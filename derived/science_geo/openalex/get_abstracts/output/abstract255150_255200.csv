In this report, we have identified a signaling pathway leading to caspase-1 activation that is induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and viral infection that is mediated by Cryopyrin/Nalp3. Stimulation of macrophages with dsRNA, viral RNA, or its analog poly(I:C) induced the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in a cryopyrin-dependent manner. Consistently, caspase-1 activation triggered by poly(I:C), dsRNA, and viral RNA was abrogated in macrophages lacking cryopyrin or the adaptor ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activating and recruitment domain) but proceeded normally in macrophages deficient in Toll-like receptor 3 or 7. We have also shown that infection with Sendai and influenza viruses activates the cryopyrin inflammasome. Finally, cryopyrin was required for IL-1β production in response to poly(I:C) in vivo. These results identify a mechanism mediated by cryopyrin and ASC that links dsRNA and viral infection to caspase-1 activation resulting in IL-1β and IL-18 production.

Innate immunity is the initial line of host defense against microbial pathogens, including viral infection. The early recognition of viruses by the host initiates signaling pathways leading to the induction of anti-viral responses, including the secretion of type I interferons (IFNs) 5The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; NLR, NOD-like receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor; NF, nuclear factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; IL, interleukin; IKK, IkB kinase; FHV, flock house virus; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; WT, wild-type; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. α and β and pro-inflammatory cytokines (1Takeda K.

Recognition of pathogens including viruses by the host immune system relies on the detection of conserved molecular structures that are shared by large pathogens (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs). In the case of viruses, genomic DNA and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced during viral replication are sensed by host cells to induce anti-viral responses (3Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Viral DNA, ssRNA, and dsRNA are recognized by a subfamily of Toll-like receptors (TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9) in endosomes after the endocytosis of viral particles in mammalian cells (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar, 9Krug A. French A.R. Barchet W. Fischer J.A. Dzionek A. Pingel J.T. Orihuela M.M. Akira S. Yokoyama W.M. Colonna M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 107-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Upon activation, these TLRs recruit the adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF (Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β) to activate the IkB kinase (IKK) complex and the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKϵ (1Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar, 10Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar). Viral dsRNA is recognized by TLR3 and the two cytosolic RNA helicases, the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), and MDA5 (which induces activation of IKK and TBK1/IKKϵ) (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C.

Activation of the IKK complex that includes the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ as well as the regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO mediates NFκB activation, whereas that of TBK1 and IKKϵ induces phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 or IRF7 (10Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6702) Google Scholar, 13Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K.

The nuclear translocation of NFκB and IRF3/IRF7 mediates the transcriptional activation of interferon and cytokine genes that limit viral replication and promote adaptive immune responses (15McWhirter S.M. Fitzgerald K.A. Rosains J. Rowe D.C. Golenbock D.T. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 17Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways other than NFκB or IFN that are activated upon viral recognition and mediate anti-viral responses are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that infection of macrophages with certain viruses including influenza A and Sendai virus induce interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 secretion (18Pirhonen J. Sareneva T. Kurimoto M. Julkunen I. Matikainen S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7322-7329PubMed Google Scholar, 19Julkunen I. Sareneva T. Pirhonen J. Ronni T. Melen K. Matikainen S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which host cells sense viruses to induce caspase-1 activation is unknown. Both IL-1β and IL-18 are synthesized as inactive cytoplasmic precursors that are processed into biologically active mature forms in response to various pro-inflammatory stimuli, including viruses by caspase-1, a cysteine protease (18Pirhonen J. Sareneva T. Kurimoto M. Julkunen I. Matikainen S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7322-7329PubMed Google Scholar, 20Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Caspase-1 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen that becomes activated by cleavage at aspartic residues to generate an enzymatically active heterodimer composed of a 10- and 20-kDa chain (20Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4233) Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins (also called NOD-LRR (nucleotide binding oligomerization domain-(leucine-rich repeat) or CATERPILLER) in the regulation of caspase-1 activation in response to microbial pathogens (22Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Núñez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 23Ting J.P. Davis B.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 387-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The NLR family is composed of 23 cytosolic proteins, including Nod1, Nod2, Cryopyrin/Nalp3, and Ipaf. The structure of NLRs include an amino-terminal effector binding region that consists of protein-protein interaction domains, such as caspase-recruitment domains or pyrin (a central nucleotide binding oligomerization domain that acts to oligomerize these proteins) and carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeats that are required to detect specific PAMPs (22Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Núñez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Cryopyrin forms an endogenous multiprotein complex containing ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activating and recruitment domain) and caspase-1 dubbed “the inflammasome,” which promotes caspase activation and processing of pro-IL-1β (24Martinon F. Agostini L. Meylan E. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1929-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 25Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F. Hawkins P.N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Notably, missense mutations in the CIAS1 gene that encodes Cryopyrin cause three autoinflammatory disorders characterized by deregulated production of IL-1β (26Stojanov S. Kastner D.L. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2005; 17: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Cryopyrin senses bacterial RNA, synthetic anti-viral purine analogs, and monosodium urate or calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals (27Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A. Park J.H. Franchi L. Whitfield J. Barchet W. Colonna M. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Akira S. Núñez G. Nature. 2006; 440: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 28Martinon F. Petrilli V. Mayor A. Tardivel A. Tschopp J. Nature. 2006; 440: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar). In addition, other results indicate that Cryopyrin regulates caspase-1 activation in response to factors that induce intracellular K+ efflux, such as certain toxins and high concentrations of extracellular ATP (29Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K. McBride J. O'Rourke K. Roose-Girma M. Lee W.P. Weinrauch Y. Monack D.M. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar, 30Sutterwala F.S.

Immunity. 2006; 24: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The genome of poxviruses encode Pyrin-containing proteins that interact with components of the inflammasome and inhibit caspase-1 activation and the processing of IL-1β and IL-18 induced by diverse stimuli (31Johnston J.B. Barrett J.W. Nazarian S.H. Goodwin M. Ricuttio D. Wang G. McFadden G. Immunity. 2005; 23: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These results suggest that certain viruses target components of caspase-1 activation pathways to circumvent host anti-viral responses. However, the signaling pathways that link viral infection to caspase-1 activation and IL-1β/IL-18 are unknown. Here we show that viral dsRNA and its analog poly(I:C) as well as viral infection activate caspase-1 through cryopyrin, resulting in the production of active IL-1β and IL-18. The signaling pathway stimulated by dsRNA and cryopyrin was independent of TLR3 or TLR7. These results identify a novel TLR-independent signaling pathway that is mediated by cryopyrin and ASC and leads to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to viral infection. Mice—Cryopyrin, ASC, and TLR7 knock-out mice have been described previously (27Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Body-Malapel M. Amer A. Park J.H. Franchi L. Whitfield J. Barchet W. Colonna M.

Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Macrophages—Bone marrow was prepared from the leg bones of 5–20-week-old mice. The legs were dissected and the bone marrow flushed out. Bone marrow cells were cultured with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 30% L929 supernatant containing macrophage-stimulating factor, glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 5 days (bone marrow differentiation medium). Bone marrow macrophages were then harvested with rubber scrapers and seeded. Peritoneal macrophages were elicited to the peritoneum of mice and isolated 4 days after the injection of 4% thioglycolate broth. After 1 day, non-adherent cells were removed, and the remaining macrophages were incubated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. In Vitro RNA Transcription, Viruses, and Viral RNA—The dsRNA for hsp90 and LacZ were made according to the protocol described in Ref. 34Kampmueller K.M. Miller D.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6827-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. To prepare flock house virus (FHV) dsRNA, the plasmids pFHV2(0,0) and p2VHF(2,0) (35Ball L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12443-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were used to generate viral (+) and (–) ssRNAs, respectively. Plasmids were linearized with RsrII, in vitro transcripts were synthesized using T7 polymerase and an Ambion Megascript kit per the manufacturer's instructions, and RNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and quantitated by spectrophotometry. Equal amounts of (+) and (–) RNA transcripts were mixed in RNase-free water, heated to 75 °C for 30 min, and allowed to cool gradually at room temperature to form dsRNA. Viral RNA integrity and formation of dsRNA were assessed by non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Murine Sendai virus (strain Cantell) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (H1N1) was a gift from James R. Becker, Jr. (University of Michigan). Rotavirus (strain SA11–4F) dsRNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction from virus grown in monkey kidney (MA014) cells and purified by CsCl centrifugation (36Patton J.T. Wentz M. Xiaobo J. Ramig R.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3961-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microbial Ligands and Antibodies—Pam2CGDPKHPKSF (FSL-1), Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C), and CpG oligonucleotide (5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′) were purchased from Invivogen. poly(A), (C), (G), and (U) ssRNA and poly(I)·poly(C) dsRNA were from Sigma. Purified total RNA from Escherichia coli was purchased from Ambion. Bacillus anthracis protective antigen and lethal factor were obtained from List Biologicals Laboratories and were used at 1 μg/ml concentration. Aliquots of RNA samples were incubated with RNases (Ambion) as suggested by the manufacturer. Rabbit anti-mouse caspase-1 was a generous gift of P. Vandenabeele (Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium). The antibodies for mouse IκBα, phospho-IκBα, p38, phospho-p38, ERK, and phospho-ERK were from Cell Signaling Technologies. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer solution (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For analysis of caspase-1 activation, macrophages were cultured with stimuli for 1–3 h and then with medium containing 5 mm ATP (Sigma) for 30 min. Extracts were prepared from cells and culture supernatants by adding lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were clarified, denatured with SDS buffer, and boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies and proteins detected with appropriate secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Measurements of Cytokines— Macrophages were stimulated with various microbial and synthetic ligands for 24 h and the supernatants were analyzed for IL-1β, IL-18, TNFα, and IL-6 secretion. The ligand concentrations used were FLS-1 and Pam3CSK4 (at 1μg/ml) and poly(I:C) (at 2.5 μg/ml). Mouse cytokines were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cryopyrin Is Required for IL-1β and IL-18 Secretion in Response to the dsRNA Analog Poly(I:C)—To assess a role for cryopyrin in immune responses induced by viruses, macrophages from wild-type (WT) and cryopyrin-deficient mice were stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA analog that mimics viral infection and a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide (FSL-1, TLR2 agonist) or E. coli RNA as controls. Incubation of wild-type macrophages with poly(I:C) induced IL-1β, but this response was abolished in cryopyrin-null macrophages (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with previous results, production of IL-1β in response to E. coli RNA (but not FSL-1) was deficient in cryopyrinnull macrophages (Fig. 1A). Additionally, cryopyrin was required for IL-18 induced by poly(I:C), but dispensable for IFNα production (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that cryopyrin is specifically required for IL-1β/IL-18 secretion induced by poly(I:C). Cryopyrin-dependent IL-1β Secretion by Poly(I:C) Is Independent of NFκB and MAPK Activation—Stimulation of macrophages with poly(I:C) induces the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). We found that cryopyrin was dispensable for the production of TNFα and IL-6 induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, production of TNFα and IL-6 required TLR3 (Fig. 2, C and D), as previously reported (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). The induction of IL-1β secretion is thought to involve the up-regulation of pro-IL-1β through transcriptional mechanisms via NFκB and then a second stimulus that leads to the activation of caspase-1, processing of pro-IL-1β, and release of mature IL-1β (37Perregaux D.G. McNiff P. Laliberte R. Conklyn M. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4615-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 38Dinarello C.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 856: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Stimulation with poly(I:C) induced comparable levels of NFκB, ERK, and p38 activation in WT and cryopyrin–/– macrophages (Fig. 2E). By contrast, the activation of NFκB and MAPKs was abolished in TLR3-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2F). These results demonstrate that cryopyrin-mediated IL-1β secretion induced by poly(I:C) is independent of NFκB and MAPK as well as TLR3. Cryopyrin (but Not Nod2/TLR3/TLR7) Is Essential for Activation of Caspase-1 in Response to Poly(I:C)— Proteolytic activation of procaspase-1 is a critical step in the induction of IL-1β secretion (39Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A. Huebner K. Black R.A.

Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Importantly, processing of pro-caspase-1 was induced rapidly (by 1 h) and in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation of WT macrophages with poly(I:C), as determined by the detection of the mature 20-kDa subunit of caspase-1 (Fig. 3, A and B). Such activation of caspase-1 was abrogated in macrophages lacking cryopyrin (Fig. 3, A and B) or ASC (Fig. 3C), an adaptor that links cryopyrin to caspase-1 (25Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F. Hawkins P.N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 41Dowds T.A. Masumoto J. Zhu L. Inohara N. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21924-21928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of caspase-1 induced by poly(I:C) was unimpaired in Nod2- and TLR3- or TLR7-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3, D–F). These results demonstrate that cryopyrin is essential for caspase-1 processing in response to poly(I:C). Furthermore, TLR3 is required for NFκB and MAPK activation but dispensable for caspase-1 activation. Cryopyrin-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 Secretion and Caspase-1 Activation by Poly(I:C) Requires dsRNA Structure—We next tested several ssRNA and dsDNA compounds to determine the structural requirements for IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and caspase-1 activation induced by poly(I:C). Importantly, the synthetic ssRNA analogs (polycytidylic acid (poly(C), polyuridylic acid (poly(U), or polyinosinic (poly(I)) neither induce IL-1β and IL-18 secretion (Fig. 4, A and B) nor caspase-1 activation (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the dsDNA analogs polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (poly(dI: dC)) and polydeoxyinosinic-deoxcytidylic acid (poly(dG:dC)) did not have any effect on IL-1β secretion or caspase-1 activation (Fig. 4, A–C). To further verify these results, we treated poly(I:C) with a panel of RNases that cleave ssRNA, dsRNA, or both. Digestion of poly(I:C) with RNase A and RNase T1 that are specific for ssRNA had little or no effect on caspase-1 activation induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 4D). In contrast, treatment of poly(I:C) with RNase V1 that cleaves dsRNA or with benzonase that digests both ssRNA and dsRNA abolished its ability to induce processing of caspase-1 (Fig. 4D). Together, these results indicate that the dsRNA structure of poly(I:C) is essential for cryopyrin-dependent induction of IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activation in macrophages. Viral and Non-viral dsRNA Produced in Vitro Induce Cryopyrin-dependent Caspase-1 Activation— Poly(I:C) does not represent all viral and non-viral dsRNA. To assess whether in vitro transcribed dsRNAs induce caspase-1 activation, we produced ∼700 bp dsRNA fragments from the 5′ coding region of the lacZ and Drosophila Hsp83 genes using the in vitro transcription system (34Kampmueller K.M. Miller D.J. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6827-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Ball L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12443-12447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, complementary plus sense (+) and minus sense (–) ssRNAs of FHV were produced by in vitro transcription and annealed to form viral dsRNA. Stimulation of macrophages with FHV dsRNA as well as non-viral dsRNAs induced caspase-1 activation as effectively as the poly(I:C) that was used as a control (Fig. 5A). As expected, neither the (+) ssRNA nor the (–) ssRNA used in preparing FHV dsRNA was able to induce processing of caspase-1 (Fig. 5B). As observed with poly(I:C), digestion of FHV dsRNA with RNases that digest dsRNA (but not ssRNA) abolished their ability to induce caspase-1 activation (Fig. 5, C and D). Additionally, treatment of dsRNAs with E. coli RNase III, an endoribonuclease that cleaves dsRNA into 10–18-bp dsRNA fragments, had no effect on their ability to induce caspase-1 activation (Fig. 5E). Cryopyrin/ASC-dependent Activation of Caspase-1 by Naturally Produced Viral dsRNA—We next tested the ability of genomic dsRNA purified from rotavirus grown in monkey kidney cells to induce caspase-1 activation. Incubation of macrophages with naturally produced rotavirus dsRNA induced caspase-1 activation in WT but not cryopyrin-deficient cells (Fig. 6A). Similarly, cryopyrin was required for the activation of caspase-1 induced by viral dsRNA purified from plant cells infected with brome mosaic virus as well as by in vitro produced brome mosaic viral dsRNA. (Fig. 6B). In contrast, caspase-1 activation triggered by the lethal toxin of B. anthracis, consisting of the protective antigen and lethal factor that depends on Nalp1b (42Boyden E.D. Dietrich W.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), proceeded normally in the absence of cryopyrin (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the results obtained with poly(I:C), activation of caspase-1 induced by rotavirus dsRNA required ASC but not TLR3 or TLR7 (Fig. 6, D–F). Furthermore, treatment of naturally produced rotavirus and dsRNA with RNase V1 (but not RNase III) abolished their ability to induce caspase-1 activation (Fig. 6G). Infection of Macrophages with Sendai and Influenza Viruses Induce Cryopyrin-dependent Caspase-1 Activation—We next tested the ability of Sendai and influenza A virus, two viruses known to stimulate IL-1β secretion in human macrophages (18Pirhonen J. Sareneva T. Kurimoto M. Julkunen I. Matikainen S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7322-7329PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pirhonen J. Sareneva T. Julkunen I. Matikainen S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), to induce caspase-1 activation in WT and cryopyrin-deficient macrophages. Macrophages were infected with Sendai or influenza A virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and cell extracts were examined for pro-caspase-1 processing by immunoblotting. The analysis revealed that both viruses induced caspase-1 activation in WT but not cryopyrin-deficient macrophages (Fig. 7A). As it was observed with viral dsRNA, activation of caspase-1 triggered by viral infection was independent of TLR3 and TLR7 (Fig. 7B). Cryopyrin Is Required for Production of IL-1β and IL-18 after Administration of Poly(I:C) in Vivo—We next examined whether cryopyrin plays a role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the animal. Intraperitoneal administration of poly(I:C) induced the production of IL-1β, IL-18, TNFα, and IL-6 in the serum of wild-type mice. Similarly, the bacterial lipopeptide Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist) also induced the production of IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 in the serum of wild-type mice. (Fig. 8). In contrast, the serum levels of IL-1β, IL-18, and to lesser extent IL-6 were greatly reduced, whereas those of TNFα were unimpaired in cryopyrin knock-out mice after injection with poly(I:C) (Fig. 8, A–D and G, and supplemental Fig. 1). The reduced levels of IL-6 detected in the serum of cryopyrinnull mice after stimulation with poly(I:C) is presumably due to the induction of IL-6 by IL-1β in vivo (43Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Verschueren I. Van Der Meer J.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3057-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Notably, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β was unimpaired in cryopyrin-deficient mice after intraperitoneal administration of Pam3CSK4, demonstrating the specific role of cryopyrin in regulating poly(I:C) responses in vivo. Infection of monocytes and macrophages with a variety of viruses is known to induce the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 through the activation of caspase-1, but the molecular mechanisms involved have remained largely unknown. These studies demonstrate that cryopyrin plays an essential role in the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 by sensing viral dsRNA and inducing the activation of caspase-1. Viral dsRNA also triggers the production of type I IFNs, TNFα, and IL-6 through TLR3 and the RIG-1 stimulation (4Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar, 11Kato H. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Matsui K. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Fujita T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Immunity. 2005; 23: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), but these immune responses were independent of cryopyrin. The latter responses are mediated through the activation of the transcriptional factors IRF3/IRF7 and NFκB (16Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2000; 13: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 44Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, dsDNA induces at least three distinct defense-signaling pathways in host cells to limit viral infection. IL-1β and IL-18 are induced by a variety of microbial stimuli through the activation of caspase-1. IL-1β is considered to be a master cytokine in that it mediates several innate and adaptive immune responses directly or through the induction of other cytokines such as IL-6 (43Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. Verschueren I. Van Der Meer J.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 3057-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-1β is a potent pyrogen that is involved in the development of fever in response to pathogen infection (45Dinarello C.A. Wolff S.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). However, there is little evidence for a role of IL-1β in host defense against viral infection. In contrast, IL-18, a cytokine that stimulates nature killer cells and CD8+ T cells and is potently synergistic with IL-12 for this function (46Micallef M.J. Ohtsuki T. Kohno K. Tanabe F. Ushio S. Namba M. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Fujii M. Ikeda M. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), is known to play an important role in viral clearance (47Liu B. Mori I. Hossain M.J. Dong L. Takeda K. Kimura Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 48Gherardi M.M. Ramirez J.C. Esteban M. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, administration of IL-18 can protect the host against infection with herpes simplex and vaccinia virus (49Fujioka N. Akazawa R. Ohashi K. Fujii M. Ikeda M. Kurimoto M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2401-2409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Tanaka-Kataoka M. Kunikata T. Takayama S. Iwaki K. Ohashi K. Ikeda M. Kurimoto M. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A role for IL-18 in viral infection is also supported by the finding that the genome of several poxviruses encodes proteins that bind and inactivate IL-18 (51Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11537-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Functional analyses of RNA compounds and enzymatic studies revealed that dsRNA (but not ssRNA) activate caspase-1 through cryopyrin. The ability of cryopyrin to discriminate between dsRNA and ssRNA provides a mechanism to sense viral RNA and to avoid harmful activation of the cryopyrin inflammasome by endogenous RNA. Treatment of 700 bp dsRNA fragments with RNase III, an endoribonuclease that cleaves both synthetic and natural dsRNA into small duplex products averaging 10–18 bp in length (52Dunn J.J. Gene. 1982; 245: 213-221Google Scholar), had no effect on its ability to induce caspase-1 activation. It is known that mammalian RNase III enzymes, such as Dicer, process dsRNA into 21–24-nt dsRNAs that can induce degradation of homologous mRNAs and specific gene silencing (53Carmell M.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It is also known that certain siRNAs can induce IFN responses and toxic effects in mammalian cells (54Sledz C.A. Holko M. de Veer M.J. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Our results suggest both long viral and endogenous dsRNA fragments or their shorter dsRNA products generated by RNase III enzymes might lead to cryopyrin activation and IL-1β/IL-18 secretion. There are several mechanisms by which dsRNA could induce the activation of caspase-1 through cryopyrin. Viral dsRNA is produced during viral infection in the cytosol of host cells and could be sensed directly by cryopyrin. There is evidence that several NLR proteins, including Nod1, Nod2, Ipaf, and cryopyrin, can recognize microbial structures (22Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Núñez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 23Ting J.P. Davis B.K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 387-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that the microbial products physically interact with the leucine-rich repeats of these NLR proteins (55Mackey D. Holt B.F. II I Wiig A. Dangl J.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The sensing of dsRNA by cryopyrin is most likely to be indirect, as it has been proposed for the recognition of microbial components by plant NLR homologs (55Mackey D. Holt B.F. II I Wiig A. Dangl J.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 743-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 56Mackey D. Belkhadir Y. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Dangl J.L. Cell. 2003; 112: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Cryopyrin has been shown to form a large multiprotein complex containing ASC that promotes the activation of caspase-1 in cell-free systems (25Agostini L. Martinon F. Burns K. McDermott M.F. Hawkins P.N. Tschopp J. Immunity. 2004; 20: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible model is that the leucine-rich repeats of cryopyrin sense dsRNA produced during viral infection, which induces the oligomerization of cryopyrin and recruitment of caspase-1 via ASC and possibly other factors involved in caspase-1 activation. In summary, our results have shown a novel role for cryopyrin in the activation of inflammasome by dsRNA/viral RNA and by viral infection. These findings provide important insight into the role of NLR proteins in the host response to dsRNA. The possibility that certain siRNAs might activate the cryopyrin inflammasome warrant further investigation, as such siRNAs are being explored for their potential therapeutic use (57Jacque J.M. Triques K. Stevenson M. Nature. 2002; 418: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 58Gitlin L. Karelsky S. Andino R.

https://openalex.org/W2086727917,"The influenza pandemic of 1918-19 was responsible for about 50 million deaths worldwide. Modern histopathological analysis of autopsy samples from human influenza cases from 1918 revealed significant damage to the lungs with acute, focal bronchitis and alveolitis associated with massive pulmonary oedema, haemorrhage and rapid destruction of the respiratory epithelium. The contribution of the host immune response leading to this severe pathology remains largely unknown. Here we show, in a comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by the 1918 influenza virus, that mice infected with the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus displayed an increased and accelerated activation of host immune response genes associated with severe pulmonary pathology. We found that mice infected with a virus containing all eight genes from the pandemic virus showed marked activation of pro-inflammatory and cell-death pathways by 24 h after infection that remained unabated until death on day 5. This was in contrast with smaller host immune responses as measured at the genomic level, accompanied by less severe disease pathology and delays in death in mice infected with influenza viruses containing only subsets of 1918 genes. The results indicate a cooperative interaction between the 1918 influenza genes and show that study of the virulence of the 1918 influenza virus requires the use of the fully reconstructed virus. With recent concerns about the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses into humans and their potential to cause a worldwide pandemic with disastrous health and economic consequences, a comprehensive understanding of the global host response to the 1918 virus is crucial. Moreover, understanding the contribution of host immune responses to virulent influenza virus infections is an important starting point for the identification of prognostic indicators and the development of novel antiviral therapies."

https://openalex.org/W1998115852,"Oxidative stress and diminished glutathione pools play critical roles in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Synthesis of glutathione, the most abundant mammalian antioxidant, is regulated at the substrate level by cysteine, which is synthesized from homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. Elevated homocysteine and diminished glutathione levels, seen in Alzheimer and Parkinson disease patients suggest impairments in the transsulfuration pathway that connects these metabolites. However, the very existence of this metabolic pathway in the brain is a subject of controversy. The product of the first of two enzymes in this pathway, cystathionine, is present at higher levels in brain as compared with other organs. This, together with the reported absence of the second enzyme, γ-cystathionase, has led to the suggestion that the transsulfuration pathway is incomplete in the brain. In this study, we incubated mouse and human neurons and astrocytes and murine brain slices in medium with [35S]methionine and detected radiolabel incorporation into glutathione. This label transfer was sensitive to inhibition of γ-cystathionase. In adult brain slices, ∼40% of the glutathione was depleted within 10 h following γ-cystathionase inhibition. In cultured human astrocytes, flux through the transsulfuration pathway increased under oxidative stress conditions, and blockade of this pathway led to reduced cell viability under oxidizing conditions. This study establishes the presence of an intact transsulfuration pathway and demonstrates its contribution to glutathione-dependent redox-buffering capacity under ex vivo conditions in brain cells and slices.

This study establishes the presence of an intact transsulfuration pathway and demonstrates its contribution to glutathione-dependent redox-buffering capacity under ex vivo conditions in brain cells and slices. An inescapable consequence of aerobic energy metabolism is the generation of incompletely oxidized products, the reactive oxygen species, which, due to their inherent reactivity, can be damaging in a cellular milieu. Reactive oxygen species are also generated in response to specific triggers (viz. growth factors in intracellular signaling pathways and in intercellular communication as in the chemical warfare between cells of the immune system and pathogens) (1Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Cells have an arsenal of antioxidant molecules and enzymes to neutralize reactive oxygen species and to shield themselves from oxidative damage. The brain, representing ∼2% of body mass, consumes a disproportionately large fraction of the total oxygen (∼20%) and may be more susceptible to oxidative damage than other organs. Aberrations in redox homeostasis are a hallmark of several neurodegenerative disease and are also associated with neuropsychiatric disorders (viz. schizophrenia and autism) (2Bharath S. Hsu M.

Glutathione Synthetase Deficiency and Other Disorders of the γ-Glutamyl Cycle. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 1461-1477Google Scholar). The limiting reagent in the synthesis of glutathione is cysteine, which is synthesized from homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway (Fig. 1). In liver, ∼50% of the cysteine in glutathione is derived from homocysteine via the transsulfuration pathway (7Beatty P.W. Reed D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 204: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The importance of this pathway in glutathione-based redox homeostasis is further supported by a decrease in the steady-state glutathione concentration in liver (to 63%) and brain (to 71%) in transgenic mice with homozygous disruption of the cystathionine β-synthase gene (9Vitvitsky V. Dayal S. Stabler S. Zhou Y. Wang H. Lentz S.R. Banerjee R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R39-R46Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Homocysteine is a sulfur-containing nonprotein amino acid that is maintained at relatively low concentrations. Elevated levels of homocysteine are correlated with cardiovascular diseases (10Boushey C.J. Beresford S.A. Omenn G.S. Motulsky A.G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 274: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3503) Google Scholar), neural tube defects (11Mills J.L. McPartlin J.M. Kirke P.N. Lee Y.J. Conle M.R. Weir D.G.

Med. 2002; 346: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar).The reciprocal changes in homocysteine and glutathione levels seen in some neurodegenerative disorders suggest a possible dysfunction in the transsulfuration pathway that connects these metabolites. However, the very existence of this pathway in the brain is controversial. In a comparative study on methionine metabolism, the activity of brain cystathionine γ-lyase was reported to be >100-fold lower than in liver (15Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). This has been widely cited as evidence for the negligible importance or even absence of the transsulfuration pathway in brain. This conclusion appeared to be supported by a recent report on the absence of detectable cystathionine γ-lyase protein or activity in the mouse brain, although low RNA expression was observed (16Ishii I. Akahoshi N. Yu X.N. Kobayashi Y. Namekata K. Komaki G. Kimura H. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and by the inability of methionine to serve as a cysteine donor for glutathione synthesis in cultured rat neurons (17Dringen R. Hamprecht B. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 259: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies provided evidence for the presence of cystathionine γ-lyase activity in brain (18Gaitonde M.K. Richter D. The Metabolism of 35S-Methionine in the Brain. Pergamon Press, London1957: 449-455Google Scholar, 19Griffiths R. Tudball N. Life Sci. 1976; 19: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Kodama H. Ikeda H. Awata S. Nakayama K. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 1207-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the presence of an intact transsulfuration pathway in the human brain has not been addressed experimentally.Given the prominent role of glutathione in defense against oxidative stress (3Dringen R. Hirrlinger J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the postulated roles of the transsulfuration enzymes in biogenesis of H2S (21Stipanuk M.H. Beck P.W. Biochem.

Med. 2002; 346: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar), the controversial existence of the transsulfuration pathway in the brain is a clinically important issue that merits resolution. Herein, we have used sensitive metabolic labeling and inhibitor studies to examine the conversion of methionine to glutathione in cultured human and murine neurons and astrocytes and in neonatal and adult murine brain slices. The results establish the existence of an intact transsulfuration pathway in the brain and furnish interesting insights into developmental and cell-specific differences in transsulfuration capacity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBrain Slice Preparation—Slices were prepared from adult (6–8-week-old males) C57BL/6 mice and 2-day old mouse pups. Adult mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and pups were anesthetized by immersion in an ice water bath. Following decapitation, the brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold modified Ringer's solution for 3–4 min before slicing. Ringer's solution consisted of 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 2.4 mm MgSO4, 10 mm dextrose and was bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 before use. The cerebellum was then removed with a cut perpendicular to the anteroposterior axis, and the brain was glued anterior end up to the tissue slicer stage (VibraSlice, Camden Instruments). The tissue was submerged in ice-cold oxygenated Ringer's solution, and 500-μm-thick coronal sections containing neocortical and striatal regions were cut. The slices were transferred with a spatula to dishes containing DMEM 2The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PPG, propargylglycine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; FBS, fetal bovine serum; AVG, aminoethoxyvinylglycine; t-BuOOH, tertiary butylhydroperoxide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NBM, Neurobasal medium. /F-12 (Invitrogen) with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 32 °C in a water bath.For experiments in cystine-free medium, DMEM lacking pyruvate, glutamate, glutamine, methionine, and cystine (Invitrogen) was supplemented with 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate (HyClone), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 48 μm glutamate (Sigma), 115 μm methionine (cell culture grade, Sigma), and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For control experiments, the same medium additionally supplemented with 150 μm cystine (cell culture grade; Sigma) was employed.Measurement of Radiolabel Incorporation from Methionine to Glutathione in Brain Slices—Brain slices were preincubated for 1 h in the DMEM/F-12 medium described above with or without 2.5 mm propargylglycine (PPG). Then l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the incubation medium (1 μl/ml; diluted 1:4 with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) from 10 μCi/μl solution). The medium was bubbled with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture, and the temperature was maintained at 32 °C. Slices were collected at 5 and 10 h following the addition of [35S]methionine and then rinsed with PBS and transferred to preweighed tubes. For the 0 h time point, slices were collected immediately after they were prepared. Slices were homogenized in 200 μl of metaphosphoric acid solution (16.8 mg/ml HPO3, 2 mg/ml EDTA, and 9 mg/ml NaCl) and stored at –80 °C until further use.For radiolabeling experiments in cystine-free medium, [35S]methionine was added at 0 h, and the slices were collected at the indicated times.Murine Neocortical Neuronal Cultures—Neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 17–19 C57BL/6 mice. The dam was anesthetized with isoflurane, and the fetuses were removed and placed in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Brains were rapidly removed, placed in ice-cold Neurobasal medium (NBM; Invitrogen), and the neocortex was dissected bilaterally. Tissue was dissociated with a 10-ml plastic pipette and incubated in NBM containing 0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following digestion, the tissue was diluted 1:1 with trypsin inhibitor solution (Sigma) containing 10% (final) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml (final) DNase I (Sigma) and placed on ice for 20 min. The tissue was then washed with 3 × 5 ml of ice-cold NBM, triturated using a sterile Pasteur pipette, and filtered through a 70-μm filter. Cells were cultured in flasks (at 10 × 106 cells/75 cm2) or in 6-well culture plates (2 × 106 cells/well) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Culture flasks and plates were coated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine before use. The culture medium consisted of NBM containing 2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Every 4 days, 50% of the medium in each well was replaced with fresh medium.Murine Astrocytes—Astrocytes were prepared from 1–2-day-old C57BL/6 mouse pups. The pups were anesthetized by immersion in an ice water bath, brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold HBSS, and the neocortex was dissected bilaterally. The tissue was dissociated gently using a 10-ml plastic pipette and rinsed twice with ice-cold HBSS. The tissue was then incubated in HBSS containing trypsin (0.25% final) and DNase I (200 units final) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Ice-cold FBS (10%) was then added, and the tissue was rinsed twice with ice-cold HBSS. The tissue was triturated with a 5-ml pipette and filtered through a 40-μm filter. The cells were resuspended in culture medium and plated on flasks at a cell density of 10 × 106 cells/75 cm2. The culture medium consisted of DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and were replated when near confluence at least three times before using in experiments. For final replating, cells were incubated in flasks (10 × 106 cells/75 cm2) or 6-well culture plates (2 × 106 cells/well).Isolation and Cultivation of Human Fetal Astrocytes and Neurons—Human fetal astrocytes and neurons were isolated from first and early second trimester human fetal brain tissue from elective abortus specimens. These were obtained in full compliance with the ethical guidelines of both the National Institutes of Health and the University of Nebraska Medical Center.Astrocytes were isolated from fetal brain tissue cortices as previously described (23Ghorpade A. Holter S. Borgmann K. Persidsky R. Wu L. J. Neuroimmunol. 2003; 141: 141-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, brain tissue was dissected and mechanically dissociated by teasing through a Nitex bag and 40-μm sieves. The cell suspension was centrifuged, resuspended in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and an antibiotic mixture containing penicillin and streptomycin, and cultured at a density of 20 × 106 cells/150 cm2. The adherent astrocytes were treated with trypsin and cultured under similar conditions to enhance the purity of replicating astroglial cells.Human fetal cortical neurons were prepared as previously described (24Deshpande M. Zheng J. Borgmann K. Persidsky R. Wu L. Schellpeper C. Ghorpade A. Neurotox. Res. 2005; 7: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Zheng J. Ghorpade A. Niemann D. Cotter R.L. Thylin M.R. Epstein L. Swartz J.M. Shepard R.B. Liu X. Nukuna A. Gendelman H.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8256-8267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, dissociated brain tissue was incubated with 0.25% trypsin for 30 min, neutralized with 10% FBS, and further dissociated by triturating. The resulting single-cell suspension was cultured on poly d-lysine-coated plates in NBM supplemented with antibiotics and B-27 supplement.All preparations of astrocytes and neurons were characterized for purity by immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (an astrocyte marker), microtubule-associated protein-2, neurofilament, and NeuN for neurons and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain nuclei (for cell counting). The purity of neurons ranged from 80 to 90%, whereas astrocytes were routinely >98% pure.[35S]Methionine Labeling in Cell Culture—Before starting experiments, the medium was changed (100% for astrocytes and 50% for neurons). l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was diluted 1:4 with sterile PBS from a 10 mCi/ml stock solution, and 1 μl/ml was added to the culture medium to a final activity of 2 μCi/ml. When used, PPG or aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and tertiary butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH; Sigma) in Me2SO was added at a concentration of 200 μm. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. At the desired time points, medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested by scraping and suspended by pipetting. For analysis of thiols, an aliquot of the cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of metaphosphoric acid solution. To measure protein concentration, an aliquot of the cell suspension was mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 25 μg/ml tosyllysine chloromethylketone, and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were stored at –80 °C until further treatment.Effect of PPG and AVG on Cell Viability—To measure the influence of PPG and AVG (2.5 mm each) on cell viability, human astrocytes and neurons were incubated with or without effectors for the desired times, and their viability was assessed. The influence of the transsulfuration pathway on cell viability under oxidative stress conditions was assessed in human astrocytes due to the readier availability of these cells. The cells were grown in 6-well plates, and the medium was changed (2 ml/well) at the beginning of the experiment. Cells were incubated for 12 h with or without 2.5 mm PPG. Then t-BuOOH or H2O2 was added to a final concentration ranging from 0.1 to 3 mm, and cells were incubated for 12 h. Control samples received an equal volume of the vehicle (i.e. Me2SO (for t-BuOOH) or PBS (for H2O2)). Cell viability was determined using the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (Sigma) assay (26Manthorpe M. Fagnani R. Skaper S.D. Varon S. Brain Res. 1986; 390: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).HPLC Analysis of Thiol Compounds—For analysis of thiol compounds, the metaphosphoric acid fixed samples of cells and brain slices were thawed and vortexed, and proteins were sedimented by centrifugation. Thiol metabolites in protein-free extracts were derivatized with monoiodoacetic acid followed by 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and analyzed by HPLC using a μ-Bondapak-NH2 300 × 3.9-mm column (Waters) with a methanol/acetate gradient as described previously (8Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Incorporation of [35S]methionine into thiol compounds was evaluated by measuring radioactivity in the corresponding chromatographic fractions. Results were normalized to protein concentration or to the weight of the brain slices. The protein concentration in samples was measured using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.The identity of the peak attributed to GSH (by comigration with an authentic sample by HPLC) was further confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis (negative ion mode). The presence of a parent ion with m/z = 530.2 confirmed the presence of the dinitrobenzene derivative of carboxymethylated GSH.RESULTSGlutathione Content in Astrocytes and Neurons—Oxidized and reduced glutathione levels were measured in cultured murine and human cells (Table 1). The average glutathione content in human astrocytes was 177 ± 10 μmol/g of protein and was ∼2-fold higher than in neurons with an average glutathione concentration of 93 ± 13 μmol/g of protein. In mice, the astrocyte glutathione content (86 ± 7 μmol/g of protein) was ∼1.4-fold higher than in neurons (62 ± 8 μmol/g of protein). The GSH/GSSG ratio, an indicator of redox poise, was similar in the two murine cell types and higher in human astrocytes than in neurons.TABLE 1Glutathione content in neurons and astrocytesCellsGSHaValues represent mean ± S.E., and the numbers in parentheses represent the range of GSH measured for each cell type. n, the number of independent measurements.GSH/GSSGnμmol/g proteinμmol/g proteinHuman neurons93 ± 13 (55-182)69 ± 1511Human astrocytes177 ± 10 (128-219)97 ± 1412Murine neurons62 ± 8 (32-137)52 ± 416Murine astrocytes86 ± 7 (56-120)53 ± 99a Values represent mean ± S.E., and the numbers in parentheses represent the range of GSH measured for each cell type. n, the number of independent measurements. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Cystathionine γ-Lyase Depletes the Glutathione Pool in Cultured Astrocytes and Neurons—PPG is a mechanism-based inhibitor of cystathionine γ-lyase and inhibits the endogenous route for provision of cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway (Fig. 1). The addition of PPG to neuronal and astroglial cell cultures led to a reduction in intracellular glutathione concentration and in radiolabel transfer from [35S]methionine (Fig. 2A). The average glutathione levels in both human and mouse astrocytes were 87% of untreated controls and 69% in murine neurons. PPG treatment did not alter the GSH/GSSG ratio in any of these cell types. The observed diminution in glutathione pools in these cells is consistent with the presence of an intact transsulfuration pathway. However, the magnitude of change indicates that the contribution of the transsulfuration pathway to cysteine synthesis is lower in cultured neurons and astrocytes than in hepatoma cells or that PPG is a less effective inhibitor in these cells versus hepatoma cells (8Mosharov E. Cranford M.R. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13005-13011Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Transsulfuration activity is present in human neurons (hN), human astrocytes (hA), murine neurons (mN), and murine astocytes (mA).

White bars, 100% controls for both glutathione radioactivity and glutathione concentration in untreated cells.

The effect of PPG treatment on [GSH] and on GSH radioactivity in human neurons was not measured due to a paucity of these cells.

The only known route for the transfer of radiolabel from methionine to glutathione under these conditions is via synthesis of cysteine in the transsulfuration pathway (Fig. 1). Cultured human neurons and astrocytes showed a time-dependent increase in incorporation of 35S radiolabel in the glutathione pool (Fig. 2B). The addition of PPG inhibited incorporation of radioactivity to 47 ± 7% in human astrocytes compared with untreated controls (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). The addition of AVG inhibited incorporation of radioactivity to a similar extent (51 ± 3%) (not shown). The effect of PPG on the kinetics of radiolabel incorporation into glutathione in human neurons was not determined due to the paucity of cells. Murine neurons and astrocytes also exhibited a time-dependent increase in radiolabel incorporation, which was sensitive to inhibition. PPG decreased incorporation of radioactivity to 48 ± 10% (p < 0.04) in murine neurons and to 61 ± 9% (p < 0.06) in murine astrocytes relative to untreated controls. Together, these results demonstrate that cultured astroglia and neurons have a functional transsulfuration pathway. Neither AVG nor PPG affected cell viability over a 48-h period (not shown).Incorporation of Radiolabel from Methionine into Glutathione in Murine Brain Slices—To eliminate the possibility that expression of the transsulfuration pathway is induced during culture of astrocytes and neurons and is not relevant to metabolism in brain, we performed similar experiments with neonatal and adult murine coronal brain slices containing, primarily, neocortical and striatal regions (Table 2). A time-dependent decrease in GSH levels was observed that could be due to tissue injury during slice preparation. After 5 and 10 h of incubation, glutathione levels in brain slices were ∼2-fold lower in adults than in neonates (Table 2). Between the 5 and 10 h incubation time points, an ∼20% decrease in the net glutathione concentration was observed, which could be explained by a moderate swelling of brain slices as indicated by a 20–30% increase in their wet weight compared with the 0 h time point. A decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio from 48 ± 5 to 32 ± 3 was observed in the adult brain, whereas the ratio in neonatal samples was similar at 5 and 10 h (11 ± 0.8 and 10 ± 1.4, respectively).TABLE 2Glutathione and cysteine content in neonatal and adult brain slicesAgePPGTime[GSH]aValues represent mean ± S.E. n, the number of independent measurements.[Cys]aValues represent mean ± S.E. n, the number of independent measurements.nhnmol/g tissuenmol/g tissueNeonatal-5929 ± 25305 ± 307-10718 ± 64215 ± 457+10597 ± 51198 ± 316Adult-01453 ± 5476 ± 1513-5475 ± 272082 ± 1827+5349 ± 221125 ± 1276-10383 ± 111860 ± 967+10239 ± 12350 ± 856a Values represent mean ± S.E. n, the number of independent measurements. Open table in a new tab Treatment of brain slices with PPG resulted in changes in the glutathione pool size and in the extent of radioactivity incorporated into glutathione (Fig. 3). In neonatal slices, glutathione decreased to 77 ± 4% (n = 6, p < 0.03) of untreated controls in 10 h, whereas glutathione-specific radioactivity decreased to 44 ± 7% (n = 6, p < 10–5). In adult brain slices, glutathione decreased to 62 ± 3% (n = 6, p < 10–6) in 10 h and was accompanied by a proportional decrease in radioactivity incorporation. Consequently, the specific GSH radioactivity in adult slices treated with PPG was virtually unchanged. Exposure of brain slices to [35S]methionine resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in radiolabel incorporation into glutathione between the 5- and 10-h incubation period (Table 3).FIGURE 3Labeling of glutathione with [35S]methionine and the effect of PPG in neonatal (A) and adult (B) brain slices. 2.5 mm PPG was added to incubation medium containing [35S]methionine for brain slices for 10 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The specific radioactivity (S.A.) was represented as the ratio of the radioactivity in the glutathione fraction pooled following HPLC separation as described under “Experimental Procedures” to the concentration of glutathione in the same sample.

We investigated radiation-induced autophagy in the presence or absence of Bax/Bak with or without an mTOR inhibitor, Rad001. Two isogenic cell lines, wild type (WT) and Bak/Bak-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts and tumor cell lines were used for this study. Irradiated Bak/Bak-/- cells had a decrease of Akt/mTOR signaling and a significant increase of pro-autophagic proteins ATG5-ATG12 COMPLEX and Beclin-1. These molecular events resulted in an up-regulation of autophagy. Bax/Bak-/- cells were defective in undergoing apoptosis but were more radiosensitive than the WT cells in autophagy. Both autophagy and sensitization of Bak/Bax-/- cells were further enhanced in the presence of Rad001. In contrast, inhibitors of autophagy rendered the Bak/Bax-/- cells radioresistant, whereas overexpression of ATG5 and Beclin-1 made the WT cells radiosensitive. When this novel concept of radiosensitization was tested in cancer models, small interfering RNAs against Bak/Bax also led to increased autophagy and sensitization of human breast and lung cancer cells to gamma radiation, which was further enhanced by Rad001. This is the first report to demonstrate that inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins and induction of autophagy sensitizes cancer cells to therapy. Therapeutically targeting this novel pathway may yield significant benefits for cancer patients.

This is the first report to demonstrate that inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins and induction of autophagy sensitizes cancer cells to therapy. Therapeutically targeting this novel pathway may yield significant benefits for cancer patients. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are well characterized as regulators of apoptosis. The multidomain pro-apoptotic members of this family, such as Bax and Bak, act as a gateway for caspase-mediated cell death (1Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J.

EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Many reports have shown that proapoptotic approaches sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents (5Brown J.M. Attardi L.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that apoptosis-permissive cells are more sensitive to ionizing radiation than apoptosis-refractory cells (6Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar, 7Held K.D. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 265-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is also contradictory data, however, showing that overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 makes tumor xenografts more sensitive to ionizing radiation (8Wouters B.G. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. Brown J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6540-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Autophagic cell death is morphologically characterized by a cell with an intact nucleus (9Baehrecke E.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

This process can be initiated in the presence of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; DKO, double knockout; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; LC3, light chain 3; ATG, autophagy-related gene; Gy, gray; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DER, dose enhancement ratio. 2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; DKO, double knockout; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; LC3, light chain 3; ATG, autophagy-related gene; Gy, gray; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DER, dose enhancement ratio. inhibitors or starvation. Ionizing radiation has also been shown to induce autophagy (11Yao K.C. Komata T. Kondo Y. Kanzawa T. Kondo S. Germano I.M. J. Neurosurg. 2003; 98: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Autophagosomes contain subcellular organelles, such as mitochondria, needed for survival (12Bursch W. Hochegger K. Torok L. Marian B. Ellinger A. Hermann R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bursch W. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) and contain high concentrations of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Etoposide (an inhibitor of topoisomerase II and a common apoptotic reagent) has been shown to induce autophagy in Bax/Bak-/- double knock-out (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (6Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Radiosensitivity of Bax/Bak-/- DKO MEF cells has never been tested by the gold standard clonogenic assay, although cell viability of irradiated Bax/Bak-/- thymocytes per propidium iodide staining was not significantly different at 24 h after irradiation (15Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar).Although radiation-induced apoptosis mediated by Bax/Bak has been extensively studied over the past decade, it is not a major form of cell death (believed to account for <20%) (16Verheij M. Bartelink H. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Other forms of non-apoptotic cell death have been described, which include mitotic catastrophe, necrosis, autophagy, and senescence. The relative contributions of the apoptotic and non-apoptotic death pathways to radiation sensitivity are poorly understood. Using the Bax/Bak-/- DKO MEF and cancer cell models, we showed that the radiosensitization in the absence of Bak and Bax results from increased autophagy, which is blocked by an autophagic inhibitor, 3-MA, or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against pro-autophagic proteins such as ATG5 and Beclin-1. Further enhancement was induced in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor, Rad001.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary MEFs derived from wild type and Bax-Bak DKO mice and immortalized by transfection with a plasmid containing SV40 genomic DNA were generously provided by Dr. Stanley J. Korsmeyer. (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.1 μmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and H460 lung carcinoma cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin respectively. All cells were incubated at 37 °C and humidified 5% CO2. These cells were treated with either Me2SO or Rad001. Alternatively, they were transfected with either expression plasmids or siRNA of ATG5 or Beclin-1.Immunoblotting—Cells (0.5 × 106) were collected at various time points after treatment and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice before the addition of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3Vo4, 1 mm NaMO4, and mixture inhibitor (5 μl/ml) (Sigma). Protein concentration was quantified by the Bio-Rad method. Equal amounts of protein were loaded into each well and separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), ATG-5 (a gift from Dr. Mizushima), Beclin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), S6 ribosomal protein, or phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser-240/244) (Cell Signaling Technology), and actin. Goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Immunoblots were analyzed using the chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and autoradiography.Clonogenic Assay—Cells were fixed for 15 min with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid and stained for 15 min with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma) in methanol. The surviving colonies were counted, and their fractions were calculated as mean colony counts/cells inoculated × plating efficiency (or PE), where PE was defined as mean colony counts/cells inoculated for irradiated controls.Measurement of Apoptosis—Percent of apoptosis was measured using the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit I (Pharmingen) with flow cytometry. Cells were plated into 100-mm dishes for each data point. After 24 h of 37 °C incubation, the groups were irradiated with 0, 5, or 10 Gy. Cells were then incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, the cells were trypsinized (keeping all floating cells) and counted for each sample. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 1× binding buffer. 100 μl of the solution (5 × 105 cells) were then transferred to a 5-ml culture tube. 3 μl of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 3 μl of propidium iodide were added. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, 400 μl of 1× binding buffer was added to each tube and analyzed by FACScan.Autophagy Assay—Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of GFP-LC3 expression plasmid (a gift from Dr. Mizushima) using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were treated with 5 Gy. After 24 or 48 h, the fluorescence of GFP-LC3 was observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope.Electron Microscopy—Cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with a brief wash in prewarmed 0.1 m cacodyate buffer and then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. The cells were washed, post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated with ascending grades of ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in LX-112 medium (Ladd). After polymerization, ultra-thin (90 nm) sections were cut with a diamond knife, collected on uncoated copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate (1%) and lead citrate (0.2%). The samples were examined with a JEOL-1010 electron microscope (JEOL) operated at 80 kV.siRNA Transfection—siRNA Bax (mouse), siRNA Bak (mouse), siRNA Bax (human), siRNA Bak (human), and siRNA Beclin (mouse) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. siRNA ATG5 (mouse) was synthesized by Dharmacon Research. Cells were transfected with 25 nm siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000. The transfected cells were used for subsequent experiments 24 h later.RESULTSRadiation Sensitization When the Bax/Bak-mediated Apoptosis Is Attenuated—We used DKO MEF cells that were deficient for Bak and Bax to determine the extent of apoptosis and radiation sensitivity as a consequence of lacking Bak and Bax. We examined proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 as a marker for apoptosis in both WT and DKO cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Caspase-3 cleavage was not detected in the DKO cells at any time point or dose level, whereas it was apparent in the irradiated WT cells (Fig. 1A). A corroborative assay, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining was performed to measure the percent of apoptosis in the irradiated WT and DKO cells (Fig. 1B). 24 h following 5 Gy, the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased by 6.5-fold in WT cells, and 10 Gy induced an 8.2-fold increase. As expected, in the irradiated Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells there was minimal change in the percentage of apoptotic cells after 5 or 10 Gy.To determine whether inhibited apoptosis affects radiation sensitivity, clonogenic survival assay was performed in WT, DKO, and WT cells transfected with siRNAs against Bak and Bax to exclude potential clonal variation between MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, Bak and Bax were attenuated in WT cells transfected with siRNAs against Bak and Bax. Unexpectedly, radiation sensitivity was found greatly enhanced in Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells compared with WT MEFs. Dose enhancement ratio (DER) is defined as the ratio of doses required to decrease survival to 20%. The DER in Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells relative to their WT counterparts, was 1.7 (p < 0.05, Student's t test, n = 3). Clonogenic survival represents an integral of cell death measured over several days or weeks. Consistently, WT cells transfected with Bax/Bax siRNAs produced a DER of 1.4 compared with the cells transfected with a control siRNA (p < 0.05, n = 3, Student's t test). Taken together, the results in Fig. 1 suggest that radiation sensitivity is increased in MEF cells that are defective in the Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis.Increased Autophagy in the Irradiated Bax and Bak-/- Cells—To determine whether radiosensitivity of DKO cells is mediated by non-apoptotic programmed cell death, such as autophagy, we transfected WT and DKO cells with GFP-tagged LC3 plasmid (17Mizushima N.

As shown in Fig. 2A, diffuse cytoplasmic localization of GFP-LC3 was observed in the transfected WT MEF cells and Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells without undergoing irradiation, whereas the irradiated Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells showed significantly increased punctate fluorescence or lysosomal localization of LC3 protein in 24 h. However, there was little increase in punctate fluorescence seen in the irradiated WT MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the number of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence significantly increased in a time-dependent manner in Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells, from 33 (24 h after irradiation) to 60% (48 h after irradiation), but only a slight increase was seen in WT cells. To confirm the induction of autophagic changes in Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells, we examined these cells using electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2C, irradiated WT MEF cells did not show appreciable autophagosomes (Fig. 2C, ii), whereas Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells showed numerous autophagosomes containing recognizable cellular material (Fig. 2C, iv and vi). The fusion of late autophagosomes and lysosomes is another characteristic of autophagy that was observed in these cells (Fig. 2C, v).FIGURE 2Increased autophagy in the irradiated Bax and Bak-/- MEF cells. A, GFP-LC3-transfected cells were treated with and without 5 Gy and then examined by fluorescence microscopy after 24 h.

As shown in Fig. 3A, the phosphoproteins were increased in the irradiated WT cells, whereas they were decreased in the irradiated Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells. To determine whether radiation up-regulated the expression of autophagic proteins in the Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells, we used immunoblotting to examine the expression of ATG-5 and Beclin-1 at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after 5 Gy irradiation. There was considerable increase of both the ATG5-ATG12 complex and Beclin-1 (Fig. 3B) in the irradiated Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells. In contrast, there was minimal change in these proteins seen in the irradiated WT MEF cells. These data suggest that pro-autophagic signaling is up-regulated in the irradiated DKO cells.FIGURE 3Induced pro-autophagic signaling in the irradiated Bax and Bak-/- MEF cells. WT and DKO MEF cells were irradiated with 0 or 5 Gy. Cells were collected at various time points, and protein extracts were made for Western blotting. A, shown are immunoblots of phospho-Akt, phosphomTOR, and p-S6 using the lysates from WT and DKO MEF cells treated with 0 or 5 Gy after 30 min. B, also shown are immunoblots of ATG5-ATG12 complex and Beclin-1 using the lysates from WT and DKO MEF cells treated with 0 or 5 Gy after 24, 48, and 72 h.

Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 3-MA-treated DKO cells had decreased autophagic signaling, ATG5-ATG12 COMPLEX and Beclin-1 were examined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, we found that 3-MA attenuated the induction of both ATG5-ATG12 COMPLEX and Beclin-1 in the irradiated DKO cells. To determine whether inhibiting autophagy by 3-MA affects the radiation sensitivity of DKO cells, clonogenic survival was assayed. As shown in Fig. 4B, DKO cells in the presence of 3-MA became more radiation-resistant by a factor of 1.8 when calculated at a survival value of 50% (p < 0.004, Student's t test). This result suggests that 3-MA increased radioresistance by attenuating autophagic cell death in Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells.FIGURE 4Inhibition of autophagic signaling induces radiation resistance. A, wild type (WT) and Bax/Bak-/- MEF (DKO) cells were cultured in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 100 or 200 μm 3-MA, an inhibitor of type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and irradiated with 0 or 5 Gy. Western analyses of ATG5-ATG12 COMPLEX and Beclin-1 in the irradiated cells with or without pre-treatment of 3-MA. B, WT and Bax/Bak-/- MEF (DKO) cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 10 or 20 μm 3-MA and irradiated with 0-6 Gy. After 8 days, the colonies were stained and scored. Data are based upon three separate repeated experiments and shown as the mean ± S.D. C, WT and DKO MEF cells were transfected with 25 nm siRNAs directed against ATG5 and Beclin-1. The protein levels of ATG5-ATG12 COMPLEX and Beclin-1 were detected by Western analysis 48 h following transfection. D, DKO cells were transfected with siRNAs against ATG5 and Beclin-1 or a control siRNA. They were then irradiated with 0-6 Gy. After 8 days, colonies were stained and scored. Shown are the mean ± S.D. of three separate repeated experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that inhibition of autophagic signaling induces radioresistance of DKO MEF cells, the Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells were transfected with siRNAs against ATG5 and Beclin-1 or a siRNA control. As shown in Fig. 4C, both proteins were decreased following the transfection of siRNAs against these proteins. The clonogenic assay shown in Fig. 4D indicates that DKO cells transfected with siRNA directed against both gene products of ATG5 and Beclin-1 became more radioresistant by a factor of 1.4 when calculated at a survival value of 50%, compared with cells transfected with a control siRNA (p < 0.006, Student's t test, n = 3). DKO cells transfected with siRNA directed against either ATG5 or Beclin-1 alone showed increased radioresistance, but the effect was slightly less than that seen with the cells transfected with siRNAs against both gene products (data not shown).Induction of Autophagy Increases Radiation Sensitivity—To determine whether induction of autophagy through inhibition of mTOR enhances the radiation sensitivity of MEF cells, WT and Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells were treated with 10 nm Rad001, an inhibitor of mTOR. The clonogenic assay shown in Fig. 5A indicates that DKO cells became more sensitive in the presence of Rad001 by a DER of 1.37 (p < 0.001, Student's t test, n = 3), whereas the effect on WT cells was slight (DER = 1.06, p < 0.006, Student's t test, n = 3).FIGURE 5Induction of autophagy increases radiation sensitivity. A,WTor Bak/Bax-/- MEF cells were treated with either Me2SO or Rad001, an inhibitor of mTOR, and irradiated with the indicated doses. After 8-10 days, colonies were stained and scored.

B, WT and DKO cells were transfected with expression plasmids of ATG5 and Beclin-1. 24 h later, they were irradiated with the indicated doses. After 8-10 days, colonies were stained and scored.

WT and DKO cells were transfected with expression plasmids of ATG5 and Beclin-1 or a vector control. The clonogenic assay shown in Fig. 5B indicates that WT and DKO cells overexpressing ATG5 and Beclin-1 became more radiosensitive (WT: DER = 1.25, p < 0.002; DKO: DER = 1.29, p < 0.008).siRNA against Bak/Bax and Rad001 Sensitize Cancer Cells to Ionizing Radiation—To apply the above concept, inducing autophagy as a potential strategy to enhance cell death following irradiation, we determined whether reduction of pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax alters the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and H460 lung cancer cells were transfected with siRNAs directed against Bak and Bax, which significantly decreased their expression (Fig. 6A). Clonogenic assay showed that the reduction of Bak and Bax increased the radiation sensitivity of both cell lines. As shown in Fig. 6B, DER is 1.23, p < 0.003 (Student's t test) for the breast cancer model and is 1.62, p < 0.003 (Student's t test) for the lung cancer model as shown in Fig. 6C. Similar findings were noted in prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, and DU145 cells (data not shown). We also analyzed whether inhibition of mTOR using Rad001 would further enhance the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells. Both cancer cell lines were first transfected with siRNAs against Bax and Bak to block apoptosis. 24 h later, these cells were incubated with Rad001 to induce autophagy. Subsequently, they were irradiated with 0-6 Gy, and clonogenic assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the combined treatment of Rad001 and siRNAs against Bax and Bak resulted in even greater radiosensitization (breast cancer: DER = 1.50, p < 0.002; lung cancer: DER = 1.98, p < 0.001).FIGURE 6siRNAs against Bak and Bax and Rad001 sensitize cancer cells to radiation. A, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and H460 lung cancer cells were transfected with 10, 15, and 25 nm siRNAs. The protein levels of Bak and Bax were detected by Western analysis at 48 h following transfection. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (B) and H460 lung cancer cells (C) were transfected with a control siRNA or siRNAs against Bak and Bax. These transfected cells were irradiated with the indicated doses of radiation. After 8-10 days, colonies were stained and scored. Shown are the mean ± S.D. of three separate repeated experiments. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (D) and H460 lung cancer cells (E) were transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid, and the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy 24 h after 5 Gy. The percentage of cells with punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence was calculated relative to all GFP-positive cells. Error bars are shown as mean ± S.D. of three different trials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether siRNAs directed against Bax and Bak and inhibition of mTOR with Rad001 induced autophagy in irradiated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and H460 lung cancer cells, both cancer cells were transfected with GFP-LC3. Increased punctate fluorescence, suggestive of autophagy, was seen after radiation treatment in both cancer cell lines. The greatest amount of autophagy was seen in the combination treatment (Fig. 6, D and E). These results also suggest that autophagy mediates the increased radiosensitivity in cancer models.DISCUSSIONThis study showed evidence that autophagy is induced as an alternative form of cell death in irradiated cells that are unable to undergo apoptosis. The extent of autophagy was found to determine radiation sensitivity. Inducing autophagy through the inhibition of apoptosis or directly triggering autophagic signaling by mTOR inhibitors are viable strategies that can be applied to cancer therapy. Because strategies aimed at enhancing apoptosis have for many years been a focus of cancer therapeutic research, this is a novel concept that could affect the direction of cancer drug development.We found that radiation induced the cleavage of caspase-3 in WT and not in Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells. This is consistent with the fact that radiation can induce apoptosis through the activation of caspases (19Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 22Ding H.F. Fisher D.E. J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 2001; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). WT MEF cells stained by Annexin-V were also significantly higher than the DKO cells. These results suggest that radiation induces apoptotic cell death through activation of caspases in the presence of Bax and Bak. We expected that apoptosis-permissive cells would show decreased clonogenicity after irradiation, because previous publications have shown that apoptosis-permissive cells were more radiosensitive as compared with apoptosis-refractory cells (6Story M.D. Voehringer D.W. Malone C.G. Hobbs M.L. Meyn R.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar, 7Held K.D. Apoptosis. 1997; 2: 265-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, we found increased radiation sensitivity of Bax/Bak-/- MEF cells by clonogenic assay. This concept was confirmed by attenuating levels of Bax and Bak in the WT cells. We speculated that alternative cell death, such as autophagy, in the absence of caspase activation may explain this phenomenon (19Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 20Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Recent papers report that cell death still occurs in Bax/Bak-/- mice, implying that alternative mechanisms for cell death exist in these animals (14Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T.

RNA interference of IRSp53 is reported to decrease lamellipodia formation (1Suetsugu S. Kurisu S. Oikawa T. Yamazaki D. Oda A. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, membrane protrusion with very dim or absent phalloidin (a reagent that stains actin filament) staining has been observed in the IRSp53-overexpressing cells (2Nakagawa H. Miki H. Nozumi M.

The RCB domain of IRSp53 shares its homology with the MIM (missing in metastasis) protein, and this domain is also named the IRSp53/MIM homology domain (IMD) (residues 1-250 of IRSp53). Activated Rac binds to the RCB domain of IRSp53 (4Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 5Choi J. Ko J. Racz B. Burette A.

In contrast, the IMD of MIM is reported to bind to the inactive form of Rac (6Bompard G. Sharp S.J. Freiss G. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5393-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition to the Rac binding (RCB) activity, the RCB domain/IMD of IRSp53 or MIM possesses the actin filament bundling activity (7Yamagishi A. Masuda M. Ohki T. Onishi H. Mochizuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14929-14936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Overexpression of IMD is shown to cause actin filament-containing protrusions; however, some of the protrusions were branched and lacked the phalloidin staining (7Yamagishi A. Masuda M. Ohki T. Onishi H. Mochizuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14929-14936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently, Millard et al. (8Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y.

They found that the basic residues at the extreme ends of the dimer are important for the actin filament bundling activity. The substitution of the basic residues with Glu is reported to reduce the actin binding activity by 50%. The IMD structure suggested that the bundle of three extended α-helices is structurally similar to the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain. This domain has a curved structure, and its concave surface is postulated to bind to the cell membrane. The expressed amphiphysin BAR domain was targeted to intracellular vesicles, and it caused membrane tubulation (9Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T.

Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Thus, the BAR domain is a membrane-binding and tubulation module. In the BAR domain, the concave surface and the basic residues at the extreme ends are involved in the binding of the BAR domain to the membrane. Therefore, the structural similarity and presence of protrusions without the actin filaments suggest that RCB domain/IMD is a membrane-binding module as well as an actin filament-binding module. In this study, the crystal structure of the RCB domain (residues 1-228) was determined; the three-helix bundle dimer was formed in the absence of helix 4 of the IMD (residues 1-250), demonstrating that the overall structure of the RCB domain/IMD was similar to that of the BAR domain. The RCB domain expression in the cells caused membrane protrusions that lacked phalloidin staining in a Rac-dependent manner. Moreover, in the presence of Rac, the isolated RCB domain induced deformation of the artificial liposomes in a manner that was different from that induced by the BAR domain. Mapping of the residues responsible for membrane deformation suggests the involvement of the convex surface of the RCB domain in the binding of the RCB domain to the membrane. These findings indicate that the RCB domain is a Rac-dependent membrane tubulation module as well as an actin filament-bundling module. Purification—The human IRSp53-RCB domain (residues 1-228) was expressed as an N-terminal GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The fragment encoding the RCB domain was excised from full-length IRSp53 by BamHI and StuI digestions. This fragment was inserted into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The BamHI site is followed by ACC (Thr) and then the first amino acid residue. The protein was purified on a glutathione affinity column, and the GST tag was cleaved with thrombin. After ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration was conducted. Protein was concentrated to 54.6 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The final sample included genetically manipulated fragments (residues -2-0 and 229-239). IRSp53 and Rac were expressed in a baculovirus system and purified as described previously (1Suetsugu S. Kurisu S. Oikawa T. Yamazaki D. Oda A. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—The IRSp53-RCB domain was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The protein solution (8.7 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution, including 90 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 27% PEG4000, 190 mm sodium acetate, and 3.5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. A mercury derivative was obtained by soaking the crystals in 5 mm ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid in the reservoir solution for 10 min. X-ray diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 K). Crystals were flash-frozen after an incubation in reservoir buffer with a cryoprotectant (30% ethylene glycol). Initial x-ray data collections for the native (data set II) and mercury derivative crystals were conducted with in-house CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), using an R axis IV++ RIGAKU Image Plate detector mounted on a Rigaku FR-D rotation anode x-ray generator. High resolution native data (data set I) were collected at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) on beamline BL44B2 with a Mar Research CCD detector (Table 1). All x-ray diffraction data were integrated and scaled with the use of the HKL2000 package (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

ELISA Lipid Binding Assay—Lipid vesicles (phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) = 1:1, total 2 μg), containing 10% (by weight) of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) resuspended in 100% ethanol were coated onto 96-well plates (Immulon 2HB; Thermo Labsystems) and airdried at room temperature. The wells were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, before incubation with the appropriate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (1.0 μg ml-1) for 45 min. The wells were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, and glutathione-conjugated peroxidase (1.0 μg ml-1, Sigma) was overlaid and detected by a reaction with ortho-phenylenediamine. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad). Pulldown Assay for Rac-RCB Domain Association—Rac protein was purified from E. coli, and was loaded with GTPγSas described previously (17Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). RCB or IMD domain was expressed as an N-terminal GST fusion protein. Equal amounts of various RCB or IMD GST fusion proteins were immobilized on beads, and binding to GTPγS-loaded Rac (2 μm) was examined. After washing, bound Rac was analyzed by Western blotting and densitometry. The amount of bound Rac was expressed as arbitrary units. Actin Filament Sedimentation Assay—Binding of filamentous (F)-actin to the RCB domain of IRSp53 was analyzed by co-sedimentation assay. A globular (G)-actin solution was first clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the G-actin was polymerized to F-actin for 1 h at room temperature. Various GST-RCB domain solutions (2 μm in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm CaCl2) were also clarified by ultracentrifugation. F-actin (2 μm) and RCB domain solutions were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants and pellets (equal volumes) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry. Percentages of protein amount in the precipitates are shown with standard deviations. Liposome Co-sedimentation Assay—Synthetic liposomes contained PC/PE/PIP3 = 48:48:4 (weight ratio) or PC/PE/PS/PIP3 = 48:48:12:4. Liposomes were resuspended at a concentration of 1 mm test lipid in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, and 150 mm NaCl and were subjected to five cycles of freezing (liquid N2) and thawing (37 °C water bath). RCB and/or Rac, at the indicated concentrations, and liposomes (0.5 mm for PC) were mixed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 20 min, vesicle pellets were suspended in SDS sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Bound protein was identified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or Western blotting and quantified by densitometry with ImageJ software. Liposome concentrations were calculated by dividing the total concentration in half, because 50% of the total was assumed to be on the inside layer of the vesicles. The Kd value for RCB-liposome association was calculated from the amount of co-precipitated protein by curve fitting of the equilibrium response. Dual Polarization Interferometry—The interactions between RCB and small GTPases were investigated with an AnaLight Bio200 interferometer (Farfield Sensors). GST-RCB was coated onto the surface of different channels of an amine sensor chip, according to the manufacturer's instructions, with BS3 chemical linkers. The buffer consisted of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2. Tag-free Rac and Cdc42 proteins purified from E. coli were each loaded with GTPγS or GDP and injected at different concentrations in the same buffer (association phase). Binding was examined at five or more different protein concentrations, and Kd (=kd/ka) values were calculated from curve fitting. The observed association rates (kon) over the initial 60 s of association were plotted (Fig. 4C). The slope and intercept yielded ka and kd values, respectively. Electron Microscopy—RCB domain was expressed as an N-terminal GST fusion protein in E. coli. IRSp53 and Rac proteins were expressed in a baculovirus system and were purified as described previously (1Suetsugu S. Kurisu S. Oikawa T. Yamazaki D. Oda A. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy was performed as described previously (18Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 19Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Liposomes (Folch fraction 1; Sigma) (0.1 mg/ml final concentration) were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in buffer XB (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2) with RCB domain or IRSp53 (0.5 μm) and GTPγS-loaded Rac (0.5 μm). At the end of the incubation, aliquots were adsorbed onto collodion-coated copper electron microscopy grids (Nissin EM) for 1 min at room temperature, washed in 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.4, stained in 1-2% uranyl acetate for 30 s, blotted, and then allowed to air dry. Time-lapse Microscopy of Liposome Deformation—Time-lapse analysis of liposome deformation was performed as described previously (20Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). To adhere liposomes onto glass coverslips, two 1-μl droplets of lipid solution (10 mg/ml Folch fraction 1 (Sigma) in chloroform) were spotted onto each coverslip and allowed to dry under vacuum for at least 1 h. Lipids were then prehydrated in 50 μl of XB + 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20-30 min at 37 °C in a small chamber built by placing the coverslip over a glass slide with strips of double-sided tape as spacers. Twenty microliters of protein solution (1 mg/ml) was then injected between the glass pieces. Time-lapse images were obtained with a phase contrast microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a camera (CCD-782-Y/HS; Princeton Instruments). ×40 oil-immersion objective (NA = 1.30 FLUAR; Zeiss) was used. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Microscopy—COS-7 cells were cultured as described previously (21Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RCB domain was tagged N-terminally with a brighter variant of GFP (Venus) (22Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar) and was expressed under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. DNA encoding constitutively active Rac (G12V mutant) was inserted into the pEF-BOS vector with a Myc tag (4Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). After fixation, permeabilization, and blocking of cells, cells were stained with an anti-GFP antibody (MBL) or anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Sigma) followed by an Alexa-488- or Alexa-633-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Actin filaments were visualized by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Latrunculin B (1 μg/ml) was treated for 30 min before fixation. For membrane staining, membrane-staining dye (DiI (DiIC18(3Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)); Molecular Probes) was incubated with cells before fixation, and then cells were observed without permeabilization and antibody staining. Fluorescent images were taken through a microscope (Nikon) with a confocal microscopy system (Radience 2000; Bio-Rad) at room temperature. ×60 oil immersion objective NA = 1.40 (Nikon) was used. Images were assembled with Adobe Photoshop. In each plate, photographs were cropped, and each fluorochrome was adjusted identically for brightness and contrast to represent the observed images. Time-lapse analysis was performed with total-internal-reflection microscopy system (Olympus) with ×100 oil immersion objective NA = 1.45 (Olympus) and MetaMorph software. Coordinates—Atomic coordinates of the IRSp53 RCB domain have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1WDZ). Structure of the RCB Domain—The three-dimensional structure of the RCB domain (amino acid residues 1-228) (Fig. 1) of IRSp53 was determined by single isomorphous replacement with the anomalous scattering method. The RCB domain structure had an asymmetric unit that included two subunits, A and B; this unit formed an elongated homodimer with a length of ∼180 Å (Fig. 2A). With the exception of the subunit B residues 150-158, which could not be identified because of a disorder, polypeptide chains were traced for both the subunits in an electron density map. The subunits were related by a local 2-fold rotation axis and were superimposed with a root mean square deviation of 0.497 Å (mean value for the 222 common C-α atoms). Each subunit consisted of six α-helices, namely α1-α6 (Fig. 1), that are arranged as an antiparallel helix bundle. The helix bundle structure of the IRSp53 RCB domain was almost identical to the corresponding portion of the reported structure of the IRSp53 IMD, which is 22 residues longer than the RCB domain (8Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y. Dafforn T.R. Scott D.J. Machesky L.M. Futterer K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These additional IMD residues form a short helix (helix 4) that interacts with the other three helices in the IMD structure (8Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y. Dafforn T.R. Scott D.J. Machesky L.M. Futterer K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of this short helix, the RCB domain formed a bundle structure, suggesting that the short helix does not contribute to bundle formation. Thus, the RCB domain is an independent entity with a structure and surface electrostatic properties similar to that of the BAR domain (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2Mapping of the RCB domain residues responsible for binding of the RCB domain to lipids, Rac, and actin filaments. A, ribbon diagrams of the RCB domain and the IMD. Monomers A and B are colored cyan and light green, respectively. Helix 4 in the IMD is shown in orange. Black ellipse and line represent the local 2-fold symmetry. B, surface electrostatic potentials of the RCB domain and the arfaptin and amphiphysin BAR domains. Positively charged regions are shown in blue, and negatively charged regions are shown in red. C, lipid binding ability of various RCB domain mutants as determined by ELISA.

Amino acids used for the mutation analysis of the RCB domain-lipid (D), RCB domain-Rac (F), and RCB domain-actin binding activities (H) are shown in red (reduced activity) and green (no change). Each figure includes a front view (perpendicular to the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis) and a side view (along the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Membrane-binding Sites of the RCB Domain—The RCB domain and full-length IRSp53 bind to lipids presumably via electrostatic interactions with little selectivity for specific phosphoinositides (1Suetsugu S. Kurisu S. Oikawa T. Yamazaki D. Oda A. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine the lipid-binding surface of the RCB domain dimer, we constructed a series of Glu and/or Ala substitutions for 20 Lys or Arg residues and tested its lipid binding ability by ELISA (Fig. 2C) (23Oikawa T. Yamaguchi H. Itoh T. Kato M. Ijuin T. Yamazaki D. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). At the ends of the dimer, there is a basic patch consisting of Lys-142, Lys-143, Arg-145, Lys-146, and Lys-147. A basic patch mutant (BPM), in which all these five residues were replaced by Ala, did not bind to negatively charged phosphoinositides (Fig. 2C); the structure of the RCB domain was not destroyed, as revealed by the circular dichroism spectrum (data not shown). Next, we replaced two of the basic amino acids in the basic patch according to their side chain orientations. The replacement of Lys-142 and Arg-145 by either Ala (K142A/R145A) or Glu (K142E/R145E) did not affect the RCB domain-lipid binding. In contrast, the K143A/K147A and K143E/K147E mutations dramatically reduced the RCB domain-lipid binding (Fig. 2C), whereas the K143E mutation did not affect this binding. Therefore, Lys-147 was determined to be the most important residue in the basic patch. Arg-128 and Lys-130 are located close to each other near the basic patch. The RCB domain-lipid binding was significantly decreased by the R128E/K130E mutations. Furthermore, the K108E and K171A mutants showed decreased lipid binding, whereas Glu substitutions for Arg-29, Lys-40, Lys-58, Lys-70, Lys-121, Lys-136, Lys-152, Lys-156, Lys-160, and Arg-192 did not (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the RCB domain-lipid binding involves a limited region; among the basic residues tested, Lys-108 (α4), Lys-130 (α5), Lys-147 (α5-α6 loop), and Lys-171 (α6) were determined to be particularly important for this binding (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2D). With the exception of Lys-147, these Lys residues are located in a straight line along the straight helix bundle (Fig. 2D, front view). Lys-147 is located on the flexible α5-α6 loop and can relocate its side chain to position itself on the straight line (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2D). Each protomer of the dimeric helix bundle possesses this “lipid-binding line”; the two lines are located symmetrically on opposite sides of the dimer. In the “front” view of the helix bundle (Fig. 2D, upper panel), the lipid-binding line on the right is visible, whereas that on the left is located on the opposite side of the dimer (invisible in this panel). If the dimer is sufficiently stable and does not bend, only one of the lipid-binding lines is used when the dimer binds to the membrane surface. Interestingly, the corresponding region of MIM (1-238 amino acids) had less lipid binding ability (Fig. 2C). Consistently, the Lys-108, Lys-147, and Lys-171 are occupied with neutral amino acids in MIM (Fig. 1). Based on the binding curve, the Kd value between the RCB domain and phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposome was estimated to be ∼3 μm (Fig. 3A). Rac-binding Sites of the RCB Domain—In contrast to the binding of IRSp53 to the GTP-loaded Rac, MIM was reported to bind to the GDP-loaded Rac (4Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6Bompard G. Sharp S.J. Freiss G. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5393-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed pulldown assays to test the Rac binding ability of the RCB domain mutants (Q23E, R11E/Q23E, K40E, K58E, K70E, K121E, R128E/K130E, K142E/R145E, K143E, K143E/K147E, and BPM), in which the conserved residues (underlined) or the nonconserved residues between IRSp53 and MIM were replaced (Fig. 1). Arg-11 was considered to contribute to Rac binding because the RCB domain mutations of this residue (R11E/Q23E) showed impaired binding to GTPγS-loaded Rac (Fig. 2E); Gln-23 contributed slightly to Rac binding (Fig. 2E). The basic patch of MIM is reported to be involved in Rac binding (6Bompard G. Sharp S.J. Freiss G. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5393-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutations, including the Lys-143 replacement (K143E, K143E/K147E, and BPM), showed significantly decreased Rac binding ability (Fig. 2E). Our kinetic analyses revealed that the RCB domain fragment binds to the GTPγS-loaded Rac protein with a Kd value of 3.2 μm (Fig. 3B), a value comparable with that between Rac·GMPPNP and arfaptin (3 μm) (24Tarricone C.

https://openalex.org/W1975927777,"A mitochondrial matrix copper ligand (CuL) complex, conserved in mammalian cells, is the likely source of copper for assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) within the intermembrane space (IMS) in yeast. Targeting the copper-binding proteins human Sod1 and Crs5 to the mitochondrial matrix results in growth impairment on non-fermentable medium caused by decreased levels of CcO. This effect is reversed by copper supplementation. Matrix-targeted Crs5 diminished Sod1 protein within the IMS and impaired activity of an inner membrane tethered human Sod1. Copper binding by the matrix-targeted proteins attenuates levels of the CuL complex without affecting total mitochondrial copper.

The copper-binding subunits of CcO are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, so copper insertion into CcO occurs within the organelle. Cox17 functions in Cu(I) delivery within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) to two accessory proteins, Sco1 and Cox11, for the subsequent copper insertion into CcO (3Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A.

Approximately 1–5% of total Sod1 is also localized within the IMS, and its localization within this compartment is dependent on Ccs1 (2Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Sod1 is imported as a metal-free polypeptide, so its activation occurs within the IMS by Ccs1 (4Field L.S. Furukawa Y. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28052-28059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The presence of two copper metalloenzymes that are metallated within the mitochondrion necessitates a specific copper transport pathway to the IMS. Copper ions enter Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells through a combination of high affinity (Ctr1 and Ctr3) and low affinity (Fet4 and Smf1) permeases (5Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Within the cytoplasm copper levels are buffered by two metallothioneins (Cup1 and Crs5) that limit the free aqueous copper pool (6Rae R.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Copper ions are shuttled to sites of utilization by protein-mediated transfer using proteins designated metallochaperones including Atx1 and Ccs1 (7Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 677-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Field L.S. Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Atx1 shuttles Cu(I) to the Ccc2 P-type ATPase transporter localized in post-Golgi vesicles for incorporation into the plasma membrane iron permease ferroxidase, Fet3 (9Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Ccs1 provides Cu(I) for activation of Sod1 and also catalyzes the formation of an essential disulfide bond in Sod1 (10Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking Ccs1 fail to activate Sod1 and have oxygen-dependent phenotypes. One unknown aspect is how these proteins acquire copper prior to delivery to utilization sites. Metallochaperone function is not impaired in cells lacking the high and low affinity transporters (Ctr1, Ctr3, and Fet4) in replete medium, suggesting that the chaperones are not intrinsically dependent on any interaction with these transporters (11Portnoy M.E. Schmidt P.J. Rogers R.S. Culotta V.C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 265: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic copper ion delivery to Sod1 and Ccc2 is protein-mediated (12Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The presence of Ccs1 and Cox17 in both the cytoplasm and IMS made them candidates for shuttling copper ions to the mitochondrion for subsequent functions (13Beers J. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33191-33196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, yeast lacking either Ccs1 or Cox17 retain wild type mitochondrial copper levels (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, tethering Cox17 to the mitochondrial inner membrane by a heterologous membrane-binding domain resulted in its exclusive localization within the organelle, and CcO assembly proceeded normally (15Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, Cox17 and Ccs1 cannot be obligate mitochondrial copper transporting metallochaperones. The metallochaperone paradigm predicts that translocation of Cu(I) to the mitochondrion is mediated by another metallochaperone or transport pathway. Copper is utilized in the metallation of CcO and Sod1 within the IMS, yet the most substantial pool of mitochondrial copper is localized within the matrix (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The matrix copper pool is present as a soluble, low molecular weight, nonproteinaceous copper complex (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Here we show that this copper complex is conserved in yeast and mouse and that targeting of heterologous copper-binding proteins to the matrix attenuates the activation of both CcO and Sod1 within the IMS. In addition we present data suggesting that the ligand from this copper complex is found in the cytoplasm where it may recruit, in place of a metallochaperone, the copper that is translocated and stored within the mitochondrial matrix for subsequent use in the IMS for the metallation of CcO and Sod1. Yeast Strains, Culture Conditions, and Standard Methods— The yeast strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, his3Δ1) and the isogenic ctr1Δ:: kanMX4 mutant from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). sod1Δ KS107 (Mat α, leu 2-3, 112, his3Δ1, trp-289a, ura3-52, sod1Δ::TRP1) was a gift from Dr. V. C. Culotta. All of the cultures were grown in synthetic defined media with selective amino acids excluded with appropriate filter sterilized carbon source added. Metal concentrations were varied by using Bio101 yeast nitrogen base (Q-Bio Gene) plus added 0.1 mm ferrous chloride to give copper-deficient conditions. If required, further copper chelation was achieved by adding filter-sterilized copper chelator bathocuproine sulfonate (BCS). Exogenous copper was provided by adding CuSO4 at the final concentrations stated. All of the growth tests were performed at 30 °C with 1 in 10 serial dilutions of pre-cultures grown under permissive conditions (e.g. fermentable carbon sources or anaerobic conditions). Anaerobic cultures were prepared in anaerobic jars using BBL GasPak Pd catalysts (BD Biosciences). Vector Constructs—Matrix-targeted human SOD1 was described previously (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Matrix-targeted CRS5 was constructed by adding the coding sequence for the 26 N-terminal amino acids of Sod2 in-frame to the open reading frame YOR031W by overlap PCR. A Myc tag was added to the C terminus by primer extension. A stop codon present in template genomic DNA (BY4741 background) was corrected to a serine as per previously reported sequence (16Culotta V.C. Howard W.R. Liu X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25295-25302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using QuikChange (Stratagene). The fusion sequence construct was cloned into YEp vector with a heterologous MET25 promoter sequence (300 bp upstream of YLR303W) and a CYC1 terminator. IM-hSOD1 was constructed by inserting the hSod1 open reading frame in-frame with the sequence encoding the N-terminal 104 residues of Sco2 (YBR024W) that encode a targeting sequence and a transmembrane domain described previously (15Maxfield A.B.

The promoter element was derived from the 200 bp upstream of SCO1 (YBR037C). All of the constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing prior to use. Chromatographic Fractionations of Mitochondria—Mitochondria fractions were prepared as described previously (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The soluble contents were fractionated as described previously (22Marobbio C.M.T. Vozza A. Harding M. Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Anionic fractions for reverse phase (RP) HPLC were prepared as above or by adding DEAE (Whatman) resin in batch. The resin was washed with 25 bed volumes of 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.0, and eluted with 5 volumes of 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 8.0. The samples were loaded directly onto a Beckman C18 resin. Unbound fractions were removed with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0 (or 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to isolate the apo ligand). A 60-min gradient to 100% acetonitrile was used with 1 ml of fraction collected. The final fractions were analyzed for copper by flame atomic absorption (PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnlyst 100) and for fluorescence in a LB 50 fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Excitation and emission scans of copper containing fractions revealed an excitation maximum of 220 nm and an emission maximum of 360 nm. Excitation and emission slits of 5 nm were used. Copper Titrations—Copper titration of apo ligand was performed in Tris buffer at pH 7.2 by the addition of Cu(I) as copper:acetonitrile complex or Cu(II) as copper-sulfate. Cu(BCS)2 complex was made by addition of copper:acetonitrile to a 2.5-fold excess of BCS and quantified by absorbance at 483 nm (ϵ = 13.3 mm–1 cm–1). Variable concentrations of apo ligand were added to fixed concentration of 0.05 mm Cu(BCS)2 and incubated at room temperature. The fraction of Cu(BCS)2 was determined by absorbance at 483 nm after 30 min. Mouse—Livers from mice were recovered, and mitochondria were isolated by mechanical disruption of the tissues by a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and differential centrifugation in 0.25 m sucrose followed by gradient purification using a discontinuous 22% over 28% Nycodenz gradient. Integrity and purity were assessed by immunoblotting and enzymatic activity of marker proteins. Miscellaneous Methods—The monoclonal anti-human SOD1 and polyclonal anti-ANT1 and anti-LAMP3 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Yeast Sod1 antisera was a gift from Dr. V. C. Culotta. Antisera to Por1 (porin) and Pgk1 (phosphoglycerol kinase) were from Molecular Probes. The enzyme assays were preformed as described previously (17Geller B.L. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8945-8952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme was extracted by the pyridine hemochromogen method (18Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Attenuation of CcO Activity by Matrix-directed Human Sod1—We showed previously that human Sod1 can be activated when targeted to the mitochondrial matrix to complement the oxygen-dependent phenotypes of a sod2Δ yeast strain (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Here we have tested whether expression of matrix-targeted human SOD1 (m-hSOD1) (the matrix targeting sequence of yeast Sod2 was used) has negative physiological consequences for copper-dependent activities within the mitochondria when compared with cells expressing human SOD1 lacking the matrix-targeting signal (c-hSOD1). Cells lacking Ctr1 were used in these studies because they have diminished copper levels within the cell, creating favorable conditions for the competition experiments. Immunoblotting of ctr1Δ transformants demonstrated the presence of the hSod1 proteins in the predicted compartments (Fig. 1A). Both transformants grew equivalently in glucose-containing medium, but the matrix-targeted hSod1 cells were compromised for growth on nonfermentable carbon sources as a result of specific loss of CcO activity (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Respiration-dependent growth was restored by the addition of CuSO4 to the growth medium (Fig. 1B); this correlated with the partial return of CcO activity (data not shown). The inhibited glycerol growth of m-hSod1-containing cells may arise from hSod1 competition with the matrix CuL complex, resulting in decreased availability of copper for the metallation of downstream targets. In fact a catalytically inactive hSod1 containing an R143A substitution was able to exert the same dominant negative phenotype in ctr1Δ cells (data not shown). Mitochondrial lysates fractionated by anion exchange chromatography revealed that cells containing m-hSod1 had a diminished level of the matrix CuL complex (shown previously to elute in fractions 8 and 9 (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar)) when compared with mitochondria from control cells with an empty vector (data not shown) or c-hSod1-containing cells (Fig. 1C). An enriched copper fraction now appeared in the column wash fractions (fractions 1 and 2) that contained m-hSod1 (Fig. 1C, inset). Gel filtration chromatography of the wash fractions (Fig. 1D) showed that fractions containing m-hSod1 also contained copper, confirming copper binding by m-hSod1. Attenuation of CcO Activity by Matrix-directed Crs5—To assess the specificity of the m-hSod1 competition for matrix copper, a second copper-binding protein was used. The mitochondrial targeting sequence of Sod2 was fused to the cytoplasmic Crs5 copper-metallothionein to generate a matrix-targeted variant (m-Crs5). Immunoblotting showed that the Myctagged m-Crs5 was localized in the mitochondrion (Fig. 2A). The presence of Crs5 within the mitochondrial matrix did not impair the growth of yeast on glucose medium (Fig. 2B). However, m-Crs5 compromised growth on glycerol medium, and this inhibitory effect was reversed by the addition of CuSO4 to the growth medium (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this phenotype, CcO activity was impaired in m-Crs5 cells, and the supplementation of CuSO4 to the growth medium restored its activity to a level sufficient to support growth on a nonfermentable carbon source (Fig. 2C). In addition to attenuating CcO activity, the presence of m-Crs5 led to a diminution in the yeast Sod1 protein level within the IMS (Fig. 2D), whereas cytosolic Sod1 was unaffected (data not shown). Sod1 protein level was restored when CuSO4 was added to m-Crs5 cell cultures (Fig. 2D). Sod1 Tethered to the IM Is Dependent on the Matrix Copper Complex—The negative effect of matrix Crs5 on IMS Sod1 protein levels was further investigated by engineering a yeast strain containing an IM-tethered hSod1 (via the Sco2 transmembrane domain). Cells lacking endogenous Sod1 were transformed with a vector expressing the IM-hSOD1 fusion gene. Immuno-blotting analysis showed that the fusion protein was intact and exclusively localized in the mitochondrion (Fig. 3A). The IMhSod1 chimera reversed the oxygen-dependent growth defect of sod1Δ cells even on medium lacking lysine and methionine (19Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The effect of matrix-targeted Crs5 on IM-hSod1 activity was assessed. The presence of m-Crs5 imparted a growth defect in cells cultured in normoxia (Fig. 4A). Both strains grew equivalently in the absence of oxygen, confirming that the negative effect of m-Crs5 was exerted on IM-hSod1. The presence of m-Crs5 reduced the CcO activity (data not shown) and also attenuated the level of the IM-hSod1 chimeric protein (Fig. 4C). Increasing the quantity of CuSO4 in the growth medium partially reversed the inhibitory effect of m-Crs5 on normoxic growth (Fig. 4B) and CcO activity but failed to restore the steady state level of IM-hSod1. When IMhSod1 was expressed from the minimal MAC1 promoter, protein levels detected by immunoblotting were comparable with those shown in Fig. 4C in cells expressing m-Crs5. This level of expression was sufficient to complement the oxygen sensitivity of sod1Δ cells (data not shown). Thus, the growth defect observed with m-Crs5 was due to a failure to activate hSod1 and not to decreased levels of IM-hSod1.FIGURE 4IM-hSOD1 complementation of the oxygen sensitivity of sod1Δ yeast cells can be modulated by the mitochondrial-matrix targeted Crs5. A) sod1Δ cells containing the IM-hSOD1 chimera gene under the control of the SCO1 promoter and either an empty vector (vec) or the chimeric m-Crs5 were plated in serial dilution on 2% glucose plates cultured in normoxia and anoxia. B, the same cells as in A were plated on 2% glucose Met– Lys– plates (supplemented with 0.01 mm BCS or CuSO4 as indicated) and grown under normoxia or in an anaerobic jar (Anoxia). C, steady state protein levels for m-Crs5 and IM-hSod1. Mitochondria from sod1Δ cells expressing IM-hSOD1 and either an empty vector (vec) or m-Crs5 were immunoblotted to detect IM-hSod1 and the Myc tag corresponding to m-Crs5. Two independent mitochondrial preparations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Matrix-targeted Competitors Diminish Levels of the Matrix CuL Complex—Characterization studies were conducted to identify molecular signatures of the matrix CuL complex to enable its quantification. The matrix CuL complex is anionic and has a low molecular weight (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Anion exchange fractions of mitochondrial extracts containing the CuL complex were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC at pH 5 using an acetonitrile gradient (0–100%). A single copper component eluted at 60% of the linear gradient (Fig. 5A). Because aqueous copper is not retained on RP-HPLC, the copper component is ligand-bound. The HPLC-purified CuL complex was subjected to spectroscopic analysis and was found to fluoresce with excitation and emission maxima at 220 and 360 nm, respectively (Fig. 5B). The quantum yield was enhanced by the addition of potassium cyanide that effectively removes copper from the complex (Fig. 5B). Fluorescence analysis of the HPLC elution fractions revealed a co-fractionation of the 360-nm emission property and copper (Fig. 5A). Upon addition of KCN and refractionation by RP-HPLC, the ligand was recovered in a similar column fraction now devoid of copper (data not shown). The emission of the copper-free ligand was quenched by the addition of Cu(I) but not by Zn(II) or Fe(II) (Fig. 5C). In addition the levels of the anionic fluorescent complex recovered from mitochondrial extracts was increased in cells grown in high exogenous copper that result in increased mitochondrial copper (Fig. 5D). Thus, the anionic ligand concentration correlates with the total mitochondrial copper. The fluorescence property of the matrix CuL ligand was used to quantify the ligand in mitochondria of ctr1Δ cells containing either c-hSod1 or m-hSod1. Clarified mitochondrial lysate from c-hSod1- or m-hSod1-containing cells were adsorbed to an anion exchanger, and the total anionic fraction was subsequently applied to reverse phase HPLC at pH 5 (Fig. 5E). Total ligand fluorescence (assessed after cyanide addition) was attenuated in m-hSod1-containing cells. Likewise, mitochondrial ligand fluorescence was attenuated in m-Crs5-containing cells (Fig. 5F). The decreased yield of this fluorescence strongly suggested that this signature of the CuL complex is associated with the source of Cu(I) for CcO and Sod1 metallation within the IMS. The presence of the competitor proteins altered the distribution of the matrix copper without affecting the total mitochondrial copper content. The ligand exhibits a binding preference for Cu(I) over Cu(II) (Fig. 6A). Comparison of metal ion quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the ligand revealed preferential quenching by Cu(I) compared with Cu(II). Likewise, CuL complex as purified from mitochondria is reactive with excess of the Cu(I)-specific chelator BCS and is EPR silent (data not shown). Quantitation of the amount of Cu(I) resulting in maximal quenching (Fig. 1B) and assuming a 1:1 complex permitted an approximation of the ligand concentration. Titrating the apo ligand into a solution containing a preformed Cu(BCS)2 complex revealed concentration-dependent stripping of Cu(I) from BCS. From the estimated affinity of the Cu(BCS)2 complex of 1019 (20Xiao Z. Loughlin F. George G.N. Howlett G.J. Wedd A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the matrix ligand has a Cu(I) binding affinity only slightly diminished from that of BCS. EDTA was inferior to the ligand in competing for Cu(I) from Cu(BCS)2 as would be expected considering the acetate ligands. Metal-free Ligand Is Found in the Cytoplasm—The fluorescent and chromatographic properties of the ligand allowed us to address whether the ligand existed in the cytoplasm. The cytosol was fractionated into anionic and uncharged/cationic pools by adsorption on anion exchanger. Anionic components were eluted in a high salt wash of the resin. The column wash and salt eluate were boiled to coagulate proteins. This treatment does not alter the concentration or the chromatographic characteristics of the matrix CuL complex. The clarified fractions were chromatographed by RP-HPLC. Fractions with retention times equivalent to that of the mitochondrial CuL complex were quantified by fluorimetry. The anion exchange salt elution (anionic fraction) contained low levels of the fluorescent adduct, whereas the anion exchange wash showed an abundance of the fluorescent species (Fig. 7A). After treatment with cyanide, this nonanionic fraction appeared to have a quantum yield per cell of nearly eight times over that purified from isolated mitochondria (Fig. 7B). Although we cannot eliminate the possibility that at least some of this molecule was liberated from mitochondria by our extraction procedure, the large amount found in these fractions suggests that the ligand is present in the cytoplasm. The copper-free molecule present in the cytoplasm could be converted to an anionic copper adduct by incubation with Cu(I) and dithiothreitol (Fig. 7C). The copper-reconstituted adduct chromatographed equivalently to the anionic CuL complex on reverse phase HPLC. Quantitation of the ligand based on fluorescence revealed that of the total cytoplasmic ligand only around 10% is copper bound (Fig. 7A). Conversely, the ligand found associated with mitochondria is >60% in the anionic copper-bound form (Fig. 7D). The coordination of copper appears to impart a net negative charge to the complex. The Matrix Copper Ligand Is Conserved in Mouse Liver—To investigate the conservation of the CuL complex in higher eukaryotes, we isolated intact pure mitochondria from mouse liver. The purity of mitochondria was established by Western blot analysis and marker enzyme activities (Fig. 8A and not shown). Pure mitochondria were analyzed for total copper content and for heme a+a3 (Fig. 8B). Because heme a+a3 is only found in active CcO, the heme a+a3 content can be used to quantify the levels of copper in CcO. The analysis revealed that a range of 10–40% of the copper present in different mitochondrial preparations was associated with active CcO. The mice used in these studies were not matched for age or sex and were from two genetic backgrounds (contributing to the broad range). Therefore, as in yeast, CcO does not account for the predominant pool of copper in mouse liver mitochondria. Soluble mitochondrial extracts were fractionated on anion exchange resin as we had done for yeast mitochondria. The major copper peak was isolated as an anionic complex that was not sensitive to proteases (proteinase K and trypsin) (Fig. 8C). Further fractionation on reverse phase chromatography revealed an identical elution position to the yeast CuL complex (Fig. 8D). The final fraction had the CuL complex fluorescence, and the quantum yield was increased by cyanide and quenched by Cu(I), but not by Fe(II) or Zn(II) (Fig. 8E). As in yeast, the ligand from this complex could be isolated in an uncharged state in the cytosol fractions from mouse liver (data not shown). Taken together these data show that the CuL complex is conserved in higher eukaryotes. A matrix CuL complex conserved in the mitochondrion of yeast and mouse liver is shown to be the source of copper for the metallation of CcO and Sod1. In yeast 85% and in mouse liver ∼70% of the total mitochondrial copper is associated with this matrix copper complex. Targeting two different copper-binding proteins, human Sod1 and Crs5, to the mitochondrial matrix but not the cytoplasm, results in growth impairment on nonfermentable carbon sources because of decreased levels of CcO activity. This effect is reversed by supplementation of CuSO4 to the culture medium. In addition the presence of the matrix-targeted Crs5 results in diminished Sod1 protein levels within the IMS and impaired activity of an IM-tethered hSod1. This tethered Sod1 provided a direct marker of IMS copper. Copper binding by the matrix-targeted proteins attenuates the level of the anionic CuL complex within the matrix without affecting the total mitochondrial copper levels, suggesting that biochemical attenuation of the matrix CuL complex via heterologous competitor molecules limits the available copper for redistribution to the IMS for metallation of CcO and Sod1. Supplementation of cells with exogenous copper leads to an expansion of the matrix Cu(I) pool, resulting in an increase in the fluorescent CuL complex (14Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, expression of m-hSod1 had a diminished effect on the quantity of the CuL complex. Therefore, the copper reversal of the observed glycerol growth impairment in cells harboring the matrix-targeted proteins likely occurs from the restoration of the matrix CuL pool. The anionic CuL complex is fluorescent, and its fluorescence correlates with its copper-binding status. The ligand fluorescence is specifically quenched by Cu(I). Although attenuated quenching is observed with Cu(II), recovery of the subsequent CuL complex reveals the presence of Cu(I). The ligand fluorescence provides a spectroscopic signature that we have used for its quantitation and identification of its presence in the cell cytoplasm. Copper is present in the CuL complex as Cu(I), and the ligand has an affinity for Cu(I) in a similar range as BCS. Thus, although the ligand binds Cu(I) stably, the bound Cu(I) ions are exchange-labile because either hSod1 or Crs5 can compete for the bound Cu(I). A kinetically labile copper pool within the mitochondria, but not the cytoplasm, was recently confirmed by microprobe x-ray absorption spectroscopy (21Yang L. McRae R. Henary M.M. Patel R. Lai B. Vogt S. Fahrni C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11179-11184Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The ligand is found in the yeast cytoplasm in a largely copper-free state. The cytoplasmic ligand fails to adsorb to an anion exchanger unless it is charged in vitro with Cu(I). Cu(I) binding yields an anionic complex that co-fractionates with the matrix Cu(I) complex on RP-HPLC. We postulate that Cu(I) binding to the ligand within the cytoplasm triggers the translocation of the complex to the mitochondrion for storage and subsequent use in CcO and Sod1 metallation within the IMS. The facile expansion of the matrix Cu(I) pool upon supplementation of cells with exogenous copper is consistent with this model and with the high concentration of apo ligand within the cytoplasm. The model predicts that two types of transporters exist within the mitochondrion. One transporter may function in the translocation of the CuL complex to the matrix compartment, and the second transporter is postulated to deliver either Cu(I) or the CuL complex to the IMS for use by Cox17 and Ccs1 for metallation of downstream targets. We are developing genetic strategies to identify the putative transporters. Considering that the ligand is conserved in mammalian cells, we predict that similar transporters exist in mammalian cells. The apparent small molecule/metabolite characteristic of the copper ligand described here would be consistent with transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane by the mitochondrial carrier family. This family of 30 proteins has been shown to transport a number of metabolites such as S-adenosyl methionine and thiamine pyrophosphate (22Marobbio C.M.T. Vozza A. Harding M. Bisaccia F. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5653-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Marobbio, C. M. T., Agrimi, G., Lasorsa, F. M., and Palamieri, F. (22) EMBO J. 22, 5975–5982Google Scholar). Metal links exist with this family, Mrs3 and Mrs4 are involved in iron transport for the assembly of iron-sulfur cluster and heme, and Mtm1 has been shown to be involved in manganese/iron homeostasis (24Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. SU. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Yang M. Cobine P.A. Molik S. Naranuntarat A. Lill R. Winge D.R. Culotta V.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The lack of nonfermentable growth phenotypes for other mitochondrial carrier family deletion strains suggests that if the putative copper transporter required for CcO assembly is a mitochondrial carrier family, it may have redundant partners. In the case of yeast Mrs3/4, the iron-related phenotypes are much more pronounced in the double deletion strain (27Li F.Y. Nikali K. Gregan J. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Schweyen R. Larsson C. Suomalainen A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Cu(I) ligand model for copper transport to the mitochondrion, eubacterial in origin, resembles a siderophore strategy of metal ion acquisition by bacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria utilize a copper-requiring membrane methane monooxygenase in methane catabolism and synthesize the only characterized copper siderophore-like complex, methanobactin. Methanobactin is extruded by methanotrophs into the growth medium when cells are cultured under copper-limiting conditions and is rapidly internalized when copper is provided (28Kim H.J. Graham D.W. DiSpirito A.A. Alterman M.A. Galeva N. Larive C.K. Asunskis D. Sherwood P.M.A. Science. 2004; 305: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Methanobactin co-purifies with the particulate methane monooxygenase, suggesting that Cu(I)-methanobactin provides copper for the catalytic function of the enzyme. Methanobactin is a small cyclic peptide with two chelating 4-thionyl-5-hydroxyimidazolates that stably binds Cu(I). Similar to the matrix CuL, the fluorescence of methanobactin is quenched by Cu(I). No compelling evidence exists regarding whether the matrix Cu(I) ligand structurally resembles methanobactin. The methanobactin pathway represents a paradigm for how mitochondrial copper acquisition may proceed. Finally, a number of isolated CcO deficiencies and pleiotrophic loss of respiratory competence with unknown mutations have been found. As our knowledge of the protein mediated assembly and the complex translation and post-translational mechanisms controlling CcO expands, a number of new targets for these mutations will be identified. Unexplained CcO deficiencies in humans may arise from mutations in one of the proposed transporters or mutations that affect the ligand biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1980188948,"The recently identified ceramide transfer protein, CERT, is responsible for the bulk of ceramide transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. CERT has a C-terminal START domain for ceramide binding and an N-terminal pleck-strin homology domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate suggesting that phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinases are involved in the regulation of CERT-mediated ceramide transport. In the present study fluorescent analogues were used to follow the ER to Golgi transport of ceramide to determine which of the four mammalian PI 4-kinases are involved in this process. Overexpression of pleckstrin homology domains that bind phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate strongly inhibited the transport of C5-BODIPY-ceramide to the Golgi. A newly identified PI 3-kinase inhibitor, PIK93 that selectively inhibits the type III PI 4-kinase β enzyme, and small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of the individual PI 4-kinase enzymes, revealed that PI 4-kinase β has a dominant role in ceramide transport between the ER and Golgi. Accordingly, inhibition of PI 4-kinase III β either by wortmannin or PIK93 inhibited the conversion of [3H]serine-labeled endogenous ceramide to sphingomyelin. Therefore, PI 4-kinase β is a key enzyme in the control of spingomyelin synthesis by controlling the flow of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi compartment. The recently identified ceramide transfer protein, CERT, is responsible for the bulk of ceramide transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi.

Sphingomyelin is a critical lipid component of the plasma membrane that together with cholesterol and glycolipids forms a special liquid-ordered microdomain of cellular membranes often referred to as rafts (1Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Rafts concentrate many signaling proteins and also contain inositol phospholipids and hence are considered to be active zones in signal transduction (2Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The regulation of cholesterol and sphingomyelin metabolism is intimately interrelated but relatively little is known about the regulatory pathways that link them together (3Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1734: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Efficient synthesis of sphingomyelin in the Golgi has been shown to require the steady supply of ceramide from the ER 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CERT, ceramide transfer protein; FAPP, four phosphate adaptor protein; FL-Cer, FL C5-ceramide; OSBP, oxysterol binding protein; PAO, phenylarsine oxide; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; PtdIns4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; TR-Cer, TR ceramide; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. by a process distinct from the vesicular transport between the two organelles (4Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The mechanism of this transport has been recently revealed by the identification of a lipid transport protein, named CERT by the use of an elegant cloning strategy (5Hanada K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2006; 286: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). CERT has a lipid binding START domain at the C terminus, a PH domain at the N terminus, and a so-called FFAT (diphenylalanine in an acidic track) domain that binds the ER-localized protein, VAP-A (4Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The START domain is both necessary and sufficient for ceramide binding and transport, yet a mutation within the PH domain renders the molecule unable to fulfill its transport function pointing to the PH domain as a critical component for the docking/regulation of the molecule (4Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The CERT PH domain shows a high degree of similarity to PH domains that specifically recognize PtdIns4P, such as those of the OSBP, FAPP1, and FAPP2 proteins, and has been shown to localize to the Golgi (6Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that PtdIns4P and PI4K enzymes are likely to regulate the transport function of CERT. There are four PI4K enzymes identified in mammalian genomes that fall into one of two groups. Type III PI4Ks are structural relatives of PI3Ks and are represented by the PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ enzymes that are highly conserved from yeast to men. Their yeast orthologues, Stt4p and Pik1p, respectively, are essential genes with non-redundant functions (7Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol.

Given the presence of multiple PI4Ks in the Golgi and one in the ER, it was of interest to determine which (if any) of these enzymes are important in supporting the transport of ceramide between the ER and Golgi. In the present study we used a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches to address this question and show that PI4KIIIβ is important in the transport of fluorescent ceramide analogues to the Golgi and that inhibition of PI4KIIIβ results in the defect of the synthesis of sphingomyelin. Materials—Wortmannin and phenylarsine oxide (PAO) were purchased from Sigma, and brefeldin A from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI). PIK93 was synthesized as described previously (21Knight Z.A. Gonzalez B. Feldman M.E. Zunder E.R. Goldenberg D.D. Williams O. Loewith R. Stokoe D. Balla A. Toth B. Balla T. Weiss W.A. Williams R.L. Shokat K.M.

The polyclonal antibody against PI4KIIα was kindly provided by Dr. Pietro De Camilli. The primary antibody against PI4KIIIβ was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA). The affinity purified polyclonal antibody against the PI4KIIIα was recently described (20Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies were purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD). Alexa-transferrin, BODIPY® FL C5-ceramide, BODIPY® TR-ceramide, and ER-tracker green were obtained from Invitrogen. The Lipofectamine 2000 and Oligofectamine reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA Constructs and Transfections—The FAPP1- and OSBP-PH domains fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein have been previously described (20Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These PH domains were subcloned so that the enhanced green fluorescent protein was replaced by the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP), kindly provided by Dr. R. Y. Tsien (22Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). The PH domain of CERT (residues 76-345) has been amplified from a human full-length EST clone (IMAGE id: 3505746, Open Biosystem, Huntsville, AL) using the primer pairs of: forward, 5′-acatctcgaggcctccatgtcgcgctgcggggtcctcagtaagtgg-3′, and reverse, 5′-acatgaattccagattcagtcttgtgctgttcaatggc-3′. The PH domain was subcloned into the pmRFP-N1 plasmid (fashioned following the pEGFP-N1 plasmid) in-frame with the mRFP protein using the XhoI/EcoRI restriction sites. COS-7 cells grown on 25-mm glass coverslips were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNAs with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For siRNA studies, the same duplexes and procedures were used as described in Ref. 20Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar. Briefly, COS-7 cells (105 cells in 2 ml) were plated in 35-mm culture dishes 1 day before transfection with 20 μl of 20 μm siRNA (obtained from Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using Oligo-fectamine (Invitrogen). After 6 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum. Transfection with the siRNAs was repeated 1 day later, and live cells were studied by confocal microscopy on the fourth day. The effect of siRNA treatment on the PI4K expression levels was determined in parallel dishes by Western blot analysis. Confocal Microscopy and Analysis of Ceramide Transport—For ceramide transport, COS-7 cells were plated onto 25-mm diameter circular glass coverslips at a density of 3 × 105 cells/dish 1 day before the experiment. On the day of the experiment the coverslip was placed into a chamber and the cells were washed in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4) and incubated on ice for 20 min with 0.05 μm BODIPY® FL C5-ceramide or 0.5 μm BODIPY® TR-ceramide and the excess fluorescent dye was removed by washing again with modified Krebs-Ringer buffer. The coverslip was then mounted on a heated stage with the medium temperature (and the objective) kept at 37 °C and the distribution of ceramide was analyzed using an inverted Zeiss LSM-510 scanning laser confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) and an objective heater (Bioptech, Butler, PA). Quantification of the Distribution of BODIPY® FL C5-ceramide between the Golgi and ER—The transport of fluorescent ceramide was quantified post-acquisition using the linescan function of the Metamorph software. A line was drawn through the cells in the confocal pictures taken in different time points and the fluorescent intensity was measured in the cytoplasm and over the Golgi complex of the cells. The “uptake ratio” was calculated from the fluorescent light intensity in the Golgi divided by the intensity measured in the cytoplasm. The maximum uptake ratio was measured in control cells after 25 min incubation at 37 °C, and this value was taken as 100%. The quantification was made from the data of three independent experiments in which confocal pictures were taken in 12 different time points and in each time points 7 cells were analyzed. Labeling of Endogenous Sphingolipids with [3H]Serine—Metabolic labeling of sphingolipids using l-[3H]serine was performed by the modified protocol of Ridgway et al. (23Ridgway N.D. Merriam D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Bodennec et al. (24Bodennec J. Koul O. Aguado I. Brichon G. Zwingelstein G. Portoukalian J. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. After 1 day in culture, cells were incubated in a serine-free medium for 4 h before labeling with 100 μCi/ml [3H]serine for the indicated times. When inhibitors were used, they were added 10 min prior to labeling and were present throughout the labeling period. Incubations were terminated by removal of the labeling medium and the addition of ice-cold 5% perchloric acid. Cells were then scraped and centrifuged, and the pellets sonicated for 10 s in 2 ml of methanol/water (5:4, v/v), followed by the addition of 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). After vigorous shaking phase separation was achieved by adding 4 ml of 0.58% NaCl followed by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min). The lower phase was washed 3 times with 2 ml of methanol, 0.58% NaCl, chloroform (45:47:3, v/v) and dried under nitrogen. The dried samples were subjected to alkaline methanolysis to remove glycerolipids by adding 2 ml of chloroform, 0.6 n NaOH in methanol (1:1, v/v) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After hydrolysis, 0.8 ml of 0.6 n HCl was added to the samples, with vortexing. The two phases were separated by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min) and the lower phase was extracted again using chloroform, methanol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (3:48: 47, v/v). After drying under N2, sphingolipids were separated by TLC on Silica G plates using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v). Lipids were identified by fluorography and the radioactive spots were cut out and counted in a scintillation counter. Fluorescent Ceramide Analogues Differ in Their Ability to Report on Ceramide Transport—Fluorescent ceramide analogues have been widely used to follow the transport of ceramide in living cells (25Lipsky N.G. Pagano R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2608-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two of these analogues, BODIPY® FL C5-ceramide (green) and BODIPY® TR ceramide (red), were used in the present study (Figs. 1 and 2). These fluorescent analogues were exogenously added to COS-7 cells for 20 min at 4 °C and after washing, their transport was followed at 37 °C. To minimize the simple diffusion of the analogues due to their partial water solubility, FL-Cer was used in very low concentration (0.05 μm, which is 100-fold less than recommended by the manufacturer). BODIPY® FL C5-ceramide (FL-Cer) was present in the plasma membrane immediately after loading but rapidly disappeared from the plasma membrane after warming to 37 °C showing diffuse cytoplasmic distribution consistent with ER localization. This analogue did not remain in the ER in high amounts but quickly appeared in the Golgi where it continued to accumulate throughout the 30-min period examined (Fig. 1A). The Golgi localized FL-Cer slowly redistributed to the ER when the cells were treated with brefeldin A, suggesting that FL-Cer is probably bound to a Golgi-localized protein (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Differential transport of different fluorescent ceramide analogues. A, COS-7 cells were incubated for 20 min on ice in modified Krebs-Ringer solution containing 0.5 μm TR-Cer (complexed to bovine serum albumin). After washing, cells were warmed to 37 °C and the transport of TR-Cer was followed by confocal microscopy. On 37 °C, TR-Cer is transported from the PM to the ER and it accumulates there even after 30 min on 37 °C. The ER was labeled using 1 μm ER-tracker. B, COS-7 cells were loaded simultaneously with 0.05 μm FL-Cer and 0.5 μm TR-Cer as described above. The transport and localization of the two fluorescent analogues were followed by confocal microscopy at 37 °C. The two fluorescent ceramide analogues show distinct localization. C, chemical structures of the two ceramide analogues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Surprisingly, BODIPY® TR-ceramide (TR-Cer) showed a distinct transport pattern. This analogue had to be used at 10-fold higher concentration than FL-Cer (this was still 10-fold less than recommended by the manufacturer) to be reliably detected in our microscope system. Under these conditions this analogue, too, was localized to the plasma membrane upon loading and moved rapidly to the ER during the 37 °C incubation. In contrast to its green counterpart, however, TR-Cer was only very slowly transported to the Golgi and accumulated in the ER as shown by its co-localization with the endoplasmic reticulum marker ER-tracker even after a 25-min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). The different transport rates of the two ceramide analogues was best seen in experiments in which the two were added simultaneously (Fig. 2B). Here, the Golgi localization of FL-Cer is quite prominent, whereas TR-Cer remains largely in the ER. This indicates that not only is TR-Cer a poor substrate of CERT, but it also is a poor inhibitor of the transport of FL-Cer. Based on these comparisons, FL-Cer was used in all subsequent studies. To obtain a numerical measure of the transport to the Golgi, we determined the relative fluorescent intensities over the Golgi and ER using the linescan function of the Metamorph software (Fig. 3). From the fluorescent intensity profiles obtained along lines drawn across the Golgi, a ratio was formed using the peak fluorescent intensity measured at the Golgi divided by that of the cytoplasm (ER) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The value of this ratio started out around 1 in control cells immediately after starting the 37 °C incubation of the loaded cells and reached a maximum value of around 8 by 10 min incubation at 37 °C. In kinetic analysis, the ratio value found at 25 min after incubation at 37 °C in control cells was taken as 100% in each experiment and the values were expressed as a percent of this value. Effects of the Overexpression of the PH Domains of FAPP1 and OSBP on Ceramide Transport—Because CERT contains a PH domain that is essential for its ability to transport ceramide from the ER to Golgi and this PH domain recognizes PtdIns4P, our goal was to explore the role of PI 4-kinases and their product PtdIns4P in the ER-Golgi transport of ceramide. To investigate the extent to which Golgi PtdIns4P is important in the CERT-mediated ceramide transport, first the effects of overexpression of PH domains with PtdIns4P binding on FL-Cer accumulation was examined. COS-7 cells were transfected with either the FAPP1-PH-mRFP or the OSBP-PH-mRFP constructs, and their FL-Cer transport was followed by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of the PH domains greatly inhibited the transport of FL-Cer to the Golgi and decreased the ability of the Golgi to accumulate fluorescence. It is important to note that expression of the PH domains at low levels did not interfere with the transport and in fact showed co-localization with FL-Cer over the Golgi. This observation showed that the PtdIns4P pool of the Golgi is necessary for efficient ER to Golgi transport of ceramide. Which PI4K Is Involved in CERT-mediated Ceramide Transport?—Because the Golgi/trans-Golgi network contains several PI4Ks (see above), next we wanted to determine which PI4K is important for this process. First, the effects of different PI4K inhibitors were examined on the transport of FL-Cer to the Golgi. Wortmannin, a widely used PI3K inhibitor that also inhibits type III (but not type II PI4Ks) at micromolar concentrations (27Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), was used to determine which class of PI4K is involved in this process. As shown in Fig. 5, FL-Cer accumulation in the Golgi was significantly inhibited in cells pretreated with 10 μm wortmannin indicating the involvement of the type III PI4Ks (Fig. 5). Lower concentrations of wortmannin (100 nm) that only inhibit PI3Ks did not have an effect on ceramide transport (not shown). To discriminate between PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ that have almost identical wortmannin sensitivities, we took advantage of our recent identification of a PI3K inhibitor, PIK93 that can discriminate between the two PI4K enzymes (21Knight Z.A. Gonzalez B. Feldman M.E. Zunder E.R. Goldenberg D.D. Williams O. Loewith R. Stokoe D. Balla A. Toth B. Balla T. Weiss W.A. Williams R.L. Shokat K.M. Cell. 2006; 125: 733-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Whereas PI4KIIIβ is inhibited by ∼90% at 250 nm concentration of PIK93, PI4KIIIα requires >10 μm to be inhibited by 50%, and type II PI4Ks are completely resistant to the inhibitor. (These values were obtained with purified enzymes tested in vitro in the presence of 100 μm ATP. 4A. Balla, G. Tuymetova, B. Tóth, X.-H. Zhao, Z. Knight, K. Shokat, P. Steinbach, and T. Balla, manuscript in preparation.) As shown in Fig. 5, 250 nm PIK93 almost completely eliminated the Golgi localization of the CERT-PH domain within 5 min treatment, and inhibited FL-Cer accumulation in the Golgi to the same extent as wortmannin. These data suggested that PI4KIIIβ is very important for this process. The effects of PAO were also tested because this compound is often used as a PI4K inhibitor (28Wiedemann C. Schäfer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 29Várnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment of the cells with 10 μm PAO, a concentration that is expected to primarily inhibit the type IIIα enzyme had multiple effects. It partially inhibited the transport of FL-Cer to the Golgi but it also caused the appearance of small cytoplasmic puncta that was not observed with any of the other inhibitors. PAO treatment also decreased the overall amount of FL-Cer taken up by the cells (data not shown). These data suggested that PAO probably interferes with FL-Cer transport at multiple steps, and therefore, its effects were not examined in detail. To further analyze the role of the PI4K enzymes, the proteins were down-regulated by siRNA treatment. These studies showed that knock-down of PI4KIIIβ caused a strong inhibition of ceramide transport compared with cells treated with a control siRNA (Fig. 6, A and B) and this effect was very comparable with those evoked by the inhibitors. Down-regulation of the other PI4Ks, PI4KIIα and -IIIα caused a small but consistent inhibition of FL-Cer accumulation in the Golgi, but did not inhibit the rate by which this equilibrium was reached (Fig. 6C). We also noted that the cells in which PI4KIIIα was knocked down accumulated less FL-Cer within the cell (not shown). Importantly, knockdown of PI4KIIα or PI4KIIIα had no effect on the expression level of PI4KIIIβ (Fig. 6), hence the small alterations in ceramide transport in these latter cases cannot be attributed to changes in PI4KIIIβ levels. Treatment with PI4KIIβ siRNA failed to show any effect on FL-Cer uptake or transport (not shown), but we could not detect the endogenous protein in COS-7 cells with antibodies available for us, so the role of this enzyme in ceramide transport (if any) needs further investigations. Because pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of PI4KIIIβ caused only a partial inhibition of ceramide transport compared with the effects of overexpressed PH domains, we examined whether there is an additive effect when PI4Ks are down-regulated in combination. However, we were unable to show any additive effects with the combined down-regulation of more than one enzyme (for example, the type IIα or type IIIα in addition to type IIIβ) or by the addition of type IIIβ inhibitors to cells in which type IIα was down-regulated (data not shown). Inhibition of PI4KIIIβ Affects Endogenous Sphingomyelin Synthesis—To determine whether the observed effects of PI4KIIIβ inhibition on FL-ceramide transport reflect a similar defect in endogenous ceramide movements, we examined the effects of wortmannin and PIK93 on the labeling of endogenous sphingolipids in [3H]serine-labeled cells. Pretreatment of COS-7 cells with 250 nm PIK93 had a significant inhibitory effect on the incorporation of [3H]serine into sphingomyelin without any effect on the labeling of ceramide (Fig. 7). A slight but consistent effect on glycosyl-ceramide (GlcCer) synthesis was also observed but this was minor compared to the effects on sphingomyelin labeling (Fig. 7). A similar effect was observed when 10 μm wortmannin was used instead of PIK93. It is important to note that sphingomyelin synthesis was not completely blocked even though at these concentrations both inhibitors completely inhibit the PI4KIIIβ enzyme. Several yeast studies indicate a relationship between lipid transport and PI 4-kinases. The connection between the yeast PI/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, Sec14p, and PtdIns4P production is well established (13Hama H. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Takemoto J.Y. DeWald D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34294-34300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Bankaitis V.A. Malehorn D.E. Emr S.D. Greene R. J.

Traffic. 2005; 6: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), as is the importance of Stt4p in phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine conversion in extramitochondrial sites (32Voelker D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 396-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A recent synthetic lethality screen also identified genetic connections between the Stt4p PI4K and several effectors linked to sphingolipid metabolism (33Tabuchi M. Audhya A. Parsons A.B. Boone C. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 26: 5861-5875Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The presence of PH domains with specific recognition of PtdIns4P in proteins, such as the OSBP CERT and FAPP2, all of which have lipid transfer functions also places PtdIns4P and PI4Ks in the center of interest concerning lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we used the CERT-mediated transport of ceramide between the ER and Golgi to determine which of the four PI4Ks are important for this process because all four mammalian PI4Ks are localized to either the Golgi or ER (34Balla A. Balla T. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The present data, based on both pharmacological and genetic evidence, clearly suggest that PI4KIIIβ has a prominent role in facilitating ceramide transport between these organelles. Because the PH domain of CERT binds PtdIns4P and when expressed in isolation, it also localizes to the Golgi (6Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) it is feasible to assume that PI4KIIIβ regulates the release of ceramide from CERT and its transfer to the Golgi membrane. The selective inhibition of sphingo-myelin synthesis from [3H]serine-labeled ceramide by PI4KIIIβ inhibitors is also consistent with the need for PtdIns4P formation at the Golgi, because sphingomyelin is synthesized in the luminal side of the Golgi and it requires CERT for ceramide transfer from the ER (35Sigal Y.J. McDermott M.I. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As reported earlier (4Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), CERT is not required for the synthesis of GlcCer and indeed, we found only a slight effect of PI4KIIIβ inhibition on GlcCer labeling. The PI4K requirement of CERT-mediated ceramide transport, however, is also not absolute, as both the transport of FL-Cer to the Golgi and the incorporation of [3H]serine to sphingomyelin was only partially inhibited by PI4KIIIβ inhibitors. This could either mean that other PI4Ks can provide PtdIns4P for this process or alternatively, the process is only partially dependent on PtdIns4P production. We reported recently that Golgi localization of the PH domains of FAPP1 and OSBP depended on both PI4K type IIIβ and type IIα (20Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Given the similarity between the former PH domains and that of CERT, the role of PI4KIIα could have been expected. However, we could not demonstrate any involvement of either this or the type IIβ PI4K enzyme in this process in knockdown experiments. Similarly, no additivity was found between the effects of combined down-regulation or inhibition of the PI4Ks. The only effect of PI4KIIα depletion was a slightly reduced accumulation of FL-Cer in the Golgi, but the kinetic of the uptake was not different from that of control cells. A similar effect was also seen after the knockdown of PI4KIIIα, an enzyme primarily localized to the ER but also implicated in PtdIns4P production at the plasma membrane (20Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Whereas we cannot completely rule out that these other PI4Ks also contribute to the regulation of ceramide transport between the ER and the Golgi, their role, if any, is far less prominent than that of the PI4KIIIβ enzyme. The more potent inhibition of ceramide transport by the overexpressed OSBP and FAPP1 PH domains can be due to the ability of these PH domains to bind and sequester Arf1 in addition to binding PtdIns4P (6Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 36Godi A. Di Campi A. Konstantakopoulos A. Di Tullio G. Alessi D.R. Kular G.S. Daniele T. Marra P. Lucocq J.M. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), hence, interfering with the interaction of the CERT-PH domain with the Golgi more efficiently. Moreover, at this level of overexpression the PH domains already alter the Golgi structure (20Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Varnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Godi A. Di Campi A. Konstantakopoulos A. Di Tullio G. Alessi D.R. Kular G.S. Daniele T. Marra P. Lucocq J.M. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and this may also explain their more efficient disruption of the transport process. Altered Golgi morphology could also contribute to the smaller Golgi accumulation of FL-Cer in PI4KIIIβ-depleted cells, although we did not observe major alterations in Golgi morphology in such cells using immunostaining with gm130 antibody (not shown). The molecular details of how PtdIns4P could regulate the transport function of the CERT protein is not clear at present. However, there are several recent observations that could provide some clues to this process. Expression of the full-length CERT protein is localized to the Golgi only at low expression levels (37Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), whereas the isolated PH domain localizes to the Golgi even when expressed at higher levels (6Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). 5B. Toth and T. Balla, unpublished observations. These observations imply that the PH domain is at least partially masked within the CERT molecule and that the localization of the CERT molecule also requires additional molecules that are in limited amounts relative to the expressed CERT protein. A recent report identified OSBP as a protein that is required for the interaction of CERT with the ER-bound VAP-A protein (37Perry R.J. Ridgway N.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), thereby establishing a molecular link between the transport of cholesterol metabolites and ceramide. Because OSBP also has a PH domain that recognizes PtdIns4P, and the structure of the lipid binding domain of the yeast OSBP homologue, Kes1p, suggest that charged lipids could regulate its lipid binding (38Im Y.J. Raychaudhuri S. Prinz W.A. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2005; 437: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 39Raychaudhuri S. Im Y.J. Hurley J.H. Prinz W.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), the PI4K-mediated regulation of these transport processes deserves further attention. Last, this is the first report to use the recently identified inhibitor PIK93 to discriminate between the two forms of type III PI4Ks. This inhibitor, which still potently inhibits some of the PI3Ks, is quite effective against PI4KIIIβ at concentrations (200-300 nm) that do not inhibit the PI4KIIIα enzyme or the type II PI4Ks. The present study demonstrates that this inhibitor will be an extremely valuable tool to determine the multiple roles of PI4KIIIβ in the Golgi and perhaps in other cellular compartments. In summary, the present studies establish PI4KIIIβ as the key PI4K enzyme that contributes to the regulation of CERT-mediated transport of ceramide between the ER and Golgi. This finding further supports the central role of PI4KIIIβ in regulating Golgi functions, namely vesicular trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane as shown in both yeast and mammalian cells. It will be the task of future studies to determine whether the transport of ceramide to the Golgi and perhaps its conversion to sphingomyelin is part of the regulatory process also contributing to vesicle budding and fission.

The factors regulating these interactions are not known. We have used co-immunoprecipitation and co-clustering paradigms to show that both adhesion molecules can interact with the 3Ig IIIC isoform of the FGFR1 in a number of cell types. Interestingly, whereas the interaction can be seen over most of the cell surface, it is not seen at points of cell-cell contact where the adhesion molecules accumulate at stable junctions. We also demonstrate for the first time that all of the major isoforms of NCAM can interact with the FGFR. Using deletion mutagenesis we have found that the adhesion molecule/FGFR interaction can withstand the removal of most of any one of the FGFR immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D3). In contrast, the FGFR interaction with N-cadherin and NCAM (but not FGF) is absolutely dependant on the presence of the acid box motif that can be found in the linker region between D1 and D2. As this motif can be spliced out of all four FGFRs, it suggests that this is one mechanism that can regulate the interaction of the receptor with different ligand classes.

For example, in the nervous system they play roles in cell migration, axonal growth and guidance, and synapse formation (1Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 425-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Although initially thought to function by modulating adhesion between cells, it is now clear that some CAM functions require the activation of specific second messenger signaling cascades in cells. For example, there is now substantial evidence that the ability of NCAM, N-cadherin, and L1 to stimulate axonal growth is dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in neurons (2Doherty P. Ashton S.V. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 21-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence from studies on Drosophila suggests that a functional interaction between CAMs and the FGFR evolved perhaps 1 billion years ago (8Garcia-Alonso L. Romani S. Jimenez F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Forni J.J. Romani S. Doherty P. Tear G. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2004; 26: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, there now appears to be an emerging consensus that CAM interactions with the FGFR are not only important for neuronal function but also for contact dependent survival of some cell types (10Peluso J.J. Biol. Signals Recept. 2000; 9: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Erez N. Zamir E. Gour B.J. Blaschuk O.W. Geiger B. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the development or progression of some cancers (12Suyama K. Shapiro I. Guttman M. Hazan R.B. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 13Cavallaro U. Niedermeyer J. Fuxa M. Christofori G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 14Bottcher R.T. Niehrs C. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Divergent evolution has generated four functional gene products that constitute the FGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors, and these can interact with up to 23 fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) (15Itoh N. Ornitz D.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 563-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Responsiveness to these conventional ligands is determined in part by alternative splicing of the exons that encode the extracellular domains of the receptors (15Itoh N. Ornitz D.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 563-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the interplay between CAMs and FGFs in the context of FGFR signaling nor the factors that influence CAM interactions with the FGFRs. In some cancer cells, an interaction between N-cadherin and the FGFR1 appears to stabilize receptors on the cell surface and may thereby potentiate signaling by endogenous FGFs (12Suyama K. Shapiro I. Guttman M. Hazan R.B. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In other cancer cells an interaction between NCAM and the FGFR4 appears to orchestrate the formation of a higher order-signaling complex that can signal independently of the conventional ligands (13Cavallaro U. Niedermeyer J. Fuxa M. Christofori G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Likewise, in neurons CAMs appear to be able to act as surrogate ligands for the FGFR and signal via the receptors independently of FGFs (3Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 16Williams E.J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.D. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43879-43886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A better understanding of this relationship clearly requires more insights into the factors that influence the ability of CAMs to interact with the FGFRs. The extracellular domain of the FGFR can be composed of up to three distinct Ig-like domains (D1, D2, and D3) with an unusual stretch of acidic amino acids (the “acid box”) being present in the linker region between D1 and D2. Alternative splicing generates full-length FGFRs that differ in the second half of the membrane proximal D3 and/or shorter versions of the receptor that lack D1 and/or the acid box (17Green P.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The structures of FGF1/2 with the membrane proximal D2 and D3 domains of the FGFR1/2 have been solved, and this has allowed for a very detailed understanding of the nature of this class of ligand-receptor interface (18Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 19Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and rational design of novel peptide antagonists (16Williams E.J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.D. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43879-43886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). FGFs bind to an interface that is formed by the membrane proximal D2/D3 domains, as well as the linker region between the domains, in a manner that can explain why alternative spicing of the exons that encode D3 can determine ligand binding specificity. The structures of two distinct higher order receptor-ligand structures that also accommodate heparin have also been solved (20Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 21Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), with recent evidence suggesting that both might be biologically relevant (22Harmer N.J. Ilag L.L. Mulloy B. Pellegrini L. Robinson C.V. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Whereas there is a large body of evidence relating to FGF/FGFR interactions, very little is known about how CAMs interact with the FGFR. FGFRs contain an ∼20 amino acid motif within the D2 domain that shares sequence homology with functional motifs present in NCAM and N-cadherin (23Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This “CAM homology domain” (CHD) forms a contiguous sequence with the acid box and antibodies raised against the acid box or the CAM homology domain inhibit CAM stimulated neurite outgrowth (3Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Importantly, synthetic peptide mimetics of motifs from this region of the FGFR also inhibit the CAM responses (3Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This formed the basis for the suggestion that the CAMs might directly interact in cis with this region of the FGFR (23Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The membrane proximal D3 domain of the FGFR is essential for FGF binding but not required for N-cadherin binding (12Suyama K. Shapiro I. Guttman M. Hazan R.B. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The interaction of N-cadherin and the FGFR appears to involve a direct cis interaction between D1 and D2 domains of the receptor with an N-cadherin region that includes the fourth of the five cadherin domains (12Suyama K. Shapiro I. Guttman M. Hazan R.B. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 16Williams E.J. Williams G. Howell F.V. Skaper S.D. Walsh F.S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Likewise, surface plasmon resonance and NMR data have shown direct interactions between the FGFR1 D1 and D2 domains with the fibronectin type III domains of NCAM (25Kiselyov V.V. Skladchikova G. Hinsby A.M. Jensen P.H. Kulahin N. Soroka V. Pedersen N. Tsetlin V. Poulsen F.M. Berezin V. Bock E. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 691-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used co-immunoprecipitation and co-clustering assays to map sites on the 3Ig IIIc isoform of the FGFR1 that are required for an interaction with N-cadherin and all of the major isoforms of NCAM. Our results show that the FGFR1 will robustly interact with N-cadherin and all five of the major isoforms of NCAM, and this provides the first evidence that alternative splicing of NCAM does not directly influence its interaction with the FGFR1. In the context of the FGFR, our results demonstrate that whereas the CAM homology domain is dispensable for the CAM/FGFR interactions, the proximal acid box region is absolutely required. Interestingly, the acid box can be spliced out of the FGFR and is not required for FGF function (26Shimizu A. Tada K. Shukunami C. Hiraki Y. Kurokawa T. Magane N. Kurokawa-Seo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11031-11040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results show for the first time a positive requirement of the acid box for an FGFR function and substantiate the emerging view that CAMs can interact with regions of the receptor that are not involved in binding FGFs. Structures—The structure of the membrane proximal D2/D3 Ig like domains of the FGFR1/2 has been solved (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1cvs and 1fq9). The structure of the D1 Ig-like domain was defined by homology modeling with the Swiss-Model server using the telokin structure (1tlk) as a template. The structure of the linker domain between D1 and D2 has not been solved, and there are no structures for similar sequences in the public domain. However, a secondary structure prediction (with the 3D-pssm server) is that of a random coil. We modeled the linker region as a random coil and joined the three structures for the complete model. We make no inference on the relationship between D1 and D2/D3; this aspect of the model is for illustrative purposes only. Antibodies—The NCD2 monoclonal antibody (27Hatta K. Takeichi M. Nature. 1986; 320: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) specifically reacts with the ECD1 (EGFR extracellular domain 1) of chicken N-cadherin and was obtained from R&D. 3B9 (28Ordonez N.G. Hum. Pathol. 2003; 34: 749-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is an N-cadherin monoclonal antibody obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. ERIC 1 is a monoclonal antibody targeted against the second fibronectin domain of human NCAM (29Bourne S.P. Patel K. Walsh F. Popham C.J. Coakham H.B. Kemshead J.T. J. Neurooncol. 1991; 10: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A rabbit antibody (06-177) raised against the acid box containing region of FGFR (30Lee P.L. Johnson D.E. Cousens L.S. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 245: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. A rabbit antibody raised against the catalytic domain of the FGFR1 (FlgC-15) (31Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A polyclonal rabbit serum raised against a highly conserved peptide sequence from the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a kind gift from Prof. W. J. Gullick (University of Kent, Canterbury, UK). Goat anti-rat, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 were obtained from Molecular Probes. Anti-active and total MAPK antibodies were obtained from Promega and used according to manufacturer's instructions. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled horse anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Vector. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Expression constructs for the various isoforms of human NCAM and full-length chicken N-cadherin have been described previously (32Barton C.H. Dickson G. Gower H.J. Rowett L.H. Putt W. Elsom V. Moore S.E. Goridis C. Walsh F.S. Development (Camb.). 1988; 104: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Doherty P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Mann D.A. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). An epitope-tagged FGFR1 expression construct was obtained by cloning the 2.3-kb HindIII-XbaI cDNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of the 3Ig IIIc isoform of the mouse FGFR1 into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector using standard protocols (Invitrogen). A construct lacking the cytoplasmic domain of the FGFR (DN-FGFR1) was created by PCR from the FGFR1 plasmid, again using standard procedures. Likewise, constructs with substantial deletions within D1, D2, and D3 of the FGFR1 and the linker region between D1 and D2 were assembled with PCR-generated fragments and standard molecular cloning techniques. In brief, for each deletion construct, FGFR1 sequences were generated by PCR separately incorporating specific deletions, and then, using these PCR products as templates, a second-step PCR was performed to piece together individual fragments. The final PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His plasmid. Cell Lines and Cell Transfection—BT-549 breast carcinoma cells and L6 myoblasts were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Transfected NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing all of the major isoforms of human NCAM (34Doherty P. Barton C.H. Dickson G. Seaton P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Gower H.J. Walsh F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were routinely maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Transfected L6 cells that stably express the 3Ig IIIc isoform of the human FGFR1 (L6-FGFR; a kind gift from Dr Claesson-Welsh) (35Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and NIH 3T3 cells that stably express full-length chicken N-cadherin (the LK8 line) (33Doherty P. Rowett L.H. Moore S.E. Mann D.A. Walsh F.S. Neuron. 1991; 6: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) were maintained in selection medium (720 ng/ml G148 in 10% FCS-DMEM). Importantly, NIH 3T3 cells predominantly express full-length 3Ig forms of the FGFR1 and FGFR2 (36Doherty P. Moolenaar C.E. Ashton S.V. Michalides R.J. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1992; 356: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). L6 cells were transfected with 1 μg of the plasmid encoding the control or mutated versions of the 3Ig IIIc isoform of the mouse FGFR1 construct and/or 0.5-1 μg of the plasmid encoding the full-length chicken N-cadherin using a Lipofectamine-Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen). In some experiments the N-cadherin construct was transfected into the L6 cell line that stably expresses the 3Ig IIIC isoform of the human FGFR1. Transfected cells were allowed to recover in serum-containing medium overnight before being subcultured onto poly-l-lysine coated glass cover slips for microscopic analysis or standard tissue culture plates for co-immunoprecipitation studies. Post-natal day 3 mouse cerebellar neurons were isolated as previously described (36Doherty P. Moolenaar C.E. Ashton S.V. Michalides R.J. Walsh F.S. Nature. 1992; 356: 791-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 8 × 106 cells per well in individual wells of a 6-well culture dish and allowed to attach overnight at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—In general, transfected cells and control cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Extracts were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay. Cell lysates (0.5-1 mg) were incubated with FGFR antibodies (generally flg at 1 μg/ml, but in some experiments a combination of flg and 177) or N-cadherin antibody (NCD2 at 1 μg/ml) for 3-12 h at 4 °C with rotation. The immunocomplexes were captured with 10 mg of prewashed protein A-Sepharose (from Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. Precipitates were then washed three times with cold lysis buffer and re-suspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibody. The primary antibodies were subsequently detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugates (Vector) at a 1:3000 dilution. Bound antibodies were detected by adding chemiluminescence substrate solution (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to Kodak Bio-Max light film. Membrane Preparation for Western Blotting—Transfected L6 cells from a 10-cm tissue culture plate were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and re-suspended in 500 μl of Buffer STM (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors). All the procedures were carried out on ice or in a 4 °C centrifuge. The cells were homogenized (25 times) on ice and centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min to pellet the nuclei and attached membrane. The supernatant was kept (Smt1). The pellet was re-suspended in STM again and centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min, and this second supernatant was kept (Smt2). The pellet from Smt2 was re-suspended in STM Buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min to release the proteins from the membrane. The nuclei are kept intact in the pellet and are lysed in RIPA Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxicholate, 0.1% SDS) to obtain the nuclear fraction. Clustering Experiment—Cells were taken from semiconfluent dishes and grown overnight on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 25,000 cells/well in 10% FCS/DMEM. For clustering of N-cadherin or NCAM, the cultures were incubated with the NCD2 or ERIC monoclonal antibodies in 10% FCS/DMEM (dilution 1:400) for 30-60 min at 37 °C in tissue culture incubator, washed three times with culture media, and then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488 (for NCD2) or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (for ERIC), both at a 1:1000 dilution in 10% FCS/DMEM for a further 60 min at 37 °C. Cultures were fixed by initially adding an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS with 4% sucrose) to the culture medium for 5 min; this was then gently removed and replaced with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde solution and incubated for further 10 min. In some experiments cells were fixed prior to incubation with the N-cadherin and NCAM antibodies (non-clustered cells). Non-clustered cells were also incubated with NCD2 or ERIC. The cultures were washed three times with PBS and then blocked with 10% FCS/PBS for 30-60 min at room temperature. Non-clustered and clustered cells were then incubated with the rabbit anti-FGFR antibody (177) or the rabbit anti-EGFR antibody at a 1:400 dilution in 10% FCS/PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the cultures were finally incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 in 10% FCS/PBS (to detect the FGFR) for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing in PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and viewed on an inverted Zeiss microscope (Axiovert 135) with a 63× objective lens (Plan-Apochromat 63×/1,40). We would emphasize that we only detected positive immunoreactivity for the FGFR when both the primary and secondary antibodies were included, and we did not in any circumstance see “bleeding” from the green N-cadherin channel into the red FGFR channel. For example, evidence in support can be seen in Fig. 4 where saturable staining for N-cadherin is seen in the green channel in the absence of any corresponding staining in the red channel. Detection of Active MAPK (ERK1/2)—Parental or transfected L6 cells were starved in serum free media for 24 h. Cells were then treated with FGF2 (1 nm) for 5 min and aliquots of the cell lysates fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Active MAPK was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-active MAPK antibody (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions (1:5000 dilution) and a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) followed by chemiluminescent detection. N-Cadherin Co-immunoprecipitates with the FGFR from a Variety of Cell Types—Our initial objective was to determine whether N-cadherin interacts with the FGFR in a variety of cell types. As functional interactions between N-cadherin and the FGFR have been reported in breast cancer cells and neurons (see Introduction), we determined whether N-cadherin was present in the FGFR immunoprecipitate obtained from lysates from samples of both cell types. When lysates from the BT549 breast cancer cell line were subjected to a standard immunoprecipitation protocol with two independent FGFR antibodies, N-cadherin was found in both precipitates, with a more robust response being seen with these cells when the antibodies were used in combination (Fig. 1a). We observed a similar co-immunoprecipitation from post-natal day 3 cerebellar neurons that had been cultured overnight (Fig. 1b) and from a number of other cells and intact tissues (e.g. the chick retina; data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the interaction, and to be able to map interaction sites, we wanted to identify a cell type that did not express endogenous N-cadherin or the FGFR. We could not detect endogenous N-cadherin or FGFR in Western blots of lysates of the L6 muscle cell line that has previously been reported to be negative for FGFR expression (35Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In accord, we did not detect N-cadherin by Western blotting in FGFR immunoprecipitates from control L6 cell lysates or from L6 cells transfected with the FGFR or N-cadherin constructs on their own (Fig. 1c). However, when N-cadherin was transfected into an L6 cell line that stably expresses the transfected 3Ig IIIc isoform of the human FGFR1, N-cadherin was now found in the FGFR immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1c, final two lanes). Similar results were seen when N-cadherin and the 3Ig IIIc isoform of the mouse FGFR1 were transiently co-transfected into L6 cells (data not shown). As expression of both molecules is required to obtain the result, this controls for the specificity of the FGFR and N-cadherin antibodies. The FGFR Co-localizes with a Sub-pool of N-Cadherin in Cells but Is Excluded from Sites of Cell-Cell Contact—The FGFR and N-cadherin will co-immunoprecipitate from lysates from a variety of cell types; we wished to determine to what extent these molecules co-localize with each other in cells. We have previously reported low level “diffuse” staining of endogenous FGFR at the cell membrane, and this precludes meaningful co-localization studies (37Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, antibody-induced clustering of transfected N-cadherin in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (the same LK8 line used here) is associated with a co-clustering of the endogenous FGFR (37Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study we first asked if the 3Ig IIIc isoform of the human FGFR1 co-localizes with N-cadherin clusters in the L6 cell line that stably expresses this receptor. Following transient transfection of the N-cadherin construct, we observed extensive (but not absolute) colocalization of the FGFR1 and the clustered N-cadherin protein (e.g. Fig. 2, a-c). Similar results were found in parental L6 cells following transient co-transfection of the mouse 3Ig IIIc isoform of the FGFR1 with N-cadherin (Fig. 2, d-f). Similar findings were made with other cell types; for example in NIH 3T3 cells that stably express transfected N-cadherin (the LK8 cell line) the endogenous FGFR co-localizes with N-cadherin over most of the cell membrane (Fig. 2, g-i). However, we noted that the FGFR is excluded from the cell-cell junction that is enriched for N-cadherin in LK8 cells (see arrowhead in Fig. 2, g-i) and in transfected L6 cells (data not shown). This is an interesting observation that also acts as an important internal control as it demonstrates the specificity of the antibodies used for the staining. Additional control experiments for the specificity of the interaction were carried out. For example, LK8 cells express low levels of the EGFR that can be detected with a rabbit anti-serum ra"
https://openalex.org/W1972632823,"Serotonin transporter (SERT) catalyzes reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and is a target for antidepressant drugs and psychostimulants. It is a member of a large family of neurotransmitter and amino acid transporters. A recent study using site-directed cysteine modification identified a helical region of the transporter with high accessibility to the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the high resolution structure of LeuT, a prokaryotic homologue, showed that the residues corresponding to this helical region are part of the fifth transmembrane domain. The accessibility of these positions is now shown to depend on conformational changes corresponding to interconversion of SERT between two forms that face the extracellular medium and the cytoplasm, respectively. Binding of the extracellular inhibitor cocaine decreased accessibility at these positions, whereas 5-HT, the transported substrate, increased it. The effect of 5-HT required the simultaneous presence of Na+ and Cl-, which are transported into the cell together (symported) with 5-HT. In light of the LeuT structure, these results begin to define the pathway through which 5-HT diffuses between its binding site and the cytoplasm. They also confirm a prediction of the alternating access model for transport, namely, that all symported substrates must bind together before translocation.

Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters, Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 25-52Google Scholar). It is a member of the NSS or SLC6 family of sodium-coupled neurotransmitter and amino acid transporters, which also includes transporters for dopamine, norepinephrine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and glycine (2Chen N.H. Reith M.E. Quick M.W. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). SERT is a target for antidepressant drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and for psychostimulants such as cocaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (also known as ecstasy) (3Stahl S.M. J. Affect. Disord. 1998; 51: 215-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 4Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1817-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Antidepressants, cocaine and the high affinity cocaine analog 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT, or RTI-55) are competitive inhibitors of SERT-mediated 5-HT uptake and are likely to bind from the extracellular medium close to the 5-HT binding site on SERT (5Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wall S.C. Innis R.B. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 264-270PubMed Google Scholar). SERT couples the transport of one 5-HT molecule into the cell together with one Na+ and one Cl- ion and in exchange for one K+ ion in each catalytic cycle (8Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10084-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Talvenheimo J. Fishkes H. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6115-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rudnick G. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 1998; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). According to the alternating access model, a transporter contains a central binding site for substrates that is exposed alternately to either side of the membrane through conformational changes (11Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 12Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3701-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a corollary to the alternating access model, when a transporter couples the transmembrane movement of more than one substrate, the process requires, for maximum efficiency, that the conformational change occurs only when all substrates that are transported in the same direction (symport) are bound (13Stein W.D. Transport and Diffusion across Cell Membranes. Academic Press, Orlando1986: 397-404Google Scholar). When substrates are transported in opposite directions (antiport) efficient coupling requires that the conformational change occurs only when substrate is bound and not when the binding site is empty (14Jencks W.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1980; 51: 75-106PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stein W.D. book and Diffusion across Cell Membranes. Academic Press, Orlando1986: 306-315Google Scholar). Applied to SERT, these rules for efficient coupling suggest that extracellular 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- must all be bound before the transporter will undergo the conformational change that opens the permeation pathway connecting the binding site to the cytoplasm and that cytoplasmic K+ must bind before the cytoplasmic pathway closes and the extracellular pathway opens. It is unlikely that the substrate-permeation pathways are both open simultaneously, because that would create a channel that would rapidly dissipate any accumulated substrate. Thus, we expect that the cytoplasmic permeation pathway should close before the extracellular pathway opens, and vice versa. In 2003 we demonstrated that TnaT from Symbiobacter thermophilum, one of the many previously uncharacterized prokaryotic proteins homologous to SERT, was a functional amino acid transporter (16Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Goldberg N.R. Ueda K. Beppu T. Beckman M.L. Das S. Javitch J.A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Subsequently, another prokaryotic transporter from the NSS family, LeuT from Aquifex aeolicus, was crystallized (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure obtained from these crystals represents a major development in the understanding of this family of transporters. It allows us to interpret results from site-directed chemical modification studies within a structural context. Nevertheless, many aspects of transporter function, including conformational changes accompanying transport, are not apparent from the LeuT structure. A similar situation exists for other transport proteins, many of which have recently been crystallized (18Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

Only for those proteins, such as Ca2+ ATPase and lac permease, for which there is an abundance of biochemical data available has the structure been very informative as to transport mechanism. To address the conformational changes that SERT undergoes as a result of substrate and inhibitor binding, we have employed a strategy of site-directed chemical modification (26Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J.H. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Rudnick G. Quick M.W. book Transporters. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2002: 125-141Google Scholar), replacing endogenous SERT residues with cysteine and testing their reactivity toward methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents either in intact cells, where these reagents have access to the extracellular face of SERT, or in unsealed membrane preparations. In both cases, we have used, as a background construct, a SERT mutant (X5C) with five endogenous cysteine residues replaced by alanine or isoleucine (28Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we and others have identified many positions in SERT where the reactivity of an inserted cysteine is modulated by substrate or inhibitor binding. At some positions, this is apparently due to steric interaction (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 29Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but for most of the positions where ligand binding affects reactivity, the interaction is apparently allosteric (28Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Ghassemi F.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In some mutants, only substrates but not inhibitors affected the reactivity of the inserted cysteine, and the effect required the simultaneous presence of Na+ and Cl-. Because of the requirement for Na+ and Cl- in transport, we postulated that the conformational change requiring substrate, Na+, and Cl- led to conversion of SERT to a conformationally distinct intermediate in the transport cycle, but we had no evidence with which to assign that intermediate to a particular conformation. The work presented in this communication allows us to make a tentative assignment to the intermediate. We previously investigated the cytoplasmic accessibility of SERT in the region predicted to form an intracellular loop between transmembrane domain (TM) 4 and TM5 (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We found that cysteine residues substituted for Trp-271 through Ile-290 were accessible to 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) in membrane preparations from transfected cells, but not in those intact cells, indicating that those positions were accessible from the cytoplasm. In this region, six positions, 273, 274, 277, 280, 281, and 284, appeared to be much more accessible to reaction with MTSEA suggesting an α-helical conformation (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the high resolution structure of LeuT, the region corresponding to SERT 271-290 constitutes the cytoplasmic half of TM5 (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 35Beuming T. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Weinstein H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1630-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The more accessible residues are indicated in Fig. 1, which shows TM5 in the context of the overall structure of SERT as inferred from the LeuT structure. Because the structure of LeuT gives no hint about the cytoplasmic permeation pathway, we investigated the possibility that the accessible region identified in SERT TM5 contributes to this pathway. The previously identified cysteine mutants were found to vary in reactivity in response to substrates and inhibitors in a manner consistent with opening and closing of this permeation pathway. Expression of Rat SERTs—Construction of the rSERT cysteine mutants used here was described previously (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each mutant was subcloned into the X5C background construct (C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A), which is lacking all of the endogenous cysteine residues known to react with MTS reagents (28Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The expression system used has been described in detail elsewhere (36Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Analyt. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Binding Assay—Binding of the high affinity cocaine analogue β-CIT was measured in crude membrane preparations from transfected HeLa cells as described previously (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For membrane binding assays, frozen membranes from cells expressing rat SERT mutants were thawed on ice, applied to Multiscreen-FB 96-well filtration plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and washed five times by filtration with 100 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, or equimolar concentration of other salts as indicated). To measure the effect of ligands, the indicated concentrations of 5-HT or cocaine were added to the washed membranes and incubated for 10 min in binding buffer containing 150 mm of NaCl, NMDG chloride, or sodium isethionate, as indicated. MTSEA was subsequently added to the membranes, the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and the membranes were then washed five times to remove unbound MTSEA and ligand. β-CIT binding was then initiated by the addition of 100 μl of the standard binding buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 nm [125I]β-CIT (RTI-55, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The reaction was stopped by washing three times with 100 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. The filters were removed from the plate and counted with a Wallac MicroBeta plate counter in 150 μl of Optifluor (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (OriginLab, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve-fitting algorithm. The statistical analysis given was from multiple experiments. In the figures, data with error bars represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate measurements. Asterisks indicate significance at the p < 0.05 level in the paired Student's t tests. Previous results (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) indicated a reactive stripe of positions on one face of TM5 (Fig. 1). We chose SERT mutant S277C as a representative of residues on this highly reactive face and K279C as a representative of the relatively unreactive face. For each of these mutants, we measured the ability of substrates, inhibitors, and ions to influence the rate of reaction with MTSEA. In these experiments, we incubated membranes from cells expressing a given mutant with the indicated compliment of ions and ligands and MTSEA at a concentration expected to inactivate ∼50% in 15 min. At the end of this incubation, the membranes were washed free of MTSEA and ligands into binding buffer containing NaCl and [125I]β-CIT. Altered ionic conditions or ligand addition, therefore, was present only during the incubation with MTSEA and not during the binding measurement. The extent of MTSEA reaction was inferred, as previously shown (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), from the decrease in β-CIT binding to the membranes. In that work, we showed that β-CIT binding to mutants with a cysteine at positions 273-288 could be completely (>90%) inactivated by MTS reagents (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). K275C and K279C were not completely inactivated by MTSEA but were sensitive to (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), and the difference was shown to be incomplete reaction with MTSEA rather than residual activity in the MTSEA-modified protein (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These studies showed that S277C reacted with MTSEA over 100 times faster than does K279C (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, by using different concentrations of MTSEA, we were able to inactivate approximately half of the β-CIT binding activity in each case and to measure the effects of ligands on that reaction. In this and subsequent experiments, the activity remaining after MTSEA treatment is presented. In the absence of MTSEA, essentially 100% of activity remained. If a given treatment led to more activity than with MTSEA alone, this indicated protection, or decreased reactivity, and likewise a decrease in remaining activity indicated increased reactivity toward MTSEA. The results for substrate and inhibitor effects on K279C are shown in Fig. 2. Both 5-HT and cocaine decreased the reactivity of K279C protecting it from inactivation by MTSEA, although neither ligand completely protected against inactivation, even at the highest concentrations used. Protection was observed in the presence of NaCl and when either Na+ or Cl- was replaced (by NMDG or isethionate, respectively). However, the potency of 5-HT and cocaine was reduced when both Na+ and Cl- were present during inactivation relative to when either Na+ or Cl- was absent. The increase in IC50 was estimated to be 2- to 4-fold for 5-HT and >5-fold for cocaine. For S277C, the results were similar with cocaine but quite different with 5-HT. Cocaine decreased S277C reactivity toward MTSEA under all conditions, and the IC50 for this effect was 4- to 5-fold higher in the presence of both Na+ and Cl- (Fig. 3). For 5-HT, reactivity did not decrease under any conditions. In contrast, 5-HT rendered S277C more reactive toward MTSEA inactivation but only when both Na+ and Cl- were present. To confirm that the different extents of inactivation in the presence of cocaine and 5-HT were in fact due to different rates of reaction and not a qualitatively different effect of modification by MTSEA, we measured inactivation of β-CIT binding to S277C membranes as a function of MTSEA concentration. As shown in Table 1, the presence of 5-HT or cocaine decreased or increased, respectively, the MTSEA concentration required to inactivate half of the binding activity. Addition of 10 μm cocaine increased the MTSEA concentration required for halfmaximal inactivation by almost 3-fold, and 10 μm 5-HT decreased that concentration 4-fold. These ligands caused much smaller changes in the maximal extent of inactivation. The average extent was 91% for MTSEA alone, 85% in the presence of 5-HT, and 93% in the presence of cocaine. These results are consistent with changes in the reactivity of S277C in response to 5-HT and cocaine and argue against alternative possibilities, for example, that MTSEA completely modifies this mutant in the presence of cocaine without completely blocking β-CIT binding.TABLE 1Effect of 5-HT and cocaine on the rate and extent of MTSEA inactivation of S277CTreatmentIC50 for MTSEAInactivationμm%MTSEA alone0.107 ± 0.05491 ± 3+ 10 μm 5-HT0.025 ± 0.01485 ± 4+ 10 μm cocaine0.308 ± 0.18693 ± 9 Open table in a new tab We previously showed that MTSEA was able to inactivate binding to the TM5 cysteine mutants only in membrane preparations and not in intact cells (34Zhang Y.W.

To confirm that 5-HT and cocaine do not alter the sidedness of MTSEA reactivity, we tested the ability of extracellular MTSEA to inhibit 5-HT transport and β-CIT binding in intact cells expressing S277C. Using 1mm MTSEA, which inactivated S277C >80% in membrane preparations within 15 min, we observed no inhibition of either transport or binding either in the presence or absence of 10 μm 5-HT or cocaine (Table 2).TABLE 2Insensitivity of SERT mutants to inactivation by MTSEA in intact cellsMutantBindingTransportMTSEA+ 10 μm 5-HT+ 10 μm cocaineMTSEA+ 10 μm 5-HT+ 10 μm cocaineX5C93 ± 393 ± 497 ± 594 ± 292 ± 694 ± 7S277C93 ± 490 ± 594 ± 495 ± 490 ± 288 ± 2K279C98 ± 399 ± 598 ± 791 ± 793 ± 588 ± 6 Open table in a new tab The effects of 5-HT and cocaine on MTSEA reactivity were not limited to these two mutants. Fig. 4 shows a summary of inactivation measurements with mutants containing cysteine at positions on the less reactive faces of TM5. Some of these mutants, such as K275C and T276C, were very insensitive to MTSEA, but for most of the others, significant inactivation was observed in the absence of 5-HT or cocaine (white bars). When present during the incubation with MTSEA, both 5-HT and cocaine, at 10 μm, significantly decreased the reactivity of K272C and W282C like they did for K279C as shown in Fig. 2. V283C, A285C, and T286C were also protected by both ligands under conditions where Na+ or Cl- was absent, but 5-HT failed to protect V283C and A285C in the presence of NaCl, and T286C was resistant to inactivation in NaCl. The results show that 5-HT did not increase the reactivity of any residues on the less reactive face of TM5. In contrast, 5-HT increased the reactivity (as indicated by the greater extent of inactivation) of many positions on the reactive face of TM5 (Fig. 5). Significantly, this increase required the concomitant presence of both Na+ and Cl-. Fig. 5 shows that G273C, V274C, V280C, and V281C, like S277C, were inactivated to a greater extent when 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- were present during the MTSEA incubation (lower panel). 5-HT had little effect on these residues in the absence of Na+ (upper panel) or Cl- (middle panel). In contrast, for all these mutants and for all conditions tested, cocaine decreased their reactivity toward MTSEA, protecting them from inactivation (Fig. 5). T284C (closest of the reactive residues to the substrate binding site, Fig. 1) was unique among the tested residues in TM5, because it was protected by 5-HT in the absence of Na+ or Cl- but was unaffected by 5-HT in NaCl. In addition to Na+, Cl-, and 5-HT, SERT also transports K+ as part of the translocation cycle (8Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10084-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Rudnick G. Nelson P.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4739-4742Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of K+ on the accessibility of TM5, we measured the ability of MTSEA to inactivate TM5 cysteine mutants in the presence of various monovalent cations. In addition to Na+ and K+, we also tested the influence of Li+, which was previously shown to influence conformational changes and ligand binding in SERT (38Ni Y.G. Chen J.G. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Huang C.J. Moczydlowski E. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30942-30947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the effect of increasing concentrations of Na+, K+, and Li+ on inactivation of β-CIT binding by SERT K279C. NMDG-Cl was present to maintain isotonicity. As shown in Fig. 6, Na+ had no discernable effect on the inactivation, but both K+ and Li+ dramatically increased the MTSEA reactivity toward K279C in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of K+ on reactivity was most obvious for residues closer to the cytoplasmic end of TM5. Fig. 7 shows that cysteine mutants K272C through K279C all showed increased reactivity in the presence of 150 mm K+ (upper panel) while V280C through T284C were not significantly affected (lower panel). Unlike K+, Li+ increased the reactivity of all tested TM5 cysteine mutants. For both cations, there was no apparent difference between positions on the more or less reactive face of TM5. The results presented here support the proposal that the cytoplasmic permeation pathway of SERT, through which 5-HT, Na+, Cl-, and K+ pass in transit between their binding sites and the cytoplasm, is composed, in part, by TM5. According to this proposal, and consistent with our results, this pathway is open to the cytoplasm in one of two mutually exclusive conformations of SERT, and closed in a second conformation, which is able to bind extracellular inhibitors such as cocaine. Our results also illustrate one consequence of the alternating access model for transport, which is that interconversion between these two conformations should occur when the binding sites for 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- all are occupied. Previous work from our laboratory had assigned residues from Trp-271 through Ile-290 to the second intracellular loop because of their accessibility to MTSEA in membrane preparations but not in intact cells (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues in the subsequently published high resolution structure of LeuT indicated that this region comprised the cytoplasmic half of TM5 (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In that structure, many positions were not solvent-accessible, especially residues corresponding to those we found highly reactive in SERT. The results presented here suggest that TM5 was reactive because it contributes to the cytoplasmic substrate-permeation pathway, which is closed in the LeuT structure but presumably open in other conformations of LeuT and SERT. The accessible region found in SERT extended past Pro-288. The corresponding residue in LeuT is Leu-202, which is within 6Å of one of the Na+ ions bound near leucine in the LeuT structure. The cytoplasmically accessible region of TM5, therefore, is sufficiently long to span the distance from the cytoplasm to the binding site. The most interesting of our results is that 5-HT and cocaine had opposite effects on accessibility in the putative TM5 permeation pathway. The reactivity of cysteine residues on the highly reactive face of TM5 (at positions 273, 274, 277, 280, and 281) was decreased by the presence of cocaine during incubation with MTSEA. 5-HT, however, increased MTSEA reactivity toward the same residues (Figs. 3 and 5). We interpret this difference as being due to the ability of 5-HT and not cocaine to act as a substrate for SERT. As a non-transported competitive inhibitor that acts from outside the cell, cocaine is expected to bind to, and stabilize, the form of SERT in which the substrate binding site is facing the extracellular medium, thereby preventing the cytoplasmic pathway from opening and reacting with MTSEA. Conversely, MTSEA modification of a cysteine in the cytoplasmic pathway is expected to trap SERT in the cytoplasmic form in which the extracellular pathway, where cocaine and β-CIT bind, is closed. This provides an explanation for the fact that MTSEA, acting from the cytoplasmic face of SERT, inhibits β-CIT binding to an extracellular site. In contrast to cocaine, 5-HT is expected to allow interconversion of SERT to the cytoplasmic form, from which substrates are released. Because this release of 5-HT requires opening of the cytoplasmic permeation pathway, it is expected that, as 5-HT is transported to the cytoplasm, residues lining that pathway will be more accessible to reagents approaching from the cytoplasmic face of the protein. These conclusions are based on an assumption that the effects of 5-HT and cocaine are allosteric and that these ligands do not influence SERT mutants by a direct interaction with the site of MTSEA reactivity. For 5-HT, the effect on reactivity requires both Na+ and Cl-, although it was shown that neither ion is required for 5-HT binding (5Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, 5-HT can bind in the absence of Na+ or Cl- without affecting the reactivity of TM5 cysteine residues. Furthermore, because 5-HT increased, rather than decreased, the reactivity of cysteines that we believe are in the permeation pathway, it is unlikely that the 5-HT binding site overlaps the positions that react with MTSEA. It is also likely that the effect of cocaine is allosteric. Cocaine acted from the outside of the cell to inhibit 5-HT uptake, whereas extracellular MTSEA did not appreciably react with these TM5 cysteine mutants in intact cells but only in membrane preparations (34Zhang Y.W. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30807-30813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Table 2). Finally, these two ligands affect the reactivity of cysteines at positions from 273 to 281, and it is unlikely that both the 5-HT and cocaine binding sites extend over this 15-Å region. From all these considerations, it is likely that 5-HT and cocaine acted allosterically to increase or decrease, respectively, MTSEA reactivity with these TM5 cysteine residues. Our results provide evidence for other conformational changes in addition to the interconversion of SERT between extracellular and cytoplasmic forms. Figs. 2 and 3 show that cocaine and 5-HT potency were decreased when both Na+ and Cl- ions were present (compare the lower NaCl panels to the top and middle panels). This change in affinity presumably reflects conformational changes that precede 5-HT binding and interconversion from extracellular to cytoplasmic forms of SERT. Yet another conformational change may be responsible for 5-HT decreasing the MTSEA reactivity of TM5 mutants that face away from the putative permeation pathway (Figs. 2 and 4). It should be noted that these residues are relatively unreactive even in the absence of ligands, and any small conformational changes that decrease the accessibility of this region even slightly are likely to produce a large further decrease in reactivity. In the alternating access model of transport, substrates that are transported together (such as 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- in the case of SERT) are expected to bind together before the protein can convert between extracellular to cytoplasmic forms. To prevent uncoupled flux, this conversion should not occur if one or more of the substrates are missing. To our knowledge, the requirement that all substrates be bound before conformational reorientation of the transporter has never before been demonstrated. Our observation (Figs. 3 and 5) that both Na+ and Cl- must be present for the 5-HT-dependent increase in reactivity of TM5 residues may be the first example linking the conformational transition to the requirement for binding of all symported substrates. It is important to note that Na+ and Cl- are not required for 5-HT binding, because 5-HT was shown to bind in the absence of Na+ or Cl- (28Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protective effects of cocaine and 5-HT were seen in the absence of Na+ or Cl- (Figs. 2 and 4). In studies of the reactivity of cysteine residues inserted into extracellular loops 1 and 4, we have observed indications of conformational change in SERT that depended on the presence of 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- (28Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Mitchell S.M. Lee E. Garcia M.L. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but in the absence of the present findings and the LeuT structure, the nature of the conformational change was not apparent. It is likely that the previously observed reactivity changes that required 5-HT, Na+, and Cl- all are due to the same conformational change revealed here by exposure of the TM5 residues. The influences of K+ and Li+ (Figs. 6 and 7) are apparently due to additional conformational changes. Both cations significantly increased the reactivity of TM5 cysteine mutants, although the effect of K+ was restricted to the cytoplasmic end of the accessible region. Li+ was previously shown to affect reactivity in extracellular loop (EL) 1 (38Ni Y.G. Chen J.G. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Huang C.J. Moczydlowski E. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30942-30947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and both effects of Li+ may result from its ability to act as a chaotropic ion. The effect of K+, detectable at concentrations as low as 20-50 mm, suggests a more specific influence on SERT conformation, which is different from that of 5-HT or cocaine. K+ antiport is part of the SERT reaction cycle, and Li+ does not replace K+ in this step (8Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10084-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that a distinct conformation mediates the K+-dependent conversion of SERT to the extracellular form. From the increased reactivity at positions 272-279, we can surmise that the cytoplasmic end of TM5 increased its conformational flexibility in the presence of K+. The structure of LeuT indicated an internal structural repeat in which TMs 1-5 corresponded to TMs 6-10 but with an inverted topology (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Thus, the extracellular half of TM10 corresponds to the cytoplasmic half of TM5. We previously found that cysteines at positions from Gly-484 through Pro-499 reacted with the impermeant reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) (39Keller P.C. Stephan 2nd, M. Glomska H. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8510-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These residues correspond to Asn-397 through Ile-410 of LeuT, which constitute the short EL5 loop and about half of the TM10 helix (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The LeuT structure has been described as a “shot glass” where the cavity in the glass reaches almost to the bound substrate molecule (17Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Lining the walls of the cavity are TMs 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10. In particular, the region of TM10 corresponding to the exposed residues in SERT continues past the bottom of the cavity and passes within ∼7 Å of the bound substrate. Thus, the exposed region of TM10, like that of TM5, is long enough to span the distance from the binding site to the outside surface of the protein. If the extracellular half of TM10 fulfills a role similar to that of the cytoplasmic half of TM5, the compact conformation of the cytoplasmic half of LeuT in the crystal structure (likely similar to the extracellular form) might be a model for the extracellular half of SERT in the cytoplasmic form. Some evidence supporting this idea comes from studies with TM1 and EL4 of SERT. Cysteines at positions from 403, 404, 407, and 409 in EL4 were less reactive toward MTSET in the presence of 5-HT, and this protection required both Na+ and Cl- as did the 5-HT effect in TM5 (33Mitchell S.M. Lee E. Garcia M.L. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A cysteine at position 107 in TM1 was more reactive toward MTSET in the presence of cocaine and less reactive in the presence of 5-HT (30Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This is exactly opposite to what we found with TM5 (Figs. 3 and 5), but it is consistent with the idea that the inner permeation pathway opens when the outer pathway closes. Likewise, the relatively open conformation of the extracellular face of LeuT may serve as a model for the cytoplasmic face of SERT in the cytoplasmic form. The reactive residues in TM5 face TMs 1, 6, and 8, and it is possible that, in addition to TM5, the cytoplasmic permeation pathway is formed by these helices. In this context, it is interesting that residues in the cytoplasmic portions of TMs 1 and 6 were recently shown to become more accessible in the presence of substrate in the related Tyt1 tyrosine transporter from Fusobacterium nucleatum (40Quick M.

We present evidence that Nse4 is the kleisin component of the complex, which bridges the heads of Smc5 and -6. The C-terminal part of Nse4 interacts with the head domain of Smc5, and structural predictions for Nse4 proteins suggest similar motifs that are shared within the kleisin family. Specific mutations within a predicted winged helix motif of Nse4 destroy the interaction with Smc5. We propose that Nse4 and its orthologs form the delta-kleisin subfamily. We further show that Nse3, as well as Nse5 and Nse6, also bridge the heads of Smc5 and -6. The Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 and Nse5-Nse6 subcomplexes bind to the Smc5-Smc6 heads domain at different sites."

Mice expressing an exonuclease deficient form of Pol γ exhibit a 3-5-fold increase in the level of point mutations. This increase in mitochondrial DNA mutation is associated with the onset of age-related phenotypes including hair loss, subcutaneous fat loss, weight loss, curvature of the spine, reduced fertility, enlargement of the heart, osteoporosis, and anemia (20Trifunovic A.

To date there has been no exhaustive study of the fidelity of Pol γ, examining the incorporation kinetics of all 16 possible base pairs. Steady-state experiments have suggested that the majority of errors made by Pol γ are substitution errors and those caused by the incorporation of dNTPs opposite bases that are not their Watson-Crick base pairing partners (21Longley M.J.

A study using another Pol A family enzyme, the Klenow fragment of DNA Pol I, showed that of all of the 12 possible incorrect pairings, a dGTP incorporated onto a template dTMP was the most common mutation (22Minnick D.T. Liu L. Grindley N.D. Kunkel T.A. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additionally, single nucleotide incorporation assays showed that the fidelity of Klenow fragment manifests from a ∼25-fold increase in the Kd for ground state binding and an ∼3000-fold decrease in the rate of incorporation on the average. For dGTP onto a dTMP, the Kd increase is ∼5-fold, and the rate decrease is but ∼900-fold. The authors suggest that the differences in kinetic data between dGTP: dTMP and dTTP:dGMP misincorporations may be due to the geometric asymmetry of the purine-pyrimidine mispairs relative to normal Watson-Crick base pairs. This report expands upon previous work from this laboratory (23Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) detailing the kinetic parameters governing the fidelity of human Pol γ polymerization under single turnover conditions utilizing a defined primer-template system. Pol γ is thought to be a heterotrimer (24Carrodeguas J.A. Theis K. Bogenhagen D.F. Kisker C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) consisting of a single catalytic subunit (140 kDa) and two accessory subunits (54 kDa) with no known catalytic activity. Because both subunits are nucleus-encoded and transported to the mitochondria, the genes of the recombinant proteins were truncated to mimic the removal of the mitochondrial import leader sequences (25Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The catalytic and accessory subunits were combined in a 1:5 molar ratio needed to saturate the binding to reconstitute the holoenzyme. To probe the fidelity of human Pol γ, we challenged an exonuclease deficient mutant (E200A) with incorrect dNTPs and measured the kinetic parameters of mismatch polymerization. In the accompanying paper we examine the kinetics of incorporation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine triphosphate, a common oxidative metabolite of dGTP (27Hanes J.W. Thal D.M. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36241-36248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Enzyme Subunits—Expression and purification of Pol γA and Pol γB were accomplished as previously described (25Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Graves S.W. Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6050-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The expression, purification, and characterization of an exonuclease-deficient mutant of Pol γΑ has been previously reported (23Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be identical to the wild type enzyme. Experiments to assess the polymerization fidelity were performed as described previously (23Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) using the reconstituted holoenzyme, consisting of a catalytic subunit containing a 29-amino acid truncation and an accessory subunit containing a His6 tag and a 56-amino acid terminal truncation. Protein concentrations were determined by active site titration against a known concentration of duplex DNA (25Johnson A.A. Tsai Y. Graves S.W. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A 1:5 ratio of catalytic subunit to accessory subunit was used for holoenzyme reconstitution based upon a measured Kd of 35 nm and a typical enzyme concentration of 50-100 nm. Preparation of DNA-DNA Substrate—Primer strands were 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase as per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Termination of the reaction was accomplished by heating the reaction to 95 °C for 5 min. Excess 32P-labeled nucleotide was removed using a Biospin 6 column (Bio-Rad). Primer-template annealing was accomplished by mixing equimolar ratios of 25-mer primer and 45-mer template, heating the mixture to 95 °C, and allowing it to cool slowly to room temperature. The sequences of primer-template substrates used are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1DNA primer/template sequences used to examine incorporation5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTAGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGACAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG5′-TCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA3′-AGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTCGGAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG Open table in a new tab Assay Conditions—Assays were performed at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. The catalytic holoenzyme-DNA complex was assembled in a MgCl2-free buffer, then mixed with the appropriate nucleotide, previously diluted into a MgCl2 containing buffer, at a 1:1 ratio to initiate the reaction. Because mixing of the enzyme-DNA with the nucleotide is at a 1:1 ratio, each solution is assembled at twice the reported final concentration. Product Analysis—Products were separated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels, imaged on a storm 860, and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Kd and Maximum Rate of Polymerization for Incorrect Nucleotide Incorporation—To examine the effects of nucleotide concentration upon the rate of polymerization, single nucleotide incorporation experiments were performed. Because it was expected that the rates of incorporation of incorrect nucleotides would be slower than the rate of dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA substrate and to eliminate the complications associated with multiple turnovers of the enzyme, these assays were carried out under single turnover conditions, with enzyme in slight excess over DNA. Reactions were generally carried out from 0 to 30 min, and the time course of product formation was fit to a single exponential ([product] = A × e-kt + C). Rates of polymerization determined from the single exponential were plotted against nucleotide concentration and fit to a hyperbola (observed rate = kpol × [dNTP]/(Kd + [dNTP])) to determine the dissociation constant, Kd, and the maximum rate of polymerization, kpol, for each incorrect nucleotide. A Note on Terminology—Throughout the paper we will use the shorthand notation for a base pair as dGTP:dC, for example, where dGTP is the incoming nucleoside triphosphate, and dC is the template base. Exonuclease-deficient Pol γ was used for these misincorporation experiments because neither creation of a mismatch nor extension beyond a mismatch have been observed in the presence of exonuclease function (23Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 28Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, because the rate of polymerization is as slow or slower than the rate of dissociation of the holoenzyme from the DNA substrate and to minimize the complication due to multiple enzyme turnovers, experiments were conducted with enzyme in excess over DNA. Under these conditions we examine the kinetics of a single turnover. We investigated the incorrect incorporation of nucleotides onto templates containing a dCMP, dGMP, or dAMP at the position of incorporation. Previous studies have reported the correct incorporation kinetic parameters of all four nucleotides and for incorrect incorporation opposite a template dTMP (23Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Additionally, this same work showed that single nucleotide incorporation assays accurately reflect the kinetics of polymerization under conditions of multiple incorporations. Fig. 1 illustrates representative data defining the kinetics of formation of an A:A mismatch. The rates were determined by fitting to a single exponential function defining the formation of product versus time. The rates were then plotted against the nucleotide concentration and fit to a hyperbola to yield a Kd of 25 ± 7 and a kpol of 0.0036 ± 0.0003. Kinetic parameters for the incorporation of all 16 correct and incorrect nucleotide base pairs are summarized in Table 2.

These data provide estimates of the specificity constant for each base pair combination as the ratio kpol/Kd. Nucleotide discrimination is then defined by the ratio D = (kpol/Kd)correct/(kpol/Kd)incorrect. The probability of a misincorporation can then be computed by 1/(D + 1) when competing nucleotides are at the same concentration. Based upon evidence favoring a rapid equilibrium of nucleotide binding, Kd and kpol measured in single turnover experiments define Km and kcat, respectively, and thus, define the specificity constant, kcat/Km. In this context we consider the theoretical values for kcat and Km assuming these parameters could be measured accurately during steady-state processive synthesis and ignoring practical problems precluding accurate measurements in the steady state as discussed below. The equality Kd = Km has been shown to be approximately correct because nucleotide ground state binding appears to be in rapid equilibrium (30Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 31Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Evidence supporting rapid equilibrium of the ground state for human Pol γ has been reported previously based largely upon lack of evidence to the contrary (23Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38090-38096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The maximum rate of polymerization at saturating nucleotide, kpol, defines a parameter equating to kcat for processive synthesis. For the past decade it has been debated whether the chemistry step or a conformational change limits kpol, and further studies on Pol γ will be required to establish whether a nucleotide-induced conformational change limits the rate of nucleotide incorporation. However, recent evidence on T7 DNA polymerase has indicated that it does not matter which step is rate-limiting. Rather, the reverse of the conformational change step determines specificity in that a good substrate is committed to continued forward reaction by the slow release of tightly bound nucleotide (31Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In contrast, a bad substrate dissociates from the enzyme faster than it is incorporated. Although we do not yet know whether a conformational change step contributes to selectivity by Pol γ, the more detailed analysis afforded in studies using T7 DNA polymerase justify the use of kpol/Kd to measure kcat/Km most accurately. Pol γ and T7 DNA polymerase are both Pol A family enzymes and share significant sequence conservation near the active sites. The specificity constant (kcat/Km) represents the limiting slope of the concentration dependence of the rate of incorporation at low substrate concentration. As such, it has been argued that one could measure kcat/Km under steady-state conditions even though the rate of polymerization is limited by DNA release (32Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, the concentration dependence of the rate of steady-state single nucleotide incorporation should, theoretically, give a measure of specificity even though this rate is limited by the rate of DNA dissociation (21Longley M.J. Nguyen D. Kunkel T.A. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38555-38562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). However, given that the average kcat/Km for correct incorporation by Pol γ is 46 s-1 μm-1 and the rate of DNA dissociation is 0.02 s-1, then the expected apparent Km is 0.4 nm for steady-state single nucleotide incorporation. Concentrations of nucleotides required to accurately measure kcat/Km using steady-state methods are too low to generate a signal in the assay, and this could explain the aberrant results reported using steady-state methods (33Lim S.E. Copeland W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23616-23623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Inspection of Fig. 2 reveals several observations. Although the results may reflect sequence context effects for the particular oligonucleotides chosen for this study, some of the trends appear to be more generally applicable. As a general rule, purine-pyrimidine base pairs are favored over purine-purine and pyrimidine-pyrimidine base pairs. This observation supports the notion that the overall size of the base pair is an important determinant (34Kim T.W. Brieba L.G. Ellenberger T. Kool E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2289-2295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). With the possible exception of dGTP:dA, incorporations onto dT and dG appear to be favored over dC and dA, within a base pair subgroup (Pur-Pyr, Pur-Pur, etc). Rates of incorporation disfavor identical base pairings over all others, whereas ground state binding disfavors nonidentical purine-purine/pyrimidine-pyrimidine base pairs. However, the differences in specificity constants and discrimination observed when comparing mismatches to each other are small compared with the much greater differences observed comparing correct incorporations and mismatches to each other as groups. The largest difference in specificities observed is 800-fold when comparing mismatch to mismatch (dGTP:dT compared with dCTP:dC). Ignoring dGTP:dT, the difference is 40-fold. The smallest difference in specificities, comparing mismatch to correct, is 2400-fold (dGTP:dT and dTTP:dA). Discrimination against misincorporation results from weaker ground state binding and slower rates catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase, human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase, and rat polymerase β (35Wong I. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 526-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 36Werneburg B.G. Ahn J. Zhong X.J. Hondal R.J. Kraynov V.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to Kd and kpol values reported here and previously, exo- human Pol γ also exhibits weaker ground state binding and decreased rates of polymerization for mismatched nucleotides. A C:C mispair was formed at the slowest rate, whereas the weak binding of dGTP provided selection against the formation of a G:A mispair. G:T mispairs have been observed to be relatively easily formed by other polymerases (37Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ahn J. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and human Pol γ is no exception. Although T:T and G:T mispairings both have similarly tight dissociation constants (57 and 71 μm, respectively), Pol γ catalyzes the incorporation of dGTP opposite a template dTMP 90-fold faster than it does a dTTP opposite a template dTMP. It is thought that aberrant base pair geometry slows the incorporation rate, whereas base pair hydrogen bonding contributes to selectivity in ground state binding (39Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Although T:T and G:T mispairs both show similar and relatively tight ground state binding and presumably similar base pair hydrogen bonding, only the G:T mispair appears to maintain sufficiently normal base pair geometry to afford rapid incorporation subsequent to binding of the incoming nucleotide. Recently, a structural study of thermophilic Bacillus DNA polymerase I fragment, BF, complexed to terminally mispaired DNA strands showed that T:T mispairings do not alter the enzyme conformation; however, the incoming nucleotide is shifted into the major groove somewhat, thus breaking a hydrogen bond formed between the 3′ hydroxyl and an active site residue, Asp-830, corresponding to Asp-1135 in Pol γ and disrupting catalytic site assembly (40Johnson S.J. Beese L.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The study also showed that although this enzyme adopts a distorted open conformation when bound to a G:T terminally mispaired DNA substrate, the G:T pair adopts a conformation similar to the cognate base pairing and that the 3′ hydroxyl placement for catalysis remains nearly intact. Perhaps more interesting than the comparison of T:T and G:T mispairs is the comparison of a G:T to a T:G mispairing. Our data suggest that base pair hydrogen bonding of the T:G mispair does not stabilize it to the same degree as for the G:T mispair (∼3-fold higher Kd) and that the base pair geometry is more perturbed in the case of T:G than it is for G:T (∼7-fold slower kpol). Data from the BF structural study (40Johnson S.J. Beese L.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 803-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) indicates that although the enzyme adopts a similar open conformation, a BF-DNA contact is disrupted in the T:G mispair structure and that an interaction between the primer 3′ hydroxyl and an active site residue (Asp-830) is at least partially disrupted. No crystal structure is available for human Pol γ as yet, but the kinetic parameters presented here suggest that binding of Pol γ to terminally mispaired DNA substrates may be similar to that observed with BF. Nucleotide discrimination can be calculated by dividing the specificity constant for correct nucleotide binding by the constant for incorrect binding (Fig. 2D). For example, the specificity constant for T:A incorporation is 41.7 s-1 μm-1, and the specificity constant for A:A misincorporation is 7.6 × 10-5 s-1 μm-1 resulting in a discrimination value of 550,000. We have previously calculated and reported an average fidelity of Pol γ polymerization to be 1 error in 280,000 base pairs catalyzed. The studies presented in this paper allow us to calculate a more complete average fidelity of polymerization of 1 error in 440,000 bases incorporated. Pre-steady-state kinetic studies of exonuclease activity have defined the exonuclease proofreading contribution to fidelity of Pol γ as a 4-200-fold increase (28Johnson A.A. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38097-38107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Combining the fidelity contributions from polymerization and exonuclease proofreading allows us to refine the previously reported overall fidelity of 1 error in 1.1-20 × 106 to a new overall fidelity of 1 error in 1.8 × 106-3.6 × 107 bases incorporated. Fidelity of nucleotide incorporation by a DNA polymerase is a complex phenomenon created by a host of interactions including, but not limited to Watson-Crick interactions, base stacking, nearest neighbor interactions, and enzyme-substrate contacts within the active site of the polymerase. Experiments in aqueous solution have shown a trend in base stacking interactions, where deoxyguanosine stacks most strongly followed by deoxyadenosine, deoxycytosine, and deoxythymidine in order (41Petruska J. Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that due to the exclusion of water in the active site of DNA polymerases, base stacking interactions are stronger than would otherwise be expected (41Petruska J. Sowers L.C. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 42Petruska J. Goodman M.F. Boosalis M.S. Sowers L.C. Cheong C. Tinoco I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In the experiments that are presented in this paper, only a single DNA primer was employed to investigate the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation. Because only deoxyadenosine was tested as the base directly 5′ of the position of incorporation, the results presented here may be biased. However, because only one primer sequence was employed, the data are more easily compared directly, as primer sequence is removed as a possible source of variability. It has been previously shown with T4 DNA polymerase that replication fidelity is highest when either deoxyguanosine or deoxyadenosine are present in the primer directly 5′ of the site of incorporation (43Pless R.C. Bessman M.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4905-4915Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although experiments to determine the effects of nearest neighbors on discrimination have not been carried out with Pol γ, data from T4 DNA polymerase suggest that the overall discrimination that we have calculated for Pol γ may be a high estimate. Further experimentation employing primers and templates differing in sequence from those used previously should allow for further refinement of the estimate of nucleotide discrimination by human mitochondrial DNA Pol γ without ambiguity or bias."

https://openalex.org/W2049614330,"The RING finger ubiquitin ligase Siah2 controls the stability of various substrates involved in stress and hypoxia responses, including the PHD3, which controls the stability of HIF-1α. In the present study we determined the role of Siah2 phosphorylation in the regulation of its activity toward PHD3. We show that Siah2 is subject to phosphorylation by p38 MAPK, which increases Siah2-mediated degradation of PHD3. Consistent with these findings, MKK3/MKK6 double-deficient cells, which cannot activate p38 kinases, exhibit impaired Siah2-dependent degradation of PHD3. Phosphopeptide mapping identified T24 and S29 as the primary phospho-acceptor sites. Phospho-mutant forms of Siah2 (S29A or T24A/S29A) exhibit impaired degradation of PHD3, particularly after hypoxia. Conversely, a phospho-mimic form of Siah2 (T24E/S29D) exhibits stronger degradation of PHD3, compared with wild type Siah2. Whereas phospho-mutant Siah2 exhibits weaker association with PHD3, phospho-mimic Siah2 associates as well as wild type and is localized within the perinuclear region, suggesting that phosphorylation of Siah2 affects its subcellular localization and, consequently, the degree of its association with PHD3. In all, our findings reveal the phosphorylation of Siah2 by p38 and the implications of such phosphorylation for Siah2 activity toward PHD3."

Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM, also known as erythermalgia), an autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by burning pain in the extremities in response to mild warmth, has been linked to mutations in Nav1.7. Recently, a substitution of Ser-241 by threonine (S241T) in the domain I S4-S5 linker of Nav1.7 was identified in a family with IEM. To investigate the possible causative role of this mutation in the pathophysiology of IEM, we used whole-cell voltage-clamp analysis to study the effects of S241T on Nav1.7 gating in HEK293 cells. We found a hyperpolarizing shift of activation midpoint by 8.4 mV, an accelerated time to peak, slowing of deactivation, and an increase in the current in response to small, slow depolarizations. Additionally, S241T produced an enhancement of slow inactivation, shifting the midpoint by -12.3 mV. Because serine and threonine have similar biochemical properties, the S241T substitution suggested that the size of the side chain at this position affected channel gating. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of S241A and S241L substitutions on the gating properties of Nav1.7. Although S241A did not alter the properties of the channel, S241L mimicked the effects of S241T. We conclude that the linker between S4 and S5 in domain I of Nav1.7 modulates gating of this channel, and that a larger side chain at position 241 interferes with its gating mechanisms.

Except for two mutations in S4 and S6 of domain I (DI), the other five mutations change residues in cytoplasmic linkers, with one mutation in the S4-S5 linker of domain I (DI S4-S5), three mutations in the DII S4-S5, and one mutation in the loop between DIII and DIV (7Waxman S.G. Dib-Hajj S. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ser-241 to threonine (S241T) mutation in DI S4-S5 was identified in several generations of a Flemish family with IEM (10Michiels J.J. te Morsche R.H. Jansen J.B. Drenth J.P. Arch. Neurol. 2005; 62: 1587-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The S241T substitution might be considered a conservative change because of the similar chemical properties of the side chain, which can serve as a phosphoacceptor site. We reasoned that the increase in size of the side chain by one methyl group might alter the local folding of the linker or cause a long-range allosteric effect in other structures, which could affect properties of the channel leading to neuronal hyperexcitability. We used whole-cell patch-clamp methods to study the biophysical effects of the naturally occurring S241T mutation and then tested the hypothesis that these effects are attributable to the longer side chain of threonine by investigating the effect of substituting Ser-241 by alanine (S241A) and leucine (S241L). Our data show that residue 241 altered channel gating and suggest that channel function was sensitive to the size of the amino acid residue at that position. Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines—The S241T, S241A, and S241L mutations were introduced individually into hNav1.7R, which carried a tetrodotoxin-resistant version of human Nav1.7 cDNA (19Herzog R.I. Cummins T.R. Ghassemi F. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 741-750Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar) using QuickChange XL site-directed mutagenesis reagents (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected with the individual mutant channel construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Transfected HEK293 cells, grown under standard culture conditions (5% CO2, 37 °C) in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, were treated with G418 for several weeks to derive stable cell lines that expressed the mutant channel. We have previously demonstrated that the gating properties of Nav1.7 in transfected HEK293 cells are similar to those of Nav1.7 in native DRG neurons (19Herzog R.I. Cummins T.R. Ghassemi F. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 741-750Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were chosen to minimize variability in transient transformations. Nevertheless, the current density for cell lines expressing all three mutant derivatives of Nav1.7 were lower (318.7 ± 29.8 pA/pF for S241T, 210.8 ± 21.7 pA/pF for S241A, and 344.0 ± 39.0 pA/pF for S241L) than for wild type Nav1.7R (556.2 ± 41.6 pA/pF), likely because of the site of integration of the plasmid within the HEK293 genome; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that these substitutions affect single channel properties or stability of the channel within the cell membrane. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar) of HEK293 cells stably expressing the sodium channels Nav1.7R, S241T, S241A, or S241L derivatives were performed with an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) using fire polished 1-1.5 MΩ electrodes (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 CsF, 10 NaCl, 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES; 302 mosmol (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH), and the extracellular bath contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 0.0003 tetrodotoxin; 310 mosmol (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). Tetrodotoxin was added to the bath solution to block all endogenous voltage-gated sodium currents, which might be present in HEK293 cells (21Cummins T.R. Zhou J. Sigworth F.J. Ukomadu C. Stephan M. Ptacek L.J. Agnew W.S. Neuron. 1993; 10: 667-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and thereby study Nav1.7R in isolation. All recordings were conducted at room temperature (∼21 °C). The pipette potential was adjusted to zero before seal formation, and the voltages were not corrected for liquid junction potential. Capacity transients were cancelled, and series resistance was compensated by 65-95%. Leakage current was subtracted digitally online using hyperpolarizing potentials applied after the test pulse (P/4 procedure), except for ramp current recordings. Currents were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA Electronics), filtered at 2.9 kHz, and sampled at a rate of 20 kHz. Voltage protocols were carried out 4 min after establishing cell access. Briefly, standard current-voltage (I-V) families were obtained using 40 ms pulses from a holding potential of -100 mV to a range of potentials (-100 to +60 mV) in 10 mV steps with 10 s between pulses. The peak value at each potential was plotted to form I-V curves. Activation curves were obtained by calculating the conductance (G) at each voltage (V).G=IV−Vrev with Vrev being the reversal potential, determined for each cell individually. Activation curves were fitted with the following Boltzmann distribution equation,GNa=GNa,max1+e−(Vm−V1/2k) where GNa is the voltage-dependent sodium conductance, GNa,max is the maximal sodium conductance, V½ is the potential at which activation is half-maximal, Vm is the membrane potential, and k is the slope factor. Ramp currents were elicited by slowly depolarizing voltage ramps, ranging from -100 to +20 mV at a rate of 0.2 mV/ms. Size of absolute ramp currents was measured as the difference between first current downward reflection and the peak of the ramp current. Protocols for assessing steady-state fast inactivation consisted of a series of prepulses (-130 to -10 mV) lasting 500 ms from the holding potential of -100 mV followed by a 40 ms depolarization to -10 mV to assess the noninactivated transient current. The normalized curves were fitted using a Boltzmann distribution equation,INaINa,max=11+eVm−V1/2k where INa,max is the peak sodium current elicited after the most hyperpolarized prepulse, Vm is the preconditioning pulse potential, V½ is the half-maximal sodium current, and k is the slope factor. The decay time constants were obtained by fitting a single exponential function to the current traces. Steady-state slow inactivation was determined using 30 s prepulses ranging from -130 mV to +10 mV followed by a brief hyperpolarization to -120 mV for 100 ms to remove fast inactivation. Available channels were then tested with a 20 ms test pulse to -10 mV. Elicited currents were normalized to the maximal peak current and fitted using a Boltzmann distribution with an added constant (offset). The rate of deactivation was measured using a short (0.5 ms) depolarizing pulse to -20 mV followed by a 50 ms repolarizing pulse to potentials ranging from -100 to -40 mV. Decaying current was then fitted with a single exponential function using PulseFit software (HEKA Electronics). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) performing one-way analysis of variance, and significance for multiple comparisons was tested using Tamhane T2 post hoc analysis. Results revealing p < 0.05 were considered significant. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. S241T Lowers Threshold for Activation, Slows Deactivation, and Increases Ramp Responses of hNav1.7R—The amino acid threonine is larger than serine by a methyl (CH3) group, but both have similar chemical reactivity at their reactive OH group on the side chain, for example, phosphorylation. Nevertheless, the S241T mutation has been linked to IEM (10Michiels J.J. te Morsche R.H. Jansen J.B. Drenth J.P. Arch. Neurol. 2005; 62: 1587-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of the S241T substitution on the biophysical properties of Nav1.7. To characterize the effects of substitution of Ser-241 with threonine on the biophysical properties of Nav1.7, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from HEK293 cell lines stably transfected with wild type Nav1.7R and the mutant derivative S241T. Voltage steps from a holding potential of -100 mV produced a fast activating and fast inactivating current for both constructs (Fig. 1A). The V½ of activation (Fig. 1B and Table 1) was -25.6 ± 0.9 mV (n = 47) for Nav1.7R and -34.0 ± 1.1 mV (n = 39) for the S241T mutant channels, showing a shift of -8.4 mV. The V½ of steady-state fast inactivation was not changed by this mutation (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Thus, the predicted window current would be larger, close to resting membrane potential of neurons.TABLE 1Parameters of Boltzmann fits and values for ramp currents All values are in mV, except for the data of the ramp currents, which are presented as percentage of transient peak currents.ChannelActivationFast inactivationSlow inactivationRamp currentMidpointSlopenMidpointSlopenMidpointSlopenPercentageVoltage at peaknNav1.7R–25.6 ± 0.96.02 ± 0.2147–82.3 ± 0.96.6 ± 0.151–78.4 ± 2.111.9 ± 0.4210.13 ± 0.02–45.5 ± 0.936S241T–34.0 ± 1.1aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.056.52 ± 0.2639–81.8 ± 0.86.0 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0529–90.7 ± 1.1aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.056.3 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.05120.49 ± 0.08aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.05–54.5 ± 0.9aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0534S241A–24.0 ± 0.76.55 ± 0.1935–80.8 ± 0.86.2 ± 0.1aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0525–83.5 ± 2.59.5 ± 0.6aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.05130.15 ± 0.03–46.7 ± 1.120S241L–30.5 ± 1.0aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.057.8 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0521–86.2 ± 1.26.1 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0520–89.2 ± 2.1aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.056.6 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0570.25 ± 0.04aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.05–55.4 ± 1.3aSignificantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.0514a Significantly different from Nav1.7R, tested with one-way analysis of variance and Tamhane post hoc analysis, with p at least smaller than 0.05 Open table in a new tab Kinetics of activation were investigated by measuring the time to peak of the transient current. Considering the observed shift in V½ of activation induced by the S241T mutation, we expected a faster activation depending on the step voltage. At -30 mV, activation of S241T was significantly faster than that of Nav1.7R (Fig. 1C; p < 0.05, one-way analysis of variance, Tamhane post hoc analysis). The same statistical analysis was performed for all indicated p values. Deactivation of S241T was significantly slower at -40 and -50 mV (Nav1.7R, 0.34 ± 0.03 ms; S241T, 1.55 ± 0.15 ms at -40 mV; p < 0.01 (Fig. 1D)). The inactivation decay time constants at these potentials were 12.0 ± 3.6 ms (-40 mV) and 5.3 ± 0.4 ms (-50 mV) for Nav1.7R and 8.4 ± 1ms(-40 mV) and 3.2 ± 0.4 ms (-50 mV) for S241T. As the inactivation time constants were significantly slower than the deactivation time constants, contamination of channel closing by inactivation could be considered low. Small, slow depolarizations of Nav1.7 evoke ramp currents that mimicked weak natural stimuli, for example, generator potentials. The slow closed-state inactivation of Nav1.7 permits this channel to produce relatively larger ramp currents compared with other sodium channels (19Herzog R.I. Cummins T.R. Ghassemi F. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 741-750Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22Cummins T.R. Howe J.R. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9607-9619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells which express Nav1.7R channels produced a ramp current as expected (peak ramp current as percentage of transient peak is 0.13% ± 0.01%, n = 46 (Fig. 1E)). S241T substitution caused a 3.6-fold increase in the ramp current (S241T, 0.49% ± 0.07% of peak transient current, n = 38; p < 0.001). The voltage at which the ramp current peaked was hyperpolarized for S241T as expected from the negative shift of the V½ of activation. Enhanced slow inactivation has been observed for several IEM mutations (16Cummins T.R. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 18Choi J.S. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G.

S241T enhances steady-state slow inactivation and shifts the V½ by -12.3 mV from -78.4 ± 2.1 mV (n = 21) for Nav1.7R to -90.7 ± 1.1 mV (n = 12) for S241T (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1F and Table 1) and reduces the slope factor from 11.9 ± 0.4 mV for Nav1.7R to 6.3 ± 0.3 mV for S241T channels (p < 0.001), thereby rendering the voltage dependence of slow inactivation steeper. However, the offset for slow inactivation of the S241T mutant channel (7.7% ± 0.8%) was not different from that of Nav1.7R channels (8.4% ± 1.0%). Size of the Side Chain at Position 241 Modulates Gating Properties—Serine and threonine side chains differ by one methyl group (Fig. 2A), which could interfere with the packing of the S4-S5 linker secondary structure when the two amino acids are exchanged. To address the possibility that the different size of the side chain of the residue at position 241 contributes to the functional changes in the S241T mutant channels, we substituted Ser-241 by the relatively smaller residue alanine (S241A), which carried one less oxygen atom or the significantly larger residue leucine (S241L) (Fig. 2A). S241L substitution was chosen because it had a bulkier side chain compared with serine; also, a S246L mutation in Nav1.4 (Ser-246 in Nav1.4 corresponds to Ser-241 in Nav1.7) has been described in a patient with myasthenic syndrome (23Tsujino A. Maertens C. Ohno K. Shen X.M. Fukuda T. Harper C.M. Cannon S.C. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7377-7382Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells, stably transfected with S241A and S241L, produced fast activating and inactivating voltage-gated sodium currents, similar to Nav1.7R and S241T channels (Fig. 2A). We investigated the effect of S241A and S241L on voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state fast inactivation. S241A did not significantly alter activation properties of the channel (Fig. 2B, blue squares and Table 1). In addition, the midpoint of steady-state fast inactivation was not significantly different compared with Nav1.7R. The fast inactivation slope decreased to 6.2 ± 0.1 mV (n = 25; p < 0.05; slope for Nav1.7R, 6.6 ± 0.1 mV). S241L currents, however, showed a significant hyperpolarizing shift in activation midpoint compared with Nav1.7R (by 4.9 mV; n = 21; p < 0.05 (Fig. 2B, yellow squares and Table 1)), similar to the effect of S241T; the activation midpoints of S241L and S241T were not significantly different. The slope of activation of S241L increased from 6.0 ± 0.2 mV for Nav1.7R to 7.8 ± 0.3 mV (p < 0.001). Steady-state fast inactivation for S241L was steeper than for Nav1.7R (slope of S241L, 6.1 ± 0.2 mV; p < 0.05), whereas the changes in fast inactivation midpoint were not significant compared with Nav1.7R. To investigate the changes in activation kinetics in more detail, we compared the time to peak and deactivation time constants of the mutant channels. S241A had no significant influence on the time needed to reach the peak of the transient current or on the deactivation time constants (Fig. 3, A and B). S241L, however, made the channel open faster (significant shorter time to peak in the voltage range from -30 mV to +30 mV; Nav1.7R, 0.8 ± 0.02 ms; S241L, 0.6 ± 0.02 ms at -30 mV; p < 0.001; Fig. 3A) and deactivate slower (S241L, 0.69 ± 0.10 ms at -40 mV; p < 0.05, not significant at -50 mV) (Fig. 3B); both effects were similar to those induced by the naturally occurring mutation S241T. The decay time constants were much larger than the deactivation time constants for each mutation (6.9 ± 1.4 ms for S241A and 3.2 ± 0.3 ms for S241L inactivation time constant at -40 mV). S241L produced a larger ramp current (0.25% ± 0.04% of transient peak current, n = 13) than Nav1.7R (0.13% ± 0.01%; p < 0.01). S241A did not alter the ramp current (0.15% ± 0.03%, n = 30; Table 1). The voltage at which the ramp current peaked for S241L was hyperpolarized, as expected by the negative shift of the V½ of its activation. Changes in slow inactivation induced by an increase in size of side chain in the mutant S241T channels were mimicked by S241L: the V½ was shifted by -10.8 mV to -89.2 ± 2.1 mV (n = 7; p < 0.05), and the slope was reduced to 6.6 ± 0.3 mV (p < 0.001) so that the slow inactivation kinetics were almost indistinguishable for these two mutations (Fig. 4 and Table 1). S241A induced a smaller change in slope (9.5 ± 0.6 mV, n = 13; p < 0.05) but did not alter the V½ (-83.5 ± 2.5 mV). For both mutations the offset did not change significantly (9.8% ± 1.2% for S241L and 9.6% ± 1.8% for S241A). We show in this study that the IEM mutation S241T of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 alters the biophysical properties of the channel, consistent with the pathophysiology of this disorder. Activation of S241T was shifted to hyperpolarized potentials, time to peak was faster, deactivation was slower, and response to slow, small depolarization (ramp currents) was increased. All these changes would be expected to increase the excitability of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons harboring the mutation, thus contributing to the pain in IEM (8Dib-Hajj S.D. Rush A.M.

Using transient state kinetic methods, we quantified the kinetics of incorporation, excision, and extension beyond a base pair containing 8-oxodG. The 8-oxodGTP was incorporated opposite dC in the template with a specificity constant of 0.005 μm-1 s-1, a value ∼10,000-fold lower than that for dGTP. Once incorporated, 96% of the time 8-oxodGMP was extended by continued polymerization rather than being excised by the proofreading exonuclease. The specificity constant for incorporation of 8-oxodGTP opposite a template dA was 0.2 μm-1 s-1, a value 13-fold higher than incorporation opposite a template dC. The 8-oxodG:dA mispair was extended rather than excised at least 70% of the time. Examination of the kinetics of polymerization with 8-oxodG in the template strand also revealed relatively low fidelity in that dCTP would be incorporated only 90% of the time. In nearly 10% of events, dATP would be incorporated, and once incorporated dA (opposite 8-oxodG) was extended rather than excised. The greatest fidelity was against a dTTP:8-oxodG mismatch affording a discrimination value of only 1800. These data reveal that 8-oxodGTP is a potent mutagen. Once it is incorporated into DNA, 8-oxodGMP codes for error prone DNA synthesis. These reactions are likely to play important roles in oxidative stress in mitochondria related to aging and as compounded by nucleoside analogs used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2016264506,"Centaurin β1 (CENTB1), a GTPase-activating protein, is a member of the ADP-ribosylation factor family encoded by a gene located on the short arm of human chromosome 17. A yeast two-hybrid screen first suggested a direct interaction between CENTB1 and NOD2. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed direct interaction between CENTB1 and NOD2 and demonstrated similar interaction between CENTB1 and NOD1. We also demonstrate that endogenous CENTB1 interacts with endogenous NOD2 and NOD1 in SW480 and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells. CENTB1 partially co-localized with NOD2 and NOD1 proteins in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. CENTB1 expression in epithelial cells was highly induced by tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, and the NOD1 and NOD2 ligands (γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid and muramyl dipeptide, respectively). In addition, CENTB1 mRNA level is increased in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Functionally, CENTB1 overexpression inhibited NOD1- and NOD2-dependent activation of NF-κB, whereas small inhibitory RNA against CENTB1 increased NF-κB activation following NOD1- or NOD2-mediated recognition of the bacterial components γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid and muramyl dipeptide, respectively. In contrast, CENTB1 had no effect on NF-κB activation induced by Toll-like receptors. In conclusion, CENTB1 selectively down-regulates NF-κB activation via NODs pathways, creating a “feedback” loop and suggesting a novel role of CENTB1 in innate immune responses to bacteria and inflammatory responses.

Nunez G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The CARD15 (NOD2) gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 16 and encodes a protein that contains two C-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central NOD (also known as a nucleotide-binding domain) and an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat region (2Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chenn F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). NOD2 recognizes intracellular peptidoglycans from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria through the detection of the minimal motif muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (3Inohara N. Ogura Y. Fontalba A. Gutierrez O. Pons F. Crespo J. Fukase K. Inamura S. Kusumoto S. Hashimoto M. Foster S.J. Moran A.P. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. J. Biol.

Recognition of this specific dipeptide by NOD2 leads to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation (4Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G. Philpott D. Sansonetti P.J. J.

This is thought to be relevant to disease pathogenesis given that NF-κB is a key intracellular signaling molecule in a variety of inflammatory pathways (5Neurath M.F. Fuss I. Schurmann G.

NOD1 is a cytosolic protein that is constitutively expressed by many cell types including intestinal epithelial cells (9Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32962-32968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in innate immune recognition. NOD1 contains CARD, NOD/nucleotide-binding domain, and leucine-rich repeat region domains. The CARD and NOD domains are required for NF-κB activation (10Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), whereas the leucine-rich repeat region domain recognizes the γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) derived from peptidoglycans of Gram-negative bacteria (11Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Science. 2003; 300: 1584-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Because intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are constantly exposed to bacteria and their components, IECs are considered to be not only a structural but also a functional barrier as the front line of host defense against microorganisms. Although IECs are hyporesponsive to normal flora in vivo, pathogenic bacteria or internalized bacterial components can initiate an inflammatory response (12Philport D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 13Savkovic S.D. Koutsouris A. Hecht G. Am. J.

These data suggest that presentation of internalized bacterial components is a critical point in bacteria-epithelial interaction. We have previously shown that the NOD2 acts as a defensive factor against intracellular bacteria in IECs (20Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podoslky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In addition, membrane recruitment of NOD2 in IECs is essential for NF-κB activation in MDP recognition, which could be responsible for NOD2 anti-bacterial activity (21Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, intraepithelial bacteria have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (15Swidsinski A. Ladhoff A. Pernthaler A. Swidsinski S. Loening-Baucke V. Orter M. Weber J. Hoffmann U. Schreiber S. Dietel M. Lochs H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 44-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) and an increased prevalence of adherent-invasive Escherichia coli has been observed in ileal mucosa of CD patients (16Darfeuille-Michaud A. Boudeau J. Bulois P. Neut C. Glasser A.L. Barnich N. Bringer M.A. Swidsinski A. Beaugerie L. Colombel J.F. Gastroenterology. 2004; 127: 412-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the hypothesis that recognition mechanisms of intracellular bacteria or their components likely play a key role in the pathophysiology of IBD. However, understanding of the mechanisms through which NOD proteins lead to effective responses remains substantially incomplete. Although some studies have suggested that NOD2 activation modulates TLR2 responses, which may be dysregulated when the NOD2 3020insC mutant associated with CD is present, others have not found comparable results (17Watanabe T. Kitani A. Murray P.J. Strober W. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 18Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nunez G. Flavell R.A.

A number of groups have endeavored to identify and characterize proteins that interact with NODs to better understand their functional effects and mechanisms of action. These efforts have previously suggested roles for GRIM-19 (22Barnich N. Hisamatsu T. Aguirre J.E. Xavier R. Reinecker H.C. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol.

However, it is evident that these proteins are not sufficient to fully explain the regulation of NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation. To identify new molecules that could interact with these intracellular sensors, a yeast two-hybrid screen was undertaken using NOD2 protein as bait. Hybrid constructs comprising the NOD and leucine-rich repeat region domain led to the finding that Centaurin β1 protein (CENTB1) interacts with both the NOD1 and NOD2 proteins. Yeast Two-hybrid Cloning of NOD2-interacting Proteins— Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using MATCH-MAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, pGBKT7-NOD2 was transfected into the AH109 yeast strain. Expression of Myc-tagged NOD2 protein in yeast extract was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA) and affinity-purified anti-NOD2 antisera (19Maeda S. Hsu L.C. Liu H. Bankston L.A. Iimura M. Kagnoff M.F. Eckman L. Karin M. Science. 2005; 307: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Screening was performed using a bone marrow pretransformed library (BD Biosciences Clontech) as described previously (20Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podoslky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Co-transformants were selected in S.D. medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Yeast α-galactosidase activity, expressed from the MEL1 gene response to GAL4 activation, was determined in plates containing X-gal (BD Biosciences Clontech). Cell Culture and Tissue—COS-7, HEK293, THP-1, Jurkat, SW480, HT-29, Caco-2, T84, Colo205, and HCT116 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used for experiments after they had reached 90-100% confluence. SW480 and Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro Mediatech Ins., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 20% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals Inc., Norcross, GA). COS-7, HEK293, HT-29, Colo205, and HCT116 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. T-84 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine (Cellgro Mediatech Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Colonic mucosal biopsy samples from patients with ulcerative colitis and CD were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen biopsies were disrupted mechanically, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. cDNA from colon surgical specimens of IBD patients and normal controls were provided by Dr. Emiko Mizoguchi. All of the tissue samples were obtained under protocols approved by Partners IRB. Construction of Expression Plasmids—cDNA of CENTB1 was obtained by a PCR method using an Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) from the above mentioned cell lines. The PCR primers were: 5′-atgacggtcaagctggatttcgagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cacagcgtgtggaggtcatgactg-3′ (reverse). The sequence of CENTB1 cDNA was confirmed using an ABI 3700 PRISM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) automated sequencer. An expression plasmid-encoding Xpress-tagged CENTB1 mammalian expression vector (pCDNA4/HisMAX-Centaurin β1) was generated by RT-PCR from SW480 cells. An expression plasmid-encoding FLAG-tagged NOD2 (pCMV FLAG-NOD2) was previously generated (20Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podoslky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). pCI CARD4/NOD1-HA expression vector was provided by Dr. John Bertin (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc). Two oligonucleotides, 19 residues in length (siRNA-1, gtacaaggaccctgtgact; and siRNA-2, aattcaccgtgagcctgaa), specific to the human CENTB1 were selected for synthesis of siRNA. pSUPER vector for siRNA was purchased from Oligoengine (Seattle, WA). The depletion of endogenous CENTB1 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Crohn's disease mutations plasmids including FLAG-NOD2 L1007fs, FLAG-NOD2 R702W, and FLAG-NOD2 G908R have been previously generated (21Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Blau syndrome mutants FLAG-NOD2 R334W and FLAG-NOD2 L496F were generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) according to the manufacturer's protocols, and the mutations introduced were confirmed by sequencing. The CENTB1 deletion constructs were generated by PCR amplifying different regions of amino acids using specific primers (PH domain: 5′-atgacggtcaagctggatttcgagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-accgcctttctgagtcaggg-3′ (reverse)); Arf-GAP domain + Ankyrin repeats: (5′-gcacgtggtggcccaggtccagag-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcacagcgtgtggaggtcatgactg-3′ (reverse)); and Ankyrin repeats (5′-aatgccacaccgctgatccag-3′ (forward) and 5′-tcacagcgtgtggaggtcatgactg-3′ (reverse)). The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA4-Xpress vector to generate a fusion protein with an N-terminal Xpress tag. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting CENTB1 and NOD Proteins—Anti-CENTB1 sera were produced by co-immunizing rabbits with the synthesized polypeptide sequences: peptide 1, DPEKLSRRSHDLHTL (positions 726-740); and peptide 2, ARLGPPEPMMAECLE (positions 67-81) conjugated with glutaraldehyde. Anti-CENTB1 sera were affinity purified by using BioPure from ABR Affinity BioReagents. The cells were grown in six-well plates. The medium was removed, and 300 μl of 1% Triton-X lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 5.6, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm Na3VO4, and 40 mm NaF) supplemented with protease-inhibitor mixture, complete Mini (Roche Applied Science) was added. Supernatants of cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were extracted from COS-7 cells (transiently co-transfected with pCMV FLAG-NOD2 and pCDNA4-HisMAX-CENTB1 plasmids). Two milligrams of total cell lysate protein were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG biotinylated M2 monoclonal or anti-Xpress monoclonal antibodies and 100 μl of Hiptrap protein A/G-Sepharose beads. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4-12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). The proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected using anti-FLAG biotinylated M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Co-localization of CENTB1 and NOD Proteins—COS-7 cells were seeded on sterile Permanox coverslips, grown for 24 h, and then co-transfected with pCDNA4/HisMAX-CENTB1 and pCMV FLAG-NOD2. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed 20 min with cold methanol at -20 °C, and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were saturated for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% horse serum and then incubated 2 h with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody and/or rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma). Immunostaining was performed with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories). The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined at room temperature with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Radiance 2000 model; Bio-Rad) using multi-tracking (line switching) for two-color imaging (40×). Image acquisition was performed with LaserSharpScanning software (Bio-Rad). mRNA Expression of CENTB1—Total RNA of intestinal epithelial cell lines was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using a SuperScript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector using a SYBR Green JumpStart™ detection system. Briefly, 50 ng of the reversed transcribed cDNA was used for each PCR with 200 nm of forward and reverse primers. Two sets of primers for CENTB1 were designed (5′-cgccttgatgacagcccccgggg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cccatgagtcaagggtcagagaccg-3′ (reverse); and 5′-gtgtcagaattggagacccgtc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gctgtccagcttgtggttcagg-3′ (reverse)). The PCR program with specific primers was as follows: 50 °C for 2 min and then 95 °C for 10 min followed by 44 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. PCR products were sequenced using an ABI 3700 PRISM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) automated sequencer. The sequences were analyzed using NCBI BLAST software. Assessment of NF-κB Activation.—HEK293 cells were transfected overnight with NOD2, NOD1, CENTB1, and CENTB1 siRNA constructs, plus pIV luciferase reporter and Renilla plasmids. At the same time, 1 μg of MDP-LD (Sigma) (where L and D indicate levo and dextro, respectively) and 100 ng/ml of iEDAP were added. After 24 h, luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized relative to Renilla activity. Statistical Analysis—For analysis of the significance of differences in NF-κB, invasion, and mRNA levels, Student's t test was used for comparison of two groups of data. All of the experiments were repeated at least five times. A p value ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Identification of CENTB1 as a Novel NOD2-interacting Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify cellular proteins that interact with CARD15/NOD2. A NOD2 construct without the CARD15 domain was used as bait. We screened a human cDNA library expressing proteins fused to the active domain transcriptional activation domain. One of the positive clones was found to encode the human CENTB1. To confirm a specific interaction between NOD2 and CENTB1, we performed AH109 yeast survival assays in S.D./-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/X-gal selective medium. Co-expression of NOD2 and CENTB1 in AH109 yeast showed a strong interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). To confirm the interaction of NOD2 and CENTB1 in mammalian cells, COS7 and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged NOD2 and Xpress-tagged CENTB1. After 48 h of transfection, NOD2 was immunoprecipitated with HM2559 anti-NOD2 serum (20Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podoslky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and CENTB1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, CENTB1 was detected in anti-HM2559 (20Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podoslky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitates from NOD2 co-transfectants, but not from cells co-transfected with a control plasmid. A reciprocal immunoprecipitation/blotting experiment using anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody also showed NOD2 co-precipitation with CENTB1, confirming the interaction of these two proteins in mammalian cells. Interaction between NOD1 and CENTB1 in Mammalian Cells—To examine the extent of the interaction of CENTB1 with NOD proteins, the ability of NOD1, an other NOD family member, to co-immunoprecipitate with CENTB1 was investigated by Western blot (Fig. 1B). After 48 h of co-transfection of HEK293 cells with DNA constructs encoding HA-tagged NOD1 and Xpress-tagged CENTB1, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using anti-NOD1 antiserum HM3851 (9Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32962-32968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody to pull down NOD1 and CENTB1, respectively. CENTB1 was detected in anti-NOD1 immunoprecipitates from NOD1 co-transfectants. A reciprocal immunoprecipitation/Western blotting experiment using anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody also showed NOD1 co-precipitation with CENTB1, confirming the interaction of these two proteins. Expression of CENTB1 Messenger RNA in IBD Tissues and Immune Cell Lines—CENTB1 mRNA level was assessed by real time PCR in immune cell lines as well as several human intestinal epithelial cell lines (SW480, HT-29, Caco-2, T84, Colo-205, and HCT-116). THP-1 macrophages, Jurkat cells, granulocytes, and B lymphocytes showed expression of CENTB1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no basal CENTB1 mRNA was detectable in any of several intestinal epithelial cell lines, including SW480, HT-29, Caco-2, T84, Colo205, and HCT116 (data not shown). Real time PCR showed that CENTB1 mRNA was present in surgical specimens from ulcerative colitis and CD patients, but not from normal controls (Fig. 2B). Induction of CENTB1 Expression in Intestinal Epithelial Cells by Inflammatory Stimuli—The finding that endogenous CENTB1 expression is increased in association with intestinal inflammation prompted an assessment of the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on CENTB1 expression. Two representative colonic cell lines (SW480 and HT-29) were stimulated with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) or IL-1β (15 ng/ml). CENTB1 mRNA was markedly increased after 1h of TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3A). Comparable effects were observed following IL-1β stimulation. Similar results were also found in Jurkat and THP-1 cells when they were stimulated with these two proinflammatory cytokines (data not shown). CENTB1 mRNA was also markedly induced in SW480 and HT-29 cells stimulated with the ligands for NOD1 and NOD2 MDP and iE-DAP, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). Comparable increases in endogenous protein expression were also observed (Fig. 3, D and E). Indeed, CENTB1 expression was greater in epithelial cell lines stimulated with NODs ligands than when cells were stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, TLR2 and TLR4 prototype ligands lipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) had no effect on CENTB1 expression (data not shown). Interaction between Endogenous NODs and CENTB1 Proteins in Mammalian Cells—To assess the possible physiological significance of the NOD2/CENTB1 interaction, we investigated the interaction between endogenous NOD2 and CENTB1 using lysates from SW480 cells that express endogenous NOD2 (21Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and stimulated them with MDP-LD (1 μg) to induce endogenous CENTB1 expression. For immunoprecipitation experiments, we used a newly produced rabbit antiserum against CENTB1. Anti-CENTB1 antibody specifically recognized CENTB1 in lysate of COS-7 cells transfected with the Xpress-tagged CENTB1 construct (data not shown). Endogenous NOD2 expression was observed in SW480 cells by using the rabbit antiserum against NOD2 HM2559 (20Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podoslky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation using anti-CENTB1 antiserum in SW480 cells stimulated with MDP-LD (1 μg) (Fig. 4A) confirmed the interaction between endogenous CENTB1 with NOD2 protein. Similarly, interaction between endogenous NOD1 and CENTB1 proteins was assessed using HT-29 cells stimulated with the NOD1 ligand (iE-DAP) to induce CENTB1 expression. The HT-29 intestinal epithelial cell line has been previously demonstrated to exhibit endogenous expression of NOD1 (9Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32962-32968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments using rabbit antiserum previously generated against NOD1 (HM3851) (9Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32962-32968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the newly produced rabbit antiserum against CENTB1 described above confirmed interaction between endogenous NOD1 and CENTB1 proteins in HT-29 lysate (Fig. 4B). CENTB1 and NODs Proteins Co-localize in the Cytosystem— To determine whether NOD2 and CENTB1 co-localize as implied in the finding of a direct biochemical interaction, subcellular localization was evaluated by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. COS-7 cells were transfected with Xpress-tagged CENTB1 and FLAG-tagged NOD2 expression plasmids. NOD2 protein was observed throughout the cytoplasm and also associated with the plasma membrane as previously reported (21Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells co-expressing FLAG-tagged NOD2 and Xpress-tagged CENTB1, CENTB1 co-localized with the cytoplasmic NOD2 but not with the NOD2 membrane-associated fraction (Fig. 5A). This partial co-localization of NOD2 with CENTB1 is consistent with the evidence that specific interactions occur between these two proteins in vitro. Using similar approaches CENTB1 was also found to co-localize with NOD1 in the intracytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 5B). Cellular localization of endogenous CENTB1 and NOD2 was investigated in SW480 cells stimulated with MDP-LD. Co-localization between endogenous CENTB1 and NOD2 was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). Similar co-localization of endogenous CENTB1 and NOD1 was found in SW480 cells transfected with HA-NOD1 and stimulated with iE-DAP (Fig. 5D). These observations are consistent with interactions of endogenous NODs/CENTB1 proteins, suggesting physiological significance of these interactions. Mapping of CENTB1 Domain Required for NODs Interaction—To characterize the domain of CENTB1 responsible for interaction with the NODs, deletion constructs of CENTB1 protein were prepared that allowed discrimination between encompassed three regions: the PH domain, the Arf-GAP domain, and the Ankyrin repeats (Fig. 6A).

Interactions between Lingo-1 and NgR, along with a complementary co-receptor, result in neurite and axonal collapse. In addition, the inhibitory role of Lingo-1 is particularly important in regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of Lingo-1 function could be a novel approach for nerve repair and remyelination therapies. Here we report on the crystal structure of the ligand-binding ectodomain of human Lingo-1 and show it has a bimodular, kinked structure composed of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin (Ig)-like modules. The structure, together with biophysical analysis of its solution properties, reveals that in the crystals and in solution Lingo-1 persistently associates with itself to form a stable tetramer and that it is its LRR-Ig-composite fold that drives such assembly. Specifically, in the crystal structure protomers of Lingo-1 associate in a ring-shaped tetramer, with each LRR domain filling an open cleft in an adjacent protomer. The tetramer buries a large surface area (9,200Å2) and may serve as an efficient scaffold to simultaneously bind and assemble the NgR complex components during activation on a membrane.

Injured neurons in mature organisms are unable to effectively regrow their axons after central nervous system damage. One of the many factors restricting axonal regeneration after injury is the growth-inhibiting components associated with damaged myelin. At least three of these components, Nogo-66, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), 3The abbreviations used are: MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; NgR, Nogo receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s., root mean square; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; SIRAS, single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering.3The abbreviations used are: MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; NgR, Nogo receptor; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; r.m.s., root mean square; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; SIRAS, single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, either individually or collectively, have been shown to be potent inhibitors of neurite outgrowth (1He Z. Koprivica V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 341-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Filbin M.T. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). All three signal inhibition through the Nogo receptor complex, composed of the ligand-binding Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) and two complementary co-receptors p75 and Lingo-1 that act as a signal-transducing pair on an axon's cell membrane (3Barker P.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 4Bandtlow C. Dechant G. Sci. STKE 2004,. 2004; : 24Google Scholar). Although both NgR and the p75 nerve growth factor receptor have well documented roles in the context of myelin inhibition, reports exploring the role of Lingo-1 are more recent. Human Lingo-1 is a central nervous system-specific transmembrane glycoprotein (Fig. 1) also known as LERN-1, which belongs to a larger family of LRR-Ig-containing proteins involved in central nervous system development and axonal growth (5Carim-Todd L. Escarceller M. Estivill X. Sumoy L. Euro. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3167-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Its large extracellular or ectodomain is thought to be of functional importance in protein-protein recognition and is characterized by a tandem array of multiple LRRs and one Ig-like domain. The first studies examining the role of Lingo-1 demonstrated that in cultured neurons Lingo-1 directly associates with NgR and p75 and that whenever myelin-NgR/p75-mediated growth inhibition is observed, Lingo-1 is present, and is essential to this process (6Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The functional capacity of the tripartite complex to launch the downstream RhoA-dependent signaling pathway that evokes the inhibition of neurite outgrowth has been reported. Of note is the finding that truncated Lingo-1 lacking the intracellular domain restores neurite outgrowth in vitro by interrupting the interaction of Lingo-1 with its binding partners. Direct physical interactions between the full-length Lingo-1 and either NgR or p75 have been reported, as have interactions of truncated soluble Lingo-1 with either NgR or p75 (6Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). More recently, our understanding of this inhibitory system has changed with the identification of yet another member of the Nogo receptor complex, designated TROY (7Park J.B. Yiu G. Kaneko S. Wang J. Chang J. He Z. Neuron. 2005; 45: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The latter belongs to the same, tumor necrosis factor-receptor family as p75 but, unlike p75, is broadly expressed in adult neurons, where it can substitute for p75 in the signaling complex, allowing for RhoA activation and outgrowth inhibition in neurons lacking p75 (7Park J.B. Yiu G. Kaneko S. Wang J. Chang J. He Z. Neuron. 2005; 45: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 8Shao Z. Browning J. Lee X. Scott M. Shulga-Morskaya S. Allaire N. Thill G. Sah Levesque M.D. McCoy J.M. Murray B. Jung V. Pepinsky R.B. Mi S. Neuron. 2005; 45: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The current model for myelin-mediated inhibition includes therefore an alternative signaling complex that involves NgR, Lingo-1, and TROY. In addition to its expression on neurons, Lingo-1 is also detected in oligodendrocytes (9Mi S. Miller R.H. Lee X. Scott M.L. Shulag-Morskaya S. Shao Z. Chang J. Thill G. Levesque M. Zhang M. Hession C. Sah D. Trapp B. He Z. Jung V. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In this study, Lingo-1 was reported to be a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, exerting its function through a Fyn-RhoA pathway. Although a link to these signaling molecules is note-worthy in light of the fact that a role for Fyn/RhoA signaling has been reported in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination (10Liang X. Draghi N.A. Resh M.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7140-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism by which Lingo-1 signaling is initiated and the nature of protein-protein interactions involved remain largely unknown. Agonist and antagonist or null versions of Lingo-1 modulate the amount of functional Lingo-1 and hence its activity. Blockade of normal Lingo-1 activity, modeled either by introduction of exogenous Lingo-1 to oligodendrocyte-neuron cocultures or with knock-out mice lacking Lingo-1, not only permits outgrowth of oligodendrocyte processes, it also results in highly developed myelinated axons. These findings coupled with complementary gain-of-function results suggest that Lingo-1 inhibitory signaling could be one of the factors controlling central nervous system myelination. An interesting point in this respect is the recent evidence that myelin debris inhibits differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursors and that myelin could in fact be an underlying cause of impaired remyelination (11Kotter M.R. Li W.-W. Zhao C. Franklin R.J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Whether this mechanism is relevant to the Lingo-1 inhibitory action in oligodendrocytes is not known. All these findings underline the importance and complexity of the molecular action of Lingo-1 and have stimulated much interest in this molecule as a promising therapeutic target, in particular for the treatment of diseases associated with myelin deficiencies, such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophies. Because development of therapeutics to block Lingo-1 specific interactions may lead to a new class of inhibitors, the atomic details of its ligand-recognition module should have an immediate impact on the discovery of such inhibitors. With this goal in view, we have produced recombinant soluble Lingo-1 protein, confirmed its biological and functional binding activity, and determined its ectodomain crystal structure to 2.7-Å resolution. The structure provides the first atomic insights into this new member of an apparently unique signaling protein family that contains both LRR and Ig-like domains in their extracellular region. Structural and solution characterization of this molecule reveal another important and previously not recognized concept, oligomerization of Lingo-1, which may relate to the proposed role of Lingo-1 in the central nervous system. The unique structure of this molecule defines its potential functional binding sites and should now provide a basis for further research that will address physiological relevance of these findings to central nervous system function. Protein Expression and Purification—An extracellular portion of human Lingo-1 was expressed in lectin-resistant CHO Lec 3.2.8.1 cells as a C-terminal 6-His-tagged protein (residues 1-549, signal sequence 1-33). The human Lingo-1-His was subcloned into pSMEG vector behind a murine cytomegalovirus promoter and verified by sequencing analysis. CHO cells were grown and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DNA transfection and large-scale production of conditioned cell culture media for Lec3.2.8.1 cells were performed as described previously (12Zhong X. Kriz R. Kumar R. Guidotti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1723: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The media expressing Lingo-1-His was exchanged into a buffer of 1 m Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, to which a mixture of protease inhibitors (complete inhibitors from Roche Applied Science) was added. The protein was captured by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and then purified by gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex-200). NgR 1D4 (residues 27-451) fused at the C terminus with the 10-amino acid 1D4 epitope tag was expressed in CHO-A2 cells using the honeybee meletin secretory leader, then purified from the media by anti-1D4 affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. Neurite Outgrowth Assays—96-well plates were coated with a thin layer of nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) before incubating with Lingo-1-His or control IgG-Fc (R&D Systems) proteins in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml MAG-Fc (R&D Systems) at 4 °C overnight. Wells were subsequently coated with 17 μg/ml of poly-d-lysine (Sigma), followed by an incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Postnatal day 5 rat cerebella granule neurons were dissociated and seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well. Cells were cultured for 18-20 h before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with a neuronal specific anti-β-tubulin antibody (Tuj1, Covance). The average of total neurite lengths from each neuron was quantitated by Cellomics' Neurite Outgrowth Bioapplication from at least 400 neurons per well, in triplicate wells per experiment. Results have been repeated independently for more than three times. Cell-based Binding Assays—25,000 CHO-DUKX cells stably expressing NgR and p75 were seeded overnight in 96-well plate and then incubated with various concentration of Lingo-1-His in Hanks' balanced salt buffer with 1%fetal bovine serum, 20 nm HEPES for 2 h at 37°C. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-His IgG was added, and the mixture was incubated for another hour. Bound Lingo-1-His was detected by incubation with AttoPhos substrate (Promega) at 0.6 mg/ml for half an hour and read on Flex Station (emission: 440 nm, excitation: 560 nm). Biacore Experiments—Surface plasmon resonance with BIA-core was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) between NgR 1D4 and Lingo-1-His. NgR 1D 4 was immobilized onto a CM5 chip using amine-coupling chemistry. A titration series using 2-fold serial dilutions was performed with the analyte Lingo-1-His ranging in concentration from 10 to 0.039 μm.A KD of ∼1 μm was determined for the NgR 1D4 and Lingo-1-His interaction by steady-state equilibrium analysis using BIAevaluation 3.0. Crystallization—To obtain diffraction quality crystals, the 6-His tag and stalk region were removed by proteolytic treatment with chymotrypsin for 2 h at 18°C. The cleaved Lingo-1 was further purified and analyzed by gel filtration, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry (molecular mass ∼ 66.4 kDa compared with a value of ∼71.62 kDa obtained for Lingo-1-His). For crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 4-6 mg/ml in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). Crystals were obtained at 18 °C in hanging drops using 1.2-1.4 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.0, as a precipitant. The protein crystallized in two forms, with both forms found in the same crystallization droplets: I222, with two molecules per asymmetric unit and 74% solvent content, and P21212, with four molecules per asymmetric unit and 73% solvent content. For data collection, crystals were gradually transferred from the mother liquor to the stabilizing cryoprotecting solution containing 2.9 m sodium malonate, pH 5.2. This solution, in which crystals were found to be stable over the period of several days and over the pH range 5-7, was used for crystal derivatization. A single derivative that allowed structure determination by the SIRAS method was obtained from crystals were soaked in 50 mm K2PtCl6 and 2.9 m sodium malonate at pH 7.0 for 24 h. Prior to data collection, all crystals were flush cooled under a nitrogen stream at 100 K. Data Collection, Phasing, and Refinement—Two data sets obtained from crystals of space group I222 were used for phase determination: the 3.5-Å native data set and the 3.6-Å data set for the platinum derivative, both measured in house with Saturn92 CCD mounted on an FR-E CuKα rotating anode source (Rigaku, Japan). The higher resolution native data set was collected to 2.7 Å at Advanced Photon Source beamline 22-ID of Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team from a crystal that belongs to the P21212 space group. All data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38517) Google Scholar). The initial positions of platinum atoms in the derivative crystal were located with SHELXD (2001 Bruker-AXS, XM, version 6.12) using anomalous differences of platinum atoms at the CuKα edge. The input SAS coefficients were prepared with XPREP (2001 Bruker-AXS, version 6.12). Refinement of heavyatom parameters, phase calculation, and density modification by SOLOMON, all were performed with SHARP (14De La Fortelle E. Brigogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) at 20- to 3.6-Å resolution, using both anomalous and isomorphous differences from the native and derivative data sets. The final 3.6-Å SIRAS maps produced with SHARP were of interpretable quality and revealed two Lingo-1 molecules in the asymmetric unit. SHARP phases were further improved by 2-fold NCS averaging and phase extension to 3.5 Å in DM (15Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The resulting maps allowed us to build an initial, 90% complete (∼855 residues) model with QUANTA. This model was then used for molecular replacement with the P21212 data set to utilize the higher 2.7-Å resolution data. A clear solution for four molecules in the asymmetric unit was identified with PHASER (16McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). The I222 and P21212 crystal forms share the same tetrameric packing, in which the tetramer can be built by replicating a dimer around the 2-fold axis. Subsequent rounds of rebuilding and refinement against the 2.7-Å data set were done with COOT (17Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23207) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (18Winn M. Isupov M. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The final model contains 4 protein molecules (residues A1-477, B3-475, C2-477, and D3-476), 39 N-acetylglucosamine and 12 mannose residues, and 310 water molecules. Residues 1-2 at the N termini of B, C, and D, 476-477 at the C termini of B and D, and residues D32-34 were not modeled into the structure due to the lack of adequate electron density, presumably because of disordering. Geometric analysis of the final refined structure performed with MolProbity (19Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W615-W619Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) places 94% of all residues in favored regions and 0.16% as outliers.

Open table in a new tab Chemical Cross-linking—The solution state of Lingo-1 (residues 1-478) was analyzed by chemical cross-linking and dynamic light scattering, and of Lingo1-His by analytical centrifugation. To achieve a substantial level of cross-linking, 50 μm Lingo-1 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl was buffer exchanged with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 150 mm NaCl using a desalting column. The buffer exchanged Lingo-1 at 50 μm was incubated with 75 μm glutaraldehyde at 18 °C for 2 h. Cross-linked Lingo-1 was purified away from glutaraldehyde by washing the mixture several times with 50 mm Tris; pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, followed by concentration of the protein using a Microcon. As a negative control, Lingo-1 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.7, 150 mm NaCl was incubated at 18 °C for 2 h. Both these samples were run on 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel and protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. Dynamic Light Scattering—The hydrodynamic radius of Lingo-1 was measured at various protein concentrations (ranged from 4 to 125 μm) using a DynaPro DLS instrument. Each protein sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove any particulates. The supernatant was transferred to a quartz cuvette, and 10-20 readings at 18 °C were averaged per sample. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on a Beckman XLI/XLA analytical ultracentrifuge at 20 °C at three different rotor speeds (9,000, 12,000, and 18,000 r.p.m.) and four concentrations (1.0, 5.8, 16.6, and 49.3 μm). Samples were loaded into six-channel (1.2-cm path length) carbon-Epon centerpieces in an An-50 Ti titanium rotor. Scans were recorded at 230, 250, and 280 nm with a 0.001-cm spacing and ten replicates per point, and equilibrium was judged to be achieved when there was no deviation between successive scans taken 3 h apart. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression with WinNONLIN (20Yphantis D. Johnson M.L. Lary J.W. WinNONLIN program. National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT1997Google Scholar). The solvent density and viscosity were calculated with the program Sednterp (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). The data were fit to different associating models (monomer-dimer-trimer, monomer-dimer-trimer-tetramer, and monomer-dimer-tetramer). The residual, variance of the fit, and R2 were used to judge how well the data fit to the different models. Better fits were obtained for protein concentrations <50 μm, and the best fit was for a monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibrium model. Association constants for monomerdimer-tetramer equilibria obtained from WinNONLIN were converted from absorbance (Kn,abs) to molar units (Kn,M) with the equation, Kn,M = Kn,abs(ϵl)/n, where l is the path length of the cell (1.2 cm), ϵ is the molar extinction at the wavelength monitored (23,120 m-1 cm-1 at 250 nm), and n is the oligomer size. Sequence Analysis—The set of homologous Lingo-1 sequences was retrieved with a BLAST search from the publicly available protein data base UniProt (Swissprot, TrEMBL, and PIR). The ectodomain regions (amino acids 1-477) of Lingo-1 sequences (primary accession numbers: Q96FE5_Human, Q9N008_Macfa, Q5RDJ4_Ponpy, Q9D1T0_Mouse, Q50L44_Chick, andQ562A6_Rat) were extracted, subsequentlyanalyzed, and aligned by using FASTA (22Pearson W.R.

Functional Characterization and Structure Determination of Recombinant Lingo-1—To obtain a homogeneous high mannose glycoform of the protein suitable for crystallography studies, the extracellular portion of glycosylated recombinant human Lingo-1 (amino acids 1-516, coding sequence 34-549, plus a C-terminal 6-histidine tag) was produced in lectin-resistant CHO Lec 3.2.8.1 cells and purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The obtained recombinant Lingo-1-His was evaluated in a neurite outgrowth assay and examined for binding to its partners NgR and p75. We first established that neurite outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons can be inhibited by immobilized MAG-Fc but not control IgG-Fc and then showed that Lingo-1-His is able to completely reverse the MAG-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition (Fig. 2, A-C). The physical interaction of Lingo-1-His with NgR- and p75-expressing CHO cells was demonstrated in a separate experiment (Fig. 2D). We also examined the interaction of the Lingo-1-His protein with NgR in vitro, employing a surface plasmon resonance assay (Fig. 2E). The steady-state equilibrium analysis indicated that soluble Lingo-1-His maintained micromolar affinity binding (Kd ∼ 1 μm) to the immobilized soluble NgR. Although the use of immobilized and truncated proteins may not accurately reflect the binding affinities of these proteins on the cell surface, these data confirm that Lingo-1 structural determinants required for recognition of NgR are sufficiently contained within its ectodomain. Crystallization of the full-length ectodomain of Lingo-1-His produced small weakly diffracting crystals. Cleavage of the His tag and stalk region prior to crystallization, so that the resultant ectodomain extended from residues 1 to 478, yielded two new crystal forms, the best of which (crystal form P21212) diffracted to 2.7-Å resolution. The quaternary arrangement of the protein is the same in both crystal forms analyzed. In the I222 crystal form, the dimer of dimers is crystallographic in nature, whereas in the P21212 form, the same configuration is generated by four independent Lingo-1 molecules in the asymmetric unit. Experimental phases were derived by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) followed by molecular averaging and solvent flattening. A complete model for the four molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit was built iteratively and refined to an R-value of 21.5% (Rfree = 25.5%) at 2.7-Å resolution. A representative portion of the resultant electron density map is shown in Fig. 3A, and the summary of the data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics is given in Table 1. All four molecules adopt similar, but not identical, conformations; the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations of 0.5-1.3 Å for Cα-atoms are mainly due to some flexibility of the interdomain tilt angle and to differences in loop regions. Protomer Architecture—Protomers of Lingo-1 fold into a two-module, kinked structure resembling a question mark (Fig. 3B). The N-terminal LRR module (residues 1-382) is an elongated, fairly deep arc with 15 parallel β-strands on the concave face and mostly irregular extended structures on the convex face. Overall, the canonical architecture of this module is most similar to that of the NgR ectodomain (24He X.L. Bazan J.F. McDermott G. Park J.B. Wang K. Tessier-Lavigne M. He Z. Garcia K.C.

In total, there are twelve complete LRRs, 23-25 residues each, plus one partial repeat, which together create a classic right-handed super-helical array. Each LRR begins with a β-strand and loops back by virtue of the consensus 24-residue sequence repeat motif: XL2XXL5XL7XXN10XL12XXL15XXXXF20XXL23X, where X can be any amino acid; L are hydrophobic residues, preferentially Leu, but also Ile, Val, Met, Phe, or Thr; N are less conserved in nature and include mostly Asn, but also Cys, Asp, Leu, or Trp; F represents Phe or Leu. The consensus residues at the indicated positions make up the interior of the LRR domain. As in a number of other LRR-containing proteins, the hydrophobic core of the LRR structure is sheltered on both ends by cysteine-rich capping regions. The “N-cap” (residues 3-32) has two anti-parallel β-strands, wi"

Desensitization in the continuous presence of agonist has been difficult to study with available assay methods. Here, we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based live cell assay for the second messenger diacylglycerol to measure desensitization of a model seven-transmembrane receptor, the Gq-coupled angiotensin II type 1A receptor, expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In response to angiotensin II, we observed a transient diacylglycerol response reflecting activation and complete desensitization of the receptor within 2-5 min. By utilizing a variety of approaches including graded tetracycline-inducible receptor expression, mutated receptors, and overexpression or short interfering RNA-mediated silencing of putative components of the cellular desensitization machinery, we conclude that the rate and extent of receptor desensitization are critically determined by the following: receptor concentration in the plasma membrane; the presence of phosphorylation sites on the carboxyl terminus of the receptor; kinase activity of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, but not of G protein-coupled receptor kinases 3, 5, or 6; and stoichiometric expression of β-arrestin. The findings introduce the use of the biosensor diacylglycerol reporter as a powerful means for studying Gq-coupled receptor desensitization and document that, at the levels of receptor overexpression commonly used in such studies, the properties of the desensitization process are markedly perturbed and do not reflect normal cellular physiology.

The family of heptahelical receptors, also called seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) 4The abbreviations used are: 7TMR, seven-transmembrane receptor; AT1AR, angiotensin II type 1 receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; DAG, diacylglycerol; DAGR, DAG reporter; PKC, protein kinase C; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; AngII, Angiotensin II; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin. or G protein-coupled receptors, regulates myriad physiological and pathological signal transduction pathways. Despite a large diversity of ligands, including catecholamines, chemokines, lipids, peptides, odorants, and photons, these receptors share remarkable similarity in their intracellular regulatory mechanisms. Classically, receptor function is initiated by ligand-induced activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. This is followed by receptor inactivation, mediated by receptor phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and other kinases, β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization (1DeWire S. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R. Shenoy S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). This inactivation results in desensitization, the loss of agonist efficacy following sustained stimulation. Until recently our appreciation of the kinetics of 7TMR molecular pharmacology has been limited to extrapolation from either complex in vivo readouts such as changes in blood pressure or from biochemical techniques such as phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays (3Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), which cannot be performed in live, unperturbed cells. Thus, it has not been possible to observe receptor level desensitization in the continuous presence of agonist, the situation that most closely parallels many physiological circumstances. Consequently, despite a vast literature on 7TMR desensitization, uncertainty remains regarding how this process modulates receptor signaling kinetics. The advent of fluorescent biosensor technology and the increasing number of intracellular signal indicators afford the opportunity to refine our understanding of heptahelical receptor signal kinetics. Indeed, these novel approaches have elucidated the spatiotemporal details of heptahelical receptor signaling at subcellular and sub-second scale (4Ghanouni P. Gryczynski Z. Steenhuis J.J. Lee T.W.

These powerful new technologies include fluorescent small molecule indicators (9Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), green fluorescent protein-fused protein localization (10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and most recently resonance energy transfer-based measurements of protein modification, protein conformational change, and protein-protein interactions (11Giepmans B.N. Adams S.R. Ellisman M.H. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2006; 312: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar). Such biosensors have the potential to provide a new appreciation of 7TMR desensitization kinetics. Thus, we set out to develop an assay system that affords sensitive and non-disruptive measurement of 7TMR signal regulation. This would allow us to test the specificity and kinetics of GRK and β-arrestin functions for receptor signal output. Using the angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR) as a model, we designed a system that elucidates the kinetics of receptor regulation by real-time detection of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG). This has enabled us to determine the rate of receptor desensitization in the continuous presence of a constant ligand concentration and to test how changing concentrations of receptor, GRKs, and β-arrestins alter desensitization kinetics. Plasmids—pcDNA3-DAGR and pcDNA3-CYPHER have been described previously (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1AR, pRK5-GRK2 (encoding bovine GRK2), pcDNA3-β-arrestin1-FLAG, and pcDNA3-β-arrestin2-FLAG (encoding rat β-arrestins) have all been described previously (12Kim J.

HA-tagged AT1AR or AT1AR-13A were PCR amplified from respective plasmid templates and with PCR primers tagged with restriction enzymes BamH1 and SalI and cloned into pTRE2-hyg to make pTRE2-hyg-HA-AT1AR and pTRE2-hyg-HA-AT1AR-13A. siRNA and Plasmid Transfections—GRK2, 3, 5, and 6 siRNA were all previously described (12Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Transfection of GRK2 siRNA plus 100 ng of pcDNA3-DAGR into HEK-TetOn-AT1AR cells was performed using Gene Silencer (Gene Therapy Systems) as previously described (12Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J.

To compensate for GRK2 siRNA-mediated receptor up-regulation, 50 ng/ml doxycycline was added to control samples and no doxycycline was added to GRK2 siRNA samples, resulting in equivalent expression levels. For β-arrestin1/2 silencing via siRNA, control siRNA or siRNA targeting both β-arrestins1 and 2 (15Gesty-Palmer D. Chen M. Reiter E. Ahn S. Nelson C.D. Wang S. Eckhardt A.E. Cowan C.L. Spurney R.F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 10856-10864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) plus 100 ng of pcDNA3-DAGR were transfected into HEK-TetOn-AT1AR cells using Gene Silencer. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml doxycycline to induce a modest level (170 fmol/mg) of angiotensin receptor expression, which was not different between the two siRNA conditions. For β-arrestin and GRK2 overexpression experiments, the 1 μg of the appropriate β-arrestin plasmid or 0.5 μg of pRK5-bGRK2 was cotransfected with 100 ng of pcDNA3-DAGR into a 10-cm plate of AT1AR-293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells were maintained in minimum essential Eagle's medium (M2279; Sigma) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Where applicable, G418 was used at 500 μg/ml for selection and 150 μg/ml for maintenance and hygromycin was used at 250 μg/ml for selection and 150 μg/ml for maintenance. AT1AR-stable HEK-293 cells (AT1AR-293) have been described previously (14Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and were cultured in the presence of 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Creation of Tet-inducible HEK-TetOn-AT1AR Cells—HEK-293 cells were transfected with pTET-On and subjected to G418 (500 μg/ml) selection for 3 weeks. Stable clones were selected based on their ability to inducibly express the AT1AR from transient transfection of pTRE2-hyg-HA-AT1AR and subsequent treatment with 1 μg/ml doxycycline or vehicle for 48 h. A second round of transfection was performed with pTRE2-hyg-HA-AT1AR, and cells were subjected to hygromycin selection (200 μg/ml) for 3 weeks. Positive clones were selected based on low background and ability to induce AT1AR expression in response to doxycycline. Receptor expression was determined in all experiments using previously described standard protocols for binding assays using fractional occupancy (16Laporte S.A. Servant G. Richard D.E. Escher E. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Pierce). Constitutive AT1AR expression in these cell lines was very low (10-150 fmol/mg total protein) but up-regulated in a dose-dependent fashion upon addition of the tetracycline analogue doxycycline to 500-1500 fmol/mg total protein. Careful titration experiments revealed that in several clonal transfectant cell lines we could reliably select for specific receptor density across a range of ∼10-fold. Receptor concentrations reported as fmol/mg protein convert to number of receptors/cell as follows: 100 fmol/mg protein equals ∼90,000 receptor/cell, based on our measurement of 1.5 ng of protein/HEK-293 cell. Immunoblotting—To confirm either protein overexpression or silencing, a portion of the cells used for imaging were lysed and run on SDS-PAGE gels according to standard protocols. Western blots were performed using the following antibodies, endogenous β-arrestins with A1CT at 1:3000, GRK2 with GRK2-C15 at 1:1000 (S-562; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and transiently expressed β-arrestins with FLAG M2 at 1:1000 (F1804; Sigma). Chemiluminescent detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified by a charge-coupled device camera (Syngene ChemiGenius2); representative images are shown as inverted grayscale. Reagents—FURA2-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (F1221) and was used with 15 min of preincubation at 1 μg/ml. Valsartan was obtained from Novartis and was used at a concentration of 1 μm. Angiotensin II was purchased from Sigma (A9525) and was used at 100 nm concentration in all experiments. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was purchased from Sigma (P1585) and used at a concentration of 1 μm. Doxycycline hyclate was purchased from Sigma (D9891) and used at concentrations ranging from 50 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml as indicated. Calphostin C was purchased from Calbiochem and used at 2 μm. Imaging—For all imaging experiments, 24 h prior to assay cells were split and plated to imaging dishes precoated with fibronectin. Cells were washed once and placed in imaging buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and imaged in the dark on a stage heated to 37 °C. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a Roper Micromax cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) controlled by Slide-Book 4.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) images were obtained through a 436/20 excitation filter (20 nm bandpass centered at 436 nm), a 455DCLP (dichroic longpass mirror), and separate emission filters (480/30 for CFP and 535/30 for FRET). Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) intensity was imaged through a 500/20 excitation filter, 515LP dichroic mirror, and 535/30 emission filter. All optical filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Excitation and emission filters were switched in filter wheels (Lambda 10-2; Sutter Instruments). Integration times were varied between 100 and 300 ms to optimize signal and minimize photobleaching. To assess AT1AR activation and desensitization kinetics via real-time measurement of DAG, we used the fluorescent biosensor DAGR (diacylglycerol reporter) (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). DAGR consists of the DAG-binding C1 domain from protein kinase C βII (amino acids 37-152) fused between the cyan and yellow variants of green fluorescent protein, monomeric CFP and monomeric YFP (Fig. 1A) (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). DAGR exhibits intramolecular FRET, which depends upon the distance and orientation between the two fluorophores (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, DAGR molecules can undergo intermolecular FRET whenever DAGR concentration is high enough to allow close proximity (<10 nm). When DAG is generated by the activation of phospholipase C, DAGR translocates from the cytosol to bind DAG in the plasma membrane. This translocation increases the effective concentration of DAGR at the membrane, resulting in increased intermolecular FRET. This mechanism is distinguished from conformational change-induced intramolecular FRET changes (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J.

Whereas intramolecular, conformation-dependent FRET changes are concentration independent, intermolecular FRET is proportional to the amount of DAGR present. Increasing DAGR concentration, measured by the FRET-independent YFP intensity of single transiently transfected cells, causes increasing FRET changes between untreated cells and cells treated with a saturating dose of the DAG analogue phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (supplemental Fig. S1A), confirming the mechanism of action of DAGR. We then used DAGR to monitor the dynamics of Angiotensin II (AngII) stimulation of the AT1AR. To avoid concerns of AT1AR dysregulation caused by expression above physiological levels, we generated clonal HEK-293 cell lines stably transfected with tetracycline-inducible AT1AR to control receptor expression. In HEK-TetON-AT1AR cells expressing moderate amounts of AT1AR (150fmol/mg protein) and transfected with DAGR, time lapse DAGR experiments reveal both the kinetics and subcellular location of DAG signals (Fig. 1B). Prior to agonist addition, DAGR is cytosolic (shown with the FRET-independent YFP image) and FRET is low (blue pseudocolor). Thirty seconds after AngII addition, DAGR translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where FRET increases (red pseudocolor). Quantification of the FRET ratio time lapse (FRET intensity/monomeric CFP intensity, normalized to base line) in single cells showed that AngII led to a rapid increase in DAG (peaking after ∼15 s), followed by a slower return to base line (after ∼5 min) (Fig. 1C). This DAG transient was completely blocked by the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan. Because DAGR functions by binding DAG and could potentially buffer DAG concentrations, we addressed concerns that DAGR could perturb normal AT1AR signaling. We evaluated signal output downstream of DAG by measuring angiotensin-stimulated protein kinase C activity with the fluorescent biosensor CKAR (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). 100 nm AngII stimulated transient protein kinase C (PKC) activity, which was entirely dependent on phospholipase C, DAG, and PKC as assessed by a panel of inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S1B). When CKAR is co-expressed with a red fluorescent analogue of DAGR (mRFP1-C1-mRFP1) that translocates after AngII stimulation to a similar extent as DAGR, PKC activity was indistinguishable from CKAR expressed with free mRFP1 (Fig. 1D). This indicates that the amount of DAG bound by DAGR did not significantly affect DAG-dependent signaling and thus validates DAGR as a nondestructive assay of AT1AR signaling. The transient nature of the AngII-stimulated DAG signal reflects rapid rates of AT1AR desensitization as well as DAG clearance by diacylglycerol kinases. Receptor desensitization is mediated by either GRK receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment (1DeWire S. Ahn S. Lefkowitz R. Shenoy S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar) or by second messenger-regulated kinase receptor phosphorylation (identified for the AT1AR as PKC) (17Balmforth A.J.

Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To test the effect of receptor phosphorylation on DAG, we generated a mutant angiotensin II receptor with all 13 serines and threonines in the carboxyl-terminal tail (subsequent to the seventh transmembrane helix) mutated to alanine, named “13A”. These residues are required for agonist-induced AT1AR phosphorylation, β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization (20Conchon S. Peltier N. Corvol P. Clauser E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E336-E345PubMed Google Scholar, 21Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 343 (Pt. 3): 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48255-48261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We compared the signal kinetics of WT and 13A AT1AR and found the two display strikingly different patterns of DAG generation (Fig. 2A). Compared with the transient DAG signal from WT AT1AR, 13A AT1AR exhibits a larger and prolonged DAG signal. This difference is consistent with a rapid (<5 min) phosphorylation-mediated desensitization of the AT1AR. This result is not unique to HEK-293 cells, as preliminary comparison of WT and 13A in TetOn-U2-osteosarcoma cells gave the same result (data not shown). Similar results were found in HEK-293 cells with CYPHR, a FRET sensor for phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate/inositol triphosphate, that like DAGR reflects phospholipase C activity (8Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1C). Consistent with these results, AT1AR internalization, a phosphorylation-dependent process (22Qian H. Pipolo L. Thomas W.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1706-1719PubMed Google Scholar), is rapid and nearly complete for cells expressing wild-type (WT) receptor, whereas mutant 13A AT1AR completely fails to internalize (Fig. 2B). We also evaluated calcium signals as a more distal measure of receptor function. In contrast to DAG, calcium dynamics do not correlate well with receptor desensitization; WT and 13A receptors gave similar calcium responses (Fig. 2C), consistent with post-receptor mechanisms of calcium regulation (reviewed in Refs. 25Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4213) Google Scholar, 26Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We thus conclude that DAGR can measure Gq-coupled receptor regulation with high temporal fidelity, which allows us to explore the regulation of receptor desensitization. Using tetracycline induction of receptor expression, we then determined the effect of receptor density on DAG kinetics and receptor desensitization. As already noted in Fig. 1C, we found that at low receptor expression (<100 fmol/mg protein, equivalent to 90,000 receptors/cell) AngII-stimulated DAG is transient, returning to base line after 2-3 min (Fig. 3A). This represents a surprisingly rapid and profound desensitization of the AT1AR. In contrast, at increasingly higher, but still moderate, receptor expression (up to 375 fmol/mg protein), the rapid phase of desensitization is progressively lost, leading to sustained DAG. An expanded time scale (Fig. 3B) shows that the initial rate of DAG accumulation correlates with receptor expression and illustrates how rapidly desensitization occurs (within 30 s) at low receptor density. We next tested the effect of altering 13A AT1AR expression on DAG. As expected, this mutant fails to desensitize even at very low density (30 fmol/mg protein), and the primary effect of increasing receptor expression is increased rate of DAG generation and higher maximum DAG signal (Fig. 3C). An expanded time scale (Fig. 3D) shows the effect of receptor expression on rate of accumulation and the contrast with the kinetics of WT-AT1AR-stimulated DAG transients. The initial rate of DAG accumulation (10-20 s after agonist addition) is highly correlated with receptor expression (r2 = 0.98, supplemental Fig. S1D) and is similar for both WT and 13A AT1AR. This indicates that at these low and moderate receptor concentrations, receptor expression is the limiting factor in a DAG response. Furthermore, the similarity of initial DAG accumulation for WT and 13A AT1AR indicates that the 13A mutant elicits normal G protein coupling to phospholipase C. Because AT1AR desensitization is dramatically impaired even at moderate expression levels, we investigated the mechanisms of desensitization for this receptor. Because β-arrestins desensitize signaling by binding receptors and sterically interdicting G protein coupling, the desensitization capacity of β-arrestins could become stoichiometrically limited by AT1AR expression levels above the concentration of endogenous β-arrestins. To test this hypothesis, we used a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line with dramatic overexpression of the AT1AR (1200 fmol/mg protein). Cells transfected with a vector plasmid display sustained DAG after AngII stimulation, typical of lost desensitization (Fig. 4A). However, we found that overexpression of either β-arrestin1 or 2 could fully restore normal desensitization kinetics to this cell line. This led us to conclude that 1) β-arrestins are the limiting component to AT1AR desensitization at high receptor expression, and 2) both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are capable of desensitizing the AT1AR. Because other work has shown that overexpressed, angiotensin-stimulated AT1AR co-immunoprecipitates both endogenous β-arrestins (12Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we have further concluded that the two β-arrestins are redundant for AT1AR desensitization. To confirm the importance of receptor phosphorylation for β-arrestin-mediated AT1AR desensitization, we repeated these experiments with 13A AT1AR. As expected, exogenous β-arrestin expression did not restore desensitization to the non-phosphorylatable 13A AT1AR (Fig. 4B). This result solidifies the role of phosphorylation as a necessary intermediate between receptors and β-arrestins in the desensitization process. In contrast to β-arrestins, overexpression of GRK2, the kinase responsible for most AT1AR phosphorylation (12Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), suppressed detectable DAG accumulation altogether (Fig. 4A). However, similar results for GRK2 were obtained using the 13A mutant receptor (Fig. 4B) and with a kinase-inactive K220M GRK2 mutant (27Ferguson S.S. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) for the WT AT1AR (data not shown). These results suggest this effect is not related to GRK2 kinase activity and most likely corresponds to G protein sequestration ascribed to an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling)-like domain of GRK2 (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 29Sallese M. Mariggio S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of GRK3, the closest homologue of GRK2, did not suppress the DAG signal (data not shown). We confirmed Gαq as the locus of the profound signal inhibition caused by GRK2 overexpression: Gαq overexpression, presumably saturating the RGS activity of GRK, partially rescued the signal suppression (supplemental Fig. S2). Despite this, the finding that 13A AT1AR completely fails to desensitize in the presence of endogenous levels of GRK2 (Fig. 2A) suggests that GRK2 kinase activity, and not the RGS function, is the primary regulator of acute AT1AR desensitization. Given these results and the concern that results derived from overexpressed GRKs and β-arrestins may not reflect physiologically relevant functions, we evaluated the effects of siRNA-mediated silencing of the endogenous β-arrestin/GRK system. Although individual silencing of neither β-arrestin1 nor β-arrestin2 significantly altered WT AT1AR desensitization (data not shown), simultaneous silencing of both β-arrestins significantly abrogated des"

Structurally, T7 RNAP is similar to the pol I family of DNA-directed DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases and shows high sequence homology to mitochondrial RNA polymerases (1Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Being a single subunit enzyme, T7 RNAP serves as a model RNAP in understanding the mechanism and regulation of transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. The mechanism of transcription initiation by T7 RNAP is relatively well understood. The kinetic pathway of initiation has been dissected and the steps of promoter DNA and initiating NTP binding as well as promoter DNA melting have been quantified (3Jia Y. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30147-30153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also provided a more detailed understanding of the transition process from initiation to elongation in T7 RNAP (5Guo Q. Nayak D. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. J. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mechanism of transcription elongation catalyzed by T7 RNAP has not been characterized in detail, partly because elongation is an intermediate phase of transcription that begins only after 9–12 nt of RNA is made through promoter-specific initiation (8Bandwar R.P. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the single subunit T7 RNAP, the transition from initiation to elongation is achieved through major refolding events of the N-terminal domain. The refolding process changes a part of the T7 RNAP structure, that facilitates promoter escape and the channeling of the 5′-end of the RNA into an RNA channel (12Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that T7 RNAP can assume the refolded elongation structure in the presence of a promoter-free elongation substrate (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S.

Therefore, T7 RNAP can bypass the initiation phase and catalyze the elongation of RNA in a minimal promoter-free elongation substrate that consists of an RNA/DNA hybrid of 8 bp and a downstream duplex DNA that provides the template for RNA synthesis (16Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The minimal pathway of transcription elongation includes the steps of NTP binding, phosphodiester bond formation (the chemical step), product release, and translocation of RNAP on the DNA for next nucleotide incorporation. High resolution structures of T7 RNAP in the elongation state have provided evidence for conformational changes accompanying NTP binding and PPi release (2Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M.

Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A correct NTP binds to the open state of T7 RNAP in a preinsertion site, where it interacts with the residues along the O helix (2Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). NTP in the preinsertion site makes base specific contacts with the templating base, but it does not interact with the two metal ions required for the chemical step. NTP binds to the closed state of T7 RNAP in the insertion site, where it interacts with the two metal ions that catalyze the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation reaction. It has been proposed that correct NTP binding triggers the open to closed conformational change and that this step plays a role in the selection of a correctly base-paired ribonucleotide. Such a conformational change linked to correct NTP binding has been proposed and kinetically characterized in various other polymerases (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

In this paper, we have dissected the minimal pathway of single nucleotide incorporation during transcription elongation catalyzed by T7 RNAP using transient state kinetic methods. We have used a synthetic promoter free RNA/DNA elongation substrate composed of an 8-bp RNA-DNA hybrid with a 2-base tail at the 5′-end. The minimal kinetic pathway reported here describes the equilibrium binding affinity of T7 RNAP for the elongation substrate, the time taken by T7 RNAP to assume an elongation-competent state, the binding affinity of correct NTP, the rate of NMP incorporation, and the kinetics of pyrophosphorolysis. In addition, we have designed transient state kinetic experiments to investigate the nature of the rate-limiting step in the pathway of single nucleotide incorporation. These studies have measured the rate constants of the elementary steps in the single nucleotide incorporation cycle and therefore provide a kinetic framework for future investigation of structure-function, fidelity, and processive RNA synthesis during the elongation phase of transcription.

Purified enzyme was stored at –80 °C in buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 1 mm Na3-EDTA, and fresh 1 mm DTT) containing 100 mm sodium chloride and 50% (v/v) glycerol. Enzyme concentration was calculated from its absorbance at 280 nm and molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105 m–1 cm–1 (28King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E.

Assembly of the Promoter-free Elongation Substrate—Template DNA, non-template DNA, and 5′-32P-labeled RNA were mixed in 1:1.5:1 ratio in the transcription buffer at a final concentration of 20 μm, heated at 95 °C for 20 min, then stepwise cooled from 75, 55, and 45 °C for 20 min each, 20 °C for another 25 min, and finally to 4 °C for an hour. The transcription buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and fresh 2 mm dithiothreitol. Rapid Chemical Quench-Flow Experiments—Pre-steady-state kinetic experiments were conducted at 25 °C using a Model RQF-3 chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). T7 RNAP and VSR10 (50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm DTT) mixture was loaded in one syringe of the quenched-flow instrument and NTP (50 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm DTT) in the second syringe. The reactions were rapidly mixed and quenched at various times with EDTA (0.2 m final concentration) or 1 n HCl from a third syringe. The HCl-quenched reactions were treated with chloroform and neutralized with 0.25 m Tris base and 1 m NaOH. Pyrophosphorolysis—Pyrophosphorolysis kinetics were measured using VSR11 in the rapid quenched-flow instrument. To determine the Kd of PPi, the reactions were carried out for 0.5 s at various PPi concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10 mm. Total Mg2+ was kept constant at 20 mm. RNA products <10 nt were resolved on polyacrylamide sequencing gel and were quantitated and plotted against the respective PPi concentration. The data were fit to a hyperbola (Equation 2) and analyzed as described below. Analysis of the Transcription Products—RNAs were resolved on a 20% polyacrylamide, 1.5% Bis, 7 m urea gel (Bio-Rad sequencing gel apparatus). The gel was exposed to a phosphor screen, scanned on a Typhoon 9410 PhosphorImager instrument (Amersham Biosciences), and quantitated using the ImageQuaNT software (GE Healthcare). The fraction of RNA primer converted to products was determined from the ratio of their respective counts to the total counts, and the concentration of the products was determined by multiplying the fraction with the concentration of the RNA primer. The kinetics were fit to Equation 1 using SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific).Y=y0+(1−Aexp(−kobst))(Eq. 1) Y is the fraction or molar amount of products, y0 is the y intercept or background, A is the amplitude or the total amount of products formed during the reaction, and kobs is the observed rate constant of product formation. The observed rate, kobs, plotted as a function of [NTP] was fit to Equation 2.kobs=kpol[NTP]Kd+[NTP](Eq. 2) Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the NTP, and kpol is the maximum rate constant of NMP incorporation. Global fitting of the sequential addition of two nucleotide kinetics was fit using MATLAB (MathWorks Inc) (gfit, open-source software for global analysis of experimental data, also available from the authors). Nitrocellulose-DEAE Double Filter Binding Assay—The binding affinity of T7 RNAP for the elongation substrate, VSR10, was determined by the nitrocellulose-DEAE filter binding assay (29Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 30Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DEAE and nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) were treated with 0.5 m NaOH for 5 min, washed thoroughly with doubly distilled water, then equilibrated in the transcription buffer for 12–24 h before use. Radiolabeled VSR10 (0.3 μm) and T7 RNAP (0–2 μm) were preincubated for 30 min, filtered through a bilayer of nitrocellulose and DEAE membranes under vacuum, and washed with the transcription buffer. The filters were dried and exposed to phosphor screens. The counts on the nitrocellulose membrane gave a measure of the amount of T7RNAP-VSR10 complex, and that on the DEAE provided the amount of free VSR10. The fraction bound (FB) was calculated as the ratio of counts on nitrocellulose to total counts (nitrocellulose + DEAE counts). The concentration of the bound VSR10 ([ED]) was obtained by multiplying the fraction bound with 0.3 μm. The Kd was determined by fitting the plot of bound complex against total T7 RNAP (Et) to Equation 3.[ED]=(Kd+[Et]+[Dt])−(Kd+[Et]+[Dt])2−4[Et][Dt]2(Eq. 3) Promoter-free Elongation Substrate—The design of the promoter free elongation substrate (VSR10) was based on the previous elongation studies of T7 RNAP (11Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Temiakov D. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47035-47043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A 37-mer DNA template was annealed to a 10-mer RNA and 27-mer nontemplate DNA strand to create an 8-bp RNA-DNA hybrid and 29-bp duplex coding region (Fig. 1). This substrate contained a 2-nt gap; therefore the 2 bases of the template DNA to be immediately copied by T7 RNAP were single stranded. The 5′-end of the RNA contained a 2-nt tail and was labeled with 32Pi for monitoring the elongation kinetics. Equilibrium Binding of T7 RNAP and the Elongation Substrate—The affinity of T7 RNAP for the elongation substrate VSR10 was determined using the nitrocellulose-DEAE filter binding assay (see “Materials and Methods”). In this assay, radiolabeled VSR10 was incubated with varying amounts of T7 RNAP for 30 min and the mixture was filtered through nitrocellulose-DEAE membranes. T7 RNAP-VSR10 complex bound to the nitrocellulose membrane and free VSR10 bound to the DEAE membrane was determined at each T7 RNAP concentration. Fig. 2 shows the hyperbolic increase in the concentration of VSR10-T7 RNAP complex as a function of increasing T7 RNAP concentration. The data were fit to a quadratic equation (Equation 3) that provided an equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd of 96 ± 18 nm for the VSR10-T7 RNAP complex and an amplitude of 0.2 μm. Slow Binding of T7 RNAP to the Promoter-free Elongation Substrate—The kinetics of T7 RNAP binding to VSR10 were investigated by following the elongation of 10-mer RNA to 11-mer under defined mixing conditions. In setup one, T7 RNAP was preincubated with radiolabeled VSR10 for at least 30 min before initiating the reaction by mixing with UTP. In setup two, T7 RNAP was not preincubated with VSR10, and the elongation substrate was added with UTP to initiate the reaction. The elongation of 10-mer to 11-mer in setup one under the preincubated conditions occurred at a rapid rate constant of 123 ± 19 s–1 and amplitude of 0.8 (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, the elongation of 10-mer to 11-mer in setup two under the non-preincubated conditions was extremely slow and occurred with an observed rate constant of 0.01 ± 0.0007 s–1, which is >4000 times slower than the rate of UMP incorporation. The slow rate constant of single nucleotide incorporation remained unchanged with higher concentrations of T7 RNAP (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the bimolecular rate constant of T7 RNAP binding to the promoter-free substrate does not appear to be the slow step. The results indicate that a slow conformational change prior to or subsequent to binding must limit the observed rate of correct UMP incorporation in the VSR10 substrate under the non-preincubated conditions. The Refolding of T7 RNAP Is a Slow Step—The N-terminal domain of T7 RNAP undergo major refolding events to assume the elongation competent conformation (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 11Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that the refolding of T7 RNAP is a slow step that limits the rate constant of UMP addition in the above experiments under the non-preincubated conditions. The kinetics of T7 RNAP refolding from its initiation conformation to the elongation conformation can be probed by limited trypsin digestion (8Bandwar R.P. Tang G.Q. Patel S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 360: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The 170–180 loop of T7 RNAP is susceptible to trypsin cleavage in the initiation conformation. Therefore, the full-length 98-kDa T7 RNAP-promoter complex is cleaved into 80- and 20-kDa fragments during limited trypsin digestion (Fig. 3C, lane 3) (the 20-kDa fragment is further digested to 15- and 5-kDa fragments and not shown). When T7 RNAP assumes the elongation conformation, the 170–180 loop is refolded into subdomain H, which forms part of the RNA channel, and hence the lysines in this loop are protected from trypsin cleavage. In the elongation conformation, however, T7 RNAP does not interact with the promoter; hence, the lysine in the 98–100 loop becomes susceptible to trypsin. Therefore, T7 RNAP bound to the promoter-free elongation substrate VSR10 is cleaved into 88- and 10-kDa fragments (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Appearance of the 88 kDa and disappearance of the 80 kDa are therefore signatures of initiation to elongation conformational changes. T7 RNAP was incubated with VSR10 for different time intervals ranging from 5 s to several minutes, and then treated with trypsin very briefly (estimated 5 s) before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3C shows the time course of the change in the proteolysis pattern indicating a conformational change in T7 RNAP upon binding to the promoter-free elongation substrate. It is clear from the results that the initiation to elongation conformational change is slow and occurs at a rate constant (0.01 s–1) (Fig. 3D) that is very similar to the observed rate constant of UMP incorporation in setup two under the non-preincubated conditions (see above). These results support the idea that the refolding of T7 RNAP from its initiation conformation to the elongation competent conformation is a slow step that limits the incorporation of nucleotide into the RNA primer in the promoter-free substrate. kpol and Kd of Correct Nucleotide Incorporation—The kinetics of correct UMP addition were measured under single turnover conditions (1 μm VSR10 and 2 μm T7 RNAP) with the goal of determining the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the intrinsic rate constant of UMP addition (kpol). Promoter-free substrate was preincubated with T7 RNAP for at least 15 min before initiating the reaction with UTP in a rapid chemical quenched-flow instrument. After various time intervals from 2 ms to 20 s, 1 n HCl was added to quench the reactions. The kinetics of 10-mer elongation to 11-mer were measured at various [UTP]. The RNAs were resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel (Fig. 4A), and the time course of 11-mer RNA formation was fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 1) to obtain the rate constant of UMP addition at each UTP concentration. The observed rate constants were plotted against [UTP] (5–250 μm) and the concentration dependence was fit to a hyberbolic equation (Equation 2), which provided UTP Kd of 76 ± 33 μm and kpol of 222 ± 40 s–1 (Fig. 4B). Pulse-Chase Experiments—Structural studies of T7 RNAP indicate that NTP binds via a minimal two-step mechanism involving a conformational change following NTP binding (2Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase and pulse-quench experiments were designed to investigate whether the isomerized complex after NTP binding accumulates during the reaction, that is whether the chemical step or the conformational change upon NTP binding was the rate-limiting step. In the pulse-quench conditions, the acid quenches all the enzyme-bound species immediately, whereas in the pulse-chase conditions, the reactions are chased with excess cold UTP, and this allows for the enzyme-bound species to be converted to products during the chase time. If chemistry is rate-limiting, then the isomerized enzyme-bound species will accumulate and consequently depending on the mechanism either a faster rate or higher amplitude of UMP addition will be observed in the pulse-chased conditions relative to the pulse-quenched conditions. In the pulse-quenched experiment, a solution of T7 RNAP-VSR10 complex was rapidly mixed with [α-32P]UTP, and after predetermined reaction times quenched with 1 n HCl (Fig. 5A). In the pulse-chase experiment, T7 RNAP-VSR10 complex was rapidly mixed with [α-32P]UTP, and after predetermined reaction times the complex was mixed with excess of unlabeled UTP chase for 10 s, sufficient time for chasing intermediates, before acid quenching. The resulting 11-mer radiolabeled RNA was resolved from the free [α-32P]UTP on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 5B), and its molar amount was plotted against the reaction time. The kinetics of 11-mer formation under pulse-chase or pulse-quench conditions (Fig. 5C) were identical (35 s–1). In both cases, the amplitude was close to 60%. The experiments were repeated several times and overlapping kinetics of UMP incorporation was observed under pulse-chase and pulse-quench conditions. The experimental results indicate that an isomerized ternary complex such as a closed T7 RNAP-VSR10-UTP ternary complex does not accumulate during the reaction. We therefore conclude that the chemical step must be faster than the conformational change step accompanying the NTP binding step. Kinetics of UTPαS Incorporation—The single turnover kinetics of UMPαS addition was measured to investigate the nature of the rate-limiting step in the pathway of correct nucleotide addition (18Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 31Kuchta R.D. Cowart M. Allen D. Benkovic S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 947-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). T7 RNAP was preincubated with VSR10 for 30 min and mixed with 50 μm UTP or 50 μm UTPαS(Sp isomer) for various predetermined reaction times before quenching with 1 n HCl. The single turnover kinetics of UMP or UMPαS addition (Fig. 6) were fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 1) with rate constants of 88 ± 11 s–1 and 125 ± 14 s–1 for UTP and UTPαS, respectively, and amplitudes close to 70%. The ratio of rate constants kUTP/kUTPαS, 88/125 = 0.7, indicates that the thio-UMP is incorporated as efficiently as the normal nucleotide substrate, suggesting that the chemical step is not rate-limiting. Kinetics of Sequential Addition of Two Nucleotides—The kinetics of two nucleotides was measured to investigate whether any of the steps after phosphodiester bond formation such as PPi release and/or translocation of T7 RNAP are significantly slower. The kinetics of 10-mer elongation to 11-mer and 12-mer was measured in a rapid quench-flow instrument by mixing T7 RNAP-VSR10 with a mixture of UTP and CTP. Quantitation of the RNA (Fig. 7A) show the time dependent disappearance of the 10-mer, formation and decay of the 11-mer intermediate, and the formation of the final 12-mer product with lag kinetics (Fig. 7B). We observed about 40% conversion of 10-mer to 12-mer in this experiment. This amplitude appears to be variable; therefore, we assumed that only 40% of the T7 RNAP-VSR10 complex was productive in the sequential model used to fit the kinetic data. Global fitting of the kinetics to a sequential nucleotide addition model (see “Materials and Methods”) provided rate constants of 11-mer (120 s–1) and 12-mer (100 s–1) formation. From the observation that the rate constant of 11-mer formation is very close to that of 12-mer formation, we conclude that the steps after the incorporation of the first nucleotide such as PPi release/translocation are not significantly slow to limit the addition of the next nucleotide. Pyrophosphorolysis—Pyrophosphorolysis is the exact reverse reaction of nucleotide incorporation during which the product PPi bound to the R"

The discovery that zebra tarantulas secrete a silk-like substance from their feet, and use it to help them cling to smooth vertical surfaces, introduces a new source of spider silk as well as a new attachment mechanism. This provides a window on the evolution of spider silk: the genetics involved in producing this tarsal silk should indicate whether the original function of spider silk was to increase traction or whether it was later co-opted for that purpose. An unsuspected attachment mechanism may help these huge spiders to avoid catastrophic falls. Spiders spin silk from specialized structures known as abdominal spinnerets — a defining feature of the creatures1,2 — and this is deployed to capture prey, protect themselves, reproduce and disperse. Here we show that zebra tarantulas (Aphonopelma seemanni) from Costa Rica also secrete silk from their feet to provide adhesion during locomotion, enabling these spiders to cling to smooth vertical surfaces. Our discovery that silk is produced by the feet provides a new perspective on the origin and diversification of spider silk."
https://openalex.org/W2047712983,"The ribosomal protein L12ab (Rpl12ab) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is modified by methylation at both arginine and lysine residues. Although the enzyme responsible for the modification reaction at arginine 66 has been identified (Rmt2), the enzyme(s) responsible for the lysine modification(s) has not been found, and the site(s) of methylation has not been determined. Here we demonstrate, using a combination of mass spectrometry and labeling assays, that the yeast gene YDR198c encodes the enzyme responsible for the predominant epsilon-trimethylation at lysine 10 in Rpl12ab. An additional site of predominant epsilon-dimethylation is observed at lysine 3; the enzyme catalyzing this modification is not known. The YDR198c gene encodes a SET domain similar to that of the Rkm1 enzyme responsible for modifying Rpl23ab, and we have now designated the YDR198c gene product as Rkm2 (ribosomal lysine methyltransferase 2). The effect of the loss of the enzyme on ribosomal complex stability was studied by polysomal fractionation. However, no difference was observed between the Deltarkm2 deletion strain and its parent wild type strain. With the identification of this enzyme, it appears that the 12 SET domain family members in yeast can now be divided into two subfamilies based on function and amino acid sequence identity. One branch includes enzymes that modify histones, including Set1 and Set2; the other branch includes Rkm1, Rkm2, and Ctm1, the cytochrome c methyltransferase. These studies suggest that the remaining seven SET domain proteins may also be lysine methyltransferases."

Three codons are used as stop signals in most organisms: UAA, UGA, and UAG. In bacteria, two class I RFs are required for termination: RF1, which recognizes UAA and UAG codons, and RF2, which recognizes UAA and UGA codons. In contrast, a single RF, eRF1 or aRF1, is sufficient for termination at all three stop codons in eukaryotes and archaea, respectively. eRF1 and aRF1 form closely related protein families but are evolutionarily distinct from the eubacterial RFs (4Kisselev L. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 8-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, despite a similar function, the only sequence element common to all RFs is a tripeptide sequence, GGQ. Structural and mutational analysis shows that this motif is essential for RF activity and is required to interact with the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit and trigger hydrolysis of the ester bond in peptidyl-tRNA (5Petry S.

It is remarkable that the modification of Gln in the GGQ motif is conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes despite the different evolutionary origin of the class I RFs themselves. The S. cerevisiae genome encodes two proteins, Ydr140w and Ynl063w, with significant similarity to bacterial PrmC that goes beyond the motifs known to be involved in AdoMet binding (7Dinçbas-Renqvist V. Engström Å. Mora L. Heurgué-Hamard V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6900-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Ydr140w was shown to lead to a loss of eRF1 methylation (8Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Mora L. Merkulova-Rainon T. Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. J. Biol.

Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2562-2571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Methylation of eRF1 by Ydr140w differs from prokaryotic RF methylation in that the presence of the class II RF (eRF3 in yeast), and GTP was also required. The substrate of the yeast MTase therefore appears to be the ternary complex eRF1·eRF3·GTP rather than eRF1 alone. The role of class II factors in eubacteria is to catalyze the recycling of the class I RFs following peptide release (12Zavialov A.V. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar); in eukaryotic organisms the role of eRF3 seems to be closer to that of EF1α and leaves the ribosome after peptide release (14Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, a significant difference between eubacterial and eukaryotic factors is that, in the presence of GTP, the class I and class II factors (eRF1 and eRF3) bind to each other (15Kobayashi T. Funakoshi Y. Hoshino S. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45693-45700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the eubacterial factors do not. Archaea appear to have no class II RF. Some observations made during the characterization of Ydr140w as the eRF1 MTase in S. cerevisiae suggested that at least one further component, in addition to the ternary complex eRF1·eRF3·GTP and Ydr140w, is required for methylation of eRF1 (8Heurgué-Hamard V.

Only impure preparations of Ydr140w, produced in yeast, were able to methylate RFs in vitro, and with low efficiency. Overproduction of Ydr140w in E. coli led exclusively to insoluble protein, but even when resolubilized by routine renaturation methods, no MTase activity could be detected. Polevoda et al. (9Polevoda B. Span L. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2562-2571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) confirmed the function of Ydr140w in methylation of eRF1, but their assays were also performed with partially purified components and resulted in a low efficiency of methylation. Other studies of proteins interacting with Ydr140w in yeast, either by two-hybrid mapping or by tandem affinity purification-tagged co-purification, followed by mass spectrometry, identified Ynr046w, a 15-kDa protein, as a component interacting with Ydr140w (16Ito T.

Furthermore, affinity studies showed that two S. cerevisiae tRNA MTases, Trm11p and Trm9p, and a further protein, Lys9p, apparently bind to Ynr046w (16Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M.

Biol. 2003; 23: 9283-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and Purushothaman et al. (19Purushothaman S.K. Bujnicki J.M. Grosjean H. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4359-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) demonstrated the requirement for both Ynr046w and Trm11p for m2G10 formation in yeast tRNA. Lys9p is a dehydrogenase with a Rossman fold similar to that in most RNA MTases. Sequence analysis has revealed the existence of Ynr046w orthologs within the three kingdoms of life (19Purushothaman S.K. Bujnicki J.M. Grosjean H. Lapeyre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4359-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, archaeal and bacterial proteins from this family are much shorter (about 55-65 residues) than eukaryotic proteins (about 130 residues; Fig. 1). Hence, Ynr046w is made of a central region specific for eukaryotic members (“insert” domain, residues 39-101) inserted within a region conserved in the three kingdoms of life (“conserved” domain, residues 1-38 and 102-135). Among fungal orthologs, this latter domain harbors a putative zinc finger signature made of the 11CX5C16 and 112CX2C115 motifs (where X can be any residue; from the N- and C-terminal parts, respectively). Here we show that Ynr046w is required as a subunit of the eRF1 MTase in S. cerevisiae. In vitro, purified Ydr140w, Ynr046w, and AdoMet are necessary and sufficient to methylate the ternary complex eRF1·eRF3·GTP. Finally, we present the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structure of this small protein and show that it comprises two domains: a domain built from both N-terminal and C-terminal sequences that contains a zinc-binding site and an inserted domain, absent from bacterial and archaeal orthologs of the protein, composed of three α-helices. Bacterial Growth—LB medium was supplemented according to requirements. Antibiotics were added at the following final concentration: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; ampicillin, 200 μg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 15 μg/ml. When induction was necessary to overexpress proteins, 1 m IPTG was added to liquid medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. For expression of Ynr046w, alone or as a complex with Ydr140w, ZnCl2 was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. Recombinant DNA Manipulations—General procedures for DNA recombinant techniques, plasmid extraction, etc. were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast eRF1 and Truncated eRF3 Expression Vectors—pYSC1, a derivative of pET11a plasmid encoding eRF1 with a His6 tag on its C terminus, was constructed by gene cloning between the NdeI and BamHI sites. Amplification was performed on chromosomal DNA from yeast strain yIBPC27. The upstream oligonucleotide (5′-AATACTTCACATATGGATAACGAGGT-3′) introduces an NdeI site. The downstream oligonucleotide (5′-CGCGGATCCTTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGAATGAAATCATAGTCGGACCCTTCA-3′) introduces a new BamHI site, eliminating the original one upstream of the stop codon, and encodes the His6 tag. pYSC2, also a derivative of pET11a, encodes yeast eRF3 truncated at the N terminus. Amplification of genomic DNA was done with the following oligonucleotides, introducing, respectively, the NdeI site followed by the His6 tag (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCACCACCACCACCACCACTTTGGTGGTAAAGATCACGTTTC-3′) and the BamHI site (5′-GCGGATCCTTTACTCGGCAATTTTAAC-3′). MTase Ydr140w and Ynr046w Subunit Expression Vectors— pVH450 encodes Ynr046w with a His6 tag at its C terminus and pVH451 encodes the same protein without tag. Both are derivatives of the pET11a vector with a kanamycin cassette and were constructed in the same way after genomic DNA amplification from yeast strain yIBPC27. The upstream oligonucleotide, 5′-TAGCCTAGTCCATATGAAGTTCTT-3′, the same in both cases, introduces an NdeI site. The downstream primers are 5′-ACACAGGGATCCCGCTTGATTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTACCAGGTGTGGAGGTAACAGCAA-3′ for pVH450 and 5′-ACACAGGGATCCCGCTTGATTTATAC-3′ for pVH451. For co-expression experiments, Ydr140w with a His6 tag on its C terminus was also expressed from plasmid pACYCDuet (ydrH6) compatible with pET plasmids. The gene encoding Ydr140wH6 was cloned in two steps (fragment NdeI-BamHI and fragment NdeI-NdeI) between NdeI and BsrGI in the MCS2 of pACYC-Duet1 (Novagen). pACYCDuet(ydrH6) was constructed from plasmid pTrc(ydr140wH6), a derivative of pVH383 itself derived from pVH371 (8Heurgué-Hamard V.

In the first step, Ydr140w gene was cloned from pVH371 into pLV1 between NdeI and BamHI sites to yield pVH383. A His6 tag was then introduced by inserting phosphorylated oligonucleotides (5′-GTACAGCTTTACAAGGCACCACCACCACCACCACTGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCCTTGTAAAGCT-3′) between the BsrGI and BamHI sites to give pTrc(ydr140wH6). Protein Expression and Purification—After transformation of BL21(DE3) Rosetta by the relevant plasmids, the expression of His-tagged eRF1 or truncated His-tagged eRF3 (eRF3Ct) was induced by IPTG (1 mm) at 16 °C at an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5 in LB medium with appropriate antibiotics, followed by growth overnight. For eRF1, the cells were resuspended in buffer A1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm imidazole) with EDTA-free antiprotease (Roche Applied Science) and broken by passage through a French press. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA resin (Sigma). The column was washed with buffer A1 and eluted with buffer A1 with 150 mm imidazole but no NaCl. Fractions containing protein were dialyzed against buffer A2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and concentrated by ultrafiltration through Amicon Ultra 30 (Millipore). For eRF3, the cells were resuspended in buffer B1 (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm imidazole) with EDTA-free antiprotease (Roche Applied Science) and broken by passage through a French press. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA resin (Sigma). The column was washed with buffer B1 and eluted with buffer B1 with 150 mm imidazole but no NaCl. Fractions containing protein were concentrated by ultrafiltration through Amicon Ultra 30. Imidazole was eliminated by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 in buffer B2 (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Ynr046wH6 was expressed alone in BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene). Co-expression of Ydr140wH6 and Ynr046w was done in the same strain at 23 °C after induction with 1 mm IPTG at an optical density (600 nm) of 0.5 in LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics, followed by growth overnight. Purification of Ynr046wH6 alone or the complex (Ydr140wH6·Ynr046) was performed as described for eRF1 purification with small modifications. Buffer A1 was modified to buffer C1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm ZnCl2). Elution was performed with buffer C1 with 50 mm imidazole and no NaCl. Fractions containing protein were dialyzed against buffer C2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm ZnCl2). Protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration through Amicon Ultra 30 for the complex and Amicon Ultra 10 for Ynr046wH6 alone. In Vitro Recombinant Ydr140w Purification from Inclusion Bodies—Production of Ydr140w alone in E. coli was achieved as described by Heurgué-Hamard et al. (8Heurgué-Hamard V. Champ S. Mora L. Merkulova-Rainon T. Kisselev L.L. Buckingham R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2439-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from pVH371. Purification was carried out according to Vuillard and Freeman (dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C08/C08Links/www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/protocols/inclusion.html). This procedure involves solubilization of proteins from inclusion bodies by guanidinium chloride, followed by rapid dilution in the presence of nondetergent sulfobetaines to limit aggregation. The pellet from 150 ml of bacterial suspension was resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm DTT containing 0.35 mg/ml lysozyme and then incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. Triton X-100 was added to a concentration of 1% (v/v), and the cells were broken by passage through a French press. The extract was treated with DNase I (20 μg/l) for 1 h at 37°C and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet (inclusion bodies) was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and then solubilized for 1 h at 4°Cin 2 ml of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine HCl, 25 mm DTT. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min, the insoluble material was removed. The protein concentration in the supernatant was adjusted to 1 mg/ml (from 30 mg/ml) using 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine HCl, 25 mm DTT and then diluted 10-fold as quickly as possible with cold folding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 m NDSB201). After 1 h at 4 °C,the protein solution was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In Vitro Methylation Assays—Methylation assays were performed in buffer D (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 10 μm [3H]AdoMet (0.86 Ci/mmol). GTP, GDP, or GDPNP were added at a final concentration of 1 mm. The samples were withdrawn at different times, and the reaction was stopped by cold trichloroacetic acid (5%) precipitation, followed by filtration on Whatman GF/C filters and measurement of radioactivity by scintillation counting. Each time point corresponds to 9 pmol of eRF1, 9 pmol of eRF3, and the amount of enzyme as indicated in the figure legends (3 pmol of Ydr140w and 3 pmol of Ynr046w in Fig. 4; 6 pmol of Ydr140w from inclusion bodies and 30 pmol of Ynr046wH6, purified separately, in the experiment of Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Co-elution of His-tagged Ydr140w and nontagged Ynr046w from Ni-NTA resin with imidazole.

The proteins were separated on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting with antibodies (diluted 5000×) were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (diluted 5000×), SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and Kodak X-Omat AR. Crystallization and Resolution of the Structure—The protein was stored in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 μm ZnCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The crystals were grown at 19 °C from a 1:1 μl mixture of 10 mg/ml protein solution with 1.2 m KH2PO4,pH7. For data collection, the crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant crystallization solution with progressively higher ethylene glycol concentrations up to 30% (v/v). The 2 Å resolution single wavelength anomalous dispersion data at the zinc edge and the high resolution (1.7 Å) native data could be recorded on beamlines ID23-EH1 and ID23-EH2 (ESRF, Grenoble, France), respectively. The structure was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method using the anomalous signal from the zinc element. The data were processed using the XDS package (23Kabsch W.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The space group was C2 with one molecule/asymmetric unit. One zinc atom site was found with the program SHELXD in the 45-3.5-Å resolution range (24Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Refinement of the zinc atom, phasing, and density modification were performed with the program SHARP (25Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The quality of the final phases allowed automatic building of a partial model with the program RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). This model was then refined against the 1.7 Å data set with the Arp/wARP program that allowed automated construction of all the Ynr046w residues (27Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar). This model was refined using REFMAC and rebuild with the “TURBO” molecular modeling program (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/rubrique113.html). All of the residues from Met1 to His136 (the first residue of the His tag) are well defined in electron density and fall within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by the program Procheck (28Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In addition, 150 water molecules and one ethylene glycol molecule (used as cryoprotectant) have been built. Statistics for all of the data collections and refinement of the different structures are summarized in Table 1.

Attempts to produce soluble protein by reducing the level of induction, growing cells at lower temperatures or co-expressing chaperones were unsuccessful. Denaturation and renaturation of protein from inclusion bodies did yield substantial amounts of soluble Ydr140w. However, the resulting protein did not have methylation activity in vitro and appeared to be unfolded according to circular dichroism measurements. 7V. Heurgué-Hamard, M. Graille, N. Scrima, N. Ulryck, S. Champ, H. van Tilbeurgh, and R. H. Buckingham, unpublished data. On the basis of the data suggesting an interaction between Ydr140w and Ynr046w, we undertook to co-express these two proteins and study their behavior. As shown in Fig. 2, Ynr046w expressed in the absence of Ydr140w was found partly in the supernatant and partly in exclusion bodies. When expressed alone at 23 °C, Ydr140w was found exclusively in inclusion bodies, but when co-expressed with Ynr046w by the use of compatible plasmids, the major part of Ydr140w was found in the soluble fraction, together with Ynr046w (Fig. 2). An interaction between Ydr140w and Ynr046w was previously shown by TAP purification when Ynr046w was tagged (17Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M.

Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3950) Google Scholar). After co-expression in E. coli of His-tagged Ydr140w (Ydr140wH6) and Ynr046w, we determined whether Ynr046w could bind efficiently to Ydr140wH6 immobilized on Ni-NTA resin. The data in Fig. 3 show that the two proteins co-elute from the column at an imidazole concentration of 50 mm. Using a similar purification protocol, Ynr046w alone did not bind to Ni-NTA resin (data not shown). Analytical gel filtration experiments realized on the Ynr046w·Ydr140wH6 purified complex shows that it has an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, a value slightly higher than that expected for a heterodimer (40.8 kDa, because Ynr046w and Ydr140wH6 are 15- and 25.8-kDa proteins, respectively; data not shown). In comparison, the Ynr046w protein has an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa, a value close to that expected for a homodimer (30 kDa; data not shown).

Murry-Tait V. Thompson C. Arthur J.S. BMC Dev. Biol. 2003; 3: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We discovered that ERK5 expression in the brain is maximal during early embryonic development and declines as the brain matures (16Liu L. Cavanaugh J.E. Wang Y. Sakagami H. Mao Z. Xia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ERK5 and ERK5-regulated MEF2 gene expression contribute to BDNF-promoted survival of developing, but not mature neurons cultured from the cortex and cerebellum (16Liu L. Cavanaugh J.E.

Bonni A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7326-7336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ERK5 is highly expressed in developing neurons of the central nervous system and plays a critical role in their survival, it is crucial to define ERK5 signaling mechanisms in central nervous system neurons. The only known signaling molecule mediating ERK5 activation in central nervous system neurons is MEK5 (16Liu L. Cavanaugh J.E. Wang Y. Sakagami H. Mao Z. Xia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here, we used primary cultured cortical neurons from embryonic day (E) 16-17 rodents to investigate signaling pathways that mediate BDNF stimulation of ERK5.

The anti-Rab5 antibody, Poly-d-lysine and laminin were purchased from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). The monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody, forskolin, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), and phenylarsine oxide (PAO) were purchased from Sigma.

The anti-p-ERK5 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA), the anti-p-ERK1/2 antibody from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell Culture—Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 (E17) Sprague-Dawley rats as described (4Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liu L. Cavanaugh J.E. Wang Y. Sakagami H. Mao Z. Xia Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated neurons were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 35-mm dish. Neurons were cultured in basal medium Eagle (BME, Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 35 mm glucose, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plates and glass coverslips were coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. Neurons were cultured for 5 days in vitro (DIV5) before BDNF treatment or harvesting. Cortical Neuron Cultures from MEKK2-deficient Mice—MEKK2-deficient mice have been described (26Guo Z. Clydesdale G. Cheng J. Kim K. Gan L. McConkey D.J. Ullrich S.E. Zhuang Y. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5761-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The heterozygous MEKK2+/- mice were bred to generate MEKK2-/- and MEKK2+/+ littermates. At E16, cortical neurons were prepared from individual single embryo using the same conditions as for rat E17 cortical neurons described above. The genotype of each embryo was determined afterward by PCR as described (26Guo Z. Clydesdale G. Cheng J. Kim K. Gan L. McConkey D.J. Ullrich S.E. Zhuang Y. Su B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5761-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used were: P1 (5′-AGTGTTTTGCTTTTATTATGCT-3′), P2 (5′-AGAAAAACCGAAACTTTACACTAGA-3′), and P3 (5′-AAT TCT CTA GAG GTC CAG ATC CC-3′) (P1 + P2 for wild-type, P1 + P3 for knock-out). At DIV 5, neurons were treated with 50 ng/ml BDNF for 1 h and assayed for ERK5 kinase activity or nuclear translocation. Transient Transfection of Primary Cortical Neurons—Cortical neurons (6 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently transfected at DIV3 using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation protocol as described (27Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitates were prepared by mixing 1 volume of DNA in 250 mm CaCl2 with an equal volume of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm d-glucose, and 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.07). The precipitates were allowed to form for 25-30 min at room temperature before addition to the cultures. The conditioned culture media were removed and saved. Cells were washed three times with BME, and 4.5 ml of transfection media were added to each 60-mm dish. The transfection media consisted of BME supplemented with 1 mm sodium kynurenate, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES. The pH of the transfection media was kept high by incubating BME in a dish at 37 °C and 0% CO2 for 30 min to de-gas. 180 μl of the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitates were added dropwise to each 60-mm dish and mixed gently. Plates were incubated at room temperature and ambient air for 5 min and then in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 35-45 min. The incubation was stopped 20-25 min after the layer of precipitate formed on the plates by shocking the cells for 2 min with 1× HBS, 1 mm sodium kynurenate, 10 mm MgCl2 in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol. Cells were then washed three times with 2 ml of BME. The saved conditioned media were added back to each plate, and cells were returned to the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 48 h before BDNF treatment or harvesting. Rap1 and Ras Activation Assay—The fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the Rap binding domain of RalGDS (GST-RalGDSRBD) was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli DH5α cells as described (29Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound, active Rap1 protein (Rap1GTP) was detected as described (25Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 30Wu C. Lai C.F. Mobley W.C. J Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5406-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is based on the specific binding between the GTP-bound, activated form of Rap1 (i.e. Rap1GTP) and the Rap binding domain of the RalGDS protein (RalGDSRBD). Briefly, rat E17 cortical neurons were lysed on ice for 10 min in fishing buffer (FB) which contains10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Ten micrograms of GST-RalGDSRBD fusion protein were prebound to agarose-glutathione conjugates, and then added to 300 μg of cortical neuron lysates. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1-2 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed four times in cold FB and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The amount of active Rap1GTP bound to GSTRalGDSRBD fusion protein that is coupled to glutathione-agarose beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using an anti-Rap1 antibody. Ras activation was analyzed using Ras Activation Assay kit (Upstate) per the manufacturer's instruction. Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed as described (4Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared and protein concentrations assayed by the Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein extracts (300 or 600 μg) were used for each kinase assay. To measure ERK5 activity, cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 2.5 h with either 6 μl of a polyclonal anti-ERK5 antibody (for endogenous ERK5) or 2.5 μg of a polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (for transfected FLAG-ERK5). Protein A-Sepharose beads (60 μl) were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The activity of ERK5 in the immune precipitates was quantitated by a kinase assay using recombinant GSTMEF2C (5 μg) and [32P]ATP as the substrates (5Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Activated MEKK2 or MEKK3 can phosphorylate multiple MEKs in vitro including MKK4 and MEK5 (32Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14489-14496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because GSTMKK4 is commercially available, we used it as the substrate in the in vitro kinase assay to monitor the biochemical activities of MEKK2 and MEKK3. To measure the activities of transfected MEKK2 or MEKK3, cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 2.5 h with 2.5 μg of anti-HA antibody. Protein G-Sepharose beads (60 μl) were then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The activity of MEKK2 and MEKK3 in the immune precipitates was quantitated by a kinase assay using recombinant GST-MKK4 (2 μg) and [32P]ATP as the substrates. Quantitation of kinase activity was achieved by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or by using the ImageQuant program after scanning the autoradiographic images, and normalized by protein expression based on Western analysis. Reporter Gene Assays—The Gal4-MEF2C-driven, Gal4-luciferase reporter gene expression was assayed as described (4Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (33Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 × 106 cells were plated onto each well of a 24-well plate coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. At DIV3, cells were co-transfected with the Gal4-luciferase reporter construct (1.2 μg DNA/4 wells), Gal4-MEF2C fusion protein construct (0.9 μg DNA/4 wells), and EF1a.LacZ DNA (0.55 μg DNA/4 wells). Where indicated, cortical neurons were also cotransfected with various expression vectors for the ERK5 signaling pathways. Cells were treated 40 h after transfection with 50 ng/ml BDNF for 6 h when indicated. Cell lysates were prepared, and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured as described (33Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The reporter gene luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as the fold induction relative to control. Assay of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was determined by nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation after Hoechst staining (28Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Healthy cells have evenly and uniformly stained nuclei. To facilitate detection of apoptosis in transfected cells, cortical cultures were cotransfected with an expression vector encoding β-galactosidase (UB6-Lacz) as a marker for transfected cells, To obtain unbiased counting, slides were coded, and cells were scored blindly without prior knowledge of treatment. Data Analysis—Data were either the averages or representatives of at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis of data were performed using one-way analysis of variance. Error bars represent S.E. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; n.s., not statistically significant (p > 0.05). BDNF Induces Sustained Activation of ERK5 in E17 Cortical Neurons—To investigate signaling pathways responsible for BDNF stimulation of ERK5, we prepared primary neurons from embryonic day (E) 17 rat cortex. In initial experiments, we examined the kinetics for ERK5 activation after BDNF treatment and compared it to ERK1/2 activation. The kinase activities of ERK1/2 and ERK5 were directly measured by in vitro kinase assays using MBP or GST-MEF2C fusion protein as substrates, respectively (Fig. 1). BDNF activated both ERK1/2 and ERK5 in E17 cortical neurons. Like ERK1/2 activation, ERK5 activation was prolonged and sustained for at least 12 h after BDNF treatment. However, the peak of ERK5 activity occurred later than ERK1/2 and did not reach a maximum until 1-2 h after BDNF treatment. In contrast, ERK1/2 was maximally activated by BDNF 10 min after BDNF treatment. The kinetics for activation of ERK1/2 and ERK5 in E17 cortical neurons is similar to that in postnatal cortical neurons (4Cavanaugh J.E. Ham J. Hetman M. Poser S. Yan C. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 434-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BDNF Activation of ERK5 Is Mediated by Receptor-mediated Endocytosis—Receptor-mediated endocytosis has been implicated in sustained neurotrophin signaling (34Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Howe C.L. Valletta J.S. Rusnak A.S. Mobley W.C.

Upon BDNF treatment for 20 min, we detected co-immunostaining of phospho-ERK5 and Rab5 (supplemental Fig. S1), a marker for endosomes (38Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the notion that ERK5 is found in endosomes following neurotrophin stimulation (39Shao Y. Akmentin W. Toledo-Aral J.J. Rosenbaum J. Valdez G. Cabot J.B. Hilbush B.S. Halegoua S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Dynamin, a large G protein, is involved in clathrin-dependent and -independent receptor-mediated endocytosis (40Song B.D. Schmid S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutation of dynamin inhibits internalization of neurotrophin receptors (10Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if BDNF activation of ERK5 depends on receptor-mediated endocytosis, cortical neurons were transiently transfected with a dominant negative (dn) dynamin mutant (K44A) to block receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type dynamin and cloning vector were used as controls. Cortical neurons were also co-transfected with FLAG-tagged, wild-type ERK5 to facilitate detection of ERK5 in transfected cells. In contrast to the wild-type dynamin, expression of the dnDynamin completely abolished BDNF stimulation of ERK5 (Fig. 2A). As a control for specificity, neurons were co-transfected with the dynamin constructs and wild-type, HA-tagged ERK2. Although dnDynamin attenuated BDNF stimulation of ERK2 (Fig. 2B), it had no effect on ERK2 activation by forskolin (Fig. 2C). Forskolin activates adenylyl cyclases which increase intracellular cAMP, thereby activating ERK2 (41Xia Z. Storm D.R. The Mammalian Adenylyl Cyclases. R. G. Landes Company, Mol. Biol. Intelligence Unit, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with the reports that neurotrophin but not cAMP regulation of ERK1/2 signaling in neurons is regulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis (36York R.D. Molliver D.C. Grewal S.S. Stenberg P.E. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These results also demonstrate that expression of the dnDynamin specifically inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis, rather than nonspecifically interfering with MAP kinase signaling. Cortical neurons were also co-transfected with ERK5 and a temperature-sensitive (ts) dynamin mutant (G273D) (10Watson F.L. Heerssen H.M. Bhattacharyya A. Klesse L. Lin M.Z. Segal R.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G273D Dynamin protein functions as a wild-type protein at the permissive temperature (33 °C), but as a dominant-negative protein at the non-permissive temperature (39 °C). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h after transfection to allow expression of the transgenes, at which time the expression of tsDynamin can be detected by Western analysis. The cells were then incubated at 33 °C or 39 °C for 30 min, followed by BDNF treatment for 1 h. BDNF stimulated ERK5 in the presence of co-transfected tsDynamin at the permissive temperature (33 °C), but not at the non-permissive temperature (39 °C) (Fig. 2D). The fact that transfection of tsDynamin did not affect the ability of BDNF to stimulate ERK5 at the permissive temperature suggests that overexpression of tsDynamin per se does not interfere with endocytosis. In the absence of co-transfected tsDynamin, BDNF activated ERK5 at 39 °C, excluding the possibility that BDNF activation of ERK5 is inhibited at 39 °C. Moreover, we did not observe any morphological changes or cell death of cortical neurons during the 1.5-h incubation at 33 or 39 °C. Thus, expression of the tsDynamin selectively blocks BDNF activation of ERK5, presumably because it blocks receptor-mediated endocytosis. To further investigate the role of receptor-mediated endocytosis in BDNF signaling to ERK5, we utilized phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor widely used to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis (42Boudin H. Sarret P. Mazella J. Schonbrunn A. Beaudet A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5932-5939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zwaagstra J.C. El-Alfy M. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27237-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44Piper M. Salih S. Weinl C. Holt C.E. Harris W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We pretreated cortical neurons with 5 nm PAO, a concentration specific for inhibition of endocytosis (45Gibson A.E. Noel R.J. Herlihy J.T. Ward W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C182-C184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous ERK5 is normally a cytoplasmic protein but translocates to the nucleus upon BDNF stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B). PAO inhibited BDNF-induced nuclear translocation of endogenous ERK5, suggesting PAO suppression of ERK5 activation. Furthermore, treatment with PAO greatly attenuated BDNF stimulation of endogenous ERK5 kinase activity (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained using monodansylcadaverine (MDC) (Fig. 4A), another endocytosis blocker (35Howe C.L. Valletta J.S. Rusnak A.S. Mobley W.C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 801-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Treatment with PAO or MDC attenuated BDNF stimulation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3D and Fig. 4B) but had no effect on forskolin stimulation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3E and Fig. 4C), demonstrating the specificity of PAO and MDC for endocytosis. Together, data in Figs. 2, 3, and 4 suggest that BDNF activation of ERK5 in cortical neurons depends on receptor-mediated endocytosis.FIGURE 4BDNF activation of ERK5 in cortical neurons is inhibited by MDC, an endocytosis blocker.

Encoded by the MHC they are a family of highly polymorphic peptide receptors presenting peptide antigens for the surveillance by T cells. We have shown that certain organic compounds can amplify immune responses by catalyzing the peptide loading of human class II MHC molecules HLA-DR. Here we show now that they achieve this by interacting with a defined binding site of the HLA-DR peptide receptor. Screening of a compound library revealed a set of adamantane derivatives that strongly accelerated the peptide loading rate. The effect was evident only for an allelic subset and strictly correlated with the presence of glycine at the dimorphic position β86 of the HLA-DR molecule. The residue forms the floor of the conserved pocket P1, located in the peptide binding site of MHC molecule. Apparently, transient occupation of this pocket by the organic compound stabilizes the peptide-receptive conformation permitting rapid antigen loading. This interaction appeared restricted to the larger Glyβ86 pocket and allowed striking enhancements of T cell responses for antigens presented by these “adamantyl-susceptible” MHC molecules. As catalysts of antigen loading, compounds targeting P1 may be useful molecular tools to amplify the immune response. The observation, however, that the ligand repertoire can be affected through polymorphic sites form the outside may also imply that environmental factors could induce allergic or autoimmune reactions in an allele-selective manner.

Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 430: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After internalization, they are fragmented by proteases and loaded onto class II MHC molecules in a process catalyzed by the chaperone HLA-DM (2Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 3Weber D.A. Evavold B.D. Jensen P.E. Science. 1996; 274: 618-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Processing and loading take place in a dedicated endosomal compartment (MCII vesicle) (4Watts C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After transport to the cell surface the peptide·MHC complexes are presented to CD4+ T cells, which upon recognition induce the antigen-specific immune response. On the cell surface some of these peptides are displayed for up to 100 h (5Cella M. Engering A. Pinet V. Pieters J. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1997; 388: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). A considerable fraction of the peptide·MHC molecules, however, dissociates during presentation, so that also “empty” MHC molecules are always present on class II MHC expressing cells. They are particularly abundant on immature dendritic cells, where they seem to play a role in cell membrane-associated antigen processing by capturing of extracellular antigens (6Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Carven G.J. Belyanskaya S.L. Strominger J.L. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15056-15061Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Santambrogio L. Sato A.K. Fischer F.R. Dorf M.E. Stern L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In general, however, the ligand composition of MHC molecules should reflect the protein content of the cell rather than that of the environment. Uncontrolled antigen capture by empty MHC molecules on the cell surface therefore has to be avoided. Presumably as a safeguard mechanism class II MHC molecules inactivate rapidly after dissociation of the ligand. They convert into a “non-receptive” state (8Rabinowitz J.D. Vrljic M. Kasson P.M. Liang M.N. Busch R. Boniface J.J. Davis M.M. McConnell H.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which is characterized by the inability of the MHC molecule to bind new peptide ligands. While, in principle, this inactivation is reversible, reconversion into the peptide-receptive state is extremely slow. In previous studies we have shown that certain organic compounds, such as aliphatic alcohols and phenol derivatives, have an intrinsic capacity to accelerate the peptide loading of class II MHC molecules (9Falk K.

Although their catalytic activity is rather weak, the effect is mediated nonetheless by a defined mechanism (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). While we could establish that these organic compounds are able to re-induce the peptide-receptive state, the molecular basis of this transition remained unknown. A screening of a library of ∼20.000 organic compounds has now revealed a number of new catalytic molecules that accelerate peptide loading at substantially higher rates. Most importantly, however, the analysis of their catalytic activity revealed a striking allele selectivity, which allowed identifying their putative binding site. Compounds and Reagents—100 mm stock solutions of p-chlorophenol (pCP, Fluka) were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, 10% Me2SO; 2-(1-adamantyl)ethanol (AdEtOH, Sigma), 3-(1-adamantyl)-5-hydrazidocarbonyl-1H-pyrazole (AdCaPy), 4-(1-adamantyl)benzenesulfonamide (AdBeSA), 1-propionyladamantane (AdPr), 1-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)-ethoxycarbonyl]adamantane (AdCDME), and 1-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethoxycarbonyl]-3,5,7-trimethyladamantane (3M-AdCDME, all from Chemical Diversity) were dissolved in Me2SO (100 mm).

Phycoerythrin-(PE) and allophycocyanin-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Caltag, and α-HLA-DR-PE was obtained from BD Biosciences. Recombinant soluble HLA-DR1 (DRA*0101, DRB1*0101) was produced in S2 insect cells as described (2Sloan V.S. Cameron P. Porter G. Gammon M. Amaya M. Mellins E. Zaller D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Peptide Loading/Release of Soluble HLA-DR Molecules—Detection of the peptide·MHC complex was carried out by ELISA using a monoclonal α-HLA-DR capture antibody (L243, ATCC) and Eu3+-labeled streptavidin (DELFIA, Wallac) as described (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Peptide loading was determined with 1 μm HLA-DR and 100 μg/ml biotinylated peptide (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 37 °C, 1 h). Curve fit for kinetic binding experiments was carried out as hyperbola regression (f(x) = (ax)/(b + x)) using the SigmaPlot 8.0 software. For ligand release experiments 1.6 μm HLA-DR1 molecules were loaded overnight with biotinylated IC106-120 peptide, then diluted 1:3 and incubated with 200 μg/ml HA306-318 in the absence or presence of 1 mm AdEtOH. Cells—L1501 (DRB1*1501) and L1502 (DRB1*1502) were generated by stable transfection of L929 cells (ATCC) with DRA1*0101 and DRB1*1501 or DRB1*1501(Valβ86 → Gly), respectively. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell 721.221 (DRB1*0101) was obtained from ATCC, and MGAR cells (“IHW 9014”; DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101) and RML cells (“IHW 9016”; DRB1*1602, DRB5*0202) both were provided by K. Wucherpfennig. EvHA/X5 (DRB1*0101-restricted, HA306-318-specific) were derived from HLA-DR1tg mice (14Rosloniec E.F. Brand D.D. Myers L.K. Whittington K.B. Gumanovskaya M. Zaller D.M. Woods A.

Fugger. Peptide Loading of Cell Surface MHC Molecules—5 × 104 HLA-DR-expressing cells/well were incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal calf serum in a 96 well U-bottom plate with biotinylated peptide in the presence of catalytic compounds. After 4 h cells were washed and stained with streptavidin-PE alone or double-stained with α-HLA-DR-PE/streptavidin-APC and analyzed by FACS on a FACSCalibur or FACSCanto instrument (BD Biosciences). Cells were gated using a life-gate after staining with propidium iodide. T Cell Assay—5 × 104 HLA-DR-expressing cells/well were loaded for 4 h with peptides in the presence of catalytic compounds as described above. Cells were then washed, and 5 × 104 T cells were added to the culture, which was then incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal calf serum in 96-well U-bottom plates. The T cell response was determined in a secondary assay with CTL-L cells (ATCC) as described previously (9Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Marin-Esteban V. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transfection and Site-directed Mutagenesis of HLA-DR— L929 cells were co-transfected with two pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing the HLA-DR α-chain (DRA*0101) and the respective β-chain using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For binding assays cells were used that transiently expressed the MHC molecules. Stable lines were generated after selection with G418 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of HLA-DR β-chains was carried out in a pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following mutagenesis primers were used: DRB1*0101 (Glyβ86 → Val) and DRB5*0101 (Glyβ86 → Val), 5′-CACAACTACGGGGTTGTGGAGAGCTTCACAGTGCAG and DRB1*1501 (Valβ86 → Gly), 5′-CACAACTACGGGGTTGGTGAGAGCTTCACAGTGCAG. Docking and Energy Minimization—AdCaPy was docked by hand, with the support of the “Dock” module in Sybyl 6.92 software (Tripos Inc.), into the P1 pocket of the x-ray structures HA306-318·DRB1*0101 and of MBP86-100·DRB1*1501 (Protein Data Bank entry codes 1DLH and 1BX2, respectively). The minimizations were made with MOE (Chemical Computing Group Inc.) using the MMFF94x force field. The default protonation state and the charges were calculated. Water molecules in the x-ray structures were removed. All atoms within 9 Å from the AdCaPy ligand were minimized to an energy root mean square gradient of 0.05. The reported root mean square deviation values were calculated by MOE. Adamantane Derivatives Are Effective Catalysts for Peptide Loading of HLA-DR1 Molecules—The catalytic activity of organic molecules can be determined in vitro in a peptide loading assay with soluble class II MHC molecules (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this assay the amount of biotinylated peptide loaded onto the MHC molecule is determined by ELISA using HLA-DR-specific capture antibodies together with Eur3+-streptavidin. DRB1*0101 is an allelic variant of a human class II MHC proteins present in ∼20% of the Caucasian population. 7Due to the invariance of the α-chain, which in all cases is DRA1*0101, HLA-DR molecules are named in the manuscripts only by their β-chain. In a high throughput screening a soluble version of this MHC molecule was used to test the influence of ∼20.000 synthetic compounds on the loading with the high affinity peptide HA306-318 (data not shown). Less than 0.5% of the compounds showed any loading enhancement, but molecules carrying the bulky adamantyl group were frequently found to be active. Some examples are shown in Fig. 1. Within this set highest activity was detected for AdEtOH and AdCaPy. Nearly the same activity was determined for a adamantyl compound substituted with benzene-sulfonamide (AdBeSA) followed by AdCDME and AdPr. Although the chemical nature of the side chain had apparently some influence, the catalytic activity was largely determined by the adamantyl group itself. The introduction of additional methyl substitutions at the adamantyl core structure could completely abrogate its activity (3M-AdCDME). We have shown before that the interaction of the MHC molecule with organic compounds is fully reversible and based on the induction of a peptide receptive state (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The same applies also for the activity of adamantyl compounds. AdEtOH can therefore efficiently trigger the exchange of MHC-bound peptides with free peptides of higher affinity (Fig. 2A). IC106-120 was removed from soluble DRB1*0101 in less than 6 h, while almost no exchange is observed in the absence of the catalyst. No removal of IC106-120 was evident in the absence of free HA306-318, indicating that IC106-120 ligand was indeed replaced by the high affinity peptide. The induction of the receptive state was also evident in enhanced peptide loading (Fig. 2B). Without any catalysts more than 20 h were needed to reach half-maximal loading of DRB1*0101 with the HA306-318 peptide. The presence of AdEtOH or AdCaPy, however, reduced t1/2 to ∼30 min. The enhancement of the on-rate was clearly dose-dependent (Fig. 2C) and up to a concentration of 1 mm compound did not show saturation (Fig. 2D). Allele Selectivity of Adamantyl Compounds—Catalytic organic compounds can be used not only with recombinant MHC proteins but also with living cells to mediate loading with peptides and T cell antigens (9Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Marin-Esteban V. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2709-2715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Autoimmun. 2003; 20: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, AdEtOH and AdCaPy enhanced the loading of two cell surface HLA-DR molecules DRB1*0101 and DRB1*0401 with HA306-318. Loading was in fact much more effective than with pCP, an aromatic compound previously shown to exhibit some catalytic activity on HLA-DR molecules (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No loading was detected on fibroblast cells that do not express any class II MHC molecules, demonstrating HLA-DR specificity of the adamantyl-mediated loading enhancement. Extension of the experiments to cells expressing other allelic variants of HLA-DR, however, produced unexpected results (Fig. 3B). MGAR cells are Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells which naturally express the HLA-DR variants DRB1*1501 and DRB5*0101 and IC106-120 and MBP86-100 are known to bind to these cells. When loading MGAR cells with the two peptides enhancement by AdEtOH and AdCaPy was indeed observed for IC106-120 (left panel). Notably, however, the two adamantyl compounds completely failed to enhance loading with MBP86-100, while pCP was able to increase the loading of both peptides (middle panel). The effect was not due to the MBP86-100 peptide, since loading of DRB1*1602-expressing RML cells could be improved by AdEtOH (right panel). To dissect this phenomenon, experiments were repeated with fibroblast cells each expressing only one of the two HLA-DR molecules present on MGAR cells (Fig. 3C). IC106-120 binds with higher affinity to DRB5*0101, since virtually no binding was detected on DRB1*1501 expressing cells. MBP86-100, on the other hand, preferentially binds to DRB1*1501 and only weakly to DRB5*0101. pCP enhanced the binding of both peptides to the respective HLA-DR molecule but AdEtOH enhanced only the binding of IC106-120 on DRB5*0101. No enhancement was detected for the binding of MBP86-100 to DRB1*1501, suggesting that DRB1*1501 was “non-susceptible” to adamantyl-mediated catalysis. Adamantyl Susceptibility Correlates with Residue Glyβ86—The result of the previous experiment implicated that adamantyl compounds exhibit catalytic activity only on a subset of HLA-DR molecules. A comparison of catalytic activity with the allelic variations in fact suggested a correlation of susceptibility with a well known dimorphism at position 86 of the β-chain (16Ong B. Willcox N. Wordsworth P. Beeson D. Vincent A. Altmann D. Lanchbury J.S. Harcourt G.C. Bell J.I. Newsom-Davis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7343-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In HLA-DR molecules this position is represented either by glycine (Glyβ86) or valine (Valβ86) (17Rammensee H.G. Bachmann J. Stevanovic S. MHC Ligands and Peptide Motifs. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 55-60Google Scholar). All MHC molecules susceptible to adamantyl compounds expressed glycine at this position, while DRB1*1501, the only non-susceptible molecule identified so far, expressed valine at β86 (Table 1).TABLE 1Correlation of adamantyl susceptibility of HLA-DR molecules and Gly/Val dimorphism at position β 86 Natural allelic variants of HLA-DR and HLA-DR molecules mutated at position β 86 are listed with regard to the occupation of the dimorphic position β 86 and their susceptibility to adamantyl-mediated antigen loading. Susceptibility of underlined variants has already been confirmed by peptide loading assays in this study, bold letters indicate the variants shown in Fig. 4.

After transfection of fibroblast cells the influence of organic compounds was tested again in a peptide loading experiment. While with pCP the enhancement was evident on all wild type and mutant forms of HLA-DR, AdEtOH was active only on variants expressing Glyβ86 (DRB1*0101wt, DRB5*0101wt, and DRB1*1501 Valβ86 → Gly). Substitution of this residue by valine rendered the Glyβ86 variants non-susceptible to AdEtOH (DRB1*0101 Glyβ86 → Val, DRB5*0101 Glyβ86 → Val), while Valβ86-expressing DRB1*1501, normally not affected by AdEtOH, is strongly susceptible when Valβ86 is replaced by glycine (DRB1*1501 Valβ86 → Gly). Allele-selective Enhancement of the CD4+ T Cell Response— The major function of class II MHC molecules is to present peptide antigens to CD4+ T cells. Improved antigen loading by organic compounds therefore directly increases the sensitivity of the antigen-specific CD4+ T cell response (9Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Marin-Esteban V. Puentes F.

Autoimmun. 2003; 20: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). On DRB1*0101 the presence of AdEtOH during antigen loading can lead to shifts of the dose-response curves of almost 2 orders of magnitude (Fig. 5A). Without any catalyst the threshold concentration for the in vitro T cell response against the influenza virus-derived HA306-318 antigen was slightly above 10 ng/ml peptide. 50 μm AdEtOH reduced the detection limit to 1 ng/ml peptide, and 250 μm AdEtOH further shifted the threshold to almost 0.1 ng/ml. The effect by AdEtOH, however, is evident only when the antigen is presented by a susceptible HLA-DR molecule. As shown in Fig. 5B, enhancement is evident for the HA306-318-specific CD4+ T cell response when presented by Glyβ86-expressing DRB1*0101 and DRB1*0401 molecules. The same applies also for the MBP86-100-specific response restricted by DRB1*1502. Absolutely no enhancement is observed when the antigen is presented by DRB1*1501. The two DRB1*15 variants differ only in the substitution at β86 (DRB1*1502, Glyβ86; DRB1*1501, Valβ86) and both are able to present the antigen to the 2E12 T cell hybridoma. Due to the allele selectivity of AdEtOH, however, enhancement is evident only when the T cell recognizes the antigen on the susceptible DRB1*1502 molecule. In this study we showed that low molecular weight compounds exist, which are able to enhance the immune response in an allele-specific way. By targeting a polymorphic binding site on the class II MHC molecule they induce a conformational transition that allows the rapid ligand exchange. The presence of these compounds during antigen loading can therefore result in dramatic enhancements of antigen-specific T cell responses. The effect is limited to immune responses restricted by “susceptible” MHC molecules. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this susceptibility correlates with the presence of a glycine residue at position β86 of the class II MHC molecule. The residue is located in the peptide binding site and forms the floor of the conserved pocket P1 (18Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). At least for the adamantyl compounds P1 therefore seems to be the target site to exhibit their catalytic effect. In complex with the peptide, P1 accommodates an anchor side chain of the peptide ligand (19Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar, 21Falk K. Rotzschke O. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Residue β86 restricts the depth of P1 (18Stern L.J. Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 22Smith K.J. Pyrdol J. Gauthier L. Wiley D.C. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), so that Valβ86 pockets can bind only small aliphatic anchor side chains (Ile, Leu, Val, and Met), whereas deeper Glyβ86-containing pockets accommodate also larger aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, and Trp) (Fig. 6B). Compared with the smaller pCP molecule, which enhances peptide loading irrespective of β86, the spherical adamatyl group requires significantly more space (Fig. 6C). Allele-selective enhancement by adamantyl compounds might therefore be due to the increased space requirements. Computational docking and energy minimization calculations indicated that only the Glyβ86-containig P1 pocket is in fact large enough for the bulky adamantyl group. While in a simulation the adamantyl group of AdCaPy was pushed out of the shallow Valβ86-P1 pocket of DRB1*1501 by 1.7 Å (data not shown), it remained stably inside the Glyβ86 pocket of DRB1*0101 (Fig. 6D). The van der Waals radius of the adamantyl group is only slightly bigger than the inner surface of a Glyβ86-P1 pocket harboring an aromatic anchor side chain. Energy minimization of the DRB1*0101·AdCaPy complex resulted in a root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å for the backbone of both α-helices lining the P1 pocket and of only 0.56 Å for the side chains surrounding the docked adamantyl group (Fig. 6E). Thus, ligand-exchange catalysis by adamantyl compounds seems indeed to require the occupation of P1. The catalytic effect of organic compounds is mediated by the induction of the peptide-receptive state (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and other groups have shown that mutant DRB1*0101 molecules, which express permanently filled P1 pockets due to a Glyβ86 → Tyr substitution, are in fact mostly in the receptive state (23Chou C.L. Sadegh-Nasseri S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Hence, occupation of P1 by the adamantyl group seems to have the same effect except that transient binding allows replacement by a peptide to form the stable ligand complex. In a mechanistic model, the effect could be explained by assuming that the receptive form is correlated with an open P1 pocket while the non-receptive state is linked to a collapsed P1 pocket (Fig. 7). Based on this assumption occupation of P1 by adamantyl compounds should stabilize the receptive state, resulting in fast loading rates as the result of an increased pool of peptide-accessible receptive MHC molecules. Similar interactions might also be the basis of the catalysis by other organic compounds such as pCP. Invariance of their catalytic activity with regard to β86, however, leaves it open whether P1 is in fact the target. Although previous studies suggested that H-bond donor groups are crucial for certain organic compounds (9Falk K. Lau J.M. Santambrogio L. Marin-Esteban V. Puentes F. Rotzschke O. Strominger J.L. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), this does apparently not apply for adamantyl derivatives. The structural dissimilarity of the substituents of AdEtOH (hydroxy-ethyl group) and AdCaPy (substituted pyrazole ring) rather suggests that the hydrophobic adamantyl group by itself is largely responsible for the effect. In contrast to noble metal complexes (24De Wall S.L. Painter C. Stone J.D. Bandaranayake R. Wiley D.C. Mitchison T.J. Stern L.J. Dedecker B.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which seem to strip peptides from class II MHC molecules by irreversibly inactivating the receptor complex, the interaction with organic compounds is reversible (10Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50684-50690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This applies also for some other organic compounds, recently identified to bind to the chaperone HLA-DM (25Nicholson M.J. Moradi B. Seth N.P. Xing X. Cuny G.D. Stein R.L. Wucherpfennig K.W. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 4208-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar to the HLA-DR-targeting compounds, they are also able to accelerate class II MHC loading, but their practical use for cell loading appears limited, since they require acidic pH and the presence of the chaperone. Although the development of catalytic organic compounds is still at the beginning, they are likely to become potent amplifiers of the immune response. As “MHC loading enhancer” (MLE), they represent useful tools to improve antigen recognition in a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic settings. This includes the peptide loading of immobilized or multimeric MHC molecules (e.g. as HLA-DR tetramer (26Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J. Barouch D.H. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Davis M.M. Science. 1996; 274: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar)) or the transfer of antigens onto APC for in vitro T cell assays or immune therapies. Since they could enhance also the loading rate of a peptide or protein vaccine in vivo, they might even become useful vaccine additives. Adamantyl groups are present in a number of prescription drugs. Most prominent examples are “rimantadine” (1-(1-adamantyl)-ethanamine) and “amantadine” (adamantane-1-amine), which are both used to treat influenza A virus infections. Their mechanism is not fully understood, but involvement of MLE activity seems unlikely, since in particular “amantadine” has low ligand-exchange capacity (data not shown). While in this case MLE activity is probably not involved in their primary effect, catalytic antigen loading could still be a cause of unwanted side effects. Autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis (MS) are induced by the “accidental” recognition of self-antigens. The addition of the weak catalyst pCP to preparations of crude spinal cord homogenate can activate encephalitogenic T cells specific for the self-antigen MBP86-100 (15Marin-Esteban V. Falk K. Rotzschke O. J. Autoimmun. 2003; 20: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MBP86-100 has been implicated with human MS and is known to induce an MS-like autoimmune disease in mice, and as shown here, AdEtOH amplified the T cell response against this epitope even more effectively. Most importantly, however, enhancement of the in vitro autoimmune response is evident only on susceptible HLA-DR molecules. In principle, environmental factors acting similar to AdEtOH could provoke the induction of autoimmune diseases in an allele-selective manner. It is in fact a typical characteristic of most autoimmune diseases that the prevalence is correlated with particular allelic variants of class II MHC (27Jones E.Y. Fugger L. Strominger J.L. Siebold C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In some cases the susceptibility could be even linked to polymorphic P1-like pockets. This applies for type 1 diabetes, which is correlated with position β57 in pocket P9 (28Todd J.A. Bell J.I. McDevitt H.O. Nature. 1987; 329: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), for rheumatoid arthritis, where the amino acid composition of the P4 pocket seems to be crucial (29Hammer J. Gallazzi F. Bono E. Karr R.W. Guenot J. Valsasnini P. Nagy Z.A. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1847-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 30Gibert M. Balandraud N. Touinssi M. Mercier P. Roudier J. Reviron D. Hum. Immunol. 2003; 64: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and, at least for a cohort of Australian patients, for MS, where susceptibility correlated with Valβ86 of the P1 pocket (31Teutsch S.M. Bennetts B.H. Buhler M.M. Heard R.N. Stewart G.J. Hum. Immunol. 1999; 60: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All these pockets accommodate anchor residues and participate in peptide selection but, as shown here for P1, might also represent specific target sites for ligand-exchange catalysts. Active compounds could derive from a variety of sources including drugs, chemicals, metabolites, and other biological/environmental toxins. A vast number of organic compounds has been implicated with the induction of autoimmune diseases (32D'Cruz D. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 112-113: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen whether any of these molecules can function as MLE compound. In summary, our experiments revealed that low molecular weight compounds exist that influence the immune response in an allele-specific way. By transiently occupying a dimorphic pocket on the HLA-DR molecule they seem to prevent the rapid inactivation of the complex so that free peptides can reach the vacant peptide binding site. Other natural, synthetic, or environmental compounds might exist that utilize pockets like P1 even more effectively. Their identification and the characterization of their target sites should produce not only a novel set of molecular tools to improve antigen loading, it might also provide new insights on the induction of autoimmune reactions and on the molecular mechanism of antigen loading.

BH3-only protein, tBid, activates pro-apoptotic Bax to release cytochrome c from mitochondria. tBid also activates anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial outer membrane, changing it from a single-spanning to a multispanning conformation that binds the active Bax and inhibits cytochrome c release. However, it is not known whether other mitochondrial proteins are required to elicit the tBid-induced Bcl-2 conformational alteration. To define the minimal components that are required for the functionally important Bcl-2 conformational alteration, we reconstituted the reaction using purified proteins and liposomes. We found that purified tBid was sufficient to induce a conformational alteration in the liposome-tethered, but not cytosolic Bcl-2, resulting in a multispanning form that is similar to the one found in the mitochondrial outer membrane of drug-treated cells. Mutations that abolished tBid/Bcl-2 interaction also abolished the conformational alteration, demonstrating that a direct tBid/Bcl-2 interaction at the membrane is both required and sufficient to elicit the conformational alteration. Furthermore, active Bax also elicited the Bcl-2 conformational alteration. Bcl-2 mutants that displayed increased or decreased activity in the conformational alteration assay showed corresponding activities in inhibiting pore formation by Bax in vitro and in preventing apoptosis in vivo. Thus, there is a strong correlation between the direct interaction of membrane-bound Bcl-2 and tBid with activation of Bcl-2 in vitro and in vivo. During initiation of apoptosis, Bcl-2 family proteins regulate the permeability of mitochondrial outer membrane.

Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are key regulators of apoptosis that function either as promoters or inhibitors and that display homology in one to four short sequences termed Bcl-2 homology (BH) 3The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; CB, Cascade Blue; Bcl-2ΔTM, Bcl-2 lacking the C-terminal transmembrane sequence thus equivalent to the cytosolic domain; 7-doxyl-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(7-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphotidylcholine; IASD, 4-acetamido-4′-[(iodoacetyl)amino]stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MOM, mitochondrial outer membrane; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. motifs (1Danial N.N.

Anti-apoptotic subfamily proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL contain four BH motifs (BH1–4). Pro-apoptotic proteins are grouped into either multiple or single BH motif subfamilies. The former subfamily includes the proteins Bax and Bak that display homology in BH1–3 motifs. The latter includes proteins such as Bid, Bim, and Bad that are similar only in the limited BH3 motif. Despite the limited sequence homology, the three-dimensional structures determined for seven Bcl-2 family proteins including members from all three subfamilies are very similar, consisting of a hydrophobic core of one to three helices wrapped by five to eight amphipathic helices and their connecting loops. This structure is strikingly similar to the structure of the pore-forming domains of diphtheria toxin and Escherichia coli colicins. In addition there is an obvious hydrophobic groove on the surface of all of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (4Petros A.M. Olejnicizak E.T. Fesik S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 5Woo J.S. Jung J.S. Ha N.C. Shin J. Kim K.H. Lee W. Oh B.H.

From decades of extensive studies, two properties are well known to be shared by most, if not all, Bcl-2 family proteins: homo- or hetero-binding and pore formation in membranes. More experiments have been done on the homo- or hetero-binding of Bcl-2 family proteins, resulting in the following major conclusions. 1) The hetero-binding between different subfamily proteins is important for their function. Most BH3-only proteins have been proposed to bind to Bcl-2-like proteins following various death signals, either neutralizing the pro-survival function or inhibiting the anti-death activity of Bcl-2-like proteins. A few BH3-only proteins have also been shown to bind Bax-like proteins and activate their pro-death function (7Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L.

Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). 2) Binding between two different subfamily proteins is mediated by different motifs. The interaction of a BH3-only protein and a Bcl-2-like protein is likely accomplished by the binding of the BH3-motif helix of the former into the hydrophobic groove of the latter (10Petros A.M. Nettesheim D.G. Wang Y. Olejnicizak E.T. Meadows R.P. Mack J. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Zhang H. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

Cell. 2004; 15: 999-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar interface may be formed in the complex between a Bax-like protein and a Bcl-2-like protein (13Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). 3) The interface for homobinding of Bcl-2 is different from that for Bcl-xL. Whereas a Bcl-2 dimer is formed asymmetrically by an acceptor surface including the BH1–3 hydrophobic groove and a donor surface including BH4 helix, a Bcl-xL dimer is formed symmetrically by inserting the C-terminal tail of one protomer into the hydrophobic groove of the other and vice versa (14Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Annis M.G. Truscott M. Roberts G.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Tan C. Peng J. Johnson A.E. Zhang X.C. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2146-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in healthy cells Bcl-2 is exclusively bound to membranes in a conformation in which the C-terminal tail is inserted into the lipid bilayer, and therefore not available for binding to the hydrophobic groove in the cytosolic domain of other Bcl-2 proteins (16Chen-Levy Z. Cleary M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4929-4933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Janiak F. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9842-9849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a substantial fraction of Bcl-xL is found either in the cytosol or loosely bound to membranes in healthy cells. The C-terminal tail of the soluble Bcl-xL could therefore, be involved in homobinding (18Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). During the induction of apoptosis Bcl-xL inserts into intracellular membranes. A recent crystallography study suggests that the membrane-bound Bcl-xL may swap helices 6–8 to form a symmetrical homodimer (19O'Neill J.W. Manion M.K. Maguire B. Hockenbery D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because Bax can release cytochrome c from purified mitochondria, pore formation by Bax has been studied extensively. The following major conclusions have been reached. 1) tBid protein or BH3 peptide from Bid or Bim was required for Bax to release cytochrome c from purified mitochondria, and to release dextrans up to 2 MDa from mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) vesicles or liposomes of MOM lipids (MOM-liposomes) (9Kuwana T.

Pore formation is dependent on the mitochondrial specific lipid, cardiolipin, and can be inhibited by Bcl-xL. 2) The putative Bax pore that can release 2-MDa dextrans should have a radius more than 273 Å, suggesting that massive Bax oligomerization may be involved (21Venturoli D. Rippe B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F605-F613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). 3) Oligomerization of Bax is required for Bax to permeabilize the MOM, thereby releasing proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor that activate caspases and nucleases that eventually dismantle the cell (20Kuwana T.

The oligomerization occurs after Bax is inserted into the membrane as a multispanning monomer with helices 5, 6, and 9 buried in the bilayer (25Annis M.G. Soucie E.L. Dlugosz P.J. Cruz-Aguado J.A. Penn L.Z. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2096-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The oligomerization of Bax-like proteins requires their BH3 motif and can be inhibited by Bcl-2-like proteins (26Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

The pore-forming activity can be enhanced by a trans-negative membrane potential. 2) In planar lipid bilayers both proteins form ion-conducting channels that display a linear current-voltage relationship, following the law of Ohm. The channels have discrete conductances ranging from 20 to 90 pS for Bcl-2 and 80 to 276 pS for Bcl-xL, suggesting that they may have different structures. Unlike the pores in liposomal membranes that are only detectable at acidic pH, the channels formed in planar bilayers can be detected at both neutral and acidic pH. But the channels open more frequently at acidic pH. The channels are cation selective. 3) Deletion of helices 5 and 6 eliminates the channel activity for Bcl-2, and replacing helices 5 and 6 of Bcl-xL with those from Bax alters the channel property, suggesting that the two hydrophobic helices are required for channel formation by the two anti-apoptosis proteins. 4) During induction of apoptosis, Bcl-2 changes from the tail-anchored conformation to a multispanning one in which in addition to the C-terminal tail (helix 9) both helices 5 and 6 are inserted into the membrane (37Kim P.K. Annis M.G. Dlugosz P.J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This conformational alteration can be induced in isolated mitochondria by tBid and is required for anti-Bax activity (29Dlugosz P.J. Billen L. Annis M.G. Zhu W. Zhang Z. Lin J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus, only the conformationally altered Bcl-2 can form a stable complex with the active, multispanning Bax, thereby inhibiting its oligomerization and membrane permeabilization. It is intriguing that both pro- and anti-apoptotic multi-BH motif proteins can be switched to a similar multispanning conformation by the BH3-only protein, tBid. Perhaps they form different structures in the membrane to fulfill their opposite functions. The multispanning Bax is known to form large oligomeric pores. Acidic pH induces the Bcl-2 pore formation in liposomal membranes, but the relationship between the acidic pH-induced pore formation and the tBid-induced conformational alteration remains elusive. Moreover, the correlation between the in vitro pore-forming activity and the in vivo anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 has yet to be established. Finally, although tBid can induce the Bcl-2 conformational alteration in isolated mitochondria, the minimal components required for the alteration needs to be defined. In this study we used the MOM-liposomes with encapsulated fluorescent dyes and purified cytosolic domain of Bcl-2 (Bcl-2ΔTM) to reconstitute the pore-forming process in vitro. We found that acidic pH induced a conformational alteration in soluble Bcl-2ΔTM, exposing a hydrophobic core helix to facilitate the membrane insertion and pore formation. In contrast, tBid did not induce the pore formation by the soluble Bcl-2ΔTM. However, when Bcl-2ΔTM was tethered to the liposome, it changed conformation and formed pores after interacting with tBid. Furthermore, the pore formed by the tBid-activated Bcl-2ΔTM is smaller than that formed by the tBid-activated Bax. Most importantly, Bcl-2ΔTM inhibited the large pore formation by the activated Bax only when it was also activated by either tBid or tBid-activated Bax. Mutations that enhanced or reduced the tBid-mediated Bcl-2ΔTM activation in liposomes also enhanced or reduced Bcl-2 anti-apoptosis function in cells, respectively, thereby correlating the in vitro detected conformational alteration with the in vivo function.

The plain liposomes without fluorophores were prepared similarly except that no fluorophores were in the buffer A used for resuspension of the lipids and no gel filtration chromatography was needed after the extrusion. The liposomes containing lipophilic quenchers were prepared similarly except that 30 mol % of phosphatidylcholine (PC) was replaced by a doxyl-labeled PC (1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(7-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-PC,7-doxyl-PC).

For the sample containing EDTA or imidazole, the same concentration of corresponding chemical was also presented in the sucrose gradient. Four 250-μl fractions were drawn, starting from the top of the gradient, resulting in fractions S1–S4. The pellet was re-suspended in 250 μl of buffer A, resulting in fraction P. The Bcl-2ΔTM proteins in these fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with sheep anti-Bcl-2 polyclonal antibody.

Data shown are averages of two to three independent experiments with S.D. (error bars). B, binding of the C-terminal His6-tagged Bcl-2ΔTM with regular or Ni2+-liposome (with 0 or 5% Ni2+-lipid, respectively) in the absence or presence of EDTA or imidazole was assayed by the float-up centrifugation.

The initial emission intensity (F0) was determined after equilibrating the sample at 25 °C for 5 min. Purified Bcl-2ΔTM protein (400 nm) was then added. For other figures, if indicated, 12.5 μm liposomes with CB dyes or CB-dextrans were added, and after F0 was taken, 50 nm Bcl-2ΔTM or mutant protein, 20 nm tBid or mutant protein, and/or 50 nm Bax were added. The first fluorescence intensity measurement was started exactly 20 s after the addition of the protein(s) and followed by multiple measurements in a predetermined time interval for 5 h, resulting in multiple intermediate intensities (F). At the end of the time course 0.1% Triton X-100 was added and the final measurement was taken, resulting in the final intensity (Ft). The extent of CB or CB-dextran release is proportional to the extent of fluorescence quenching that is equal to ΔFProtein/ΔFTriton, where ΔFProtein = F0 – F, and ΔFTriton = F0 – Ft. All fluorescence intensities were measured using the SLM-8100 fluorometer as described (31Tan C. Dlugosz P.J. Peng J. Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Plafker S.M. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol.

Collisional Quenching of Soluble NBD-labeled Bcl-2ΔTM by Iodide Ions—NBD (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) labeling of Bcl-2ΔTM with a single Cys (Cys158) was done as described (40Shepard L.A.

The NBD fluorescence emission scan was carried out at 1-nm intervals between 500 and 600 nm with excitation at 468 nm. The spectrum was integrated to determine the intensity. To determine the pH effect on iodide ion accessibility to the NBD, the initial net fluorescence intensity (F0) for a sample with 100 nm NBD-Bcl-2ΔTM was determined in buffer A of the indicated pH by subtracting the signal of a control without the NBD-Bcl-2ΔTM. The sample and control were titrated with aliquots of 1 m KI and 1 mm Na2S2O3. The intensities of sample and control were measured after each addition of KI/Na2S2O3 and corrected for dilution to obtain the net intensity (F). In parallel, another pair of sample and control was titrated with 1 m KCl and 1 mm Na2S2O3 for correcting the effect of ionic strength on the NBD fluorescence. In each experiment, the net change in fluorescence due to the quenching at each KI/KCl concentration was determined by the equation F0/F = (F0/F)KI/(F0/F)KCl, which was used to plot against the KI concentration to obtain the Stern-Volmer plot as described (40Shepard L.A.

https://openalex.org/W2069039700,"Leishmania parasites are eukaryotic protozoans responsible for a variety of human diseases known as leishmaniasis, which ranges from skin lesions to fatal visceral infections. Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of an infected sandfly where it exists as promastigotes and, upon entry into a mammalian host, differentiates into amastigotes, which replicate exclusively in macro-phages. The biochemical pathways enabling Leishmania to differentiate and survive in the mammalian host are poorly defined. We have therefore examined the role of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, which is essential in regulating cell function in higher eukaryotes. Using the recently completed Leishmania genome, we have identified and cloned a Leishmania protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) gene (LPTP1) by virtue of its homology with the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B gene (hPTP1B). The enzyme activity of recombinant LPTP1 was confirmed using a combination of PTP-specific substrates and inhibitors. We further demonstrate, by creating LPTP1 null mutants through gene targeting, that LPTP1 is necessary for survival as amastigotes in mice, but it is dispensable for survival as promastigotes in culture. Human PTPs, including the PTP1B enzyme, are actively pursued drug targets for a variety of diseases. The observations with the LPTP1 mutants in mice suggest that it may also represent a drug target against the mammalian amastigote stage. However, in silico structure analysis of LPTP1 revealed a striking similarity with hPTP1B in the active site suggesting that, although this is an attractive drug target, it may be difficult to develop an inhibitor specific for the Leishmania LPTP1.

Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by infection with Leishmania protozoan parasites that results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral disease (reviewed in Ref. 1Murray H.W. Berman J.D. Davies C.R. Saravia N.G. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1561-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). There are over two million new cases of leishmaniasis each year and over 12 million people currently suffering from this infection in 88 tropic and subtropic countries (2Desjeux P. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 692Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Desjeux P. Trans. R Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 95: 239-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). During its life cycle, Leishmania alternates between promastigotes in the sandfly vector and amastigotes in the mammalian host. Once transmitted to the mammalian host through the bite of an infected sandfly, the promastigotes differentiate into nonflagellated intracellular amastigotes, whereupon they multiply exclusively in the phagolysosome organelle of infected macrophages. Amastigotes are responsible for the diverse pathologies associated with leishmaniasis, which depends to a large extent on the Leishmania species (reviewed in Ref. 1Murray H.W. Berman J.D. Davies C.R. Saravia N.G. Lancet. 2005; 366: 1561-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The biochemical changes associated with differentiation from promastigotes to amastigotes and with the long term survival of amastigotes in the mammalian host are poorly understood, and consequently the biological role of protein phosphorylation remains largely unknown in Leishmania. Protein phosphorylation is among the most important regulatory biochemical changes in higher eukaryotic cells. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues is controlled by protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). 5The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; pNPP, 4-p-nitrophenylphosphate; IR, insulin receptor; bpV (phen), potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate (V).5The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; pNPP, 4-p-nitrophenylphosphate; IR, insulin receptor; bpV (phen), potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate (V). Particularly, protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation regulate multiple central processes including cellular phenotypic functions, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death (reviewed in Ref. 4Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 40-148Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The overall protein phosphorylation pattern in Leishmania parasites and related trypanosomatids has been shown to change during differentiation associated with different life cycle stages, suggesting that protein kinases and phosphatases play a role in these processes (5Bengs F. Scholz A. Kuhn D. Wiese M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been established that L. major promastigote extracts contain protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity, although the corresponding gene(s) has not yet been identified (6Aguirre-Garcia M.M. Escalona-Montano A.R. Bakalara N. Perez-Torres A. Gutierrez-Kobeh L. Becker I. Parasitology. 2006; 132: 641-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because of the central role of tyrosine phosphorylation in higher eukaryotic cell function, we have begun to investigate the potential contribution of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation to the Leishmania life cycle and virulence. We had previously observed that heterologous expression of a prototype human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) in Leishmania donovani mediates partial differentiation toward the amastigote stage, induces expression of amastigote-specific proteins, and increases virulence in BALB/c mice (7Nascimento M. Abourjeily N. Ghosh A. Zhang W.-W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These observations argue that PTPs play a role in amastigote survival in the mammalian host and provide strong justification for the characterization of endogenous Leishmania PTP genes as detailed within. In the present study, we describe the identification of a PTP gene from Leishmania major, Leishmania infantum, and L. donovani that has extensive sequence and corresponding structural homology with the human PTP1B gene product. These Leishmania genes have been designated LmPTP1, LiPTP1, and LdPTP1, respectively. The enzyme activity of LmPTP1 has been confirmed with relevant substrates and inhibitors. We have also developed LdPTP1 heterozygous and homozygous null mutant knock-out clones that proliferated in a similar fashion to wild type promastigotes in culture but were severely impaired with respect to survival as amastigotes in BALB/c mice. Through in silico structural analysis, we also show that the L. infantum PTP1 (LiPTP1) and human PTP1B (hPTP1B) shared remarkable structural conservation in the active site; however, notable differences outside this region are also present. This observation suggests that from a phenotypic perspective, the LPTP1 represents an attractive drug target. However, from a structural perspective, it may be difficult to develop a small molecule specific to the active site of LPTP1. Parasite Cultures—The L. donovani 1S/Cl2D and L. major Friedlin V9 promastigotes were routinely cultured at pH 7.2 and 27 °C in Medium 199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. L. donovani differentiation into amastigotes was performed by shifting to amastigote culture medium (37 °C, pH 5.5 in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum) overnight, which mimics the temperature and pH of the host macrophage phagolysosome. Cloning, Sequencing, and Tagging of L. major PTP1—The 1.5-kb L. major DNA fragment homologous to the human PTP1B was identified in the L. major data base by BLAST search (Entry GeneDB LmjF36.5370; www.genedb.org). Based on the sequence obtained from the data base, two primers were designed to PCR amplify the LmPTP1 gene and to incorporate a sequence encoding a His tag at the N terminus, and the amplified product was then ligated into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. The primers used were HisF 5′-aagcttATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCATCATATGTGTGAAAAGCAACTCAAGGAG-3′, which contained a HindIII site, and reverse R 5′-ggatccTTACACAAACGAAGGCGAGAAGCGC-3′, which contained a BamHI site. The resulting His-tagged LmPTP1 containing plasmid was used as template in a second PCR, where a new primer incorporated a 10-amino acid epitope tag from the L. donovani specific A2 protein that is recognized by an anti-A2 monoclonal antibody (8Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) A2-HisF 5′-aagcttATGCAGTCCGTTGGCCCGCTCTCCGTTGGCCCGCATCATCATCATCATCATCAT-3′ with a HindIII site and the same R 5′-ggatccTTACACAAACGAAGGCGAGAAGCGC-3′ with a BamHI site was used. The final amplified product was then cloned into the pcDNA3 vector and called pcDNA3-LmPTP1 as shown in Fig. 2A. As a positive control for subsequent experiments, the human PTP1B sequence was also PCR-amplified with the A2/His tag, using the oligonucleotide primers A2HisF (hPTP) 5′-ggatccATGCAGTCCGTTGGCCCGCTCTCCGTTGGCCCGCATCATCATCATCATCATCATATGGAGATGGAAAAGGAGTTCGAG-3′ with an EcoRI site and the A2HisR (hPTP) 5′-gaattcCTATGTGTTGCTGTTGAACAGGAAC-3′ with a BamHI site. The L. donovani LdPTP1 gene was PCR-amplified from L. donovani 1S/Cl2D genomic DNA with the same primers used above for L. major and sequenced (GenBank™ bankit827438 DQ862810). In brief, the amplified fragment was cloned into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and termed pLdPTP1-TOPO, and M13 reverse and M13 forward primers were used in sequencing reactions with the Mega-Bace500 (Molecular Dynamics of GE Healthcare). Sequencing reactions were performed by a DYEnamic ET TerminatorCycle sequencing kit with Thermo Sequenase II DNA polymerase, and post-reaction cleanup was achieved by extensive ethanol precipitation before adding formamide loading solution. Transfection of Cos7 Cells and Purification of A2His-tagged LmPTP1 and hPTP1B—The Cos7 cell line was transiently transfected using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, a 100-mm dish of Cos7 cells (∼8 × 105 cells) was transfected with a total of 8 μg of DNA (6 μg of pcDNA3-LmPTP1 and 2 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid) in 20 μl of Lipofectamine. The following day (∼20 h after transfection), the cells were washed with cold medium and lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science complete mixture tablets) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged, and β-galactosidase assays were performed to determine the levels of transfection efficiency in each dish and to normalize the amount of protein used in each assay. His-bind® resin (Novagen) was used for purification of the A2-His-tagged LmPTP1 and hPTP1B according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, His-bind® resin was activated in 1-binding buffer (8×= 4mm NaCl, 160 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm imidazole, pH 7.9) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. 60 μl of activated His-bind® resin was added to 200 μl of cell lysates and incubated with agitation for 3 h at 4 °C. His-bind® resin was thoroughly washed five times in 1.0 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1%Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0 buffer with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science complete mixture tablets), and half of the His-bind® resin with the purified A2-His-tagged LmPTP1 or hPTP1B was used for activity assays, and the other half used for Western blot analysis with anti-A2 tag monoclonal antibodies. Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Activity and Inhibition Assays—The 4 p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) assay was used for detection of total phosphatase activity as described previously (7Nascimento M. Abourjeily N. Ghosh A. Zhang W.-W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of His-bind® resin containing purified PTP proteins was washed once in 1.0 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, Roche Applied Science complete protease inhibitor buffer and placed in a 96-well plate. 180 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol containing 10 mm fresh pNPP) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The plates were read at 405 nm. The Malachite green phosphatase activity assay with the insulin receptor (IR) phosphopeptide is a more specific assay for hPTP1B, because the IR is a major substrate of this enzyme (9Salmeen A.

The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma; PTP101, nonradioactive phosphotyrosine phosphatase assay). Two inhibitors, 1 mm of sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), and 10 μm of potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline)oxovanadate (V) (bpV (phen)) were used to further confirm the activity of LmPTP1 and the hPTP1B as the control. bpV (phen) is a member of a class of potent and specific PTP inhibitors (11Tsiani E.

His-bind® resin containing the PTPs was washed four times with 1.0 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, Roche Applied Science complete protease inhibitor buffer and then assayed for phosphatase activity using pNPP as substrate, as detailed above. Disruption of the LdPTP1 Genes from L. donovani—The L. donovani PTP1 gene disrupted strains were generated by homologous gene targeting as outlined in Fig. 4A. A Hin-dIII and XbaI fragment containing the L. donovani PTP1 gene from the pLdPTP1-TOPO plasmid described above was subcloned into a pBlue-script vector. The resulting pBSLdPTP1 plasmid was digested with BclI to remove the 357-bp catalytic region of the LdPTP1 gene. The fragment containing the hygromycin resistance gene was removed from the pSPY hygromycin vector (13Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with BamHI and BglII and inserted into the BclI site within the LdPTP1 sequence, generating the plasmid pBSLdPTP Hyg. The linear fragment containing the hygromycin gene and the LdPTP flanking sequences was then electroporated into L. donovani. Transfectants were initially selected, in the first round targeting, with 50 μg/ml hygromycin to obtain the heterozygous single LdPTP1 knock-out mutant. The double knock-out homozygous null mutant for the LdPTP1 gene was achieved by increasing the hygromycin concentration to 200 μg/ml in selection culture medium. Complementation of the double knock-out null mutant with a plasmid containing the LdPTP1 gene was carried out as follows. The following oligonucleotide primers LdPTPF1 5′-cccaagcttTCACTTTTTGTTGCCCTTGGT with a HindIII site and the reverse LdPTPR1 5′-cgagatctCAGAGGTGCAGCCAGTCATA with a BglII site were used to amplify a 3140-bp fragment from L. donovani genomic DNA that contained the LdPTP1 gene open reading frame including 655-bp upstream and 1000-bp downstream flanking sequences. The 3140-bp fragment was then inserted into HindIII and BamHI sites of plasmid pSPY-Neo (13Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) to generate the complementing plasmid pSPYNeoLdPTP1 as shown in Fig. 7A. Southern Blotting—For Southern blot analysis, 10 μg of Leishmania genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzymes PstI and SstI and separated in a 0.7% agarose gel. Hybridization and washing were performed as previously described (14Charest H. Matlashewski G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 2975-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The LdPTP1 active domain encoding DNA (357-bp BclI fragment from nucleotides 677-1034) was used as a probe for DNA from the single (+/-) and double knock-out (-/-) clones described above to demonstrate the disruption of the LdPTP1 gene (Fig. 4B). Southern blot using the hygromycin gene demonstrated specific targeting into the LdPTP1 gene (Fig. 4C). The L. major 1.5-kb LmPTP1 gene containing fragment was used in the Southern blot to confirm the presence of the episomal LdPTP1 added back to the double knock-out null clone Ld1PTP1-/- (Fig. 7B). Infection of BALB/c Mice and Recovery of Amastigotes—Female BALB/c mice (Charles River) weighing 20-25 g (n = four mice/group) were injected via tail vein with 1.5 × 108 late log phase promastigotes in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, as described previously (15Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 8807-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After 4 weeks of infection, the mice were examined for L. donovani parasite burden by counting the number of amastigotes in the Giemsa-stained liver imprints. Liver parasite burden, expressed as Leishman-Donovan units, was calculated by multiplying the number of amastigotes/1000 cell nuclei × liver weight (g). Spleen parasite burden were determined by limiting dilution in 96-well plates as previously detailed (16Zhang W.W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Proliferation in Culture—Parasite growth was evaluated by determination of the optical density at 600 nm of diluted cultures (starting from 106 cell/ml) grown in 96-well plates from days 0-8 (promastigotes) or 0-5 (amastigotes). LiPTP1 Catalytic Domain Modeling—The alignment between the L. infantum PTP1 amino acid sequence and human PTP1B obtained with ClustalW (Fig. 1) in conjunction with the PTP1B crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1SUG) were used in Modeler 8 (version 2, default configuration) (17Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali. A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) to create the L. infantum PTP1 homology model. A 20-residue stretch of amino acids present in the Leishmania PTP1 sequence that was outside of the enzyme active site was not present in the human enzyme sequence and, as a result, was not modeled (residues 32-51). In addition, the construct used to elucidate the human enzyme structure did not contain any residues beyond position 319. Therefore, these two regions were removed from the Leishmania homology model. We began this study by performing a BLAST search of the L. major data base (Ref. 18Ivens A.C. Peacock C.S. Worthey E.A. Murphy L. Aggarwal G. Berriman M. Sisk E. Rajandream M.A. Adlem E. Aert R. Anupama A. Apostolou Z. Attipoe P. Bason N. Bauser C. Science. 2005; 309: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar; www.genedb.org) for sequences that could represent PTP genes by virtue of their homology with the human PTP1B gene. In total, nine potential PTP genes were identified in the Leishmania genome. The one with the greatest identity with human PTP1B was LmjF36.5370 located on chromosome 36, which we have designated LmPTP1. The L. infantum PTP1 (LiPTP1) sequence was also identified in this manner from the L. infantum data base (LinJ36.5860; www.genedb.org). Based on these sequences, we designed PCR primers to amplify, clone, and sequence the L. donovani LdPTP1 homolog (GenBank™ bankit827438 DQ862810) as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Alignment comparison of the various Leishmania PTP1 and hPTP1B proteins revealed they share ∼40% sequence identity, including a number of important conserved amino acid residues within the hPTP1B signature catalytic domain ((I/V)HCXXGXXR(S/T/G)), which contains the essential cysteine and arginine residues required for enzyme activity (boxed region in Fig. 1) (reviewed in Ref. 4Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 40-148Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition to the conserved catalytic domain, LPTP1s share relevant accessory motifs with hPTP1B including the adjacent signature WPD and the Q residues (boxed region indicated with bold type in Fig. 1), which play a role in maintaining the conformation of the active site. The LPTP1s and hPTP1B also share a proline-rich region from amino acids 325-340 that are responsible for SH3 domain protein-protein type interactions and cellular localization in hPTP1B (4Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 40-148Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from L. major demonstrated that LmPTP1 was a single copy gene in the haploid genome. 6M. Nascimento, W.-W. Zhang, and G. Matlashewski, unpublished data. Included in Fig. 1 is the closest PTP sequence homolog from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is more divergent from hPTP1B than is the LPTP1s. Although the Leishmania PTP1 sequences shown in Fig. 1 suggest that they encode for a hPTP1B homolog, it was necessary to validate this experimentally using relevant enzyme substrates and inhibitors. We designed primers to amplify, clone, and insert the LmPTP1 gene into a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3) for expression in transfected simian Cos7 cells. To detect and partially purify the LmPTP1 from Cos7 cells, a 10-amino acid epitope tag derived from the L. donovani A2 protein, followed by a His7 tag encoding sequence, were inserted at the 5′ end of the LmPTP1 gene (Fig. 2A). In this manner, the Cos7 cell expressing A2-His7-tagged LmPTP1 could be detected with anti-A2 monoclonal antibodies (8Zhang W.W. Charest H. Ghedin E. Matlashewski G. Mol. Biol. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and partially purified from cell lysates by affinity chromatography with His-bind® resin. We also generated the same construct using the human hPTP1B gene as a positive control for subsequent comparison. Expression of the A2-His7 tagged LmPTP1 and hPTP1B genes in Cos7 cells was analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-A2 monoclonal antibodies 24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 2B, the hPTP1B and LmPTP1 proteins were detectable at the predicted molecular masses of 50 and 55 kDa, respectively (lanes 2 and 3). The control empty pcDNA3 vector did not produce bands (lane 1), confirming the specificity of the Western blot for A2-tagged PTPs. The A2-His7-tagged proteins were subsequently partially purified from the transfected Cos7 cell lysate using His-bind® resin and washed extensively, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-A2 monoclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2B (lanes 5 and 6), the washed His tag-binding resin contained approximately equal amounts of hPTP1B and LmPTP1. These data confirmed that it was possible to express, detect, and partially purify similar levels of hPTP1B and LmPTP1 from transfected Cos7 cells. We next determined whether we could detect PTP enzyme activity in the washed His-bind® resin containing the extracted hPTP1B and LmPTP1 from the transfected Cos7 cells. Two protein phosphatase substrates were used for these assays including pNPP and a specific tyrosine phosphatase substrate, IR phosphopeptide (Fig. 3, A and B). For this assay, the hPTP1B and LmPTP1 expression constructs were transfected into Cos7 cells, purified on His-Tag resin, assayed for activity, and further subjected to parallel Western blot analysis to confirm similar levels of hPTP1B and LmPTP in each assay. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), both LmPTP1 and hPTP1B enzyme activities were detected on the His-bind® resin with the pNPP and IR phosphopeptide substrates when compared with the control (His tag-binding resin from control pcDNA3-transfected cells). To confirm that the activity detected in the samples shown was due to PTP activity, we determined whether it was possible to specifically inhibit this activity using the protein phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 and a more specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor bpV (phen) (12Posner B.I. Faure R. Burges J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Olivier M.

As shown in Fig. 3 (C and D), both the LmPTP1 and hPTP1B were inhibited with Na3VO4 and bpV (phen) (white bars). Accompanying Western blots confirmed there were similar levels of LmPTP1 and hPTP1B assayed in the presence (+, white bars) and absence (-, black bars) of these inhibitors. Importantly, the inhibitors did not affect the background activity observed on His tag-binding resin from the control vector transfected cells (pcDNA3 control). Taken together, these data confirm the bioinformatic prediction that the LmPTP1 gene encodes for a protein-tyrosine phosphatase enzyme that, when assayed under these conditions, had a level of activity similar to that of hPTP1B. Once the Leishmania PTP1 gene had been identified and characterized as detailed above, it was necessary to determine its role in the life cycle of the parasite by developing null PTP1 mutants. We performed single and double knock-outs of the catalytic domain of the PTP1 gene from L. donovani and characterized the resulting mutant parasite phenotype. L. donovani was chosen for this analysis because it can be cultured in vitro as both promastigotes and amastigotes, whereas L. major can only be cultured as promastigotes. Additionally, it has been previously shown that overexpression of a transfected hPTP1B gene in L. donovani resulted in increased virulence in the amastigote stage (7Nascimento M. Abourjeily N. Ghosh A. Zhang W.-W. Matlashewski G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because Leishmania are diploid organisms, the two alleles of the catalytic domain of the LdPTP1 gene were targeted for deletion as summarized in Fig. 4A. The BclI restriction enzyme fragment containing the LdPTP1 catalytic domain (nucleotides 677-1034; Fig. 1) was replaced with a BamHI-BglII fragment containing the selectable marker gene conferring hygromycin (Hyg) resistance. The resulting plasmid, termed pBsLdPTP1hyg, was linearized and targeted into the LdPTP1 site of the L. donovani genome by transfection, and transformants were selected for hygromycin resistance. The first round of gene targeting (heterozygous deletion) was carried out using 50 μg of hygromycin selection, and the second round (homozygous deletion) was carried out using 200 μg of hygromycin. In this manner, both LdPTP1 alleles could be targeted with one selectable marker. Cultures were then subjected to serial dilution to isolate individual LdPTP1 knock-out clones. Southern blot analyses were performed to confirm the heterozygous and homozygous targeted deletion of the catalytic domain of the LdPTP1 gene in the cloned L. donovani mutant cultures. For this analysis, the 357-bp BclI restriction enzyme fragment, which was deleted by gene targeting (Fig. 4A), was used as the hybridization probe. As shown in Fig. 4B, the BclI LdPTP1 gene fragment encoding the catalytic domain was eliminated from the L. donovani clones as indicated by the absence of the band containing this sequence in the null mutant double knock out (-/-) cultures and further by a 50% reduction in the single knock out clone (+/-), as compared with wild type L. donovani (+/+) culture. PCR analysis of the LdPTP1 gene in these mutant clones confirmed the Southern blot data showing deletion of the catalytic domain (data not shown). We further confirmed the accurate replacement of the Hygromycin resistance gene specifically into the LdPTP1 locus on the same clones by performing Southern blot analysis with a probe spe"
https://openalex.org/W2040007998,"SecA contains two ATPase folds (NBF1 and NBF2) and other interaction/regulatory domains, all of which are connected by a long helical scaffold domain (HSD) running along the molecule. Here we identified a functionally important and spatially adjacent pair of SecA residues, Arg-642 on HSD and Glu-400 on NBF1. A charge-reversing substitution at either position as well as disulfide tethering of these positions inactivated the translocation activity. Interestingly, however, the translocation-inactive SecA variants fully retained the ability to up-regulate the ATPase in response to a preprotein and the SecYEG translocon. The translocation defect was suppressible by second site alterations at the hinge-forming boundary of NBF2 and HSD. Based on these results, we propose that the motor function of SecA is realized by ligand-activated ATPase engine and its HSD-mediated conversion into the mechanical work of preprotein translocation.

SecA drives translocation of secretory proteins across the bacterial SecYEG translocon (1Vrontou E. Economou A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Veenendaal A.K. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Its mechanism of action is a major unsolved question, although earlier studies postulated that SecA drives stepwise preprotein movements by ATP- and preprotein-induced conformational changes, referred to as the insertion/deinsertion cycles (3Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 4Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of SecA is regulated such that it is extremely low in the absence of any other ligand (intrinsic ATPase activity) and that it is stimulated by interaction with SecYEG-containing membrane vesicles and maximally by interaction with both SecYEG and a preprotein (translocation ATPase activity) (5Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). SecA assumes multiple localizations and conformations. Remarkably, structural determinations have so far revealed different oligomeric states of SecA, including the antiparallel dimer (6Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B.

The translation level and the functionality of SecA are controlled in vivo by SecM, an unusual secretion monitor protein (16Nakatogawa H. Murakami A. Mori H. Ito K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structures of the translocation components have provided an important basis for our understanding of the translocation molecular mechanisms, the static structures alone are insufficient to reveal the dynamic processes of translocation facilitation. The structure of the archaeal SecYEβ complex suggests that a single unit of the hetero-trimer forms a narrow polypeptide-conducting channel inside the SecY subunit, which is constricted in the center (17Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Although SecYEG could be oligomerized further when it is interacting with the ribosome (18Mitra K. Schaffitzel C. Shaikh T. Tama F. Jenni S. Brooks C.L. Ban III, N. Frank J. Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) or with SecA (19Manting E.H. van Der Doesqq C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the basic polypeptide-conducting channel may still be formed within its monomeric unit. Such a narrow dimension of the translocating channel implies that SecA is too large to be able to “insert” into it, raising a question about the molecular reality of the SecA insertion reaction. Whatever the actual mechanism, SecA functions by interacting with SecYEG, probably with its cytosolically exposed C-terminal loops (17Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), which our genetic studies indeed suggested to be important for the activation of SecA (20Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K.

Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A preprotein cross-linking domain (PPXD) protrudes from the C-terminal region of NBF1 to join the C-terminal translocation domain, which is composed of the “helical wing domain” and the “C-terminal linker region.” The C-terminal part of SecA also includes an ATPase regulatory domain (intramolecular regulator of ATPase (IRA1)) and a SecB/Zn2+-binding site. It was also assigned initially as a membrane insertion segment. Remarkably, the ATPase and the translocation domains are connected by a characteristic long α-helix, termed helical scaffold domain (HSD; Fig. 1A, black), which is running over the molecule and interacting with all the other subdomains. In this study, we addressed the functional importance of HSD. SecA variants with amino acid substitutions at a specific pair of residues in HSD and NBF1 exhibited a novel phenotype, impaired translocation but unimpaired ATPase up-regulation. On the basis of this finding, we propose that HSD plays a crucial role in the ATPase translocation coupling. Escherichia coli Strains—JM109 (22Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of Biochemical Materials—Inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) were prepared from the SecYEG-overproducing strain (30Mori H. Ito K. J.

Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Wild-type SecA and mutated variants were overproduced in strain CK4706 and purified as described previously (30Mori H. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Concentration of SecA was determined from A280, assuming ϵ = 1 × 105. Assays for in Vivo and in Vitro SecA-related Events—Export of OmpA in vivo was assessed from pulse-labeling ratios of its mature and precursor forms as described previously (30Mori H. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In vitro activities of SecA preparations to drive preprotein translocation were assayed using urea-washed SecYEG IMVs and purified proOmpA as described previously (30Mori H. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importance of Arg-642 on HSD and Its Possible Ionic Partner, Glu-400, on NBF1—The HSD part of E. coli SecA contains a number of evolutionarily conserved residues (Fig. 1B, boldface), which were individually mutated to cysteine. We thus found that cysteine substitutions at residues Glu-635, Arg-642, and Arg-656 were partially deleterious for the SecA function (supplemental Fig. S1). Glu-635 and Arg-642 are close to Arg-566 in NBF2 and Glu-400 in NBF1, respectively, which are also conserved in bacterial species. Thus, these HSD residues appear to interact with the ATPase elements. We found further that charge-reversing substitutions, R642E in HSD and E400R in NBF1, abolish the functionality of SecA since the mutant proteins failed to complement the secA51(Ts) growth and protein export defects (Fig. 2A). Moreover, higher level overproduction of SecA(E400R) or that of SecA(R642E) from plasmid was found to impair growth of secA+ cells on minimal-arabinose medium (Fig. 2B). Neither wild-type SecA nor a “suppressed” variant, SecA(E400R,M607T) (see the last section of “Results”), exhibited such growth interference (Fig. 2B). The dominant-negative characters observed for SecA(E400R) and for SecA(R642E) are consistent with the functional importance of this pair of HSD and NBF1 residues. On the three-dimensional structure of SecA, the oxygen atom of the Glu-400 side chain and the nitrogen atom of the Arg-642 side chain are only separated by 3.1 Å (Fig. 1A). Taken together, it seems possible that they form a salt bridge, although the double charge reversal, R642E,E400R, remained non-functional (data not shown). Cysteines at Positions 400 and 642 Form an Intramolecular Disulfide Bond—To verify the close physical proximity of Glu-400 and Arg-642, we mutated both of these residues to cysteine. The double cysteine variant, SecA(E400C,R642C), was functional in vivo (data not shown). Upon purification and non-reducing SDS-PAGE, it predominantly migrated at an apparent molecular mass of ∼130 kDa, slower than normal SecA (Fig. 3A, lane 9; band indicated by **). This electrophoretic shift was canceled by β-mercaptoethanol treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 4), indicating that a disulfide bond was responsible for it. Since neither of the single cysteine variants, SecA(E400C) nor SecA(R642C), generated this ∼130-kDa band (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8), the disulfide bond that was responsible for the mobility shift must have been formed specifically between cysteines at positions 400 and 642 of either the same polypeptide chain (for the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond) or different polypeptide chains (for the formation of a disulfide-bonded dimer). When two single cysteine variants, SecA(E400C) and SecA-(R642C), were co-expressed in the same cell, they did not generate the ∼130-kDa species (Fig. 3B, lane 1), suggesting that this band was accounted for by the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-400 and Cys-642. It was noted that the double mutant, SecA(E400C,R642C), also contained a significant amount of a reductant-sensitive species that migrated more slowly than the 220-kDa molecular mass marker (Fig. 3A, lane 9; band indicated by ***). Since as much as ∼50% of the purified SecA(R642C) single cysteine variant also formed this >220-kDa species (Fig. 3A, lane 8; band indicated by ***), it must have represented a disulfide-bonded dimer. This observation agrees excellently with the recent observation by Zimmer and Rapoport (8Zimmer J. Li W. Rapoport T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) that SecA can assume an intertwined dimer, in which residue 642 (in the case of E. coli SecA) from each subunit is located adjacently each other. Thus, SecA(E400C,R642C) molecules acquire two different sets of disulfide bonds, one (major product) between these cysteines on the same polypeptide chain and the other (minor product) between Cys-642 of different polypeptide chains. Upon sedimentation fractionation, SecA(E400C,R642C) behaved identically with wild-type SecA whether or not they were treated with DTT (data not shown). Like wild-type SecA (data not shown) and non-disulfide-bonded SecA(R642C) (Fig. 3D, lower panels; band indicated by SecA*), SecA(E400C,R642C) exhibited a significantly lower sedimentation speed in the presence of a detergent, dodecyl maltoside (Fig. 3D, compare upper left and right columns for the band indicated by SecA*). On the other hand, the disulfide bond-linked SecA(R642C) dimer retained the same sedimentation speed in the presence and the absence of the detergent (Fig. 3D, compare lower left and right panels for the band indicated by SecA**). Also, the detergent did not affect the sedimentation rate of bovine serum albumin added to the same centrifugation tubes (Fig. 3D, BSA). The detergent-induced shift in sedimentation agrees with the known property of SecA, which undergoes detergent-induced monomerization (15Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These results, taken together, establish that SecA(E400C,R642C) contained an intramolecular Cys-400-Cys-642 linkage despite its unexpected effect on SDS-PAGE mobility. The 130-kDa species containing the intramolecular disulfide was also observed when the E400C,R642C double cysteine mutant of SecA was expressed in the trx gor ahpC mutant host having an oxidizing cytoplasmic environment (27Ritz D. Lim J. Reynolds C.M. Poole L.B. Beckwith J. Science. 2001; 294: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and examined directly by immunoblotting (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Thus, the disulfide bond between these positions of SecA should represent one of the native features that SecA(E400C,R642C) possesses in vivo. Both the Charge-reversing Mutations and the Disulfide Tethering of Position 642 and Position 400 Impair Translocation Drive but Not Ligand Activation of SecA ATPase—The R642E and the E400R variants of SecA were overproduced stably and purified by standard procedures. Both of them proved severely defective in the in vitro assay of proOmpA translocation into urea-washed IMVs from SecYEG-overproducing cells (Fig. 2C). The mutant proteins nevertheless exhibited higher than normal intrinsic ATPase activities (Fig. 2D, open columns), which were up-regulated further in the presence of IMVs and more pronouncedly in the presence of proOmpA and IMVs. The ATPase stimulation over the background was almost the same for wild-type SecA, SecA(R642E), and SecA(E400R) (Fig. 2D, striped portions of the columns). We then characterized the functionality of the SecA-(E400C,R642C) variant when it contained the intramolecular disulfide bond and when the disulfide bond was reduced with DTT. In vitro assays of proOmpA translocation in the presence and the absence of DTT were carried out using different concentrations of SecA and a reaction time of 7 min. Although the activity of SecA(E400C,R642C) was markedly lower in the absence of DTT than in its presence (Fig. 4A), that of the cysteine-less SecA was unaffected by DTT (Fig. 4A). The low level activity observed with the non-reduced SecA(E400C,R642C) preparation could be ascribed to the small fraction that remained non-oxidized. Thus, SecA is inactivated by the intramolecular disulfide linkage between positions 400 and 642. Like the SecA variants with charge-reversing mutations, the internally disulfide-tethered SecA possessed an increased level of intrinsic ATPase activity (Fig. 4B, open columns), which was accelerated markedly in the presence of both proOmpA and SecYEG membrane vesicles (Fig. 4B, striped portions of the columns). Thus, the disulfide tethering of NBF1 and HSD does not compromise the allosteric activation of the ATPase by a preprotein and the SecYEG translocon. The E400R Defect Is Suppressible by Alterations at the ATPase-HSD Boundary—The importance of the Glu-400 residue in SecA was suggested further by reversion analysis of the SecA(E400R) mutant. Plasmids encoding SecA(E400R) was mutagenized, and those that regained the ability to complement the secA51(Ts) growth defect were selected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We thus isolated seven suppressor mutations, shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. They all retained the original E400R alteration and contained a second-site mutation accompanied by one amino acid substitution (Fig. 5A). The suppressor (second site) mutations restored the ability of SecA(E400R) to complement the secA51(Ts) growth (Fig. 5A, upper panel) and protein export (Fig. 5A, lower panel) defects. The suppressed alleles on plasmid allowed transduction of the chromosomal ΔsecM-secA::tetA mutation, and the resulting strains were nearly normal in protein export (Table 2; see “Experimental Procedures” as well as the supplemental text for the system for examining the in vivo functionality of SecA). As already mentioned, the suppressor mutation, M607T, suppressed the dominant-negative character of SecA(E400R) (Fig. 2B). Finally, we confirmed that a double mutant protein SecA(E400R,M607T) exhibited nearly normal in vitro proOmpA translocation activity (Fig. 5B) and translocation ATPase activity (Fig. 5C) after purification. Strikingly, all the suppressor alleles proved to map within a Met-607-Asn-629 segment of SecA (Fig. 1A). On the three-dimensional structure, these second-site alterations are clustered near the hinge-like NBF2-HSD interface (Fig. 1A, magenta). The suppressor mutations were also able to alleviate the defect caused by the R642E alteration to an extent that the suppressed allele allowed the ΔsecM-secA::tetA chromosomal deletion at 30 °C, although transductants thus obtained exhibited temperature sensitivity (Table 2). In contrast, the suppressors were ineffective against a mutation I789R (32Vrontou E. Karamanou S. Baud C. Sianidis G. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22490-22497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in the intramolecular regulator of ATPase region (data not shown), suggesting that the suppression effects were not due to some general enhancement of SecA activities. Indeed, the ATPase activity of the SecA(M607T) single mutant was somewhat lower than normal (data not shown). From these results, we propose that the 607-629 segment has a role in the ATPase-translocase coupling. We have shown that Arg-642 in HSD and Glu-400 in NBF1 are functionally important. They are located in close mutual proximity such that they could form a salt bridge. Mutational reversal of the charge at either position as well as their disulfide-tethering impaired the translocase function of SecA but not the ability of SecA to up-regulate ATPase activity in response to SecYEG and proOmpA. This novel phenotype of the SecA alterations should be contrasted to the previously characterized translocation-negative SecA variants that are all compromised for the translocation ATPase activity as well. Conversely, none of previously described ATPase-enhancing mutations adversely affects the translocase function. When an ATP-utilizing enzyme is coupled with mechanical work, in which substrate ligands activate the enzyme, two general coupling mechanisms are conceivable. First, the coupling is obligatory in such a way that ligand-induced ATPase activation is mechanistically coupled with the final outcome of the system. In this case, ATPase activation is always accompanied by the concurrent execution of the mechanical work; if the latter is non-functional, ATPase is no longer up-regulated. In the second case, the enzyme is installed with separate modules: a ligand-induced ATPase activation module, a mechanical work module, and a coupling device. Our present results suggest that SecA uses the latter mechanism; the mutational impairment of the proper interplay between NBF1 and HSD allows the ligand-dependent activation of ATPase without ongoing active pre-protein translocation. By analogy, the ATPase, HSD, and the C-terminal translocation domain could perform the respective jobs of a power-controllable engine, a torque converter, and wheels. In the SecA charge-reversed variants, Glu-Glu or Arg-Arg electrostatic repulsion could increase the average distance between positions 400 and 642, whereas the disulfide tethering will keep them positioned closely. The fact that both of these alterations gave the same uncoupled phenotype suggests that this part of the NBF1-HSD interface must be both closely associated and flexible, probably undergoing time-dependent fluctuation in their geometrical arrangements, such as the swinging motion discussed below. In our suppression studies, the second site mutations at the hinge-forming NBF2-HSD boundary alleviated the E400R defect. It is tempting to speculate that the angle of this hinge is designed in wild-type SecA to position HSD at proper proximity to NBF1 and that HSD might swing back and forth in response to the ATPase cycle to drive the preprotein movement. The suppressor mutations could affect the average angle of the hinge to compensate for the mutational Arg-Arg repulsion. Consistent with the importance of the hinge region, our suppressor mutations were themselves partially defective (data not shown). The ATPase-uncoupled SecA variants still interact with the SecYEG translocon and a preprotein, thereby activating the futile ATP hydrolysis. Overexpression of SecA(R642E) or SecA(E400R) in secA+ cells interfered with cell growth, consistent with the inactive but interacting nature of the variant SecA. The ATP-binding pocket of SecA is formed between the two NBFs, but nucleotide binding to the isolated soluble form of SecA does not induce a large conformational change, and the catalytic arginine finger remains far from the γ-phosphate of ATP (10Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), explaining the low intrinsic ATPase activity. In contrast, ATP-dependent conformational change is detectable for SecA in association with the SecYEG channel (33Natale P. den Blaauwen T. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6424-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We propose that SecA interacts with a preprotein at least in two different modes, one for the ATPase regulation and the other for translocation. PPXD might be recruited for the first purpose as it is connected to NBF1 via two anti-parallel β-strand loops, through which a signal of preprotein binding could be transmitted to activate NBF1. A recent report showing that PPXD binds the mature portion of preprotein (34Papanikou E. Karamanou S. Baud C. Frank M. Sianidis G. Keramisanou D. Kalodimos C.G. Kuhn A. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43209-43217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) is consistent with this notion. In contrast to the sensing of an ATPase-activating signal by the PPXD globular domain, physical translocation by the assumed movement of HSD would require that a preprotein be captured more firmly. The crystal structure of the monomeric form of Bacillus subtilis SecA revealed an open groove similar to the substrate-binding grooves of molecular chaperones (10Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, SecA has another and shallower groove located more closely to NFB1 and HSD (6Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with possible complementarity to a signal peptide (35Chou Y.T. Gierasch L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32753-32760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that such substrate-binding cavities are used for the second mode of preprotein binding used for the actual movement of the preprotein. Further, it is conceivable that SecA interacts with SecYEG in two different ways, again for ATPase activation and for translocation drive. Recently, we have carried out site-directed SecY-SecA photocross-linking in vivo and in vitro (36Mori H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar), revealing different modes of SecY-SecA interactions. In particular, the fifth cytosolic domain of SecY interacts stably with the ATPase-PPXD region of SecA. In contrast, the C-terminal tail of SecY presumably associates with other region of SecA, and this latter interaction is transient and coupled with active translocation reaction. These results as well as the results of Dapic and Oliver (37Dapic V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25000-25007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that a N-terminal fragment of SecA is sufficient for the high affinity binding to SecYEG are consistent with our proposal made in this work that the ATPase itself can sense SecYEG as an activating ligand. The maximum ATPase up-regulation, which requires preprotein binding as well, must be accompanied by a substantial conformational change of the ATPase domain (32Vrontou E. Karamanou S. Baud C. Sianidis G. Economou A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22490-22497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to facilitate the arginine finger access to the ATP γ-phosphate and possibly to induce the swinging movement of HSD. The disulfide tethering of positions 400 and 642 seems to prevent SecA from undergoing transition from an ATPase-activated state to a preprotein-driving state. Our genetic analyses presented here lead to the proposal that the ligand-controlled conformational change of the ATPase domain is converted to the mechanical work of preprotein movement by the action of the long α-helical scaffold. This working hypothesis deserves rigorous tests, including structural determination of SecA that is associated with SecYEG and a preprotein. We thank N. Shimokawa and A.

https://openalex.org/W2072801085,"Myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1) is an oncoprotein associated with hemopoietic lineage commitment and acute myeloid leukemia. Here we show that Mlf1 associated with a novel binding partner, Mlf1-associated nuclear protein (Manp), a new heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family member, related to hnRNP-U. Manp localized exclusively in the nucleus and could redirect Mlf1 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The nuclear content of Mlf1 was also regulated by 14-3-3 binding to a canonical 14-3-3 binding motif within the N terminus of Mlf1. Significantly Mlf1 contains a functional nuclear export signal and localized primarily to the nuclei of hemopoietic cells. Mlf1 was capable of binding DNA, and microarray analysis revealed that it affected the expression of several genes, including transcription factors. In summary, this study reveals that Mlf1 translocates between nucleus and cytoplasm, associates with a novel hnRNP, and influences gene expression."

The results indicate that these matrices can be used not only to greatly stabilize protein structures but also to facilitate both thermal and photo-initiated hemeprotein reduction over large macroscopic distances. To date the promise of exciting new protein-based technologies that can harness the exceptional tunability of protein functionality has been significantly thwarted by both intrinsic instability and stringent solvent/environment requirements for the expression of functional properties. The presented results raise the prospect of overcoming these limitations with respect to incorporating redox active proteins into solid state devices such as tunable batteries, switches, and solar cells. The findings also have implications for formulations intended to enhance long term storage of biomaterials, new protein-based synthetic strategies, and biophysical studies of functional intermediates trapped under nonequilibrium conditions. In addition, the study shows that certain sugars such as glucose or tagatose, when added to redox-inactive glassy matrices, can be used as a source of thermal electrons that can be harvested by suitable redox active proteins, raising the prospect of using common sugars as an electron source in solid state thermal fuel cells. Trehalose-derived glasses are shown to support long range electron transfer reactions between spatially well separated donors and protein acceptors.

To date the promise of exciting new protein-based technologies that can harness the exceptional tunability of protein functionality has been significantly thwarted by both intrinsic instability and stringent solvent/environment requirements for the expression of functional properties. The presented results raise the prospect of overcoming these limitations with respect to incorporating redox active proteins into solid state devices such as tunable batteries, switches, and solar cells. The findings also have implications for formulations intended to enhance long term storage of biomaterials, new protein-based synthetic strategies, and biophysical studies of functional intermediates trapped under nonequilibrium conditions. In addition, the study shows that certain sugars such as glucose or tagatose, when added to redox-inactive glassy matrices, can be used as a source of thermal electrons that can be harvested by suitable redox active proteins, raising the prospect of using common sugars as an electron source in solid state thermal fuel cells. Many plants and animals express large amounts of sugars when osmotically stressed (1Arguelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The ability of sugars as such trehalose to form glassy matrices under conditions of drying is generally thought to be responsible for anhydrobiosis (2Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Anhydrobiosis. 1992; 54: 579-599Google Scholar, 3Crowe J.H. Carpenter J.F. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 73-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), whereby the cellular machinery is essentially frozen in the glass allowing for long term survival of the organism under conditions of extreme dryness. This phenomenon is the basis for substantial efforts directed toward the creation of suitable carbohydrate-based glassy matrices for the purpose of long term preservation of pharmaceuticals and food items (4Crowe L.M.

Friedman J.M. Agmon N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1749: 234-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which results in dramatic conformational stabilization with respect to thermal denaturation and degradation. Both the damping of macromolecular dynamics and the dramatic decrease in the mobility of water within sugar-derived glasses are viewed as the foundation for designing stable sugar-based matrices for long-term maintenance of proteins and other biomolecules under relatively severe conditions. Under such conditions it is assumed that the matrix would be chemically inert. In the present study it is demonstrated that dry glassy matrices can support very long range electron transfer initiated by generating either thermal or photo electrons.Most proteins when incorporated into glassy matrices can no longer function due to the extreme damping of many functionally important motions. Redox reactions, although influenced by protein dynamics, can still occur even when the proteins are immobilized. In a preliminary study (13Ray A. Friedman B.A. Friedman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7270-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) it was shown that doping trehalose glasses containing either methemoglobin or metmyoglobin with glucose (a reducing sugar) resulted in samples that undergo facile thermal reduction. In the present work we demonstrate not only that such processes are likely to be general but that these glass-facilitated redox reactions can occur over surprisingly large macroscopic distances.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Reagents and proteins were all obtained from Sigma with the exception of tagatose (generous gift from Spherix Inc.), deazaflavin (a generous gift of Dr. Bruce Palfey, University of Michigan), myoglobin mutants (generous gifts from Dr. John Olson, Rice University), and oxygenated human adult hemoglobin (a generous gift from Dr. Seetharama Acharya).Methods—Thin (∼1 mm or less) glassy matrices were prepared from stock solutions of either (a) 80:20 mg/ml of trehalose:sucrose or (b) 60:20:20 mg/ml trehalose:sucrose:glucose (or either fructose or tagatose, d-lyxohexulose, a stereoisomer of fructose) in deionized water. The use of the combined trehalose/sucrose protocol over one with just trehalose eliminated the occasional formation of crystals during drying (14Dashnau J.L. Zelent B. Vanderkooi J.M. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 114: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Wright W.W. Carlos Baez J. Vanderkooi J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 307: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The glucose, fructose, and tagatose were introduced as potential sources of thermally generated electrons. The above solutions were mixed with aliquots of stock solution of proteins to achieve concentrations of 0.25 mm in protein. Small aliquots of the resulting solutions were layered on a glass plate, dried in a desiccator for several days, and then warmed at 40 °C for 40 min. The cooled samples were stored in a sealed container at room temperature. For the two-layer sandwich experiments, the protein-containing first layer was prepared by the first method (a). For the thermal-mediated reduction experiments, protocol b without protein was used to generate the second layer. For light-mediated reduction, 10 μl of a deazaflavin solution (0.5 mg/ml in deionized water) was added to protocol b without the addition of protein. Deazaflavin is an effective source of photo-generated electrons (16Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The two extensively dried and preheated glassy layers were then sandwiched together and either heated or illuminated (390-nm light). Subsequent to either the heating or the illumination protocols, the two sandwiched layers were separated. The visible absorption spectrum was then generated from the protein-containing layer and in some cases from a protein solution derived from redissolving the protein-containing glassy layer.For the long distance photo-electron transfer measurement, glassy matrices were prepared using three different stock solutions as follows; (a) 80 mg of trehalose and 20 mg of sucrose added to and dissolved in 1 ml of a stock solution of 0.1 mm FMN and 0.2 mm NADPH in deionized water; the combination of FMN and NADPH has been shown to be effective in the photo-reduction of hemeproteins in solution (17Brunori M. Giuffre A. Nienhaus K. Nienhaus G.U. Scandurra F.M. Vallone B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8483-8488Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar); (b) 80:20 mg/ml trehalose:sucrose dissolved in 1 ml of deionized water; (c) 80:20 mg/ml trehalose:sucrose dissolved in 1 ml of a 0.2 mm cytochrome c (Fe(III)) solution.A small aliquot of solution from a and then c were placed separately on the same glass slide separated by ∼4 cm. These two separated “drops” were dried extensively, yielding well separated uniform glassy matrices. Then the gap between the separated glasses was bridged with a thin fast drying strip of the viscous protocol b solution. In one case this glassy linker actually made contact with the two initially prepared glasses, and in the other case silver paste was used to bridge a small residual gap between the ends of glassy linker and the two initially prepared glasses. The drying time of the linker was sufficiently fast to preclude any obvious dissolving of the initially prepared glasses. The FMN/NADPH-containing portion of the sample was selectively illuminated (420 nm).For thermally initiated long range electron transfer measurements, samples were prepared as in the above photo-initiated measurements except that the protein used was met human adult hemoglobin (HbA), 2The abbreviations used are: HbA, human adult hemoglobin; Mb, horse myoglobin; Cc, cytochrome c; au, absorbance units. and instead of the FMN/NADPH-doped glass, a tagatose-doped glass (as in method b) was used. The sample was then subjected to heating cycles, and the absorption spectrum of the Hb was recorded after each cycle. The control utilized a tagatose-free glass. In the following sections we use the designations Glass 1, 2, and 3 to indicate that the glass in question has either no added additional sugar (beyond the trehalose/sucrose mixture), added glucose, or added tagatose, respectively.RESULTSHeating in the Absence and Presence of Added Glucose (Glasses 1 and 2)—Fig. 1 compares Glass 1 and Glass 2 with respect the spectral changes occurring when heating glass-embedded oxidized derivatives of horse myoglobin (Mb), human adult hemoglobin (Hb), and cytochrome c (Cc) embedded in a thin glassy layer from a trehalose-sucrose mixture. The panels on the left, labeled Mb, Hb, and Cc, show the progressive changes with heating for a glucose-free glass (Glass 1), whereas the panels on the right labeled Mb*, Hb*, and Cc* show the thermal-induced changes for glucose-doped glass (Glass 2). In all cases discussed in this work, the absorption spectra are recorded after the heated sample has cooled back down to ambient temperatures. The initial glassy sample before heating typically manifests the absorption spectrum of the corresponding solution phase sample unless otherwise noted. For Mb and Hb these spectra correspond to the aquomet derivative in which water is the sixth ligand of a high spin ferric heme iron. The spectrum from the ferric Cc sample is characteristic of a six-coordinate low spin ferric heme. In contrast to Hb and Mb, the heme-iron for Cc has a permanent intrinsic sixth ligand derived from a methionine side chain.The spectra after the heating cycle for the aquomet Mb and Hb samples in the absence of added glucose show no indication of reduction. Although the spectra show no indication of reduction, they do demonstrate the progressive formation of the oxidized six-coordinate derivative of the two proteins known as the hemichrome (18Rachmilewitz E.A. Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3356-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemichrome formation, often associated with significant osmotic stress (13Ray A. Friedman B.A. Friedman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7270-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Liu W. Guo X. Guo R. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2005; 37: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is the result of the imidazole side chain of the distal histidine replacing water as the sixth ligand. Dissolving the glass in aqueous buffer resulted in the full recovery of the standard spectra of the initial aquomet derivatives. The corresponding heat cycling for the glucose-free Cc samples showed no substantive changes in the initial spectrum attributed to the initial oxidized Cc derivative.In marked contrast to the results obtained for the glucose-free samples, the glucose-containing samples show clear evidence of reduction upon heating. The panels labeled Mb* and Hb* both show that the initial heating cycle results in the loss of the aquomet spectra and the appearance of five coordinate ferrous heme spectra both in the visible region and near IR regions. Continued heating produces a contribution to the spectra from the six-coordinate reduced species known as the hemochrome (18Rachmilewitz E.A. Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3356-3366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), again the result of osmotic stress. Dissolving these hemochrome samples in aerated buffer yields the standard spectra associated with the fully oxygenated derivatives of either Hb or Mb. The Cc* panels show the conversion with heating of the oxidized Cc spectrum to that of the fully reduced Cc spectrum. The reduction of oxidized Cc is observed to occur at substantially lower temperatures than for either Mb or Hb.Thermal-mediated Protein Reduction; Sugar Dependence— For a given protein and preparative protocol, the thermal reduction profile is highly sensitive to the specific sugar added to the trehalose/sucrose glass. Fig. 2 shows that the degree of reduction for a glass-embedded sample of aquomet HbA heated at 65 °C for 45 min is a function of added sugar to the trehalose/sucrose glass. The three added sugars, all monosaccharides, are glucose, fructose, and tagatose. The extent of reduction as reflected in the appearance of deoxy spectral features increases in going from glucose to fructose to tagatose. When tagatose was added to a ferric Cc-containing glass (Glass 3), extensive reduction was fully apparent upon drying, even at ambient temperatures without any heat cycling (not shown).FIGURE 2Spectra of single layer glassy samples of aquomet HbA subsequent to heating (65 °C for 45 min) as a function of added additional sugars (glucose, fructose, and tagatose) included in the glass-forming trehalose/sucrose mixture.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sugar-mediated Thermal Reduction of Mb Does Not Require Either a Distal Histidine or a Sixth Ligand—Fig. 3 shows that glucose-mediated thermal reduction occurs for two Mb mutants that have distal histidine (His-64) replacements. In Fig. 3, panel A, the thermal reduction of Mb(H64L) is shown. The H64L mutation resulted in the introduction of a nonpolar side chain in lieu of the polar imidazole side chain of the histidine. This replacement resulted in a water-free distal heme pocket, and as a result the met derivative is a five-coordinate high spin species as reflected in the Soret band at 395 nm. As can be seen in the figure, the heating cycle generates a species with an absorption spectrum characteristic of a deoxy derivative. The position of Band III for this species is at ∼767 nm (not shown), a value characteristic of a deoxy Mb with a relatively nonpolar/water-free distal heme pocket (20Christian J.F. Unno M. Sage J.T. Champion P.M. Chien E. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11198-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The end point spectrum after the heating cycles is virtually identical to that of the solution phase deoxy sample of this mutant (not shown). The panel shows a similar thermal reduction pattern for the Mb(H64Q) mutant. Here the mutation replaces the imidazole-sided chain with another polar side chain but without the potential redox-mediating capacity of the imidazole. The spectra are consistent with water being present in the met derivative. The position of Band III (not shown) for the end point deoxy species is 760 nm, a value consistent with a water-containing distal heme pocket.FIGURE 3Changes in the absorption spectra as a function of heating for glucose-doped glasses with embedded Mb(H64L) shown in panel A and Mb(H64Q) shown in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Glass Composition Dependence of the Thermal Reduction Process—Fig. 4 shows the influence of doping an HbA-containing Glass 2 with 5% by volume glycerol (no preheating). In contrast to the glycerol-free Glass 2 sample, which manifests the unaltered aquomet HbA spectrum, the initial spectrum of the glycerol-doped samples at ambient temperature is characteristic of the hemichrome form of HbA. Subsequent to a 45-min 75 °C heating cycle, the glycerol-doped sample had undergone nearly complete reduction, but the resulting species was the hemochrome derivative, in contrast to the five-coordinate deoxy derivative that was generated using a comparable glycerol-free Glass 2 sample subjected to a similar heating cycle. Preliminary results with chitosan-doped trehalose/sucrose glasses (made from 12.5 mg of chitosan dissolved in 1 ml of the trehalose/sucrose starting solution) show a similar enhancement in the formation of the hemichrome; however, the chitosan also reduces the threshold for thermal reduction, i.e. reduction occurs at lower temperatures when compared with the corresponding chitosan-free sample. The addition of polyvinyl alcohol to the glass samples enhanced the flexibility of the glass but eliminated the thermal reduction capabilities of the resulting glass. We also fully bathed a thin aquomet Hb-containing tetramethoxysilane-derived porous sol-gel sample in an excess of the Glass 2 starting solution and found that after allowing the sample to sit for several days then pouring off the excess solution and allowing the sample to thoroughly dry, we obtained a visually glassy sample that still manifested the starting aquomet HbA spectrum. Repeated heating cycles similar to those described above did not result in any observed sample reduction; however, with heating the spectrum of the sample rapidly converted to and remained that of the hemichrome. Soaking the sample in an excess of N2-purged buffer did not reverse the hemichrome spectrum; however, subsequent addition of reducing agent (dithionite) and CO to the buffer resulted in a ferrous CO Hb spectrum for the encapsulated HbA.FIGURE 4Changes in the absorption spectrum of aquomet HbA embedded in a trehalose/sucrose glass doped with both glucose and glycerol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Trehalose/Sucrose Glass Supports Photo-initiated Hemeprotein Reduction at Ambient Temperatures—The above results all show that the monosaccharide-doped trehalose/sucrose glasses support thermally initiated hemeprotein reduction. Fig. 5 shows that photo-generated electrons within the glass at ambient temperatures are also effective in reducing embedded hemeproteins. The shown spectra are from aquomet HbA embedded in a deazaflavin-doped Glass 3. Similar results were obtained with a deazaflavin-doped Glass 1, but the extent of reduction as a function of illumination time was more extensive for the Glass 3 sample. The figure shows the initial met Hb spectrum being converted to the deoxy Hb spectrum with continued illumination. Without deazaflavin there is no reduction under these illumination conditions (excitation at ∼390 nm); however, illumination in the absence of the deazaflavin with 280-290-nm light does result in progressive reduction of the met Hb sample, which is likely the result of the direct tryptophan excitation (21Sakai H. Onuma H. Umeyama M. Takeoka S. Tsuchida E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14595-14602Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Changes as a function of illumination time at ambient temperature in the absorption spectrum for aquomet HbA in a deazaflavin doped trehalose/sucrose/tagatose single thin layer glassy matrix.

In those single film experiments it is not clear to what extent the electron donor and acceptor are physically separated. In the two-layer sandwich experiments the donor and acceptor are in separate dry films. These two-layer experiments also address the question of whether the monosaccharide-dependent differences in thermal reduction efficiency arise from differences in the physical properties of the different monosaccharide doped glasses as a function of temperature or from differences in the ability of these sugars to generate thermal electrons.Fig. 6 shows both a schematic for the two-layer protocol and results from two different sandwich experiments. In both these and all the other two-layer experiments, the two layers were separated subsequent to the heating cycle before the absorption measurements. In all cases there was no visual evidence of mixing of the two dry glasses as reflected in the absence of any heme-associated red coloring in the protein-free layer.FIGURE 6Thermal- and light-mediated reduction of glass embedded aquomet HbA in a two-layer sandwich configuration. In the top panel the Hb-containing layer is joined with a glucose-containing protein free layer and then heated. The black trace is from the sample where both layers were separately preheated at 40 °C for 45 min and then combined. The red trace is from the sample after the combined two layers underwent heating at 75 °C for 45 min. The bottom panel shows the light-induced absorption changes for a sandwich in which the non-Hb-containing glass contained deazaflavin. The black and red traces are from the glassy Hb sample before and after a 3-h illumination with low intensity light at 390 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Fig. 6 top panel below the schematic shows results from a two-layer thermal reduction experiment. An aquomet HbA-containing trehalose/sucrose layer was sandwiched with a second protein-free glassy layer containing tagatose as a dopant (60:20:20 mg/ml trehalose:sucrose:tagatose in deionized water). The sandwich was heated at 75 °C for 45 min, and then the two layers were separated once the sample cooled to ambient temperature. The figure shows that with heating of the sandwich, the initial aquomet HbA spectrum (black curve) converted to the spectrum (red curve) associated with the reduced high spin form of HbA (often referred to as deoxy-HbA). The appearance as well of the near infrared absorption band at ∼760 nm, associated only with the reduced deoxy derivative, is also shown in the inset. Dissolving the Hb-containing sample under atmospheric conditions yields a sample that manifest the spectrum associated with the standard oxygenated ferrous derivative of HbA. As previously reported for the single layer trehalose experiments (13Ray A. Friedman B.A. Friedman J.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7270-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we observe that when the protein-free layer is derived exclusively from the trehalose/sucrose mixture, the only heat-induced spectral changes are those associated with the formation of the hemichrome.The bottom panel of Fig. 6 shows an analogous sandwich experiment but with photo electrons instead of thermal electrons being the source of the protein reduction. In this case the protein-free layer was lightly doped with deazaflavin (10 μl of 0.5 mg/ml stock of deazaflavin in deionized water added to the 1 ml of solution containing trehalose and sucrose), and the sandwich was illuminated with spectrally isolated (using a filter) 390-nm light at ambient temperature for approximately 2 h. The figure shows that after the illumination cycle the protein-containing layer had undergone changes, indicating significant reduction of the initial aquomet HbA sample. Similar results were obtained for ferric cytochrome c and aquomet Mb. Control single or double layer samples that were without deazaflavin did not show any changes in the spectrum of the initial ferric derivatives after illumination at 390 nm. FMN/NADPH-doped glasses were not as effective as deazaflavin with respect to complete reduction of Hb or Mb samples.Fig. 7 shows the resulting spectra for four met HbA two-layer sandwich samples that have been subjected to the identical heating cycle (70 °C for 1 h). In each case the Hb-containing layer is a Glass 1 sample, and the protein-free layer is a trehalose/sucrose glass that is varied with respect to added monosaccharides (control with only trehalose/sucrose, glucose, fructose, tagatose). The extent of reduction follows the same pattern as seen for the single layer samples. The extent of reduction again increases in the progression control (trehalose/sucrose with no other added sugar) << glucose < fructose < tagatose.FIGURE 7The absorption spectra subsequent to heating at 70 °C for 1 h of a sample of aquomet HbA embedded in a trehalose/sucrose glassy layer sandwiched with different protein-free glass samples. The results are shown from samples using four different protein-free layers: trehalose/sucrose (control), trehalose/sucrose/glucose, trehalose/sucrose/fructose, and trehalose/sucrose/tagatose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Electron Transfer between Macroscopically Separated Proteins—The single and double layer experiments show electron transfer to proteins from either sugars or flavins. These results indicate that the glass matrices should also support interprotein redox reactions. Fig. 8 shows the spectra of the individual layers comprising a two-layer sandwich consisting of a deoxy-HbA Glass 1 layer and an Fe(III) Cc Glass 1 layer both before and after heating (50 °C for 45 min) the two-layer sandwich. Before heating, the spectra are consistent with the HbA and Cc samples being in the reduced and oxidized states, respectively. The redox status of the samples reverses subsequent to the heating cycle. The Cc spectrum is now clearly that of the reduced derivative, and that of the HbA sample resembles that of the hydroxyl met derivative. The results are consistent with thermal-mediated electron transfer from the HbA sample to the Cc sample as would be anticipated based on the latter having the known higher redox potential.FIGURE 8The absorption spectra of separated glassy layers of aquomet HbA and oxidized Cc before and after the two layers are sandwiched together, heated (50 °C for 45 min), and then re-separated. Both proteins are embedded in a trehalose/sucrose glass with any additional sugars or additives.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Very Long Range Electron Transfer within Glassy Matrices—A more dramatic illustration of the capacity of the glassy matrices to support electron transfer was obtained using a protocol where a glass containing the electron source and a second well separated (∼40 mm) glass containing the protein electron acceptor were physically linked by a strip of glass that was free of either the addition of added sugars or protein (Glass 1). Fig. 9 shows a schematic of the physical arrangement and the results obtained for a heat cycling protocol utilizing met HbA and tagatose as the physically separated but linked electron acceptor and thermal electron source, respectively."

However, direct evidence for an induced-fit mechanism through the observation of real-time protein conformational rearrangements coupled to specificity have been quantitated for a small number of enzymes (17Purohit V. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10200-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Tsai Y.C. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9675-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Enzymes that sequence-specifically modify DNA, including nucleases, repair enzymes, and methyltransferases are faced with severe challenges of substrate recognition and specificity due to the overwhelming abundance of sites that are closely related to the cognate sequence (1von Hippel P.H. Science. 2004; 305: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Halford S.E. Marko J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 5Chen B.N.

Science. 1994; 266: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mechanisms posited to account for this discrimination are diverse and often require an induced-fit process as the enzyme-DNA complex moves from a nonspecific site to the cognate sequence (22dela Sapienza P.J.

The availability of high resolution structures of cognate DNA-enzyme complexes for many such systems provides a detailed understanding of specific interactions leading to tight and cognate binding (24Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 27Reinisch K.M. Chen L. Verdine G.L. Lipscomb W.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 143-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, interactions leading to nonspecific substrate binding, which facilitate site searching, are far less characterized (1von Hippel P.H. Science. 2004; 305: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Halford S.E. Marko J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 28Halford S.E. Szczelkun M.D. Eur. Biophysics J. 2002; 31: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interconversion of conformers as the enzyme goes from nonspecific to cognate sites prior to forming the catalytically competent complex can contribute to such specificity (13Powell R.M. Parkhurst K.M. Parkhurst L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7776-7784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Erie D.A. Yang G.L. Schultz H.C. Bustamante C.

The DNA cytosine C5 methyltransferase M.HhaI binds DNA substrates between its two domains and the cofactor AdoMet 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; WT, wild type; M.HhaI, C5 cytosine methyltransferase type I from Haemophilius haemolyticus; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; NS, nonspecific; 2AP, 2-aminopurine. 2The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; WT, wild type; M.HhaI, C5 cytosine methyltransferase type I from Haemophilius haemolyticus; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; NS, nonspecific; 2AP, 2-aminopurine. in the large domain near the active site (see Fig. 1). Inspection of two cocrystal structures of M.HhaI, one involving the cognate DNA and the cofactor product AdoHcy (3MHT.pdb) (24Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), the other involving nonspecific DNA and AdoHcy (2HMY.pdb) (32O'Gara M. Zhang X. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggest that the enzyme may exploit an induced-fit mechanism. Induced-fit DNA binding was first proposed for M.HhaI in 1994 when the first ternary complex with cognate DNA, cofactor, and WT enzyme was solved (24Klimasauskas S. Kumar S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). This complex shows a flexible loop (residues 80-100) in a closed conformation, ∼26 Å from its position in the open conformer as seen in the structure without DNA. The loop closed conformer makes contacts to the DNA minor groove and correctly positions active site residues such as Cys-81, which is the essential, active site nucleophile. The nonspecific complex of M.HhaI shows the loop in the open conformer, similar to that observed in the binary enzyme-AdoMet complex (33Cheng X. Kumar S. Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the nonspecific complex lacks electron density for the DNA, thus preventing the identification of specific contacts between the enzyme and nonspecific DNA, the processes utilized to scan nonspecific DNA, and the mechanisms that allow the enzyme to differentiate between nonspecific and cognate sites. We sought to directly probe several functional aspects of the flexible loop in M.HhaI catalysis, all of which are uniquely addressable with a solution-based approach. First, the structural information on cognate and nonspecific complexes suggests that loop positioning is determined by the sequence of the bound DNA, thus providing a molecular basis for an inducedfit mechanism. Second, the temporal assignment of loop movement in relation to other known steps in the reaction cycle, such as base flipping, could be insightful for understanding if these processes are enzyme-assisted or occur passively (9Stivers J.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 77: 37-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Wong I. Lundquist A.J. Bernards A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19424-19432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Third, our recent work on M.HhaI and other DNA methyltransferases suggests that conformational rearrangements such as the loop movement in M.HhaI or DNA bending by M.EcoRI can directly contribute to specificity (29Allan B.W.

Importantly, the highly conserved nature of this loop among DNA cytosine methyltransferases (36Kumar S. Cheng X.D. Klimasauskas S. Mi S. Posfai J. Roberts R.J. Wilson G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) suggests our results may be broadly applicable. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Three single and two double mutants of WT M.HhaI were constructed, W41F, K91W, E94W, W41F/K91W, and W41F/E94W using the QuikChange PCR mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were sequenced by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Biotechnology Center (Urbana, IL) to confirm the proper sequence changes were made and that no secondary mutations were created. All mutant and WT proteins were expressed with C-terminal His6 tags; WT M.HhaI shows nearly identical functional and kinetic parameters with and without the His6 tag. 3M. M. Purdy and N. O. Reich, unpublished results. For purification, cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% triton X-100, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed with 300 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for ∼30 min at room temperature. Suspensions were cooled on ice, and additional NaCl and imidazole were added to bring final concentrations to 1 m and 20 mm, respectively. Suspensions were sonicated 10-15 times with a 2-min burst at 50% duty. Lysate was centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto a ∼3 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with Low End Buffer (LEB, 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm imidazole). The column was washed with LEB until absorbance of the eluant at 280 nm was unchanged over time, usually 10-20 column volumes. The buffer was then switched to LEB with 200 mm NaCl where it was washed for ∼5 additional column volumes. Lowering the salt from 1 m to 200 mm allowed eluant to be directly loaded onto the second ion-exchange column. The protein was eluted in a single step with LEB, which contained 200 mm NaCl and 300 mm imidazole and was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Eluted protein was then loaded onto a phosphocellulose column equilibrated with Extraction Buffer (EB, 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA). The column was washed with EB until the absorbance of the eluant at 280 nm remained unchanged over time, and the protein was eluted in a single step with EB, which contained 800 mm NaCl. The protein was dialyzed overnight in EB with 10% glycerol, and aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford, SDS-PAGE densitometry, and absorbance at 280 nm. Substrate Preparation—DNA substrates used for kinetic and fluorescence studies were all synthesized by Midlands DNA (Midland, TX) and high-performance liquid chromatography purified. The following single strand oligonucleotide sequences were used: AboxTOP, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGCGCAGTGGGTGGATCCG-3′; MboxBOT, 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCGMGTCACCCACCTAGGC-5′; BboxTOP, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGBGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′; CboxBOT, 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCCMGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′; DboxTOP, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGAGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′; PboxTOP, 5′-GGGAATTCATGGPGCAGTGGGTGGATCCAG-3′;HB0boxBOT, 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCNMGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′;HB1boxBOT, 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCPMGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′; HB2boxBOT, 3′-CCCTTAAGTACCIMGTCACCCACCTAGGTC-5′;NSTOP, 5′-CAACAACTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCAACAAC-3′; and NSBOT, 3′-GTTGTTGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGTTGTTG-5′. Recognition sites are underlined, and target bases are in boldface where M is 5-methyl cytosine, P is 2-aminopurine (2AP), I is inosine, N is nebularine (purine), and B is an abasic nucleotide. Duplex substrates were annealed to form AMbox DNA from AboxTOP and MboxBOT, BMbox DNA from BboxTOP and MboxBOT, CMbox DNA from AboxTOP and CboxBOT, DMbox DNA from DboxTOP and MboxBOT, PMbox DNA from PboxTOP and MboxBOT, HB0box DNA from AboxTOP and HB0boxBOT, HB1box DNA from AboxTOP and HB1boxBOT, HB2box DNA from AboxTOP and HB2boxBOT, and NS DNA from NSTOP and NSBOT. All substrates are hemi-methylated to force bound enzymes to a single orientation. AdoMet and AdoHcy were purchased from Sigma. For DNA KD measurements, DNA substrates were radiolabeled by using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). All substrate concentrations were spectrophotometrically determined using Beer's Law and calculated extinction coefficients (37Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Determination of kcat—Steady-state product formation over time was monitored at 4 °C using a filter binding assay previously described (38Estabrook R.A. Lipson R. Hopkins B. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31419-31428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to determine observed kcat values (see Table 1). These values are only observed kcat values, because substrate concentrations were not fully saturating; all enzymes were measured under identical conditions. Briefly, enzyme (10 nm) was added to 3H-labeled AdoMet (2.8 μm) and AMbox DNA (4.0 μm) in methyltransferase reaction buffer (MR buffer, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Aliquots were spotted onto 2.3-cm DE-81 filters at 5-min intervals. Washed filters were counted for 3H, and the data were fit to a straight line using SigmaPlot. Samples were analyzed with a Beckman Coulter LS6500 MultiPurpose scintillation counter.TABLE 1Kinetic and thermodynamic properties of enzymes studiedObserved constantWTW41FW41F/K91WW41F/E94Wkcat (s−1) 4 °C0.015 ± 0.0010.025 ± 0.0010.021 ± 0.0030.019 ± 0.001kchem (s−1) 4 °C0.037 ± 0.0030.039 ± 0.0040.031 ± 0.0020.033 ± 0.003KD AMbox-AdoHcy (pm)14.0 ± 1.1182 ± 21177 ± 35146 ± 24KD DMbox-AdoHcy (pm)135 ± 28770 ± 170405 ± 691217 ± 89KD AMbox (nm)13.4 ± 2.613.5 ± 1.710.7 ± 2.718.4 ± 2.2KD DMbox (pm)492 ± 70327 ± 49300 ± 34335 ± 47KD NS DNA (nm)aValue reported for a 40-bp oligonucleotide with ∼30 nonspecific sites.405 ± 42405 ± 99235 ± 53109 ± 34a Value reported for a 40-bp oligonucleotide with ∼30 nonspecific sites. Open table in a new tab Single-turnover Determination of kchem—Kinetic constants for the rate of methyl transfer were measured at 4 °C using a single-turnover filter binding assay, which was previously described (38Estabrook R.A. Lipson R. Hopkins B. Reich N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31419-31428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). Briefly, enzyme (1 μm) was added to 3H-labeled AdoMet (2.8 μm) and AMbox DNA (200 nm)in MR buffer with time points taken over 150 s. To quench the reaction, 12 μl of reaction mixture was added to 6 μl of 0.4% SDS with 0.5 m HCl and then neutralized with 6 μl of 0.5 m Tris base, and 20 μl were spotted onto DE-81 filters. Washed filters were counted for 3H, and data were fit to exponential curves using SigmaPlot. Gel-shift Determination of KD—12% non-denaturing PAGE mobility shifts were used to measure KD values for AMbox DNA, DMbox DNA, and NS DNA, with and without the addition of AdoHcy (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). For shifts with AdoHcy, 32P-labeled AMbox or DMbox DNA (∼4pm) and AdoHcy (24 μm) in MR buffer were titrated with enzyme (from 1 pm to 2.025 nm) at 22 °C. For shifts without AdoHcy, 32P-labeled AMbox or DMbox DNA (∼10 pm) in MR buffer was titrated with enzyme (from 2 pm to 450 nm). To determine the KD for nonspecific DNA, 32P-labeled NS DNA (∼40 pm) was titrated with enzyme (from 1 nm to 10 μm) with and without AdoHcy (24 μm). Gels were scanned on a Storm 840 densitometer (Amersham Biosciences), and band densitometry was determined using ImageQuaNT (Amersham Biosciences). Data were fit to a rectangular hyperbola using SigmaPlot. Equilibrium Fluorescence—Equilibrium fluorescence was monitored at 22 °C with excitation at 290 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer. All measurements were made in fluorescence buffer (FL buffer, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm EDTA). Excitation at other wavelengths was conducted, but 290 nm was found to be optimal for Trp excitation with the least inner filter effect from substrates, DNA in particular. All measurements were made with enzyme (1 μm) and DNA (1.2 μm). Ten 200-nm/s scans from 300 to 430 nm were made and averaged for each spectrum with slit widths of 7.5 mm (see Fig. 3). Inner filter effect corrections were made in Excel (Microsoft) using absorbance measurements at 290 nm and a previously reported method (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectropscopy, 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity comparisons between the free amino acids Trp, phenylalanine, and tyrosine were done in FL buffer at room temperature by monitoring emission from 300 to 430 nm with excitation at 290 nm (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectropscopy, 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Fluorescence—Stopped-flow measurements were made at 4 °C with excitation at two wavelengths, 290 and 310 nm, for Trp and 2AP, respectively. 4-mm slit widths were used on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow reaction analyzer equipped with a single channel emission photomultiplier tube positioned 90° from the excitation beam. All experiments were done in FL buffer, and observed rates were fit using an SpectraKinetic workstation (Applied Photophysics). At least ten shots were averaged for each data point, which was then repeated in at least duplicate. For Trp excitation, a 295 nm filter was used while a 320 nm filter was used for 2AP measurements. 2AP measurements were made by mixing PMbox DNA (50 nm) with enzyme titrations (from 250 nm to 1 μm) and monitoring fluorescence emission for 1.0 s. Traces of 2AP emission for WT, W41F, W41F/K91W, and W41F/E94W were fit to double exponential equations using the program SigmaPlot. Trp fluorescence measurements were made using AdoHcy, AdoMet, AMbox, DMbox, and NS DNA. W41F, W41F/K91W, or W41F/E94W (1 μm) were mixed with NS DNA, AMbox DNA, or DMbox DNA (5 μm) for optimal examination of the residuals (see Fig. 4). Enzyme (200 nm) was mixed with AMbox or DMbox DNA (from 1 to 5 μm) to determine apparent rate constants reported in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 5. To monitor residuals shown in Fig. 6, W41F/E94W (500 nm) was mixed with AMbox, BMbox, CMbox, HB0box, HB1box, or HB2box DNA (1 μm), and fits were determined using the program SigmaPlot. W41F, W41F/K91W, or W41F/E94W (200-500 nm) fluorescence was also monitored during the addition of AdoHcy and AdoMet (from 1 to 100 μm) (data not shown).TABLE 2Fluorescence rate constantsEnzymeAMboxDMboxaValues were obtained by monitoring Trp fluorescence.PMboxbValues were obtained by monitoring 2AP fluorescence.Phase 1Phase 2Phase 1Phase 2nM−1 s−1nM−1 s−1s−1nM−1 s−1s−1WTNDcND, not determined.NDND0.066 ± 0.00411.1 ± 2.1W41F0.020 ± 0.0030.015 ± 0.005NAdNA, not applicable due to monophasic data.0.071 ± 0.0074.3 ± 1.8W41F/E94W0.024 ± 0.0020.038 ± 0.0035.6 ± 4.50.072 ± 0.00223.0 ± 8.7a Values were obtained by monitoring Trp fluorescence.b Values were obtained by monitoring 2AP fluorescence.c ND, not determined.d NA, not applicable due to monophasic data.

A two-step binding process was modeled; E + S↔ES↔EZ with the reverse rates for each step set very slow (<0.007 s-1). The observed second order rate constant was used for the forward reaction of the first step, and values for the forward rate of the second step were varied from 50 to 1000 s-1. Protein fluorescence was monitored to obtain a variety of rate constants for a conformational rearrangement, which occurs in M.HhaI upon DNA addition. Novel Trp mutations (W41F/K91W and W41F/E94W) were engineered into the flexible loop (residues 80-100), which undergoes a DNA-dependent structural reorganization. All mutant enzymes have near WT function. Solution-based equilibrium and transientstate measurements were made to monitor differential Trp quenching between conformers as they occur upon substrate addition. Kinetic and Thermodynamic Properties—We measured observed kcat, kchem, and KD values for WT, W41F, W41F/K91W, and W41F/E94W, which are summarized in Table 1. These results show that the mutant enzymes are highly functional and validate the fluorescence data discussed below. All enzymes maintained a kinetic burst of product formation under pre-steady-state conditions (data not shown) confirming that methylation is followed by a slower, product release step (37Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cognate DNA binding is roughly 10-fold weaker for all mutants but only under ternary conditions, involving protein, DNA, and AdoHcy. Interestingly, any perturbations in the function of W41F/K91W and W41F/E94W are also present in W41F, which was previously characterized (39Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectropscopy, 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). This implies that the W41F mutation has more impact on M.HhaI function than introduction of a novel Trp into the highly flexible loop. We conclude that Trp substitutions at positions 91 and 94 in the flexible loop have not greatly perturbed enzymatic functions when compared with WT. KD Determination of NS DNA Gel Mobility Shift—The dissociation constant (KD) for nonspecific (NS) DNA was determined for all enzymes to confirm that in subsequent fluorescence experiments the enzymes were fully bound (see Fig. 2). For all enzymes, little difference was observed between measured NS KD values with and without cofactor, and values are reported without cofactor in Table 1. These measurements are critical, because they show that M.HhaI is fully bound (> 99%) to nonspecific DNA substrates under the conditions of the fluorescence experiments. Gel-shift data were fit to a rectangular hyperbolic equation, and KD values are reported in Table 1. All dissociation constants are in the nanomolar range for the 40-bp NS DNA molecule, which corresponds to a micromolar range for potential binding sites, consistent with previously reported values for DNA methyltransferases (40Martin A.M. Horton N.C. Lusetti S. Reich N.O. Perona J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8430-8439Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Surby M.A. Reich N.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2209-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Fluorescence—The fluorescence studies presented here were limited to the two binary complexes involving DNA and protein, or cofactor and protein. Justification for this comes from three observations. First, in the catalytic cycle, the binary DNA-enzyme complex forms first, followed by AdoMet binding as shown by isotope partitioning (37Lindstrom W.M. Flynn J. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4912-4919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Second, base flipping and 3H exchange between the cytosine C5 hydrogen and solvent are faster in the absence of cofactor"
https://openalex.org/W2043476713,"During short-patch base excision repair, the excision of a 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety of the downstream strand by the 5′-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity of either DNA polymerase β or λ is believed to occur after each respective enzyme catalyzes gap-filling DNA synthesis. Yet the effects of this 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety on the polymerase activities of these two enzymes have never been quantitatively determined. Moreover, x-ray crystal structures of truncated polymerase λ have revealed that the downstream strand and its 5′-phosphate group of gapped DNA interact intensely with the dRPase domain, but the kinetic effect of these interactions is unclear. Here, we utilized pre-steady state kinetic methods to systematically investigate the effect of a downstream strand and its 5′-moieties on the polymerase activity of the full-length human polymerase λ. The downstream strand and its 5′-phosphate were both found to increase nucleotide incorporation efficiency (kp/Kd) by 15and 11-fold, respectively, with the increase procured by the effect on the nucleotide incorporation rate constant kp rather than the ground state nucleotide binding affinity Kd. With 4 single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrates containing a 1,2-dideoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety, a 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate mimic, we measured the incorporation efficiencies of 16 possible nucleotides. Our results demonstrate that although this 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate mimic does not affect the fidelity of polymerase λ, it moderately decreased the polymerase efficiency by 3.4-fold. Moreover, this decrease in polymerase efficiency is due to a drop of similar magnitude in kp rather than Kd. The implication of the downstream strand and its 5′-moieties on the kinetics of gap-filling synthesis is discussed. During short-patch base excision repair, the excision of a 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety of the downstream strand by the 5′-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity of either DNA polymerase β or λ is believed to occur after each respective enzyme catalyzes gap-filling DNA synthesis. Yet the effects of this 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety on the polymerase activities of these two enzymes have never been quantitatively determined. Moreover, x-ray crystal structures of truncated polymerase λ have revealed that the downstream strand and its 5′-phosphate group of gapped DNA interact intensely with the dRPase domain, but the kinetic effect of these interactions is unclear. Here, we utilized pre-steady state kinetic methods to systematically investigate the effect of a downstream strand and its 5′-moieties on the polymerase activity of the full-length human polymerase λ. The downstream strand and its 5′-phosphate were both found to increase nucleotide incorporation efficiency (kp/Kd) by 15and 11-fold, respectively, with the increase procured by the effect on the nucleotide incorporation rate constant kp rather than the ground state nucleotide binding affinity Kd. With 4 single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrates containing a 1,2-dideoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety, a 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate mimic, we measured the incorporation efficiencies of 16 possible nucleotides. Our results demonstrate that although this 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate mimic does not affect the fidelity of polymerase λ, it moderately decreased the polymerase efficiency by 3.4-fold. Moreover, this decrease in polymerase efficiency is due to a drop of similar magnitude in kp rather than Kd. The implication of the downstream strand and its 5′-moieties on the kinetics of gap-filling synthesis is discussed. In mammalian cells, single base lesions are the most common form of DNA damage that arises either from exogenous DNA-damaging agents (1Lawley P.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Short-patch BER starts with the excision of a modified base by a DNA glycosylase, leaving a noncoding apurinic or apyrimidinic site in DNA. This lesion is further processed and repaired by a 5′-acting apurinic or apyrimidinic endonuclease, a DNA polymerase, a 5′-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (dRPase), and a DNA ligase (12Klungland A.

It has been established that in mammalian systems DNA polymerase β (Fig. 1, Polβ), an X-family DNA polymerase, plays a critical role in short-patch BER (8Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H.

Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), while its dRPase activity removes the 5′-terminal 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety (dRP) of a downstream strand (18Matsumoto Y.

In addition, fPolλ possesses a nuclear localization signal motif, a breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain, and a prolinerich domain. Although the biological role of fPolλ has not been clearly identified, it is plausible that fPolλ contributes to BER because it shares 33% sequence identity to Polβ and possesses two key enzymatic activities required by BER. This hypothesis is directly supported by the following observations: (i) recombinant human fPolλ purified from Escherichia coli can replace human Polβ in an in vitro reconstituted short-patch BER assay (26Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); (ii) mouse embryonic fibroblast Polβ–/– cell extract contains a substantial amount of active fPolλ that can also replace Polβ in a similar in vitro reconstituted BER assay, and monoclonal antibodies against fPolλ in this cell extract strongly reduce in vitro BER (27Braithwaite E.K. Prasad R. Shock D.D. Hou E.W. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). fPolλ, like Polβ, lacks 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (22Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Dahan A. Faili A.

With short gap DNA, the downstream strand, especially one with a 5′-phosphate, has been shown to increase polymerase processivity of both Polβ (28Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, Polβ has been found to incorporate a single nucleotide ∼10-fold more efficiently with single nucleotide-gapped DNA than non-gapped DNA (30Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Ahn J. Kraynov V.S. Zhong X. Werneburg B.G. Tsai M.D. Biochem.

J. 1998; 331: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Structural evidence suggests that the increase in polymerase processivity and efficiency is due to additional contacts that are established in a gapped DNA substrate between the dRPase domains of these two enzymes and the downstream strand (29Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The terminal 5′-phosphate on the downstream strand is buried in a positively charged pocket of the dRPase active site (29Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Krahn J.M. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Pedersen L.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H.

Biol. 2005; 12: 97-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). So far, the effects of a downstream strand and its 5′-phosphate on the efficiency and fidelity of gap-filling synthesis catalyzed by fPolλ has not been quantitatively determined. Here, these effects associated with human fPolλ will be investigated through presteady state kinetic studies. Moreover, steady state kinetic studies have identified the rate-limiting step in the reconstituted and uracil-initiated BER system (Scheme 1) as the removal of the dRP moiety by Polβ (21Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). fPolλ is estimated to possess a 4-fold slower dRPase activity than Polβ (26Garcia-Diaz M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), while these two enzymes catalyze single nucleotide gap-filling DNA synthesis with <2-fold difference in catalytic efficiency (34Fiala K.A. Duym W.W. Zhang J. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19038-19044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These kinetic data strongly indicate that the 5′-dRP moiety in the downstream strand is removed after Polβ or fPolλ fills single nucleotide-gapped DNA in Scheme 1. However, the effect of the 5′-dRP moiety on the fidelity and efficiency of either Polβ or fPolλ has never been kinetically evaluated. In this report, we will use single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrates containing a dRP mimic on the 5′-terminus of the downstream strand to determine the kinetic effect of the 5′-dRP moiety on gap-filling DNA synthesis catalyzed by human fPolλ through detailed pre-steady state kinetic analysis. Materials—These chemicals were purchased from the following companies: [γ-32P]ATP, GE Healthcare; Biospin columns, Bio-Rad Laboratories; dNTPs, Invitrogen; T4 polynucleotide kinase, USB (Cleveland, OH). The full-length human Polλ was cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (34Fiala K.A. Duym W.W. Zhang J. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19038-19044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Synthetic Oligonucleotides—The DNA substrates shown in Fig. 2 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18% acrylamide, 8 m urea). Their concentrations were determined by measuring UV absorbance at 260 nm with calculated molar extinction coefficients. The primer strand 21-mer was 5′-32P-labeled by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 37 °C. The unreacted [γ-32P]ATP was subsequently removed by centrifugation through a Biospin-6 column (Bio-Rad). The 5′-32P-labeled primer 21-mer was then annealed with the corresponding non-radio-labeled downstream strand 19-mer to the template 41-mer at a molar ratio of 1.0:1.25:1.15, respectively, to form a 21–19/41-mer single nucleotide-gapped substrate (the top strand was composed of two oligonucleotides with a single nucleotide gap). Mixtures to be annealed were denatured at 95 °C for 8 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature over several hours. Optimized Reaction Buffer L—All kinetic experiments were performed in buffer L containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.4 at 37 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C. Measurement of Equilibrium Dissociation Constant of Next Incoming Nucleotide—A preincubated solution of 150 nm human fPolλ and 30 nm 32P-labeled DNA was rapidly mixed with increasing concentrations of dNTP (0.25–120 μm) in buffer L in a rapid chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek) to initiate the reaction. The reactions at each concentration of dNTP were terminated with 0.37 m EDTA at varying times from milliseconds to minutes. Reaction products were analyzed by sequencing gel electrophoresis (17% acrylamide, 8 m urea, 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer) and quantitated with a PhosphorImager 445 SI (GE Healthcare). The time course of product formation was fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 1) for each concentration of dNTP to give the observed rate constant of nucleotide incorporation (kobs). “A” represents the reaction amplitude, which is equal to the initial concentration of the enzyme and DNA binary complex. The observed rate constants extracted from these time courses of product formation were then plotted against the concentrations of dNTP, and these data were fit via hyperbolic regression (Equation 2) to give the equilibrium dissociation constant of dNTP, Kd, and the maximum rate constant for incorporation of dNTP, kp. The substrate specificity and polymerase fidelity were calculated as (kp/Kd) and (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kp/Kd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect], respectively, as shown in Equations 1 and 2.Product]=A[1−exp(−kobst)](Eq. 1) kobs=kp[dNTP]/{[dNTP]+Kd}(Eq. 2) Model DNA Substrates—Based on the steady state kinetic results (21Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), the natural DNA substrate for the polymerase activity of fPolλ in BER is a dRP-DNA-type substrate (Fig. 2A) that exists as a mixture of different chemical species in solution (see “Discussion”) (35Wang K.Y. Parker S.A. Goljer I. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To simplify kinetic analysis, we prepared four H-DNA substrates, shown in Fig. 2B, whose downstream strands contained a 5′-terminal 1,2-dideoxyribose-5-phosphate moiety that mimicked 5′-dRP. The H-DNA substrates are stable and exist in one chemical form in solution due to the lack of C1-hydroxyl group in their dRP-mimic moiety. To examine the kinetic effect of the downstream strand and its 5′-phosphate, we designed another gapped substrate, D-1OH (Fig. 2D). This substrate contained a downstream 19-mer that was not 5′-phosphorylated as in D-DNA (D-1) (Fig. 2C) and non-gapped D-1N (Fig. 2E), which lacked a downstream strand. Kinetic Effect of a dRP Mimic—Previously, we have established a minimal kinetic mechanism (Scheme 2) for dTTP incorporation onto D-DNA (D-1) (Fig. 2C) catalyzed by the C-terminal Polβ-like domain of human Polλ (Fig. 1, tPolλ) (36Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This scheme shows that an incoming dNTP binds to the tPolλ·D-1 binary complex to establish a rapid equilibrium prior to nucleotide incorporation. We have also demonstrated that human fPolλ follows the same minimal mechanism shown in Scheme 2 (34Fiala K.A. Duym W.W. Zhang J. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19038-19044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This mechanism allows us to measure the apparent affinity of dNTP (Kd) for the Polλ·DNA binary complex via the dNTP concentration dependence of the observed single turnover rate constant (kobs). The polymerase efficiency and fidelity of both tPolλ (36Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and the fPolλ (34Fiala K.A. Duym W.W. Zhang J. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19038-19044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have thus been determined. Here, we utilized similar pre-steady state kinetic methods to determine the kinetics of all 16 possible single nucleotide incorporations onto the 4 DNA substrates shown in Fig. 2B. Under single turnover conditions, a preincubated solution of 30 nm 5′-32P-labeled H-7 (Fig. 2B) and 150 nm human fPolλ was reacted with increasing concentration of an incoming dATP in buffer L (see “Experimental Procedures”). The single turnover method was employed because DNA dissociates from fPolλ with a dissociation rate constant (k1) that is only ∼2- to 3-fold slower than the maximum nucleotide incorporation rate constant kp (36Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6751-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), rendering the burst phase insignificant. Thus, the experiments were performed with fPolλ in molar excess over DNA to allow the direct observation of nucleotide incorporation in a single pass of the reactants through the enzymatic pathway without complications resulting from the steady state formation of products (37Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The DNA product 22-mer and remaining primer 21-mer were separated by gel electrophoresis and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. The product concentration was plotted against reaction time intervals. These data were subsequently fit to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield an observed single turnover rate constant (kobs) at each concentration of dATP (Fig. 3A). The observed single turnover rate constants were then plotted against dATP concentration (Fig. 3B). These data were subsequently fit to Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield a kp of 0.40 ± 0.01 s–1 for the maximum dATP incorporation rate constant and a Kd of 0.78 ± 0.08 μm for dATP binding. The substrate specificity or polymerase efficiency (kp/Kd) of dATP incorporation onto H-7 was calculated to be 0.485 μm–1 s–1 (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of nucleotide incorporation onto single nucleotide-gapped H-DNA containing a dRP mimic catalyzed by human fPolλ at 37°CdNTPKdkp(kp/Kd)H-DNAFidelityaCalculated as (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kpKd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect].(kp/Kd)D-DNAbThe (kp/Kd)D-DNA values are from Table I of Ref. 34.Efficiency ratiocCalculated as (kp/Kd)D-DNA/(kpKd)H-DNA.μms-1μm-1 s-1μm-1 s-1Template A (H-1)dTTP1.7 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.30.3011.55.1dATP4 ± 11.97 × 10-5 ± 1 × 10-64.9 × 10-61.7 × 10-51.8 × 10-53.7dCTP10 ± 52.7 × 10-3 ± 5 × 10-42.6 × 10-48.7 × 10-45.0 × 10-42.0dGTP6.4 ± 0.62.5 × 10-4 ± 1 × 10-53.9 × 10-51.3 × 10-41.3 × 10-43.4Template G (H-6)dCTP1.6 ± 0.31.10 ± 0.040.6911.82.6dATP1.6 ± 0.61.04 × 10-5 ± 9 × 10-76.6 × 10-69.5 × 10-63.3 × 10-55.0dTTP10 ± 31.4 × 10-3 ± 2 × 10-41.3 × 10-41.9 × 10-42.8 × 10-42.1dGTP4.2 ± 0.74.7 × 10-5 ± 3 × 10-61.1 × 10-51.6 × 10-55.0 × 10-54.5Template T (H-7)dATP0.78 ± 0.080.40 ± 0.010.4911.63.3dTTP11 ± 27.1 × 10-5 ± 6 × 10-66.4 × 10-61.3 × 10-52.4 × 10-53.7dCTP11 ± 24.8 × 10-3 ± 4 × 10-44.5 × 10-49.3 × 10-47.0 × 10-41.6dGTP8 ± 52.2 × 10-3 ± 5 × 10-42.7 × 10-45.6 × 10-41.4 × 10-35.1Template C (H-8)dGTP1.5 ± 0.30.76 ± 0.020.5111.22.3dATP1.5 ± 0.33.8 × 10-5 ± 2 × 10-62.5 × 10-54.9 × 10-51.7 × 10-46.7dCTP3 ± 16.2 × 10-4 ± 6 × 10-51.9 × 10-43.7 × 10-43.8 × 10-42.0dTTP9 ± 56 × 10-4 ± 2 × 10-47.3 × 10-51.4 × 10-41.4 × 10-41.9a Calculated as (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kpKd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect].b The (kp/Kd)D-DNA values are from Table I of Ref. 34Fiala K.A.

Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters (Table 1) for the incorporation of each of the remaining three correct nucleotides (dTTP onto H-1, dCTP onto H-6, and dGTP onto H-8) and for the incorporation of each of the 12 possible misincorporations onto H-1, H-6, H-7, and H-8 (Fig. 2B) were carried out in the same manner as described above. Notably, the ground state binding affinity of all nucleotides to fPolλ·(H-DNA) (Table 1) were within 10-fold, but the kp values of correct nucleotides were three to five orders of magnitude higher than those of incorrect nucleotides. The differences in kp and Kd led to significantly different nucleotide incorporation efficiencies (kp/Kd) between correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporations and resulted in a fidelity of gap-filling synthesis in the range of 10–4 to 10–5 (Table 1). Kinetic Effect of the 5′-Phosphate of a Downstream Strand—The kinetic parameters of nucleotide incorporation onto D-1OH (Fig. 2D) were measured with fPolλ under the single turnover conditions described above and listed in Table 2. The apparent binding affinity of all four nucleotides was unaffected by the absence of the 5′-phosphate of the 19-mer in D-1OH, but the kp values were lowered by 10- to 100-fold (Table 2). Thus, the substrate specificity (kp/Kd) of matched and mismatched nucleotides with D-1OH was 10- and 100-fold smaller, respectively, than those with D-DNA (D-1) (Table 2). Notably, dATP incorporation onto D-1OH was too slow to be measured. A slightly larger effect on misincorporations compared with correct dTTP incorporation resulted in a slightly higher fidelity with D-1OH than with D-DNA (D-1).TABLE 2Pre-steady state kinetic parameters with D-DNA (D-1), D-1OH, and D-1NdNTPKdkpkp/KdFidelityaCalculated as (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kp Kd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect].μms-1μm-1 s-1D-DNA (D-1) substratebData are from Table I of Ref. 34.dTTP2.6 ± 0.43.9 ± 0.21.51dCTP14.8 ± 5.00.022 ± 0.0031.5 × 10-39.8 × 10-4dGTP8.2 ± 0.60.006 ± 0.0037.6 × 10-45.8 × 10-4dATP4.1 ± 0.50.0029 ± 0.00017.1 × 10-45.4 × 10-4D-1OH substratedTTP4.1 ± 0.80.56 ± 0.030.141dCTP5.5 ± 1.1(1.6 ± 0.1) × 10-42.9 × 10-52.1 × 10-4dGTP8.5 ± 2.7(1.3 ± 0.1) × 10-51.5 × 10-61.1 × 10-5dATPNo observed incorporationD-1N substratedTTP2.6 ± 0.70.025 ± 0.0029.4 × 10-31dCTP6.6 ± 2.0(8.3 ± 0.6) × 10-61.3 × 10-61.4 × 10-4dGTPNo observed incorporationdATPNo observed incorporationa Calculated as (kp/Kd)incorrect/[(kp Kd)correct + (kp/Kd)incorrect].b Data are from Table I of Ref. 34Fiala K.A.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic Effect of a Downstream Strand—The significant kinetic effect of the 5′-phosphate moiety suggested the downstream strand itself could have a dramatic influence on the single nucleotide gap-filling efficiency of fPolλ. To examine this hypothesis, we measured the pre-steady state kinetic parameters (Table 2) of single nucleotide incorporation onto D-1N that lacked a downstream strand (Fig. 1E) by employing single turnover experiments as described above. The correct dTTP was incorporated at a rate constant of 0.025 s–1 and a ground state binding affinity of 2.6 μm (Table 2). In comparison with the kinetic data with D-1OH (Table 2), the lack of a downstream strand further decreased the incorporation efficiency of matched dTTP and mismatched dCTP by approximately an additional 10-fold each. Incorporations of mismatched dGTP and dATP onto D-1N were too slow to be observed in several hours.

GzmB cleaves multiple intracellular protein substrates, leading to caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, cytoskeletal instability, and rapid induction of target cell apoptosis. However, no known individual substrate is required for GzmB to induce apoptosis. GzmB is therefore thought to initiate multiple cell death pathways simultaneously to ensure the death of target cells. We previously identified Hop (Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein) as a GzmB substrate in a proteomic survey (Bredemeyer, A. J., Lewis, R. M., Malone, J. P., Davis, A. E., Gross, J., Townsend, R. R., and Ley, T. J. (2004) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 101, 11785-11790). Hop is a co-chaperone for Hsp70 and Hsp90, which have been implicated in the negative regulation of apoptosis. We therefore hypothesized that Hop may have an anti-apoptotic function that is abolished upon cleavage, lowering the threshold for GzmB-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that Hop was cleaved directly by GzmB in vitro and in cells undergoing GzmB-induced apoptosis. Expression of the two cleavage fragments of Hop did not induce cell death. Although cleavage of Hop by GzmB destroyed Hop function in vitro, both cells overexpressing GzmB-resistant Hop and cells with a 90-95% reduction in Hop levels exhibited unaltered susceptibility to GzmB-induced death. We conclude that Hop per se does not set the threshold for susceptibility to GzmB-induced apoptosis. Although it is possible that Hop may be cleaved by GzmB as an “innocent bystander” during the induction of apoptosis, it may also act to facilitate apoptosis in concert with other GzmB substrates.

The importance of directly targeting this second class of substrates is unclear, but presumably, such events contribute to the nuclear collapse, cytoskeletal breakdown, and membrane blebbing characteristic of classical apoptosis. From recent proteomic screens, a third class of substrate has emerged. We identified the Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein Hop as a substrate of GzmB (1Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E.

Indeed, heat shock proteins have been widely implicated in the regulation of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 28Beere H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Heat shock/stress response proteins may therefore represent a new class of granzyme substrate. Hop is a 543-amino acid ∼60-kDa co-chaperone that mediates the association of the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 (29Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. Mc-Cormick D.J.

The function of Hop has been best characterized in in vitro systems examining the assembly of the progesterone receptor (33Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol.

In this model, Hop serves as an adaptor protein, tethering Hsp70 and Hsp90 and bringing Hsp90 into proximity with the hormone receptor (30Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This scaffolding function of Hop is required in vitro for the efficient assembly of mature hormone receptor capable of binding hormone (34Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D.

Scott M.D. Frydman J. Cell. 2005; 121: 739-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because Hop is implicated in the binding and organization of Hsp proteins and because multiple Hsp-mediated anti-apoptotic mechanisms have been described (28Beere H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2641-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Hop orchestrates one or more anti-apoptotic mechanisms and that cleavage of Hop by GzmB destroys this anti-apoptotic function, lowering the threshold for death induction. Here, we further characterize the cleavage of Hop by GzmB and investigate the role of Hop and its cleavage in cell death. We demonstrate that the cleavage products of Hop do not exhibit gain-of-function pro-apoptotic properties. We found that, although cleavage of Hop destroyed its in vitro binding and assembly functions, neither cells expressing ∼5-10% of normal Hop levels nor cells overexpressing GzmB-resistant Hop exhibited altered levels of GzmB-mediated death. Therefore, Hop does not set the threshold for death induced by GzmB, although its cleavage may contribute to the death pathway in coordination with other substrates. Cell Lines, Equipment, and Software—YAC-1 cells (mouse lymphoma) were maintained in K5 medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm each nonessential amino acid, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.57 μm β-mercaptoethanol) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. All flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using CXP software (Beckman Coulter) or FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Cell sorting was performed on a MoFlo high-speed cell sorter (Dako). All graphs were created using GraphPad Prism 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California), and error bars denote S.D. In Vitro Cleavage Assays—Recombinant murine GzmB (rGzmB) was produced as described (43Pham C.T. Thomas D.A. Mercer J.D. Ley T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1629-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant human GzmB was a kind gift of Margarita Garcia-Calvo (Merck). YAC-1 freeze/thaw lysates were prepared as described (1Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E. Gross J. Townsend R.R. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11785-11790Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); diluted 1:5 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 8.0); and treated with the indicated concentrations of rGzmB for 1 h or the times indicated at 37 °C. In some experiments, as indicated, YAC-1 cells were pretreated with the caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (fmk; Sigma) and Z-VAD-fmk (Sigma) at 100 μm each or with vehicle (Me2SO; Sigma) for 15-30 min prior to freeze/thaw lysis and then diluted 1:5 as described above. In some experiments, transfected populations were isolated by high-speed cell sorting, and more dilute freeze/thaw lysates were prepared in the presence of caspase inhibitors. In vitro transcribed/translated substrates were made from murine wild-type (WT) or D186E Hop cDNA using the TnT quick-coupled system (Promega Corp.) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The translated product was treated with 0 or 1 μm rGzmB at 37 °C for the times indicated. Samples were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and radiolabeled products were detected by autoradiography. Recombinant human Hop (rHop) was produced as described (44Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or purchased from Stressgen Bioreagents. 1 μg of rHop was treated with the indicated doses of rGzmB for 0 or 60 min, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and silver-stained using the ProteoSilver kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare), and blotted with the following antibodies: mouse anti-C-terminal Hop (F5) produced as described (29Smith D.F.

Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 1:1000 dilution. Secondary antibodies were used at 1:10,000 dilution. Blots were developed using ECL or ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The codon encoding Asp186 in the murine Hop cDNA was mutated to glutamic acid using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primer 5′-CCTCCTTGGGGTTGAACTGGGCAGCATGGAT-3′ and its reverse complement (synthesized by Sigma). Cell Death Reconstitution Assay—In some experiments, YAC-1 cells were pretreated with Z-DEVD-fmk and Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm each) or Me2SO for 30 min as indicated. Cells were then treated with rGzmB and purified perforin for 60 min at 37 °C as described (19Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed by Western blotting for substrate cleavage or by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; Calbiochem) staining, followed by flow cytometric analysis to assess cell death. For death assays with cells transiently cotransfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Hop forms, the viability index for GFP- and high GFP (GFPhi) populations in each was calculated as described under “Results.” For small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cells, the assay was performed at 52-54 h post-transfection. Efficacy of siRNA-mediated knockdown was verified by Western blotting for all experiments. Transient Plasmid DNA Transfections—Enhanced GFP (EGFP)-C1 and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-C1 were purchased from Clontech, and pcDNA3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen. For transient cotransfection of GFP and Hop forms, 2 μg of EGFP-C1 and 8 μg of pcDNA3.1 (empty vector) or vector containing WT or D186E Hop cDNA or 4 μg each of vector containing Hop-(1-186) cDNA (N-terminal fragment) and vector containing Hop-(Met-187-543) cDNA (C-terminal fragment) were transfected into 2 × 106 YAC-1 cells using a Nucleofector (Amaxa) with cell line solution L and program C-009 following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated in 1.5 ml of K10 medium (same as K5 medium but with 10% fetal bovine serum) and used in cell death assays or sorted based on GFP expression at 16-20 h post-transfection and used for in vitro cleavage assays and/or Western blotting. Clonogenic Assays—EGFP-C1 alone or expression vector containing GFP-WT Hop cDNA, GFP-D186E Hop cDNA, GFP-Hop-(1-186) cDNA, Hop-(1-186)-GFP cDNA, GFP-Hop-(187-543) cDNA, Hop-(Met-187-543)-GFP cDNA, or tBid-GFP cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. Honglin Li, Northwestern University) was transiently transfected into YAC-1 cells. In some experiments, 50 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA was transfected using a BTX electroporator at 300 V, 150 microfarads, and 360 ohms, whereas in other experiments, 8 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA was transfected using the Nucleofector as described above. For cotransfection experiments, 2 μg of EGFP-C1 was cotransfected with 8 μg of empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or vector containing WT Hop cDNA, D186E Hop cDNA, Hop-(1-186) cDNA, or Hop-(Met-187-543) cDNA or 4 μg each of Hop-(1-186) cDNA and Hop-(Met-187-543) cDNA using the Nucleofector as described above. For all assays, cells were plated in medium following transfection and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. GFPhi cells (∼1% of all cells) were then sorted into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Wells positive for growth were counted 12 days later. Clonogenic potential was normalized to the GFP alone condition (for GFP fusion transfections) or GFP plus empty vector condition (for cotransfections). In Vitro Protein Binding Assays—Radiolabeled WT Hop, D186E Hop, Hop-(1-186) (N-terminal fragment), or Hop-(Met-187-543) (C-terminal fragment) was transcribed/translated in vitro as described above. Hsp70 and Hsp90 immunoprecipitation was performed as described (30Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of antibody (clone BB70 for Hsp70 immunoprecipitation (29Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. Mc-Cormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell.

Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was preadsorbed to 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose resin (Sigma). Molar equivalents of radiolabeled Hop forms were added separately to 100 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (1:1 lysate; Green Hectares, Oregon, WI), combined with the immunoresin, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Resin-bound complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, and 0.5% Tween 20), resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were Coomassie Blue-stained to visualize bound proteins, and bound Hop forms were detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. Progesterone receptor complexes were assembled in vitro as described (30Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant chicken progesterone receptor was immunopurified with antibody PR22 (46Sullivan W.P. Vroman B.T. Bauer V.J. Puri R.K. Riehl R.M. Pearson G.R. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4214-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) pre-adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose, and 10 μl of this resin (containing 1 μg of progesterone receptor) was combined with 200 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing an ATP-regenerating system (47Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one of four radiolabeled Hop forms (as described above), and 20 μg/ml geldanamycin (Hsp90 inhibitor) to enrich for intermediate progesterone receptor complexes containing Hop. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and then washed and analyzed as described for Hsp70/Hsp90 immunoprecipitation. siRNA Transfections—For RNA interference experiments, Dharmacon siGENOME ON-TARGET duplexes D-048388-02 (Hop siRNA-1, 5′-CCAAGGAACUGGACCCUACUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUAGGGUCCAGUUCCUUGGUU-3′ (antisense)) and D-048388-04 (Hop siRNA-2, 5′-GAUGAUGCCUUACAGUGCUUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCACUGUAAGGCAUCAUCUU-3′ (antisense)), a pool of four duplexes targeting hemoglobin β2-subunit (β-minor chain), HBB-B2 (L-062946-00, Dharmacon, proprietary sequences), and nontargeting control siRNA-1 (Dharmacon) were used. 100 pmol of siRNA duplex was transfected into 2 × 106 YAC-1 cells using the Nucleofector as described for plasmid transfections and then plated in 2 ml of K10 medium. Cells were expanded 24-30 h later and used in experiments or harvested for Western blotting between 48 and 60 h post-transfection. Etoposide Treatment and γ-Irradiation—For treatment with etoposide (Sigma), siRNA transfectants were plated at 48 h post-transfection at ∼5 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well plates in duplicate at the indicated drug concentrations. After 36 h, cell death was assessed by 7-AAD staining and flow cytometry. For γ-irradiation, duplicate transfectants were plated at 48 h post-siRNA transfection, each in duplicate, at ∼3 × 105 cells/ml in 12-well plates and then subjected to the indicated dose of radiation. 7-AAD staining and flow cytometric analysis were performed 48 h later. Data were fit using mixed models, with replicates and separate experiments treated as random effects and doses of radiation treated as fixed effects. Least squares mean differences were compared using Tukey's multiple comparison adjustment. Efficacy of siRNA-mediated knockdown was verified by Western blotting at the time of drug treatment or irradiation for all experiments. Natural Killer Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity Assay—48 h after siRNA transfection, YAC-1 target cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and labeled with 125 mm 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular Probes) at ∼5 × 105 cells/ml for 15 min at 37 °C. The labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of K10 medium, and cells were washed once with K10 medium. For preparation of natural killer (NK) effector cells, the following strain-matched 129/SvJ mice were used: WT, GzmA-/- (48Shresta S. Graubert T.A. Thomas D.A. Raptis S.Z. Ley T.J.

We measured these parameters for the duck hepatitis B virus polymerase employing active enzyme translated in vitro and derived from intracellular core particles and mature virions. In vitro-translated polymerase immunoprecipitated as a monomer, and polymerase molecules with complementary defects in the enzymatic active site and tyrosine 96, which primes DNA synthesis, could not complement or inhibit each other in priming assays. Western analysis using antibodies recognizing epitopes throughout the polymerase combined with nuclease digestion of permeabilized virion-derived capsid particles revealed that only full-length polymerase molecules were in virions and that they were all covalently attached to large DNA molecules. Because DNA synthesis is primed by the polymerase itself and only one copy of the viral DNA is in each capsid, the polymerase must function as an uncleaved monomer. Therefore, a single polymerase monomer is encapsidated, primes DNA synthesis, synthesizes both DNA strands, and participates in the three-strand transfers of DNA synthesis, with all steps after DNA priming performed while the polymerase is covalently coupled to the product DNA. Because the N-terminal domain of the polymerase is displaced from the active site on the same molecule by the viral DNA during reverse transcription, P must be structurally dynamic during DNA synthesis. Therefore, non-nucleoside compounds that interfere with this change may be novel antiviral agents.

Hepadnaviruses are small DNA-containing viruses that replicate by reverse transcription and infect primates, rodents, and birds (reviewed in Ref. 1Ganem D. Schneider R.J. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2923-2969Google Scholar). Significant differences exist in the biology of these viruses, but they all share a very similar genetic organization, hepatic tropism, and nearly identical replication mechanisms.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 2923-2969Google Scholar) begins with the binding of P to an RNA stem-loop (ϵ) on the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), and this ribonucleoprotein complex is then encapsidated (4Bartenschlager R. Junker-Niepmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hirsch R.C. Lavine J.E. Chang L.J. Varmus H.E. Ganem D. Nature. 1990; 344: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription occurs within cytoplasmic capsid particles and is catalyzed by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase (abbreviated as “P” for “polymerase”). DNA synthesis is primed by a tyrosine in the N-terminal domain of P employing ϵ as a template, and thus, the viral DNA is covalently linked to P (6Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A. Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zoulim F. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lanford R.E. Notvall L. Lee H.

This process employs three-strand transfer reactions that presumably are promoted by P, possibly with contributions from the viral capsid structure.P is synthesized by de novo translational initiation (9Schlicht H.J.

Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 613-620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The terminal protein domain contains a tyrosine residue that primes DNA synthesis and covalently links P to the viral DNA (Tyr-96 in DHBV (6Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A.

The spacer domain has no known function and can tolerate significant insertions and deletions. The reverse transcriptase domain contains the DNA polymerase activity. Mutation of an essential YMDD motif in the reverse transcriptase domain leads to nucleoside analog resistance or ablation of DNA synthesis activity (2Hollinger F.B. Liang T.J. Knipe D.M. Howley P.

The RNaseH domain contains the RNaseH activity, which degrades the viral RNA following its conversion to DNA.Despite the importance of P as a target for three approved nucleoside analog drugs, the size of P in viral particles has been hard to discern. Various activity gel, Western, and immunoprecipitation analyses have revealed P sizes of 155, 109, 98, 85, 80, 78, 70, 68, and 63 kDa associated with DHBV cores (17Oberhaus S.M. Newbold J.E. J.

Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but the antibodies recognized epitopes only in the terminal protein domain and would not have detected P fragments lacking these sequences.P is widely assumed to function as a monomer based on indirect evidence. The strongest circumstantial argument comes from the cis-preference for encapsidation of P as a ribonucleoprotein complex with the pgRNA (4Bartenschlager R. Junker-Niepmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hirsch R.C. Lavine J.E. Chang L.J. Varmus H.E. Ganem D. Nature. 1990; 344: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (the pgRNA is also the mRNA for P). Although the simplest mechanism would be an interaction between monomeric P and the pgRNA, the complex could contain one, two, or more copies of P bound to the pgRNA. Bartenschlager and Schaller (21Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) performed the most direct measurement of the multimeric state of P and concluded that P probably acts as a monomer, but as discussed below, their experiment could not measure this parameter because it did not account for the effects of the covalent linkage of DNA on the detection of P. Retroviral reverse transcriptases can be monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers (reviewed in Refs. 27Goff S.P. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1871-1940Google Scholar and 28Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and thus, it is mechanistically possible for P to function as a monomer, dimer, or higher-order multimer.Therefore, it is still unclear whether P functions as a full-length molecule and whether it works as a monomer or a multimer, despite the fundamental implications that these physical properties of P have on the mechanism of reverse transcription. We wish to understand hepadnaviral reverse transcription to promote development of novel antiviral drugs, and thus, we used a combination of immunologic and mutagenesis assays to determine whether active P is proteolytically processed and whether it functions as a monomer or a multimer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESViruses and DNA Clones—LMH cells are a chicken hepatoma line that produces DHBV upon transfection with DHBV genomic expression constructs (29Condreay L.D.

LMH cells were stably transfected with a DHBV16 dimer to create LMH-D2 cells that constitutively secrete DHBV16 virions (30Moraleda G. Wu T.T. Jilbert A.R. Aldrich C.E. Condreay L.D. Larsen S.H. Tang J.C. Colacino J.M. Mason W.S. Antiviral Res. 1993; 20: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). pT7DPol contains DHBV3 (31Sprengel R. Kuhn C. Will H. Schaller H. J. Med. Virol. 1985; 15: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) nucleotides (nt) 170-3021 encoding P in pBluescript (Promega) with a 33-nt insertion at nt 792 encoding the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (HA tag) (32Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) in the spacer domain. The Brome Mosaic virus internal ribosomal entry site was introduced upstream of the P open reading frame in pT7DPol to produce pT7BDPol to increase the fidelity of initiation at the first AUG of the P open reading frame. pT7BDPol-3′-HA is pT7BDPol with an insertion of the HA tag at the 3′ end of the P gene instead of at nt 792. pT7DPol(Y96F) contains a point mutation in the P gene altering Tyr-96 to Phe to prevent covalent attachment of DNA to P. pT7DPol(YMHA) contains D513H and D514A active site missense mutations that ablate DNA synthesis (14Chang L.J. Hirsch R.C. Ganem D. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5553-5558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). D1.5G contains 1.5 copies of DHBV3 (duplication of nt 1658–3021) in pBluescript (Stratagene) and produces wild-type DHBV following transfection into cells. D1.5G-3′-HA contains the HA tag in the 3′ end of the P gene. D1.5G-SH has the insertion of the HA tag at nt 792 encoding the spacer domain. Fig. 1 shows the structure of all P derivatives employed in this study.PCR—Template for T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription of 3′-HA-tagged P (P(3′-HA); 806 amino acids long) was generated by amplification of pT7BDPol-3′-HA with primers T7 (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) and HA-R1 (5′-CCA TCG ATT TAA GCG TAG TCT GGG ACG TCG TAT GGG TAA GTT CCA CAT AGC CTA TGT G-3′). Template for P truncated at amino acid 738 (P-(1–738)) was generated by cleaving the P(3′-HA) amplicon with NcoI.In Vitro Transcription and Translation—All mRNAs for P were transcribed from plasmids and PCR amplicons employing Megascript kits (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNAs for P with HA (P(3′-HA)) or without HA truncated at amino acid 738 (P-(1–738)) were transcribed from PCR amplicons. 35S-labeled P was translated in vitro employing rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in a 10-μl volume containing 0.6 μl of [35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 1 h according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunoprecipitation—Monoclonal antibody 11 (mAb 11) specific for an epitope between amino acids 46–77 of P (26Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 3F10 specific for the HA tag (Roche Applied Science) were bound to protein A/G beads (Calbiochem), the antibody-bead complexes were incubated overnight with in vitro-translated P diluted into 0.2 ml of IPP150 (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), the immunocomplexes were washed four times with 1 ml of IPP150, and P was released by boiling in 25 μlof1× Laemmli buffer. Following SDS-PAGE, radioactive P was detected by phosphorimaging analysis.DNA Priming—P was translated in vitro in the absence (see Fig. 2) or presence (see Fig. 3) of ϵ. Half of the reaction was used to monitor translation, and half was used for the priming assay. If ϵ was absent during translation, 1 μgof ϵ RNA was added to the priming samples. MgCl2 (to 2.4 mm) and 5 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) were added to the translation reactions, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated with Laemmli buffer, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The 32P priming signal was detected by phosphorimaging analysis (the 35S signal from translation was blocked by a layer of exposed x-ray film).FIGURE 2Enzymatically active P translated in vitro does not form stable multimers. A, C-terminally HA-tagged or truncated DHBV P derivatives are active in DNA priming. 35S-labeled P-3′-HA and P lacking a HA tag but truncated at amino acid 738 (P-(1–738)) were translated in vitro without ϵ (lanes 1–3) and were employed in a priming reaction (lanes 4–6) after the addition of ϵ. B, P(3′-HA) and P-(1–738) do not co-immunoprecipitate. In vitro-translated P derivatives were diluted into IPP150, and equal aliquots of the translation mixture were immunoprecipitated with saturating amounts of mAb 11 (recognizes the terminal protein domain of P), mAb 3F10 (recognizes the HA tag), or anti-β-galactosidase (Anti-β-gal) (irrelevant antibody). The mobilities of the 806-amino acid P(3′-HA) and 738-amino acid P-(1–738) molecules are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3The enzymatically inactive P(Y96F) and P(YMHA) mutants do not inhibit wild-type (WT) P or complement each other during DNA priming.

LMH cells were transfected with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracellular virions and naked core particles were isolated 5 days post-transfection by clarifying the supernatant by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and then layering it over a 30% sucrose cushion and centrifuging at 192,000 × g overnight. Intracellular core particles were purified by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose pellet as described (33Tavis J.E. Massey B. Gong Y. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5789-5796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pellets containing intracellular or extracellular core particles were dissolved in 50 μl/100-mm plate of cells of B/EDTA (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 15 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 5% sucrose.Southern Blot Analysis—Viral DNAs were isolated by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and were then resolved by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. Southern blotting was performed as described previously (34Staprans S. Loeb D.D. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with internally 32P-labeled DHBV DNA as a probe.Western Blot Analysis—P was detected with monoclonal antibodies mAb 11 against P or mAb 3F10 against the HA tag as described (26Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). P within capsids was released from the covalently attached DNA prior to Western analysis by permeabilizing the capsids (35Radziwill G. Zentgraf H. Schaller H. Bosch V. Virology. 1988; 163: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) followed by treatment with micrococcal nuclease. 1 μl of glycine (300 mm, pH 2.5) was added to 5 μl of core extract and incubated at room temperature for 30 s. The reaction was neutralized by the addition of 1 μl of Tris-HCl (600 mm, pH 8.0) followed by the addition of 1 μl of CaCl2 (100 mm) and 1 μl of 5 units/μl micrococcal nuclease and incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. 1 μl of 150 mm EGTA and 2.5 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer were applied to stop the reaction. For virions, the envelope was removed by the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 prior to permeabilization.RESULTSActive P Translated in Vitro Does Not Form Stable Multimers—If P functions as a dimer or higher-order multimer during DNA priming, these complexes would be present at least transiently during priming assays with in vitro-translated P. Therefore, we attempted to co-immunoprecipitate complexes of active DHBV P isoforms that differed in size. We took advantage of the ability to modify the C terminus of P without ablating its ability to prime DNA synthesis and created two P derivatives carrying alterations at their C termini to permit their electrophoretic distinction from the 786 amino acid long wild-type protein. P-(1–738) is truncated at amino acid 738, and P(3′-HA) is P with an HA epitope tag added to the C-terminal end that increases its size to 806 amino acids. We first demonstrated that these particular P derivatives were enzymatically active for DNA priming. The proteins were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the absence of ϵ, ϵ was added, and a priming assay was performed. Fig. 2A demonstrates that P-(1–738) and P(3′-HA) could be electrophoretically resolved (lanes 1–3), that both proteins were active in DNA priming (lanes 4 and 5), and that translating the proteins together in the same lysate did not interfere with the priming activity of either protein (lane 6). Therefore, truncating P to amino acid 738 or inserting the HA tag at the C terminus did not interfere with the priming activity of P.Next, we attempted to co-immunoprecipitate these P derivatives to determine whether they formed stable complexes when co-translated. The P derivatives were translated either separately or together and diluted into IPP150 (a buffer that retains the active form of P and is used to measure P:ϵ binding (36Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and equal aliquots of the translation mixture were immunoprecipitated with mAb 3F10 specific for the HA tag, mAb 11 specific for the terminal protein domain of P as a positive control, or anti-β-galactosidase as a negative control. All P derivatives were precipitated by mAb 11 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3); however, only P molecules containing the HA tag were precipitated by mAb 3F10 (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6). The anti-β-galactosidase antibody did not precipitate any of the P proteins (Fig. 2B, lane 7). Therefore, untagged P did not co-precipitate with HA-tagged P. These results indicate that P molecules active in the DNA priming reaction do not form dimers or multimers stable enough to survive immunoprecipitation.P Molecules with Complementary Mutations Cannot Prime DNA Synthesis in trans—To determine whether transient or unstable P dimers or multimers form during DNA priming, we assessed the ability of P molecules with complementary defects in either the essential YMDD motif of the reverse transcriptase active site (P(YMHA)) or the tyrosine 96 (P(Y96F)) that primes DNA synthesis to complement each other and prime DNA synthesis in trans or to act as dominant-negative inhibitors of priming by the wild-type enzyme. Wild-type P, P(YMHA), and P(Y96F) were translated in vitro either individually or in combination in the presence of ϵ (Fig. 3A), and a DNA priming assay was performed (Fig. 3B). Wild-type P was active (Fig. 3B, lane 2), and the Y96F and YMHA mutants were inactive in DNA priming when the proteins were translated individually (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Wild-type P retained full activity when co-translated with the inactive Y96F and YMHA mutants (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6), and the two inactive mutants failed to complement each other when they were co-translated (Fig. 3B, lane 7). These results with DHBV strain 3 are the same as those reported previously for DHBV strain 16 (7Zoulim F. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).These data indicate that P mutants with lesions that inactivate the reverse transcriptase active site or ablate the hydroxyl on Tyr-96 that forms the covalent linkage with DNA cannot act as dominant negative inhibitors of the wild-type enzyme, nor can they complement each other and prime DNA synthesis in trans. Therefore, transient P dimers or higher multimers are very unlikely to exist during DNA priming in vitro.All P Molecules in Mature Virions Are Covalently Bound to Large DNAs—The preceding experiments were performed in vitro with synthetically produced P, and thus, the conclusions may be limited to this system. Therefore, we extended our studies to mature virions produced in cell culture and derived from infected duck serum.Our analytical strategy relies on the chimeric nature of mature hepadnaviral DNA in virions, in which the 5′ end of the minus polarity DNA is covalently attached to tyrosine 96 of P as a result of protein priming. P in these chimeric molecules cannot be detected by Western analysis because the mass of the DNA (∼2 MDa) greatly exceeds the mass of P (89 kDa) and traps the P-DNA chimeras in the wells during SDS-PAGE. The few P molecules that enter the gel migrate as a high molecular mass smear and do not transfer well from gels during blotting. Therefore, to detect P by Western analysis after synthesis of an appreciable amount of minus polarity DNA, the covalently attached DNA must be removed prior to electrophoresis. The use of mature cores from virions is important in this experiment because core particles must synthesize significant amounts of DNA to be secreted as virions (3Summers J. Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 37Gerelsaikhan T. Tavis J.E. Bruss V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4269-4274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Perlman D. Hu H.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2287-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Wei Y. Tavis J.E. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6455-6458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and analyzing mature cores excludes P molecules that may have initiated DNA synthesis but have not made enough DNA to prevent detection by Western analysis.We employed two sources of mature virions, LMH-D2 cells and infected duck serum. LMH-D2 cells are LMH cells carrying a stably integrated DHBV dimer that constitutively secrete DHBV virions (30Moraleda G. Wu T.T. Jilbert A.R. Aldrich C.E. Condreay L.D. Larsen S.H. Tang J.C. Colacino J.M. Mason W.S. Antiviral Res. 1993; 20: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Virions were collected from LMH-D2 culture supernatant or duck serum by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. The virions were treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 to remove the viral envelope, and the subviral capsid particles were permeabilized by brief treatment at pH 2.5 (35Radziwill G. Zentgraf H. Schaller H. Bosch V. Virology. 1988; 163: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One-half of each sample was treated with micrococcal nuclease to remove covalently attached DNA, and the other half was mock-digested. If P acts as a monomer, all of the enzyme would be covalently attached to DNA because each P molecule would have initiated DNA synthesis via protein priming, and so P would only be detectable in the nuclease-treated sample. If P acts as a dimer in which only one molecule is attached to DNA, the two monomers would dissociate during preparation for denaturing SDS-PAGE on reducing gels, so the amount of P detected in the nuclease-treated sample would be twice that detected in the mock-treated sample. If P acts as a trimer with one monomer attached to DNA, the ratio of P in the treated relative to the untreated samples would be 3:2, and the amount of P in the treated versus untreated samples would approach parity with higher-order multimers.When samples derived from LMH-D2 cells were subjected to Western analysis with mAb 11 specific for the terminal protein domain of P, intracellular non-encapsidated P was found at its anticipated sizes, including the 89-kDa primary translation product, an ∼8-kDa larger form, and N-terminal breakdown products of ∼55–60 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 1) (26Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the extracellular virion-derived core samples, P was detected at 89 kDa in the nuclease-treated sample (lane 5), but it was not detected in the mock-treated sample (lane 4). As expected, P was not detected in control supernatants from untransfected LMH cells (lanes 2 and 3). Identical results were obtained with mature DHBV virions derived from infected duck serum (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). An extra set of bands was observed in both nuclease-treated and mock-treated serum-derived samples at about 60 kDa (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5), but these were from nonspecific cross-reactions with host proteins because they were also observed at lower levels in control samples from uninfected serum (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, essentially all P molecules in mature, extracellular virions detectable by mAb 11 were covalently attached to large DNA molecules. Because all viral DNA in capsid particles is covalently attached to P and there is a single site of linkage between the DNA and P (Tyr-96 in DHBV (6Weber M. Bronsema V. Bartos H. Bosserhoff A.

https://openalex.org/W2105772318,"The small natural product wortmannin inhibits protein synthesis by modulating several phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolic pathways. A primary target of wortmannin in yeast is the plasma membrane-associated PI 4-kinase (PI4K) Stt4p, which is required for actin cytoskeleton organization. Here we show that wortmannin treatment or inactivation of Stt4p, but not disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton per se, leads to a rapid attenuation of translation initiation. Interestingly, inactivation of Pik1p, a wortmannin-insensitive, functionally distinct PI4K, implicated in the regulation of Golgi functions and secretion, also results in severe translation initiation defects with a marked increase of the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α. Because wortmannin largely phenocopies the effects of rapamycin (e.g. it triggers nuclear accumulation of Gln3p), it likely also inhibits the PI kinase-related, target of rapamycin (TOR) kinases. Importantly, however, neither inactivation of Stt4p nor Pik1p significantly affects TOR-controlled readouts other than translation initiation, indicating that these PI4Ks do not simply function upstream of TOR. Together, our results reveal the existence of a novel translation initiation control mechanism in yeast that is tightly coupled to the synthesis of distinct PI4P pools.

Together, our results reveal the existence of a novel translation initiation control mechanism in yeast that is tightly coupled to the synthesis of distinct PI4P pools. Under severe environmental conditions, conservation of energy and cellular resources, which is key to cellular survival, is achieved in part by inhibition of translation initiation. The down-regulation of translation initiation depends on multiple signaling pathways that sense internal stresses and subsequently signal downstream effectors that inactivate specific components of the translation machinery. The eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) 2The abbreviations used are: 4E-BP, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; ts, temperature sensitive; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; TOR, target of rapamycin; PI-4,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; P/M, polysome/monosome. 2The abbreviations used are: 4E-BP, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; UPR, unfolded protein response; ts, temperature sensitive; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; TOR, target of rapamycin; PI-4,5-P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; P/M, polysome/monosome. are specific translation inhibitors that bind to the translation factor eIF4E and prevent the recruitment of the translation machinery to mRNA (1Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar, 2Richter J.D. Sonenberg N. Nature. 2005; 433: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, binding of 4E-BPs to eIF4E is reversible: hypophosphorylated 4E-BPs bind to eIF4E, whereas hyperphosphorylated 4E-BPs do not bind to eIF4E. Growth stimuli including serum, hormones, growth factors, and mitogens induce hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BPs, followed by their dissociation from eIF4E. Conversely, various stresses including nutrient deprivation cause dephosphorylation of 4E-BPs, which results in a rapid association of 4E-BPs with eIF4E and consequent inhibition of translation (1Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two mammalian 4E-BP homologs, Caf20p and Eap1p, have been described (3Altmann M. Schmitz N. Berset C. Trachsel H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5de la Iost I. Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of these proteins in the regulation of translation initiation is poorly understood, Eap1p may inhibit translation initiation following membrane and/or heat stress (6de la Deloche O. Cruz J. Kressler D. Doere M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Meier K.D. Deloche O. Kajiwara K. Funato K. Riegzman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Another mechanism of translation inhibition in response to various environmental stresses is mediated through the phosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) (8Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 10Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). eIF2α is part of a trimeric GTPase eIF2 complex that, in its GTP-bound form, delivers the charged methionyl initiator tRNA to the small 40 S ribosomal subunit. Phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 converts eIF2 to an inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. As a result of the inhibition of GDP to GTP exchange, the level of GTP-bound eIF2 decreases, which leads to a reduction of the overall rate of translation initiation. Whereas four eIF2α kinases were identified in mammals (PKR, HRI, GCN2, and PERK), yeast appears to harbor only one eIF2α kinase (Gcn2p), which is mainly activated under amino acid starvation conditions (11Dever T.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 398-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α in yeast specifically stimulates translation of GCN4 mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional activator of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. The elucidation of signaling pathways that regulate translation activity has been largely facilitated by the use of natural cell-permeable compounds, acting as selective enzyme inhibitors. For example, the macrocyclic lactone rapamycin allowed the identification and characterization of the conserved TOR kinases, which, when present in the TOR complex I (TORC1) (13Loewith R. Jacinto E.

Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), act as key regulators of eukaryotic cell growth by critically regulating the phosphorylation state and the activity of Gcn2p (14Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), among other processes (15Cardenas M.E. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The fungal metabolite wortmannin represents another natural cell-permeable product (16Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) that acts as a potent cell growth inhibitor, largely by inhibiting the class I phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (17Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Class I PI 3-kinases are heterodimers composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (reviewed in Ref. 18Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In response to insulin and other growth factors, the 110-kDa subunit catalyzes the phosphorylation of PI-4,5-P2 to produce phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which results in recruitment of the serine/threonine kinases PDK1 and PKB/Akt to the plasma membrane. Activation of these effectors ultimately results in the up-regulation of translation initiation through phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of 4E-BP and activation of S6 kinase (S6K1) (reviewed in Ref. 19Martin K.A. Blenis J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 86: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the effects of wortmannin on cell growth and proliferation should be interpreted with caution, because this drug may inhibit additional lipid and/or protein kinases (18Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 20Zewail A. Xie M.W. Xing Y. Lin L. Zhang P.F. Zou W. Saxe J.P. Huang J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For instance, the class III PI 3-kinase hVPS34, which is functionally and structurally distinct from the class I PI 3-kinase, may also be targeted by wortmannin (reviewed in Ref. 18Fruman D.A.

In addition, wortmannin also inhibits the type III PI4Kβ, which is recruited onto Golgi membranes by the small GTPase Arf1p and regulates protein trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membranes (25Godi A.

Finally, at higher concentrations, wortmannin may also inhibit a number of PI3K kinase-related protein kinases such as ATM, DNA-PK, ATR, and TOR1 (29Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W.

In contrast to mammalian cells, yeast cells may not produce phosphoinositide 3,4,5-trisphosphate and express only a single PI 3-kinase, namely Vps34p (32Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Like its human counterpart, Vps34p synthesizes PI 3-phosphate on early endosomes or late-Golgi and functions in membrane and protein trafficking, but it is relatively insensitive to wortmannin in vitro (33Woscholski R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the primary target of wortmannin in yeast appears to be Stt4p (35Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27671-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a homolog of the mammalian type III PI4Kα. Stt4p is essential, localizes at the plasma membrane, and is required for cell wall integrity and vacuole morphology (36Audhya A. Foti M. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2673-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 37Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane PI4P is metabolized, via the PI 4,5-kinase Mss4p, to PI-4,5-P2, which allows recruitment of the Rho1 GTPase, a key regulator of actin organization and of the cell wall integrity pathway (37Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, Stt4p has a role in the transport of amino-phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (38Trotter P.J. Wu W.I. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13189-13196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Yeast cells also express an essential type III PI4Kβ, namely Pik1p, which is insensitive to wortmannin (18Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev.

Pik1p localizes to both the nucleus and Golgi, regulates Golgi secretory functions, and is required for the integrity of the vacuole and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (36Audhya A.

In this study, we use wortmannin to modulate PI metabolic pathways and investigate the effects of this drug on translation initiation. Our results demonstrate that decrease of functionally unrelated pools of PI4P in the stt4 and pik1 mutants leads to a rapid attenuation of translation initiation, independently of TORC1 signaling. Strains, Reagents, and Growth Conditions—Yeast mutant strains MFY128 (sst4::HIS3/p415-sst4–4ts), MFY63 (pik1::TRP1/p415-pik1–85ts), EHY304 (vps34::TRP1), MFY30 (vps34::TRP1/pvps34ts [URA3, CEN]), MFY354 (sac1::TRP1/p416-sac1–23ts), ODY371 (mss4::HIS3/p415-mss4–25ts) and MFY129 (pik1::TRP1 sst4::HIS3/p415-pik1–85ts p415-sst4–4ts) are all in the SEY6210 genetic background (Mata leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2–801 suc2-Δ9). The insertion of a myc13-kanMX6 tag into the chromosomal GLN3 gene locus of the above strains to create LC49 (SEY6210::GLN3-myc13-kanMX6), LC51 (MFY128::GLN3-myc13-kanMX6), LC50 (ODY371::GLN3-myc13-kanMX6), and LC52 (MFY63::GLN3-myc13-kanMX6) was performed by PCR-based modification as described (44Longtine M.S.

Other strains were H1896 (MATa ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 trp1-Δ63::GCN4-LacZ::TRP1 sui2Δ/p[SUI2, LEU2]), H1897 (MATa ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 trp1-Δ63::GCN4-LacZ::TRP1 sui2Δ/p[sui2-S51A, LEU2]), H1816 (MATa ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 trp1-Δ63::GCN4-LacZ::TRP1 gcn2Δ sui2Δ/p[SUI2, LEU2]), ODY396 (MATa his4 leu2 lys2 or LYS2 bar1 ura3), ODY397 (MATa his4 leu2 lys2 or LYS2 bar1 ura3 ac1–1ts), ODY433 (MATa leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1-Δ901 trp1-Δ63::GCN4-LacZ::TRP1 pik1::TRP1/p415-pik1–85ts sui2Δ/pRS316-SUI2), and ODY434 (MATa leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1-Δ901 trp1-Δ63::GCN4-LacZ::TRP1 pik1::TRP1/p415-pik1–85ts sui2Δ/pRS316-sui2-S51A). Strains were grown at the indicated temperatures in standard rich medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD)) or in synthetic complete medium complemented with the appropriate amino acids for plasmid maintenance and either 2% glucose (SD) or 2% galactose and 1% raffinose (SGal/Raf) (45Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). Wortmannin, rapamycin, and latrunculin A were purchased from Sigma, LC Laboratories, and Calbiochem, respectively, and were prepared as recommended by the manufacturers. Polysome Analyses—Sucrose gradient analyses were performed according to de la Cruz et al. (5de la Iost I. Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5201-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The ratio between the polysome and the 80 S monosome peaks (P/M) was determined using SigmaScan Pro 5.0 program (Systat Software Inc.). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted from 100 A600 units of exponentially growing cells and analyzed (5 μg) by Northern blot as described (46De Virgilio C. Burckert N. Bell W. Jeno P. Boller T. Wiemken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]CTP using the PRIME-IT II Random Primer labeling kit (Stratagene 300385). Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared as described (47Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). For the analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation, equal amounts of protein from the different extracts were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated Ser51 in eIF2α (BIOSOURCE). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with polyclonal antibodies against total eIF2α. Phosphorylated forms of Gln3p-myc13 were resolved on 7% SDS-PAGE and detected using mouse myc tag monoclonal antibody (9B11, Cell Signaling). Sucrose Density Gradients—For sucrose density gradient fractionation, the isogenic SEY6210 (wild-type) and EHY304 (vps34Δ) strains transformed with pRS316-KEX2-HA (CEN, URA3) and pTOR1-HA (2μ, LEU2) were grown in 1.5 liters of SD-URA/LEU medium to an A600 of 1.2 at 30 °C. Cells were lysed and sucrose gradients prepared as described (48Efe J.A. Plattner F. Hulo N. Kressler D. Emr S.D. Deloche O. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4751-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Preparation of cells for immunofluorescence was essentially as described (49Chuang J.S. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 0.8 A600/ml in SD medium at 30 °C. Gln3p-myc13 was detected using mouse myc tag antibody (9B11, Cell Signaling) at a dilution 1:2000. Cy3 (indocarbocyamine)-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used at 1:2000 dilution. β-Galactosidase Assay—Strains carrying the GCN4-LacZ construct were grown at 30 °C in SD medium to mid-logarithmic phase of growth. Then, rapamycin or wortmannin was added for 3 h and cells were harvested. The UPR was measured by a standard β-galactosidase assay and the activity was normalized to the A600 of cells (Miller Units) used for each assay (50Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Cells Treated with Wortmannin Display a Translation Initiation Defect That Is Associated with Rapid Phosphorylation of eIF2α—A previous chemical genomic screen using the yeast gene knock-out mutant library revealed that a group of eight translation initiation mutants are highly sensitive to wortmannin and that cells lacking the translation initiation inhibitors Gcn2p or Eap1p are partially resistant to wortmannin (20Zewail A. Xie M.W. Xing Y. Lin L. Zhang P.F. Zou W. Saxe J.P. Huang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3345-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to investigate whether wortmannin inhibits growth of yeast cells by antagonizing translation initiation. Wortmannin prevents growth of wild-type cells on synthetic minimal medium with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the corresponding growth arrest is associated with a translation initiation defect, we then analyzed polysome profiles of exponentially growing wild-type cells prior to and following a 30-min wortmannin (10 μg/ml) treatment. Wortmannin treatment resulted in a significant increase of 80 S monosome and a decrease of polysome content, both of which are characteristic of translation initiation inhibition (Fig. 1B). This defect is also accompanied by a drastic transcriptional decrease of ribosomal protein (e.g. RPS12) and ribosome-associated Hsp70 chaperone (SSB1) genes indicating that wortmannin results in a general reduction of protein synthesis (Fig. 2D). To determine whether the inhibition of translation initiation in wortmannin-treated cells may be mediated by increased eIF2α phosphorylation, wild-type cells were grown to logarithmic phase and treated with wortmannin for different periods of time. Whole cell extracts were subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for the phosphorylated form of eIF2α (eIF2α-P). We found that a short treatment with wortmannin (5 min) already caused a strong induction of eIF2α-P (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 2Wortmannin inhibits TORC1-dependent signaling pathways. A, overexpression of Tor2p partially suppresses the stimulation of eIF2α phosphorylation by wortmannin. SEY6210 (wild-type) cells transformed with a plasmid containing TOR2 under the control of an inducible GAL1 promoter were grown to mid-logarithmic phase either in SD medium or SC medium complemented with galactose and raffinose (SGal/Raf). Then, wortmannin (10 μg/ml) was added to both cultures for the times indicated (0, 15, and 30 min). Phosphorylation of eIF2α (S51) was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 1C. Numbers indicate the relative increase of the eIF2α-P/eIF2α ratio. B and C, wortmannin induces hypophosphorylation (B) and nuclear localization of Gln3p (C). Wild-type cells expressing genomically tagged Gln3p-myc13 (LC49) were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in SD medium at 30°C and treated with rapamycin (Rap; 1 μg/ml) or wortmannin (Wort; 10 μg/ml) for 30 min, or not treated (–). Whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the different phosphorylated Gln3p-myc13 forms were detected by anti-myc antibody (B). Gln3p-myc13 was visualized by immunofluorescence using monoclonal anti-myc antibody, DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (C). D, wortmannin derepresses GLN1 gene transcription. SEY6210 cells were grown as in B and C and rapamycin (R, 200 ng/ml) or wortmannin (W, 10 μg/ml) were added for the times indicated. Cells were harvested and 5 μg of total RNA from each sample was subjected to Northern analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wortmannin Induces the Phosphorylation of eIF2α by Inactivating TORC1—The phosphorylation of eIF2α is mainly induced in response to amino acid starvation and inactivation of TORC1 (10Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Tor1p and Tor2p (when present in TORC1) function as stress sensors that integrate nutrient quality and abundance to control cell growth (51Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Previously, wortmannin was shown to inhibit the intrinsic protein kinase activity of Tor1p in vitro (31Alarcon C.M. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2531-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the kinase activity is essential for Tor1/2p function, we asked whether the reduction of translation initiation in wortmannin-treated cells results from a direct inhibition of Tor1/2p. Cherkasova and Hinnebush (14Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that the activation of Gcn2p depends on Tor1/2p by showing that overexpression of wild-type Tor2p prevents the increase of eIF2α phosphorylation observed in rapamycin-treated cells. In a similar approach, we found that overproduction of Tor2p, using an inducible GAL1 promoter, leads to a marked delay in wortmannin-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). To substantiate the idea that wortmannin may inhibit Tor1/2p in vivo, we next tested whether wortmannin could phenocopy the effects of the bona fide TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. For instance, rapamycin treatment (much like nitrogen depletion) results in inactivation of TORC1 and subsequent dephosphorylation and cytoplasmic to nuclear transfer of Gln3p, a transcription activator of nitrogen catabolic genes (52Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To compare the effects of wortmannin and rapamycin on both phosphorylation and subcellular localization of Gln3p, we used a wild-type strain containing an integrated myc-tagged GLN3 construct and treated cells with wortmannin or rapamycin for 30 min. Wortmannin treatment, like rapamycin treatment, caused both dephosphorylation of Gln3p (as judged by its higher electrophoretic mobility; Fig. 2B) and accumulation of Gln3p in the nucleus (Fig. 2C). Finally, the expression of the Gln3p target gene GLN1 was induced in wild-type cells treated with rapamycin or wortmannin for 30 min (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our results suggest that the attenuation of translation initiation and phosphorylation of eIF2α following 10 μg/ml wortmannin treatment likely results from a direct inhibition of TORC1. Wortmannin Inhibits Translation Initiation via an Additional TORC1-independent Mechanism(s)—Because wortmannin may not only inhibit Tor1/2p, but also additional protein or lipid kinases, it is formally possible that wortmannin inhibits translation also via TORC1-independent mechanisms. In line with this reasoning, we observed that wortmannin reproducibly caused a much stronger decrease in the P/M ratio than rapamycin (Fig. 3A). In other words, wortmannin inhibits translation initiation more strongly than rapamycin (even when rapamycin used in significant excess; data not shown). The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on translation initiation are mainly due to enhanced Gcn2p-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α following inactivation of TORC1 (14Cherkasova V.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 859-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To address the relative contribution to the inhibition of translation initiation of phosphorylated eIF2α in cells treated with wortmannin and rapamycin, we then analyzed the effects of both drugs in the absence of Gcn2p or in the presence of eIF2αS51A, which cannot be phosphorylated by Gcn2p. As expected, the rapamycin-induced redistribution of the polysomes into the 80 S peak was significantly reduced in the absence of Gcn2p (in a gcn2Δ mutant) or in the presence of eIF2αS51A (in a sui2-S51A mutant). Importantly, however, rapamycin treatment still caused a significant decrease in the P/M ratio even in the absence of Gcn2p. Thus, whereas these data substantiate the role of phosphorylated eIF2α in the attenuation of translation initiation, they also suggest that TORC1 may control translation initiation via additional Gcn2p-independent mechanisms (see “Discussion”). In comparison to rapamycin treatment, wortmannin treatment consistently caused a much more dramatic inhibition of translation initiation, notably even in gcn2Δ and sui2-S51A mutant cells (Fig. 3A). Our observation that wortmannin inhibits protein synthesis much more potently than rapamycin is also underlined by the fact that wortmannin inhibited growth of wild-type cells much more rapidly and efficiently than rapamycin (Fig. 3B). We next investigated the effect of wortmannin on the translational regulation of GCN4 mRNA, which is selectively derepressed due to activation of Gcn2p-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation following either nutrient starvation or rapamycin-mediated TORC1 inhibition (12Hinnebusch A.G.

https://openalex.org/W1963601054,"Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase forms a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate at a specific target site 5′-C+5C+4C+3T+2T+1p ↓ N-1 in duplex DNA. Here we study the effects of nonpolar pyrimidine isosteres difluorotoluene (F) and monofluorotoluene (D) and the nonpolar purine analog indole at individual positions of the scissile and nonscissile strands on the rate of single-turnover DNA transesterification and the cleavage-religation equilibrium. Comparison of the effects of nonpolar base substitution to the effects of abasic lesions reported previously allowed us to surmise the relative contributions of base-stacking and polar edge interactions to the DNA transesterification reactions. For example, the deleterious effects of eliminating the +2T base on the scissile strand were rectified by introducing the nonpolar F isostere, whereas the requirement for the +1T base was not elided by F substitution. We impute a role for +1T in recruiting the catalytic residue Lys-167 to the active site. Topoisomerase is especially sensitive to suppression of DNA cleavage upon elimination of the +4G and +3G bases of the nonscissile strand. Indole provided little or no gain of function relative to abasic lesions. Inosine substitutions for +4G and +3G had no effect on transesterification rate, implying that the guanine exocyclic amine is not a critical determinant of DNA cleavage. Prior studies of 2-aminopurine and 7-deazaguanine effects had shown that the O6 and N7 of guanine were also not critical. These findings suggest that either the topoisomerase makes functionally redundant contacts with polar atoms (likely via Tyr-136, a residue important for precleavage active site assembly) or that it relies on contacts to N1 or N3 of the purine ring. The cleavage-religation equilibrium is strongly skewed toward trapping of the covalent intermediate by elimination of the +1A base of the nonscissile strand; the reaction equilibrium is restored by +1 indole, signifying that base stacking flanking the nick is critical for the religation step. Our findings highlight base isosteres as valuable tools for the analysis of proteins that act on DNA in a site-specific manner."
