https://openalex.org/W2055642315,"Immunoconjugates (BR96-DOX) were prepared between chimeric monoclonal antibody BR96 and the anticancer drug doxorubicin. The monoclonal antibody binds an antigen related to Lewis Y that is abundantly expressed at the surface of cells from many human carcinomas; it has a high degree of tumor selectivity and is internalized after binding. BR96-DOX induced complete regressions and cures of xenografted human lung, breast, and colon carcinomas growing subcutaneously in athymic mice and cured 70 percent of mice bearing extensive metastases of a human lung carcinoma. Also, BR96-DOX cured 94 percent of athymic rats with subcutaneous human lung carcinoma, even though the rats, like humans and in contrast to mice, expressed the BR96 target antigen in normal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2028965457,"Evidence suggests that both α and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Although type I adenylyl cyclase is inhibited directly by exogenous βγ, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by Giα has not been convincingly demonstrated in vitro. Concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclases by purified Giα subunits is described. Activated Giα but not Goα was effective, and myristoylation of Giα was required. The characteristics of the inhibitory effect were dependent on the type of adenylyl cyclase and the nature of the activator of the enzyme. The concentrations of Giα required to inhibit adenylyl cyclase were substantially higher than those normally thought to be relevant physiologically. However, analysis indicates that these concentrations may be relevant and reasonable."
https://openalex.org/W1587430592,"One of the facets of the host defense of higher insects is the rapid and transient synthesis, following bacterial challenge or trauma, of a battery of potent antibacterial peptides (Steiner, H., Hultmark, D., Engstrom, A., Bennich, H., and Boman, H. G. (1981) Nature 292, 246-248). The best characterized of these peptides are the cecropins (ibid.), 4-kDa peptides devoid of cysteines, and the insect defensins (Hoffmann, J. A., and Hetru, C. (1992) Immunol. Today 13, 411-415), 4-kDa peptides with three intramolecular disulfide bridges. Several other inducible antibacterial peptides have been characterized only at the level of their amino acid sequences (Hoffmann, J. A., Dimarcq, J. L., and Bulet, P. (1992) Medecine & Sciences 8, 432-439). We report here the isolation of a novel 19-residue proline-rich inducible antibacterial peptide from Drosophila. In contrast to all previous reports on antibacterial peptides, this molecule carries a substitution as evidenced by molecular mass determinations; our data show that this reflects the O-glycosylation of a Thr residue by an N-acetylgalactosamine plus a galactose. A synthetic nonsubstituted peptide of identical amino acid sequence has an activity several times lower (5-10) than the native compound. Our data suggest that this substitution represents a post-translational modification essential for the full biological activity of this novel peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1564301159,"When brain proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose are probe with 125I-labeled laminin, a single broad band of approximately 120 kDa binds laminin specifically. We show here by two-dimensional electrophoresis and protein microsequencing that this band consists of two distinct laminin-binding proteins. One of these is the amyloid precursor protein. The other, laminin-binding protein (LBP) 120, is closely related to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein, dystroglycan (156 kDa); 5 peptides from purified bovine brain LBP120, ranging in size from 7 to 19 residues, are up to 100% identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of muscle dystroglycan (ibraghimov-Beskrovanaya, O., Ervasti, J. M., Leveille, C. J., Slaughter, C. A., Sernett, S. W., and Campbell, K. P. (1992) Nature 355, 696-702). These protein microsequence data support the data of Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya et al., which suggest that the dystroglycan precursor is processed into 120/156- and 43-kDa proteins. Moreover, the data suggest a revision in the position of the proposed cleavage site of the precursor. The glycosylation and extracellular localization of LBP120/dystroglycan are consistent with it being a cell surface laminin receptor. LBP120/dystroglycan, either as a native protein, or following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, binds with high affinity (Kd = 90 nM) to a proteolytic fragment of laminin (E3) containing the major heparin binding domain. This binding is Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibited by low concentrations of heparin. Thus, LBP120/dystroglycan is a major non-integrin laminin receptor whose high affinity interaction with laminin may reflect a structural role in brain and muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1533115076,"Nerve growth factor causes mediator release from rat peritoneal mass cells in the presence of lysophosphatidylserine. We have investigated the neurotrophin and receptor specificity involved in this response. Nerve growth factor produced a dose-dependent release of [14C]serotonin in the presence of lysophosphatidylserine with an EC50 of approximately 1 nM. Incubation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 did not produce a response. Northern blot analysis with probes for low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75), trkA, trkB, and trkC demonstrated a detectable signal for trkA only. Western blots of trkA immunoprecipitates from mast cell culture lysates, probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, demonstrated expression of functional TrkA protein. To determine whether p75, trkB, or trkC mRNA was present in amounts below the limit of detection for Northern analysis, a sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction protocol was used; again rat peritoneal mast cells demonstrated only trkA. The predominant form of trkA message expressed in rat peritoneal mast cells was smaller than the neuronal form. An 18-nucleotide exon (coding for 6 amino acids in the extracellular domain) in the neuronal message was not found in the predominant mast cell trkA message. PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, and dissociated rat sympathetic neurons showed both trkA and p75, but not trkB or trkC. Anterior pituitary expressed both trkB and trkC, but not trkA. To confirm the lack of expression of p75 on mast cells, 125I-nerve growth factor was chemically cross-linked to mast cells or PC12 cells and then immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for p75, 192-IgG; no p75 was detected. Thus, mediator release from rat peritoneal mast cells by nerve growth factor was specific and not a general property of neurotrophins, and the response was modulated through the trkA proto-oncogene. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a bone marrow-derived cell type that expresses trkA at both the mRNA and protein levels. These data provide further evidence that p75 is not necessary for nerve growth factor signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1516627479,"The Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, located in the amino-terminal, noncatalytic half of pp60src, is highly conserved among members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. SH3 domains have also been identified in a variety of proteins otherwise unrelated to protein-tyrosine kinases. The presence of SH3 domains in proteins with diverse functions suggests this domain may be important for directing protein-protein interactions necessary for protein function or cellular localization. To explore possible interactions between the SH3 domain and cellular proteins, we have established conditions for the isolation of proteins that bind in solution to the Src SH3 domain. A 67-amino acid fragment of c-Src containing either the entire glutathione S-transferase-SH3 domain (GST-SH3) or the SH3 domain from the neuronal form of c-Src (GST-SH3+) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. The GST fusion proteins were incubated with lysates from [35S]methionine-labeled Balb/c 3T3 cells or v-Src-transformed Balb/c 3T3 cells. We found that GST-SH3, but not wild-type GST, specifically interacted with multiple cellular proteins, whereas GST-SH3+ only weakly associated with a small subset of these proteins. The majority of the SH3-binding proteins were found in particulate and detergent-insoluble cell fractions. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of the SH3-binding proteins revealed that several of the SH3-binding proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine in v-Src-transformed cells. In addition, a number of the SH3-binding proteins were phosphorylated on serine and/or threonine in in vitro kinase assays, suggesting that one or more of the SH3-binding proteins has kinase activity. We identified paxillin, a vinculin-binding protein, as one of the Src SH3-binding proteins. This finding strongly supports the hypothesis that SH3 domains may be involved in subcellular localization of proteins to cytoskeleton and/or cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1491761595,"The chemical nature of urinary stone protein is poorly understood. We have sequenced a cDNA of urinary calcium oxalate stone protein extracted with EDTA. cDNA sequences showed complete identity between urinary stone protein and human osteopontin. Osteopontin protein was detected by staining with Stains-All, which specifically stains phosphoproteins, and by digestion with the highly specific protease thrombin, demonstrating that urinary calcium oxalate stones consist of osteopontin protein. We used a technique of in situ hybridization to detect osteopontin mRNA in the kidney. In control rats, distal tubular cells were sporadically positive, and proximal tubular cells and glomeruli were negative for osteopontin mRNA. A rat model of stone formation was induced with glyoxylic acid. In stone-forming rats, staining of distal tubular cells was remarkably increased, but proximal tubular cells and glomeruli were still negative. Immunostaining for the osteopontin protein also revealed that epithelial cells of distal tubules were weakly positive in control rats and significantly increased in stone-forming rats, although proximal tubular cells and glomeruli were negative. Northern blot analysis showed a significant increase of osteopontin mRNA in stone-forming rats in proportion to the dosage and the duration of the stone-inducing drugs. These results show that osteopontin in the kidney is presumably involved in urinary stone formation as the stone matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1557661275,"Mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) in Escherichia coli alter the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). A series of new point RifR mutations was isolated with the aid of random polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis followed by selection on rifampicin (Rif). All of the new RifR mutants, including changes in two novel positions, fell into the two principal clusters previously identified in the middle section of beta. Disruption of the spacer between the two clusters with deletions and insertions led to RNAP that was functional and sensitive to Rif in vitro, indicating that the spacer is not directly involved in Rif binding. However, most of the spacer mutants were strongly resistant to streptolydigin, suggesting that this area is involved in the binding of streptolydigin. An insertion of six consecutive histidines into the spacer was constructed that could be used to anchor RNAP on a Nichelate matrix without the loss of enzymatic activity, indicating that this region is looped out of the RNAP molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1563534485,"The trkA receptor functions as a signal transducing receptor for nerve growth factor. In this report, we show that alternative splicing results in the production of two distinct trkA isoforms in both rats and humans. These isoforms differ by virtue of a 6-amino acid insertion in their extracellular domain, the placement of which corresponds exactly with the breakpoint found in several human trkA oncogenes. When tested in fibroblasts, the presence (trkAII) or absence (trkAI) of the 6-amino acid insert does not affect the receptor's ligand binding specificity or its ability to transduce functional signals in response to nerve growth factor. In rats and humans, trkAII is the only isoform expressed within neuronal tissues at appreciable levels whereas trkAI, the form of trkA originally cloned, appears to be expressed mainly in non-neuronal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2089829427,"The regulation of transcription requires complex interactions between proteins bound to DNA sequences that are often separated by hundreds of base pairs. As demonstrated by a nuclear ligation assay, the distal enhancer and the proximal promoter regions of the rat prolactin gene were found to be juxtaposed. By acting through its receptor bound to the distal enhancer, estrogen stimulated the interaction between the distal and proximal regulatory regions two- to threefold compared to control values. Thus, the chromatin structure of the prolactin gene may facilitate the occurrence of protein-protein interactions between transcription factors bound to widely separated regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1533296006,"Glucose is thought to stimulate insulin release from islet beta-cells through generation of metabolic signals. In the current study we have introduced the genes encoding the facilitated glucose transporters known as GLUT-1 and GLUT-2 into AtT-20ins cells to assess their impact on glucose-stimulated insulin release and glucose metabolism. We find that transfection of AtT-20ins cells with GLUT-2, but not GLUT-1, confers glucose-stimulated insulin release in both static incubation and perifusion studies. Cells transfected with GLUT-1 have a Km for 3-O-methyl glucose uptake of 4 mM and a Vmax of 5-6 mmol/min/liter cell space. These values are increased compared to untransfected AtT-20ins cells (Km = 2 mM; Vmax = 0.5 mmol/min/liter cell space), but are less than observed in GLUT-2-transfected lines (Km = 16-17 mM; Vmax = 17-25 mmol/min/liter cell space). Despite these dramatic differences in glucose transport affinity and capacity, the rates of [5-3H]glucose usage are not different in the control and transfected lines over a range of glucose concentrations from 10 microM to 20 mM. We conclude that the specific effect of GLUT-2 on glucose-stimulated insulin release in AtT-20ins cells is not related to changes in the overall rate of glucose metabolism and may instead involve physical coupling of GLUT-2 with cellular proteins and/or structures involved in glucose signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1532352879,"Oncoprotein 18 (Op18) is an 18-19-kDa cytoplasmic phosphoprotein, of unknown function, that is frequently up-regulated in transformed cells. Stimulation of various cell-surface receptors results in extensive phosphorylation of Op18 and this protein has, therefore, previously been implicated in intracellular signaling. In the present study, by expression of specific Op18 cDNA mutant constructs and phosphopeptide mapping, we have identified in vivo phosphorylation sites. In conjunction with in vitro phosphorylation experiments, using purified wild-type and mutant Op18 proteins in combination with a series of kinases, these results have identified two distinct proline-directed kinase families that phosphorylate Op18 with overlapping but distinct site preference. These two kinase families, mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases and cyclin dependent cdc2 kinases, are involved in receptor and cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation events, respectively. Therefore, Op18 may reside at a junction where receptor and cell cycle-regulated kinase families interact with the same substrate. The present study shows that the MAP kinase has a 20-fold preference for Ser25 as opposed to Ser38 of Op18, while cdc2 kinases have a 5-fold preference for the Ser38 residue. Only a minor fraction of the 4.5 x 10(6) Op18 molecules/cell in a leukemic T-cell line are normally in their Ser25 phosphorylated form. However, antigen receptor stimulation of this cell line is shown to result in a rapid conversion of 35-45% of all Op18 molecules to the Ser25 phosphorylated form. These results suggest that Ser25 of Op18 may be a major cytoplasmic target for the MAP kinase in cells with high expression of Op18."
https://openalex.org/W1508340724,"Earlier work identified a series of accessory polypeptides of 150, 74, 59, 57, 55, 53, 50, and 45 kDa copurifying with cytoplasmic dynein. In the present study immunoprecipitation of the 50-kDa polypeptide from bovine brain cytosol with a specific monoclonal antibody revealed coprecipitating components of 150, 135, 62, and 45 kDa, which were completely distinct from the polypeptides immunoprecipitated using an antibody to the well established 74-kDa cytoplasmic dynein subunit. The 150- and 135-kDa polypeptides reacted with an antibody to p150Glued, the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila Glued gene. N-terminal microsequencing of tryptic peptides of the major 45-kDa component of the complex revealed it to be the alpha-isoform of centractin, a novel form of actin. Immunoblotting of sucrose gradient-fractionated brain cytosol revealed p150Glued, p50, and centractin to cosediment exclusively at 20 S. Immunofluorescence microscopy using antibody to p150Glued revealed centrosomal staining, which was abolished by microtubule depolymerization. Together these results reveal the 50-kDa polypeptide to be part of a cytosolic complex distinct from cytoplasmic dynein. However, the immunolocalization data indicate an association with microtubule minus ends, suggesting a possible interaction with cytoplasmic dynein in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1499666737,"Constitutive up-regulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene expression is observed in many neoplastic cell lines. The contribution of mutations in p53 to the up-regulation of the IL-6 promoter was evaluated in transient transfection experiments. In HeLa cells, wild-type (wt) human or murine p53 preferentially repressed the IL-6 promoter. The p53 mutants Val-135 and Phe-132 up-regulated IL-6 promoter activity in these cells at both 32.5 and 37 degrees C. The temperature-sensitive Val-135 mutant was not only not inhibitory or wt-like at the lower temperature, but had gained a transcriptional activator phenotype which was temperature-independent in HeLa cells. The functional DNA target for transcriptional modulation of the IL-6 promoter by p53 species included the multiple cytokine- and second messenger-response element (-173 to -145); point mutations in the transcription factor C/EBP beta-binding site within the second messenger-response element largely blocked the ability of p53 mutants Val-135 and Phe-132 to up-regulate this promoter. The up-regulation of IL-6 promoter constructs by co-transfection into HeLa cells of a C/EBP beta constitutive expression vector was blocked in a dominant negative manner by wt p53. In contrast, the p53 mutants Val-135 and Phe-132 further enhanced C/EBP beta-mediated up-regulation of IL-6 promoter constructs. The modulation of C/EBP beta function by p53 species provides a basis for the involvement of p53 not only in the regulation of cytokine synthesis but also in the altered responsiveness of tumor cells to cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1516657748,"As an approach to understanding the interaction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its 80-kDa receptor (gp80), we have constructed chimeric human/murine IL-6-molecules, which were expressed in Escherichia coli and analyzed for biological activity and receptor binding. This experimental strategy was based on the observation that human IL-6 acts on human and murine cells, whereas murine IL-6 stimulates only murine cells. The regions to be exchanged were chosen according to the four antiparallel helix model of the hematopoietic cytokine family. All 14 chimeras constructed showed biological activity on murine cells. From the differential biological activities on human cells we deduced that three out of four domains of IL-6 are involved in species specificity, whereas only two domains are necessary for specific recognition by the gp80 IL-6-receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1510140161,"Heterotrimeric G proteins, consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, are implicated in major signal transduction pathways controlling a diversity of functions in eukaryotic organisms. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, G proteins are implicated in the regulation of several environmental responses. As a first step in studying the role of G proteins in these processes, we have cloned the genes for two alpha subunits, gna-1 and gna-2, from Neurospora. The genes are located on different chromosomes and are differentially regulated during asexual development. The encoded proteins (Gna-1 and Gna-2) are the same size as members of the Gi-alpha family (approximately 40 kDa). The Gna-1 protein sequence is 55% identical overall to members of the Gi family and contains the consensus sequences for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin and incorporation of myristic acid, which are found in this group. These properties make Gna-1 the first identified microbial alpha subunit to be a member of any class. Furthermore, incubation of a N. crassa plasma membrane fraction with pertussis toxin results in ADP-ribosylation of a protein substrate which is the approximate size of Gna-1. The predicted Gna-2 protein sequence does not share a high degree of sequence identity with the Gi class. However, the coding region contains at least one intron in a position conserved in the Gi family. We propose that the Gi family of alpha subunits is ancient and during evolution may have first appeared in filamentous fungi."
https://openalex.org/W1505216921,"The cDNA clone for carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (CBP35) was engineered into the bacterial expression vector pIN III ompA2, which directs the secretion of the expressed protein into the periplasmic space. Recombinant CBP35 was purified from this system, at a level of approximately 50 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Digestion of recombinant CBP35 with collagenase D, followed by purification using saccharide-specific affinity chromatography yielded a M(r) approximately 16,000 polypeptide, corresponding to the COOH-terminal domain (residues 118-264) of the CBP35 polypeptide. This indicates that the COOH-terminal half of CBP35 contains the carbohydrate recognition domain, consistent with its sequence homology to other S-type lectins. The NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-137) was derived by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA, in which stop codons are inserted in place of Gly138 and Gly139, and expression of the mutant cDNA in the same pIN III ompA2 system. The purified NH2-terminal domain failed to bind to saccharide-specific affinity resins. Differential scanning calorimetry of rCBP35 and its individual domains yielded transition temperatures of approximately 39 and approximately 56 degrees C for the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains, respectively. Lactose binding by the COOH-terminal domain shifted the transition temperature to 65 degrees C, whereas sucrose failed to yield the same effect. These results suggest that the individual domains of the CBP35 polypeptide are folded independently."
https://openalex.org/W1564554426,"The five potential N-glycosylation sites (sequons) of human acid beta-glucosidase were individually mutated to determine site occupancy and the effect of site occupancy on selected catalytic and stability properties of this enzyme. Each N-glycosylation consensus sequence [Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)] was obliterated by individually substituting glutamine (Q) for asparagine (N). By expression of the normal and mutated cDNAs in insect (Sf9) and COS-1 cells and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-human acid beta-glucosidase antibodies, the four sequons at Asn-19, Asn-59, Asn-146, and Asn-270 were shown to be glycosylated in either source. The sequon at Asn-462 was never occupied. The mutant enzymes N59Q, N146Q, and N270Q were catalytically active and had normal interactions with active site-directed inhibitors as well as with the activators, phosphatidylserine and saposin C. Of the occupied sequons, N-glycosylation of the first was critical to the synthesis of a catalytically active enzyme. Alteration of this sequon, Asn-19-Ala-20-Thr-21, by the substitutions N19Q, N19D, N19E, or T21G led to a lack of glycosylation at this site. Enzymes containing N19Q, N19E, or T21G had significant decreases (3- to 60-fold) in intrinsic enzyme activity. The N19D enzyme had nearly normal catalytic activity and had enhanced activation by phosphatidylserine. These results show that sequon occupancy as well as steric effects at residue 19 are important for the development of an active conformer of this enzyme. This is the first example of a lysosomal hydrolase that requires sequon occupancy for the synthesis of a catalytically active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1640679677,"Tau protein kinase II purified from a bovine brain tau protein fraction (Ishiguro, K., Takamatsu, M., Tomizawa, K., Omori, A., Takahashi, M., Arioka, M., Uchida, T., and Imahori, K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10897-10901) was shown to have a similar substrate specificity to cdc2 kinase in that both phosphorylate neurofilament (NF) proteins. Tau protein kinase II recognized the dephosphorylated form of the heavy subunit of NF (NF-H) as a predominant substrate. The substrate was phosphorylated to the same extent with tau protein kinase II as with cdc2 kinase. Upon phosphorylation, the electrophoretic mobility of the NF-H on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis changed to the position of the phosphorylated form. A synthetic peptide containing a KSPXK sequence was by far a better substrate for tau protein kinase II than that containing a KSPXX sequence, as was also observed with cdc2 kinase. NF-H lost its microtubule-associating ability upon phosphorylation with tau protein kinase II as well as with cdc2 kinase. Although anti-PSTAIR antibody (PSTAIR is an amino acid sequence commonly found in cdc2 and several cdc2-related kinases) failed to react with tau protein kinase II, tau protein kinase II bound to p13suc1-Sepharose beads (p13suc1 is a yeast protein known to bind to cdc2 kinase)."
https://openalex.org/W1538306134,"The complete sequence of the Dictyostelium myosin ID (DMID) heavy chain isoform has been determined from cDNA and genomic clones. Like the DMIB isoform characterized previously, the DMID isoform is up-regulated during starvation-induced chemotactic aggregation, and its 124-kDa heavy chain contains the tail domain sequences that correspond to both the membrane and second actin-binding sites. An antibody that is specific for the DMID isoform was found to stain the actin-rich pseudopods at the leading edge of migrating cells. Protein microsequencing data reveals that the myosin I isoform localized to leading edge pseudopods in a previous study (Fukui, Y., Lynch, T. J., Brzeska, H., and Korn, E. D. (1989) Nature 341, 328-331) was DMIB, indicating that DMID and DMIB also colocalize and that both should influence the dynamics of actin-rich cortical structures. This and other data indicate that the DMID and DMIB isoforms are closely related and are distinct from the DMIA and DMIE isoforms, which possess truncated tail domains and are not up-regulated during chemotactic aggregation. Cells in which the DMID gene was rendered nonfunctional by targeted gene disruption do not show obvious behavioral defects, suggesting that another myosin I isoform(s) (possibly DMIB) might compensate for DMID. Finally, Southern blot data indicate that Dictyostelium may contain as many as nine myosin I isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1545878785,"Lipoprotein lipase (lipase), a key enzyme in lipoprotein triglyceride metabolism, has been shown to markedly increase low density lipoprotein (LDL) retention by subendothelial matrix. In the present study we assessed the role that lipoprotein and matrix components play in retention of LDL by lipase anchored to the subendothelial matrix. Lipase addition to subendothelial matrix increased LDL retention by 66-fold. Scatchard analysis of LDL binding to lipase-containing matrix yielded an association constant of 12 nM. Exogenous addition of the matrix components, heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate (i.e. chondroitin sulfate B), reduced LDL retention by greater than 90%. These glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) also reduced lipolytic activity associated with the matrix, suggesting that lipase was released from its binding sites on the matrix. In contrast, other matrix components (collagen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and chondroitin sulfate A) neither affected LDL release nor matrix lipolytic activity. Thus, heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate function to anchor lipase to the subendothelial cell matrix. The effects of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apoA-I were also examined. Preincubation of the subendothelial matrix with apoE, followed by washing, did not affect subsequent lipase binding to the matrix nor its ability to retain LDL. However, the direct addition of apoE alone or in combination with phospholipid liposomes decreased lipase-mediated LDL retention in a concentration-dependent fashion. Addition of apoA-I had no effect. Thus, in these studies apoE functions to displace LDL bound to lipase, but not lipase anchored to the matrix. To further examine the physiologic implications of this process, we assessed the ability of human apoE-rich and apoE-poor high density lipoproteins (HDL) to displace LDL from matrix-anchored lipase. ApoE-rich HDL reduced LDL retention dramatically (86% at 2.5 micrograms/ml). In contrast, apoE-poor HDL, at the highest concentration evaluated (400 micrograms/ml), decreased LDL retention by only 32%. Overall, these data suggest apoE and specifically apoE-containing HDL reduce the lipase-mediated retention of LDL by subendothelial matrix. This observation, in part could explain the protective effects of apoE and apoE-containing HDL against atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1481629189,"Belgrade rats have an autosomal recessive anemia with hypochromia and microcytosis. Iron uptake into reticulocytes is approximately 20% of normal, but transferrin uptake is unimpaired. We have systematically compared the transferrin cycle in Belgrade versus normal reticulocytes to locate the defect more precisely. Belgrade transferrin was functionally normal as purified transferrin or whole plasma. Transferrin affinity of Belgrade receptors was indistinguishable from normal, but Belgrade reticulocytes had twice as many receptors. Belgrade transferrin endocytosis was 1.5 times faster than normal, whereas exocytosis is about twice as fast. Initially Belgrade reticulocytes internalize iron at an unimpaired rate, but they lag behind normal by 5 min. During reincubation, they release 25-33% of iron taken up during a 30-min preincubation, whereas normal cells do not lose a detectable fraction. Unexpectedly, transferrin cycle time was unchanged. Hence another kinetic step of the cycle is slower, compensating for increases in Belgrade endocytosis and exocytosis. After one cycle, Belgrade reticulocytes retain only half of the iron that entered, but over 90% of iron entering normal cells remains within. Iron unloading is ineffective inside the Belgrade vesicle; 85% of iron that entered on transferrin returned to the medium after exocytosis, whereas only 45% of iron entering normal reticulocytes exits. Ineffective utilization of iron in or near Belgrade endosomes accounts for the Belgrade defect."
https://openalex.org/W2115231119,"Abstract We have investigated the mechanism of inactivation of thymidylate synthase (TS) by ICI D1694 (a folate-based quinazoline) in normal versus tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells. ICI D1694 is a very potent cytotoxic agent against these cells with IC50 values of 1-2 nM. Its growth inhibitory activity was completely reversed by the addition of thymidine, confirming that TS is its sole target in these cells. Remarkably, TS protein levels rose by 10-40-fold following treatment with ICI D1694, depending on cell type, while TS mRNA levels remained constant. The mechanism appears to be a release of of TS translation, since addition of cycloheximide, a translational inhibitor, blocked the TS protein levels from rising. But coadministration of 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole, a transcriptional inhibitor, did not overcome protein accumulation, nor did thymidine which overcomes growth inhibition by ICI D1694. 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate (via folinic acid), however, did block the effects of ICI D1694, showing that the drug has its effect upon both detainment and enzyme inhibition by binding to the folate substrate site of TS. In addition, in the presence of ICI D1694, TS protein was no longer cell cycle-regulated as evident by its constitutive expression in synchronized cells. This accumulation and constitutive expression of TS induced by D1694 should increase drug resistance under a clinical setting. We suggest that an ideal inhibitor of TS would target the TS allosteric site that binds to TS mRNA, responsible for specific translation of the protein, thereby complimenting inactivation of the enzyme."

Synthetic glycoconjugates and glycoproteins containing terminal nonreducing galactosyl units in beta-linkage were capable of forming a precipitate with rCBP35. If the glycoprotein or glycoconjugate contained terminal Neu5Ac, or galactose in alpha-linkage, precipitate formation was not observed. We also found that murine laminin, which contains polylactosamine structures, reacted more strongly than did bovine fetuin. Using carbohydrate-bovine serum albumin (BSA) glycoconjugates, we found that the tetrasaccharide Gal beta 1, 4GlcNAc beta 1, 3Gal beta 1,4-GlcNAc-BSA reacted more strongly than the disaccharide Gal beta 1, 4GlcNAc-BSA conjugate, suggesting that the binding site accommodates carbohydrate ligands greater in size than a disaccharide. Equilibrium dialysis experiments using [3H]lactose showed that rCBP35 binds 1 mol (n = 0.84) of lactose/30,000 g atoms of protein, with an affinity constant of 2.07 x 10(4) M-1. The binding site on the polypeptide appears to contain four subsites that recognize the sequence Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1, Gal beta 1,X-. All disaccharides tested that contain a nonreducing beta-galactosyl unit behaved as inhibitors of precipitation at approximately the same concentration, suggesting that the reducing position of the tetrasaccharide does not play an important role in the specific binding to the fourth subsite. The reducing sugar may serve to hold the saccharide in a tunnel like binding pocket since methyl-beta-D-galactoside itself is an extremely poor inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1597052697,"Mouse Mx1 protein is an interferon-inducible nuclear protein and confers resistance to influenza virus infection. The Mx1 protein purified from interferon-induced A2G mouse liver exhibited GTPase activity as did the Mx1 protein purified from the Mx1 cDNA-expressing Escherichia coli (Nakayama, M., Nagata, K., Kato, A., and Ishihama, A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21404-21408; Nakayama, M., Nagata, K., and Ishihama, A. (1992) Virus Res. 22, 227-234). The Mx1 protein purified from both mouse liver and Mx1-cDNA expressing E. coli was found to exist as assembled polymeric states judged from gel filtration pattern. By making a set of deletion derivatives of the Mx1 cDNA, the main motif for self-assembly of the Mx1 protein was mapped between amino acid residues 51-99. This motif is highly conserved not only in the Mx family of proteins but also in Mx-related proteins. The polymeric form of Mx1 from E. coli was observed as horseshoe-like structure by negative staining microscopy. When the Mx1 protein was incubated with GTP, this horseshoe structure was transformed to larger and tightly stacked helical forms. Electron microscopic analysis of immunostained liver of the interferon-induced mice indicated that the Mx1 protein exists in nuclei, forming giant complexes of about half the size of nucleoli."
https://openalex.org/W1486112923,"Putative cell surface human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp41 receptor proteins of 45 and 80 kDa (p45 and p80, respectively) were identified on human cells using a 17-amino acid peptide, referred to as CS3. In contrast, murine P815 cells expressed a peptide binding protein of 80 kDa only. A segment of 8 amino acids within CS3 contains the minimum sequence able to inhibit binding of radiolabeled CS3 to p80 and p45, as shown by competitive binding studies. Human p45 was purified from CD4+ RH9 cells by CS3 peptide affinity chromatography. Human p80 was partially purified from RH9 cell lysates by size exclusion chromatography followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against this preparation. Anti-p80 antibody inhibited HIV infection in a dose-dependent manner. The CS3 region of gp41 has been been shown previously to be exposed on viral particles and envelope-expressing cells predominately after conformational changes in the HIV envelope occur due to the interaction of CD4 with gp120. These results, together with those from previous studies, suggest that following the interaction of gp120 with CD4, there may be a second receptor interaction necessary for virus entry/fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1593066897,"We measured the content of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in sarcoplasmic reticulum, transverse tubules, and triads isolated from frog skeletal muscle, as well as in triads isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. We found that acid extracts of both transverse tubules and triads contained significant amounts of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, in the range of 300-400 pmol/mg of protein as determined by a radioreceptor assay, whereas no detectable amounts were found in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The identity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the extracts was confirmed by comigration with [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates, and by phosphorylation to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate using the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase present in muscle extracts. These findings may have important physiological implications. First, the results indicate that the muscle plasma membrane regions differentiated as transverse tubules contain high amounts of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, suggesting that they might possess a high density of binding sites for this compound. Second, since inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate has been proposed as a chemical transmitter in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle, our finding that this second messenger is present in high density at the site of coupling may contribute to the understanding of its role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1494571575,"The alpha- and beta-subunits of the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) were found to be autophosphorylated in the absence of ligands at high expression levels which suggests a propensity of PDGFRs to dimerize spontaneously. When the extracellular domains (ED) of both receptors were expressed and purified to homogeneity, they could be dimerized specifically by the different PDGF isoforms. PDGF-BB-induced dimerization was dependent on uncleaved loop I sequences present on both chains. Whereas, in solution, the EDs were weak competitors for PDGF binding to cellular PDGFRs, they formed high and low affinity complexes upon immobilization on solid phase. Cross-competition experiments defined two distinct binding sites on PDGFR alpha-ED. PDGF-AB bound only to the low affinity form of immobilized PDGFR beta-ED and could not dimerize PDGFR beta-ED. Cross-linking studies, however, revealed that both chains of PDGF-AB can interact with a PDGFR beta-ED monomer. Cross-linking of PDGF homodimers with EDs also yielded complexes which contained more than two ligand chains. These results led to a revised model of receptor-ligand interaction and indicate that monomeric PDGF should be able to dimerize PDGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1514225178,"Abstract Glucokinase plays a key role in the regulation of glucose metabolism in insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells and in the liver. Recent studies have shown that mutations in this enzyme can lead to the development of a form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and onset during childhood. Here, we report the catalytic properties of five additional missense mutations associated with diabetes (Glu70-->Lys, Ser131-->Pro, Ala188-->Thr, Trp257-->Arg and Lys414-->Glu), one polymorphism present in both normal and diabetic subjects (Asp4-->Asn), and three site-directed mutations (Glu177-->Lys, Glu256-->Ala, and Lys414-->Ala). The Trp257-->Arg mutation generated an enzyme that had an activity that was less than 0.5% of that for native human beta-cell glucokinase. By contrast, the Glu70-->Lys, Ser131-->Pro, Ala188-->Thr, and Lys414-->Glu mutations had a Vmax that was 20-100% of normal but a Km for glucose that was 8-14-fold greater than the native enzyme. There was no effect of the Asp4-->Asn polymorphism or the Glu177-->Lys substitution on glucokinase activity. The Lys414-->Ala substitution had no effect on Vmax but increased the Km for glucose 2-fold and the Glu256-->Ala substitution caused a approximately 200-fold decrease in Vmax. These studies have led to the identification of additional residues involved in glucokinase catalysis and substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2162763001,"Transgenic mice, containing the chimeric gene obtained by linking the promoter-regulatory region of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene to the bovine growth hormone structural gene (bGH), were used to investigate the long-term effects of bGH on glucose metabolism. Expression of the PEPCK/bGH gene was markedly enhanced by feeding a diet high in protein and inhibited by a high carbohydrate diet. All transgenic mice had normal levels of blood glucose but were hyperinsulinemic, indicating that they were insulin resistant. The glycogen synthase activity ratios in the muscle and liver of transgenic mice were lower than noted for control animals, and remained unchanged in liver after feeding a standard high carbohydrate or a high protein diet. Similar effects were detected in the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, except that a high carbohydrate diet activated this enzyme in the liver. The activation of glycogen phosphorylase in both muscle and liver correlated with the expression of their genes. These animals had a significant content of glycogen and glucose 6-phosphate, which was related to the levels of glucokinase mRNA in the liver. The concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in the liver of all fed transgenic mice was lower than noted in livers from fed animals. In addition, a decrease in the hepatic expression of the endogenous genes for PEPCK, tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), and the glucose transporter GLUT-2 was observed and directly correlated with the expression of bGH. Thus, bGH can control glucose metabolism in vivo, at least in part, by modifying the expression of several genes coding for proteins of importance in carbohydrate metabolism. Taken together, these results indicate a state of insulin resistance caused by chronic exposure of the animals to an elevated concentration of bGH.—Valera, A., Rodriguez-Gil, J. E., Yun, J.

https://openalex.org/W1517205951,"Mammalian skeletal muscle expresses GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 glucose transporters. Here, we have investigated whether GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 expression is regulated in muscle by contractile activity. GLUT-1 mRNA levels were high in skeletal muscle at days 16 and 17 of fetal life and decreased markedly by days 19 and 21. In contrast, GLUT-4 mRNA levels were clearly detectable at day 21 of fetal life, and they increased progressively during postnatal life. The timing data for GLUT-4 induction and GLUT-1 repression suggest that these processes are related to skeletal muscle innervation. GLUT-4 mRNA decreased markedly in adult rat and rabbit tibialis anterior muscle after severage of peroneal nerve. In contrast, GLUT-1 mRNA levels showed a 9-fold increase in rat muscle 3 days after denervation. Direct stimulation of rabbit tibialis anterior muscle with extracellular electrodes protected GLUT-4 mRNA levels against the effect of denervation. This indicates that the repression of GLUT-4 mRNA associated with denervation is due, at least in part, to electrical activity. Increased contractile activity induced for 24 h by indirect electrical stimulation at low frequency caused a marked and specific increase in GLUT-1 mRNA levels in rabbit tibialis anterior muscle. Our results indicate that (a) innervation-dependent basal contractile activity regulates in an inverse manner the expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 in skeletal muscle, and (b) enhanced contractile activity stimulates GLUT-1 expression in the absence of modifications to GLUT-4 expression. This suggests the existence of different factors which depend on contractile activity and which control GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 glucose transporter expression in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1558995046,"Two active site-directed photoaffinity analogs, 5-[beta-32P]azido-UDP-glucuronic acid and 5-[beta-32P]azido-UDP-glucose, were used for the characterization of UDP-sugar-utilizing enzymes in human liver microsomes. Both compounds were recognized by human microsomal proteins: major photolabeled bands of 50-56 kDa were detected. Both photoincorporations were competitively decreased by increasing concentrations of either UDP-Glc or UDP-GlcUA, indicating a high affinity for both nucleotides. The patterns of photoaffinity labeling in the 50-56-kDa range by the two probes were significantly different, indicating the presence of different UDP-GlcUA- and UDP-Glc-specific enzymes of similar molecular mass. The presence of a UDP-Glc-dependent transferase was confirmed by the identification of an enzymatic activity catalyzing the formation of glucosides of the 6 alpha-hydroxylated bile acid hyodeoxycholic acid (3 alpha, 6 alpha-diOH (HDCA)) in the presence of UDP-Glc. The specific activity of 1.5-3.2 nmol/min/mg of protein was similar to that of 6 alpha-glucuronidation of HDCA. The apparent Km for UDP-Glc estimated with HDCA was 280 microM, and the formation of HDCA glucosides was strongly inhibited by UDP-GlcUA (apparent Ki = 7 microM). Evidence is presented that HDCA-specific UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (clone UGT2B4) expressed in V79 cells is not involved in glucosidation of HDCA and is not photolabeled with 5-[beta-32P]azido-UDP-Glc. Rigorous structure identification of the biosynthetic product proved that HDCA was glucosidated at the 6-position. Thus, this UDP-Glc-dependent activity catalyzing the biosynthesis of 6-O-glucosides of 6 alpha-hydroxylated bile acids represents a new pathway in the metabolism of these bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W1603990889,"We tested for the presence of sulfonylurea receptors in pancreatic alpha cells. Two high affinity sulfonylurea receptors were identified in clonal pancreatic alpha cells (alpha TC-6): a 140-kDa species observed previously in clonal pancreatic beta cells (HIT) and a second 150-kDa protein. The dissociation constant (Kd) for both receptors is approximately 3.5 nM for an iodinated glyburide analog, 5-iodo-2-hydroxyglyburide. The estimated number of receptors (Bmax) increases approximately 2-fold, from 3.1 to 6.8 pmol/mg of membrane protein as the pH of the binding buffer is reduced from 7.5 to 6. Consistent with the notion that high affinity sulfonylurea receptors are integral components of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel, we demonstrated the presence of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in inside-out patches of alpha TC-6 cells. Whole cell K+ currents that activated with time showed inward rectification at positive potentials (above 0 mV) and were almost completely suppressed by 5 nM glyburide. Likewise, glyburide blocked 86Rb+ efflux from ATP-depleted alpha TC-6 cells, an effect that was reversed by 400 microM diazoxide. The presence of sulfonylurea receptors provides a mechanism by which sulfonylureas can directly modulate alpha cell function. The properties of the 150-kDa receptor and the role of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in alpha cells remain to be elucidated, but as in beta cells, ATP-sensitive K+ channels may be involved in metabolic regulation of alpha cells by glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1506941215,"We have previously reported the presence of 28-kDa protein in human mammary adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, whose phosphorylation by phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and permeant diacylglycerol 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol was correlated to growth arrest induced by the protein kinase C (PKC) activators. We now investigate the possible identity of this protein with the estrogen-regulated protein shown as related to the mammalian heat shock protein 27 (Fuqua, S. A. W., Blum-Salingaros, M., and McGuire, W. L. (1989) Cancer Res 49, 4126-4129). 32P-Labeled 28-kDa protein from TPA-treated MCF-7 cells was immunoprecipitated with 24-kDa-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunoblots from cell extracts fractionated by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that TPA induced the conversion of 28-kDa isoform a (pI 6.7) to more acidic isoform b (pI 6.2). Two-dimensional gel analysis of [3H]leucine-labeled MCF-7 cell extracts demonstrated that conversely to TPA, which induced only phosphorylation of 28-kDa protein, heat shock induced both synthesis (increase of isoform a) and phosphorylation (conversion of isoforms to b) of the protein. 32P labeling of MCF-7 cells allowed demonstration of the presence of an extra phosphoisoform c (pI 5.9) upon TPA as well as heat shock treatment. When cells were pretreated with the bisindolylmaleimide GF109203X, selective inhibitor of PKC, the heat shock-induced phosphorylation was unchanged, while the TPA effect was almost abolished, suggesting that the heat shock-activated protein kinase was very likely different from PKC. However, peptide mapping of the 28-kDa phosphoprotein suggested identical sites of phosphorylation upon TPA and heat shock stimulation. Partial amino acid sequencing of the 28-kDa protein revealed identity with both the 24-kDa protein and the mammalian HSP27. The fact that estrogens and PKC, respectively, regulate expression and phosphorylation of this 24/28-kDa protein strongly argues for its key role in MCF-7 cell proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1590424712,"Abstract The combined action of exonuclease I and recA protein leads to a kind of reverse DNA strand exchange in which joint molecules formed on the wrong or distal end of a linear duplex in the presence of ATP are stabilized by exonuclease I degradation of the displaced (+) strand. Continued pairing and degradation of the displaced strand leads to strand exchange that appears to progress with a polarity opposite that of the normal recA protein promoted reaction (i.e. 3'-5' with respect to the (+) strand). However, in contrast to the normal 5'-3' strand exchange, the displaced strand is completely degraded in the process. When the linear duplex DNA substrate has a heterologous region at the 5' (proximal) end, the major product (described in a previous study (Bedale, W. A., Inman, R. B., and Cox, M. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6499-6510)) is a circular duplex DNA molecule with a double-stranded tail whose length corresponds closely to the heterologous segment of the substrate. The origin of this product is here shown to be the result of the exonuclease activity of exonuclease I (either added exogenously or present as a trace contaminant of recA protein or SSB protein preparations), as opposed to endonucleolytic or mechanical breakage. The levels of exonuclease I required to generate these products are sufficiently low that they are undetected by assays for exonuclease contamination in recA protein preparations. These results demonstrate that the interplay of recA protein with other enzymes can have a profound effect on both the mechanism and outcome of recA protein-promoted DNA strand exchange. They also demonstrate that the (+) strand of the duplex DNA substrate is at least transiently displaced in recA protein-mediated pairing even when joint molecules are limited to the distal end."
https://openalex.org/W1490100075,"Angiotensinogen is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue as well as in liver where it is mainly produced. To address the mechanism of this adipogenic expression, promoter regions of the mouse angiotensinogen gene are fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and stably transfected into 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Promoter activity correlates well with an increase of mRNA levels during adipogenic differentiation, thereby demonstrating that the induction is primarily due to transcriptional activation. Deletion analysis indicates that the proximal promoter region from -96 to +22 is able to mediate the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase induction and identifies two transcriptionally active regions: AGE1 (position -399 to -139) and AGE2 (position -96 to -52). Heterologous promoter assay reveals that AGE1 behaves with a constitutive enhancer-like property and that AGE2 functions as a differentiation-inducible activator. Gel shift experiments show that AGE2 specifically binds a novel factor (AGF2), which is induced upon differentiation. Furthermore, a constitutive factor (AGF3) binds to the core promoter region including the exon 1 (from -6 to +22, AGE3). Mutations within either AGE2 or AGE3 that disrupt nuclear factors binding in vitro dramatically reduced the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activation in the native promoter context. These results suggest that both AGE2 and AGE3 are necessary for mediating efficient activation of the mouse angiotensinogen promoter during adipogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1516104554,"Unlike many tissues, the adult central nervous system extracellular matrix (ECM) has few known components. Previously, we characterized a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, pgT1, from adult rat brain which has the properties of a general brain ECM component and is immunologically distinct from aggrecan and versican (Iwata, M., and Carlson, S.S. (1993) J. Neurosci. 13, 195-207). In this study we demonstrate that pgT1 binds hyaluronan with relatively high affinity. The pgT1 preparation isolated from rat brain aggregates in non-denaturing conditions. This aggregation is abolished by incubation of pgT1 with Streptomyces hyaluronidase. Examination of these aggregates by electron microscope reveals a structure in which an average of 18 subunits arise laterally from opposite sides of an elongated 350-nm filament. These pgT1 aggregates resemble the proteoglycan aggregates in cartilage which are composed of aggrecan and hyaluronan. Using affinity coelectrophoresis, we measure a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.9 +/- 0.2 nM for the interaction of pgT1 and hyaluronan. These new findings, combined with the general distribution of pgT1 in brain, suggest that pgT1/hyaluronan aggregates are an extended general structure of the brain extracellular matrix network."
https://openalex.org/W1543300912,"A polyclonal antibody generated against rabbit liver p-nitrophenol UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) was used to screen a rabbit liver cDNA expression library constructed in lambda gt11. A 500-base pair cDNA clone, termed pPNP, generated a fusion protein that was antigenic with the antibody. Clone pPNP encoded the 3' region of a UGT. To identify larger recombinants, clone pPNP was used as a probe to screen a second cDNA library constructed in lambda ZAP. Two different cDNA clones were identified by DNA sequence analysis. Based upon their predicted amino acid sequence analysis, the clones encode transferases belonging to the UGT2 subfamily, and have been identified as UGT2B13 and UGT2B14. The predicted N-terminal sequence of UGT2B13 is identical to that determined for the purified rabbit liver estrone UGT. However, expression of the UGT2B13 cDNA in COS-1 cells displayed no activity in the presence of estrone but efficiently conjugated 4-hydroxybiphenyl. Results of Southern blot analysis using the 5' divergent region of the UGT2B13 cDNA that encodes exon 1 demonstrates that multiple genes share sequence homology to UGT2B13, an observation which indicates that the estrone UGT and UGT2B13 genes are encoded by separate alleles. When the 5' variable regions of the cDNAs where used in Northern blot analysis, the expression of UGT2B13 and UGT2B14 were shown to be expressed primarily in adult rabbits. However, when neonatal rabbits were treated with either dexamethasone or rifampicin, UGT2B13 mRNA levels were induced. The neonatal induction of UGT2B13 mRNA corresponded with similar increases in 4-hydroxybiphenyl UGT activity. The expression and induction of UGT2B13 paralleled that of the developmentally regulated rabbit liver progesterone 6 beta-hydroxylase P4503A6."
https://openalex.org/W1555689731,"A gene, termed RNA-binding protein (RBP1), was cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. RBP1 contains an open reading frame of 2016 nucleotides that encodes a 672-amino acid protein with a calculated M(r) of approximately 75,000. Southern blots of genomic DNA from wild-type and RBP1-disrupted strains were consistent with the presence of homologous genes. RNA blots revealed a major 2.7-kb RNA band and two minor bands of 1.5 and 1.1 kb. The sequence of the putative RBP1 protein contains two copies of an RNA recognition motif, two glutamine stretches, an asparagine-rich region, a methionine-rich region, and two long potential alpha-helixes. In addition, recombinant RBP1 fusion protein can bind to RNA and single-stranded DNA but not double-stranded DNA. RBP1 is a glucose-repressible gene. Disruption of RBP1 increased cell growth rate in the early log phase. Overexpression of RBP1 or reduction in its translation by expression of antisense RNA decreased or increased the cell growth rate, respectively. From these observations, we infer that RBP1 may be involved in growth regulation, possibly through its participation in RNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2132347213,"Abstract Caldesmon, an actin-binding protein from smooth muscle and non-muscle cells, has previously been shown to bind stoichiometrically to smooth muscle myosin in an ATP-dependent manner. We now show quantitatively the effects of Ca(2+)-calmodulin and phosphorylation on the binding of caldesmon to myosin. Ca(2+)-calmodulin reduces the binding of caldesmon to myosin with the same effectiveness as it does the binding of caldesmon to actin. However, Ca(2+)-calmodulin is ineffective in antagonizing the binding of the purified myosin-binding region of caldesmon to myosin. These and other results suggest that Ca(2+)-calmodulin binding to the COOH-terminal region of caldesmon is responsible for reversal of binding to myosin. Phosphorylation of the NH2-terminal region of caldesmon by the co-purifying kinase, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, weakens but does not eliminate the binding of caldesmon to smooth muscle myosin. Finally, phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin by smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase has no effect on the binding of caldesmon to myosin. Since Ca(2+)-calmodulin and phosphorylation of caldesmon weaken the binding of caldesmon to both actin and myosin, these events may be coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1599824594,"Human complement component C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is composed of seven alpha-chains and one beta-chain. The alpha- and beta-chains are homologous and both contain multiple copies of short consensus repeats (SCR) and in addition carboxyl-terminal non-repeat regions. Each of the alpha-chains contains a binding site for C4b, whereas the beta-chain binds protein S, a vitamin K-dependent protein involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. The alpha- and beta-chain genes are closely linked in the regulators of complement activation gene cluster on the long arm of human chromosome 1, band 1q32. The human beta-chain gene which has now been characterized was found to span more than 10 kilobases of DNA. The presence of at least two different beta-chain gene transcripts was suggested by the isolation of two new cDNA clones which contained different sequences in their extended 5'-untranslated regions. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the two clones represented distinct beta-chain mRNAs with different 5' end sequences. One class of beta-chain mRNA (denoted A19) was found to be encoded by six exons and primer extension, and S1 nuclease protection assays revealed multiple closely spaced transcription start sites for this mRNA class. Its 5'-untranslated region and signal peptide was encoded by the first exon. The second class of mRNA (denoted A12) had a different transcription start site and its 5'-untranslated region was derived from at least three exons out of which the last one was formed by utilization of an acceptor splice site within the first A19 exon. Exons encoding the mature beta-chain and the 3'-untranslated region were common to both classes of mRNA. The beta-chain contains three SCRs, out of which the first and second are encoded by individual exons, whereas two exons encode the third SCR. The exon encoding the carboxyl-terminal part of the third SCR also encodes 14 amino acids of the non-repeat region. The last exon encodes the remaining 46 carboxyl-terminal amino acids and the entire 3'-untranslated region. The elucidation of the organization of the beta-chain gene provides insight into the sophisticated molecular structure of C4BP and a basis for future structural and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W1521884845,"IgE molecules bind mast cells via a heterotetrameric receptor termed Fc epsilon RI. Cross-linking of bound IgE by specific allergen (Ag) initiates a signal transduction cascade resulting in a degranulation response. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis, by the cholesterol-lowering drug, lovastatin, blocks Fc epsilon RI-dependent [3H] serotonin ([3H]5HT) release from the mast cell line, RBL-2H3. We studied the mode and locus of action of lovastatin in these cells. Lovastatin inhibited Ag-stimulated degranulation, as well as that evoked by ionomycin or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, stimuli which bypass early receptor events. Inhibition was concentration-dependent, occurred at levels which reduce lipid synthesis, and was reversible by addition of mevalonic acid, the product of the reductase reaction. The effects of lovastatin were not mimicked by treatment with the sterol demethylase inhibitor, econazole, suggesting that nonsterol isoprenoid synthesis is required for the degranulation response. Conversely, tyrosine kinase inhibitors from three disparate chemical classes reduced stimulus-evoked [3H]5HT release in a manner similar to lovastatin, suggesting that these agents share similar loci of action. Accordingly, lovastatin altered the phosphorylation pattern in unstimulated RBL-2H3, and reduced the phosphorylation response to IgE cross-linking. By analogy to 5HT release, this effect was concentration-dependent and mevalonic acid-reversible. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, geldanamycin, also reduced the phosphorylation response to Ag. Lyn, a Src-related tyrosine kinase activated upon IgE cross-linking, was little influenced by either lovastatin or geldanamycin. Thus, lipid synthesis inhibition by lovastatin results in impaired tyrosine phosphorylation in RBL-2H3. This impairment is reflected in the subsequent exocytotic response. While lovastatin may inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation via an indirect mechanism, our results with tyrosine kinase inhibitors support the concept that multiple tyrosine kinases participate in the Fc epsilon RI-dependent signal transduction process."
https://openalex.org/W1583812689,"RecA protein can bind to double-stranded DNA even without the cofactor ATP if a DNA intercalator such as ethidium bromide is present (Thresher R. J., and Griffith, J. D. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 5056-5060). We have studied the structure and association kinetics of the ethidium-promoted DNA-RecA complex in order to understand the role of this intercalator in the DNA-RecA association process, information that could provide insight about the binding mechanism of RecA to DNA. Both linear dichroism and fluorescence measurements show that ethidium remains intercalated between the DNA bases in the RecA-DNA complex in the absence of ATP. Even in the presence of the ATP analog, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), ethidium bromide shows some stimulating effect on the binding of RecA to DNA. The results indicate that the destacking of DNA bases is an important limiting step in the association of RecA to DNA (DNA is stretched in the ATP gamma S-RecA-DNA complex). In the presence of ATP gamma S, however, ethidium was extruded from DNA upon the binding of RecA. This result suggests that the binding mechanism of RecA to DNA may involve intercalation of one or more amino acid residues of RecA between the DNA bases. Such an intercalation would also be consistent with the stretching of DNA and the observation that the DNA bases remain in a (virtually stacked) perpendicular geometry (Takahashi, M., Kubista, M., and Norden, B. (1991) Biochemie (Paris) 73, 219-226; Norden, B., Elvingson, C., Kubista, M., Sjoberg, B., Ryberg, H., Ryberg, M., Mortensen, K., and Takahashi, M. (1992b) J. Mol. Biol. 226, 1175-1191)."
https://openalex.org/W1563742344,"A combination of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments has been used to identify and spatially locate the heme pocket residues in the paramagnetic, low spin, met-cyano complex of elephant myoglobin. In addition to assigning resonances of the conserved residues, we have also assigned Gln64 (E7) and an aromatic ring designated PheA whose side chain is inserted into the heme pocket, as found earlier for elephant carbonmonoxy-myoglobin and oxy-myoglobin (Yu, L. P., La Mar, G. N., and Mizukami, H. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 2578-2585). The assigned conserved proximal side residues (Leu89(F4), Ala90(F5), His93(F8), His97(FG3), Ile99(FG5), Leu104(G5), Phe138(H15), and Tyr146(H23)) and conserved distal side residues (Phe43(CD1), Thr67(E10), Val68(E11), and Ala71(E14)) in elephant met-cyano-myoglobin are found to have orientations similar to those in sperm whale met-cyano-myoglobin. The observed dipolar connectivities and dipolar shift pattern for the substituted Gln64(E7) place the Gln in the heme pocket oriented toward the iron, as found for His64(E7). The conserved structural elements demand that the inserted PheA originate from the B-helix (i.e. Phe27 or Phe33). Dipolar contacts between the inserted PheA and the conserved residues Phe43(CD1), Val68(E11), Ile107(G8), and Gln64(E7), place PheA in the position occupied by the B10 residue in sperm whale myoglobin (Mb), with the larger size of the PheA side chain as compared to the replaced Leu being accommodated by the vacancy that occurs in sperm whale Mb. The paramagnetic induced relaxation places PheA in van der Waals contact with the bound ligand. Hence we conclude that the B10 position of elephant Mb is occupied by a Phe, and this substitution relative to sperm whale Mb is responsible for the low autoxidation rate and low reduction potential of elephant Mb. A reduced autoxidation rate has been reported for a sperm whale synthetic point mutant Leu29(B10) --> Phe (Carver, T. E., Brantley, R. E., Jr., Singleton, E. W., Arduini, R. M., Quillin, M. L., Phillips, G. N., and Olson, J. S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14443-14450). The published sequence of elephant Mb places B-helix Phe residues at position 27(B8) and 33(B14), but a Phe at neither of these positions can account for the observed NMR properties. Since a large proportion of the substitutions in elephant relative to sperm whale Mb, and some of the least conservative, occur in the B-helix, neither a structurally perturbed B-helix nor an error in the sequence can be discounted."
https://openalex.org/W1638444872,"Abstract The trpB8 mutation of Escherichia coli causes a major conformational change within the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase. The basis of this effect is a replacement of glycine 281 by arginine within a structurally important region. The mutant subunit, beta(B8), is catalytically active only under certain conditions, both in vivo and in vitro. Physiologically, the availability of wild type alpha subunit is the most important determinant of catalytic proficiency (Zhao, G.-P., and Somerville, R. L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 526-541; Zhao, G.-P., and Somerville, R. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14912-14920). Through enzyme activity titration experiments it was shown that the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase dramatically stimulates catalysis by the beta 2(B8) mutant enzyme. However, by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, the stability of the alpha.beta 2(B8) complex was markedly reduced in comparison with wild type. The alpha-mediated stimulation of catalysis by the beta 2(B8) mutant enzyme was enhanced by polyethylene glycol, a volume excluder. By absorption spectroscopy, it was shown that catalysis by the beta(B8) mutant protein is blocked in at least one step after the formation of a particular Schiff base intermediate (ESII). Either the alpha subunit or ammonium ion was able to overcome this block. The microenvironment of the ESII catalytic intermediate was examined by fluorescence spectroscopy. The data are consistent with a less hydrophobic environment for ESII in the beta 2(B8) mutant protein than in the wild type protein. These lines of evidence not only support a conformational switch model of open versus closed states within the beta subunit during the catalytic cycle but also suggest a functional role for the hinge region in the process of conformational switching."
https://openalex.org/W1558680793,"The SDC25 C-domain, the product encoded by the 3'-terminal part of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDC25 gene, acts as a GDP dissociation stimulator on RAS proteins (Crechet, J.B., Poullet, P., Mistou, M. Y., Parmeggiani, A., Camonis, J., Boy-Marcotte, E., Damak, F., and Jacquet, M. (1990b) Science 248, 866-868). To define further its role in the RAS-adenylyl cyclase pathway, an in vitro system was used, which utilized cell membranes from yeast strains with appropriate genotypes carrying alterations in the positive regulators of adenylyl cyclase activity. The SDC25 C-domain was able to stimulate the adenylyl cyclase activity of membranes from RAS2 cdc25 strains. Our results indicate that the SDC25 C-domain activates adenylyl cyclase by rapidly recycling the active RAS2. or RAS1.GTP complex from the respective GDP complex. This is also supported by the observation that the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity by RAS2T152I, a mutant characterized by a constitutively fast GDP to GTP exchange, was insensitive to the action of the SDC25 C-domain. No direct influence of this GDP dissociation stimulator on adenylyl cyclase was detected. Biochemical evidence was obtained, showing that in the presence of the functional target of RAS, the adenylyl cyclase, the effects of SDC25 C-domain and the catalytic domain of GTPase-activating protein are antagonistic. This in vitro system allowed a quantitative evaluation of the effects of positive and negative effectors of RAS on adenylyl cyclase and the biochemical analysis of conditions inducing a phenotype of permanently activated adenylyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1921309247,"The in vitro susceptibility to endogenous proteases of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase was studied immunochemically. Whereas the wild-type beta subunit was apparently very stable, the missense mutant beta(B8), carrying an amino acid switch from Gly to Arg at residue 281, underwent specific proteolytic cleavage. Polyclonal chicken antibodies and monoclonal antibodies specific for the N terminus (monoclonal antibody (mAb) 15-1), the C terminus (mAb 93-6), and the region (mAb 164-2) were used to study the hydrolysis of the beta(B8) polypeptide. Cleavage products of 30 kDa, from the N terminus, and 13 kDa, from the C terminus, were observed. These two polypeptides correspond to the well characterized F1 (N-terminal) and F2 (C-terminal) fragments that are generated during the limited tryptic proteolysis of the wild-type beta subunit. The outer membrane-associated protease OmpT was shown to be responsible for the cleavage of the beta(B8) mutant protein. Proteolytic cleavage, observed only under neutral non-denaturing conditions, was specific for the peptide bond between Arg281 and Met282. The Arg-Met peptide bond has not previously been reported to be susceptible to cleavage by the OmpT protease. The beta(B8) polypeptide had dramatically reduced affinity for mAb 164-2. This antibody interacted more strongly with the OmpT-generated F1-like fragment than with the intact beta(B8) protein. These results strongly suggest that the G281R mutation alters the conformation of the hinge region of the mutant beta subunit, particularly the beta-turn around Gly281. The implications with respect to the epitope recognized by mAb 164-2 are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1607246259,"The trp repressor of Escherichia coli is a dimeric DNA-binding protein that regulates transcription of several operons concerned with tryptophan metabolism. Although heterodimer formation between mutant and wild type subunits occurs readily in vivo, comparable heterodimers could be formed in vitro only under extreme conditions. To explain this difference we analyzed trp repressor dimer formation and dissociation using an in vitro transcription/translation system. Nascent wild type or mutant repressor polypeptides, synthesized in the presence of an excess of a second repressor, were invariably incorporated into heterodimers. In contrast, previously synthesized and assembled wild type dimers appeared to be refractory to dissociation, since they did not form heterodimers. However, previously synthesized mutant dimeric repressors that were defective in tryptophan binding readily dissociated and formed heterodimers. We noted that the ability of a dimeric repressor to dissociate under our conditions correlated inversely with its affinity for tryptophan. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that dissociation of the wild type aporepressor (no added tryptophan) was appreciably more rapid than dissociation of the tryptophan-saturated wild type repressor."
