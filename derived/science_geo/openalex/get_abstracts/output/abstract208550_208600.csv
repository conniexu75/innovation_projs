https://openalex.org/W2011379564,"Six rats with bilateral ablation of the hippocampus and six rats with extensive destruction of the neocortex were trained to enter a small compartment, while hungry, for a food reward. After 35 trials, spread over 4 days of training, the animals were given a shock while they were eating in the goal box. After the shock the rats with cortical lesions would not enter the goal compartment on the remainder of the trials given on the same day and only gradually began to re-enter over the next 2 days. The effect of the shock on the subjects with hippocampal ablation was slight and transient, suggesting that the ability to make passive avoidance responses was impaired."

Since n-valine was taken up by the organism almost as well as L-valine, permeability does not appear to be a factor in the preferential utilization of the L isomer. L-Valine was also utilized for the synthesis of N-methyl-L-valine. From studies with glycine-l- and -2-C14, it was concluded that glycine is the precursor of sarcosine. The radioactivities of sarcosine- l-Cl4 and sarcosine-N-C14H3 were incorporated to an equal extent into the actinomycin peptide, which suggests that free glycine in Z&JO is converted to free sarcosine, which is then incorporated into the actinomycin peptide. L-Methionine-C14H3 and, to a limited extent, C-2 of glycine, were utilized as a source of the N-methyl group of sarcosine and N-methyl+valine. Formate was completely inactive as a precursor of methyl group. The development rapid extraction procedure for the assay of the antibiotic has made possible the study of amino acid incorporation into actinomycin in short term experiments. Under conditions that inhibit pro- tein synthesis, amino incorporation into antibiotic was greatly stimulated. The results indicate that antibiotic synthe- sis proceeds by a mechanism different from protein synthesis, although both processes compete for the available amino acids in the cell. AcknowZedgment.s-The authors wish to thank Dr. H. Fales, National Heart Institute, Institutes of Health, for his advice and suggestions in the preparation and degradation of the N-tosylsarcosine derivative, and Dr. S. Udenfriend for his con- tinued encouragement. REFERENCES"

The present communication is a further report on the role of DNA in this reaction. We have now shown that under a variety of conditions, with various DNA preparations as primers, RNA formed appears to be a complementary copy of DNA and that both strands of DNA are copied. The amount of RNA formed may exceed the amount of DNA added, which suggests a catalytic role for DNA in RNA production. There are many striking similarities between the enzymatic synthesis of RNA and that of DNA4 (13)) but one important difference between these two reactions concerns the nature of the priming DNA. Thus DNA polymerase from both animal and bacterial sources is poorly active with preparations of native DNA (14, 15). RNA polymerase, however, is primed by either native DNA or denatured DNA. In contrast to DNA poly- merase, RNA polymerase is primed to a lesser extent by de- natured DNA. These results are presented below."

https://openalex.org/W1999711084,"Studies with C(14)-labeled glycine and delta-aminolevulinic acid as heme-bilirubin precursors in man indicate that the early labeled or shunt bilirubin consists of two fractions. Fraction 1 requires 1 to 24 hours for maximum synthesis, is not dependent on marrow erythropoietic heme synthesis, and is possibly of anabolic origin (formed by a direct pathway from heme precursors). Fraction 2 requires 3 to 4 days for maximum production, is dependent on heme synthesis, and probably has its origin in the bone marrow, as a degradation product of red-cell heme."

https://openalex.org/W1973911879,The clumping that takes place when blood is mixed with isotonic glucose is well known to the clinician. This curious phenomenon has been characterized and used to prepare blood frozen in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide for transfusion. A hypothesis is advanced to explain the mechanism of reversible agglomeration of erythrocrytes in nonelectrolyte solutions.

https://openalex.org/W1988790420,"AFTER injection of heterologous antigen, antibody formation has been shown to occur in lymphoid tissues. Among the different lymphoid cell types, plasma cells contain a large amount of specific antibody as shown by the fluorescent antibody technique of Coons et al.1. It is therefore assumed that plasma cells form and secrete antibody into lymph and blood2. The buffy coat also contains immunologically competent cells. This fact is shown by the ability of these cells to induce a homograft reaction or to transfer delayed type hypersensitivity. Another form of immunological competence, antibody synthesis by peripheral blood leucocytes against a heterologous antigen, has not been demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W2003780150,"THE first direct evidence that certain organic components are retained in the fossil remains of vertebrates comes from the analysis by paper chromatography of specimens of Dinichthys of Middle Devonian age (380 million years old)1. This work has shown that degradation products of collagen can still be recognized. More recently2, it has been demonstrated that fossil dentine and bone-like tissues in Devonian ostracoderms are capable of being decalcified and sectioned on a microtome. Further work at the Royal Dental Hospital, London, using normal histological staining techniques, has now indicated the presence of polysaccharides as well as collagen in the dentine and bone-like tissue of the ostracoderms. Using fossil bone belonging to a bison from the most recent Ice Age, and to Dremotherium from the Miocene (25 million years old), electron microscope photographs have been obtained at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford, showing collagen fibrils and the intact walls of canaliculi3. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction of the same material has established that it is the tubular form of collagen that is present."

Little, if any, structural detail has been convincingly demonstrated in the plane of the membranes until the recent electron microscope investigations of Dourmashkin, Dougherty and Harris2. These workers discovered regular hexagonal patterns in membranes of various origin (Rous sarcoma virus, human and guinea pig erythrocytes, chicken liver cells), treated with saponin."

Chicks trained for the first time on the day after hatching quickly learn to escape but do not learn to avoid shock. Avoidance learning first appears on the third day of life, and from that time the number of chicks learning to avoid increases with age, so that by the fifth day of life the majority are able to do so."

https://openalex.org/W1500063369,"The source of the hydrogen atom that is transferred between the BETA - carbon of glutamate and the methyl carbon of BETA -methylaspartate in the giutamate isomerase reaction was studied by carrying out the coupled isomerase and BETA -methylaspartase reactions in the presence of tritium- or deuterium- labeled water. In the decomposition of glutamate only about 0.1 atom of hydrogen from the solvent was incorporated per mole of mesaconate formed, and this small amount can be attributed to side reactions. In the synthesis of BETA - methylaspartate from mesaconate and ammonia, approximately 1 mole of solvent hydrogen is incorporated, whereas in the conversion of BETA -methylaspartate to glutamate no more hydrogen is taken up. The results indicate that a free proton is not involved in the glutamate isomerase reaction. (auth)"

The fluorescent bodies proved to be parasites in tests for immunological specificity and on restaining with Giemsa. These results suggest a method for studying two important aspects of mammalian malarias-namely, the cycle in the mammalian host and the immunological relationships among malarias indicated by tissue stages."

https://openalex.org/W1999277668,"A PERMEABILITY factor, activated by dilution or surface contact, has been described in the β-globulin fraction of human serum1. This substance, designated PF/dil, seems to have much in common with the enzyme kalli-krein first noted by Frey2. Whether the serum of any given species contains one, or more, permeability globulin has so far not been clear. Based on similarities of hypotensive and permeability properties, it has been suggested that PF/dil and serum kallikrein may be the same3. Indeed, di-isopropyl phosphofluoridate (DFP) and soybean trypsin inhibitor seem to inactivate both4–6. Permeability globulins from guinea pig serum have been reported with the electrophoretic mobility of α2 (ref. l) as well as γ-globulin7; whether this indicates two molecular species, or is an artefact of preparative procedures, is not certain. Early chromatographic work begun by one of us (J. P. L.) on certain lots of Cohn Fraction III, obtained commercially from human plasma, had suggested the presence of more than one non-dialysable permeability active substance. We wish to report the isolation of two permeability globulins, differing in their electrophoretic mobility and chromatographic behaviour, from sera of normal young men."

The glucose concentration was taken as the difference between these two values. The mean values were 61 mg and 150 mg/100 ml. for the amniotic and allantoic fluids respectively; for fructose both allantoic and amniotic fluids had mean values of 195 mg/100 ml.

However, very little is known concerning the interaction between nucleic acids and biological corpuscles, such as blood cells and bacteria, except for the serological reports1 of hæmagglutination of tanned erythrocytes coated with DNA by reacting with some antibody in sera of systemic lupus erythematodes. Experiments were therefore carried out to elucidate the general effects of nucleic acids—yeast RNA and sperm DNA, regardless of their species specificity—on erythrocytes."
