https://openalex.org/W2064299413,"Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are antiapoptotic regulators that block cell death in response to diverse stimuli. They are expressed at elevated levels in human malignancies and are attractive targets for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. Herein, we demonstrate that small-molecule IAP antagonists bind to select baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains resulting in dramatic induction of auto-ubiquitination activity and rapid proteasomal degradation of c-IAPs. The IAP antagonists also induce cell death that is dependent on TNF signaling and de novo protein biosynthesis. Additionally, the c-IAP proteins were found to function as regulators of NF-κB signaling. Through their ubiquitin E3 ligase activities c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 promote proteasomal degradation of NIK, the central ser/thr kinase in the noncanonical NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2069800916,"XIAP prevents apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting caspases, and this inhibition can be relieved by IAP antagonists, such as Smac/DIABLO. IAP antagonist compounds (IACs) have therefore been designed to inhibit XIAP to kill tumor cells. Because XIAP inhibits postmitochondrial caspases, caspase 8 inhibitors should not block killing by IACs. Instead, we show that apoptosis caused by an IAC is blocked by the caspase 8 inhibitor crmA and that IAP antagonists activate NF-κB signaling via inhibtion of cIAP1. In sensitive tumor lines, IAP antagonist induced NF-κB-stimulated production of TNFα that killed cells in an autocrine fashion. Inhibition of NF-κB reduced TNFα production, and blocking NF-κB activation or TNFα allowed tumor cells to survive IAC-induced apoptosis. Cells treated with an IAC, or those in which cIAP1 was deleted, became sensitive to apoptosis induced by exogenous TNFα, suggesting novel uses of these compounds in treating cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2050630660,"Artificial biochemical circuits are likely to play as large a role in biological engineering as electrical circuits have played in the engineering of electromechanical devices. Toward that end, nucleic acids provide a designable substrate for the regulation of biochemical reactions. However, it has been difficult to incorporate signal amplification components. We introduce a design strategy that allows a specified input oligonucleotide to catalyze the release of a specified output oligonucleotide, which in turn can serve as a catalyst for other reactions. This reaction, which is driven forward by the configurational entropy of the released molecule, provides an amplifying circuit element that is simple, fast, modular, composable, and robust. We have constructed and characterized several circuits that amplify nucleic acid signals, including a feedforward cascade with quadratic kinetics and a positive feedback circuit with exponential growth kinetics."

We explored the roles of nanotube length and structure, fiber density, and nanotube orientation in achieving optimum mechanical properties. We found that carbon nanotube fiber, spun directly and continuously from gas phase as an aerogel, combines high strength and high stiffness (axial elastic modulus), with an energy to breakage (toughness) considerably greater than that of any commercial high-strength fiber. Different levels of carbon nanotube orientation, fiber density, and mechanical properties can be achieved by drawing the aerogel at various winding rates. The mechanical data obtained demonstrate the considerable potential of carbon nanotube assemblies in the quest for maximal mechanical performance. The statistical aspects of the mechanical data reveal the deleterious effect of defects and indicate strategies for future work."

Here, we reveal that the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 mediates ubiquitin conjugation and 53BP1 and BRCA1 focal accumulation at sites of DNA lesions. Moreover, we establish that MDC1 recruits RNF8 through phosphodependent interactions between the RNF8 forkhead-associated domain and motifs in MDC1 that are phosphorylated by the DNA-damage activated protein kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). We also show that depletion of the E2 enzyme UBC13 impairs 53BP1 recruitment to sites of damage, which suggests that it cooperates with RNF8. Finally, we reveal that RNF8 promotes the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint and resistance to ionizing radiation. These results demonstrate how the DNA-damage response is orchestrated by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of MDC1 and RNF8-mediated ubiquitination."

https://openalex.org/W1975191711,"The circadian clock temporally coordinates metabolic homeostasis in mammals. Central to this is heme, an iron-containing porphyrin that serves as prosthetic group for enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism as well as transcription factors that regulate circadian rhythmicity. The circadian factor that integrates this dual function of heme is not known. We show that heme binds reversibly to the orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα, a critical negative component of the circadian core clock, and regulates its interaction with a nuclear receptor corepressor complex. Furthermore, heme suppresses hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose output through Rev-erbα–mediated gene repression. Thus, Rev-erbα serves as a heme sensor that coordinates the cellular clock, glucose homeostasis, and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1997731331,"CD4 + T helper 1 (T H 1) cells are important mediators of inflammation and are regulated by numerous pathways, including the negative immune receptor Tim-3. We found that Tim-3 is constitutively expressed on cells of the innate immune system in both mice and humans, and that it can synergize with Toll-like receptors. Moreover, an antibody agonist of Tim-3 acted as an adjuvant during induced immune responses, and Tim-3 ligation induced distinct signaling events in T cells and dendritic cells; the latter finding could explain the apparent divergent functions of Tim-3 in these cell types. Thus, by virtue of differential expression on innate versus adaptive immune cells, Tim-3 can either promote or terminate T H 1 immunity and may be able to influence a range of inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2151934707,"Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance."
https://openalex.org/W2014143877,"Monoallelic expression with random choice between the maternal and paternal alleles defines an unusual class of genes comprising X-inactivated genes and a few autosomal gene families. Using a genome-wide approach, we assessed allele-specific transcription of about 4000 human genes in clonal cell lines and found that more than 300 were subject to random monoallelic expression. For a majority of monoallelic genes, we also observed some clonal lines displaying biallelic expression. Clonal cell lines reflect an independent choice to express the maternal, the paternal, or both alleles for each of these genes. This can lead to differences in expressed protein sequence and to differences in levels of gene expression. Unexpectedly widespread monoallelic expression suggests a mechanism that generates diversity in individual cells and their clonal descendants."
https://openalex.org/W1969003018,"As previously shown in the hippocampus and other brain areas, patterns of firing-rate correlations between neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex during a repetitive sequence task were preserved during subsequent sleep, suggesting that waking patterns are reactivated. We found that, during sleep, reactivation of spatiotemporal patterns was coherent across the network and compressed in time by a factor of 6 to 7. Thus, when behavioral constraints are removed, the brain's intrinsic processing speed may be much faster than it is in real time. Given recent evidence implicating the medial prefrontal cortex in retrieval of long-term memories, the observed replay may play a role in the process of memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2114761774,"Plants exhibit adaptive responses to light, but it is not known whether parental plants transmit environmental cues that elicit adaptive responses in offspring. We show that offspring life history (annual versus biennial) is influenced by the maternal light environment (understory versus light gap). This transgenerational plasticity is adaptive when offspring are grown in their maternal light environment, where seeds typically disperse. Projections of population growth show that plants that are appropriately cued for their light environment through maternal effects have 3.4 times greater fitness than otherwise. Transgenerational plasticity has evolved in response to natural variation in light and provides a flexible mechanism by which sedentary organisms cope with heterogeneous environments."
https://openalex.org/W1964750332,"Collective behavior based on self-organization has been shown in group-living animals from insects to vertebrates. These findings have stimulated engineers to investigate approaches for the coordination of autonomous multirobot systems based on self-organization. In this experimental study, we show collective decision-making by mixed groups of cockroaches and socially integrated autonomous robots, leading to shared shelter selection. Individuals, natural or artificial, are perceived as equivalent, and the collective decision emerges from nonlinear feedbacks based on local interactions. Even when in the minority, robots can modulate the collective decision-making process and produce a global pattern not observed in their absence. These results demonstrate the possibility of using intelligent autonomous devices to study and control self-organized behavioral patterns in group-living animals."
https://openalex.org/W2079133058,"beta-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme defective in Gaucher disease, is targeted to the lysosome independently of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor. Affinity-chromatography experiments revealed that the lysosomal integral membrane protein LIMP-2 is a specific binding partner of beta-glucocerebrosidase. This interaction involves a coiled-coil domain within the lumenal domain. beta-glucocerebrosidase activity and protein levels were severely decreased in LIMP-2-deficient mouse tissues. Analysis of fibroblasts and macrophages isolated from these mice indicated that the majority of beta-glucocerebrosidase was secreted. Missorting of beta-glucocerebrosidase was also evident in vivo, as protein and activity levels were significantly higher in sera from LIMP-2-deficient mice compared to wild-type. Reconstitution of LIMP-2 in LIMP-2-deficient fibroblasts led to a rescue of beta-glucocerebrosidase levels and distribution. LIMP-2 expression also led to lysosomal transport of a beta-glucocerebrosidase endoplasmic reticulum retention mutant. These data support a role for LIMP-2 as the mannose-6-phosphate-independent trafficking receptor for beta-glucocerebrosidase."
https://openalex.org/W2019340414,"Ultrabroad coherent comb-like optical spectra spanning several octaves are a chief ingredient in the emerging field of attoscience. We demonstrate generation and guidance of a three-octave spectral comb, spanning wavelengths from 325 to 2300 nanometers, in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The waveguidance results not from a photonic band gap but from the inhibited coupling between the core and cladding modes. The spectrum consists of up to 45 high-order Stokes and anti-Stokes lines and is generated by driving the confined gas with a single, moderately powerful (10-kilowatt) infrared laser, producing 12-nanosecond-duration pulses. This represents a reduction by six orders of magnitude in the required laser powers over previous equivalent techniques and opens up a robust and much simplified route to synthesizing attosecond pulses."
https://openalex.org/W2103211563,"Recognition of signal sequences by cognate receptors controls the entry of virtually all proteins to export pathways. Despite its importance, this process remains poorly understood. Here, we present the solution structure of a signal peptide bound to SecA, the 204 kDa ATPase motor of the Sec translocase. Upon encounter, the signal peptide forms an alpha-helix that inserts into a flexible and elongated groove in SecA. The mode of binding is bimodal, with both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions mediating recognition. The same groove is used by SecA to recognize a diverse set of signal sequences. Impairment of the signal-peptide binding to SecA results in significant translocation defects. The C-terminal tail of SecA occludes the groove and inhibits signal-peptide binding, but autoinhibition is relieved by the SecB chaperone. Finally, it is shown that SecA interconverts between two conformations in solution, suggesting a simple mechanism for polypeptide translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2077291550,"Megasplay faults, very long thrust faults that rise from the subduction plate boundary megathrust and intersect the sea floor at the landward edge of the accretionary prism, are thought to play a role in tsunami genesis. We imaged a megasplay thrust system along the Nankai Trough in three dimensions, which allowed us to map the splay fault geometry and its lateral continuity. The megasplay is continuous from the main plate interface fault upwards to the sea floor, where it cuts older thrust slices of the frontal accretionary prism. The thrust geometry and evidence of large-scale slumping of surficial sediments show that the fault is active and that the activity has evolved toward the landward direction with time, contrary to the usual seaward progression of accretionary thrusts. The megasplay fault has progressively steepened, substantially increasing the potential for vertical uplift of the sea floor with slip. We conclude that slip on the megasplay fault most likely contributed to generating devastating historic tsunamis, such as the 1944 moment magnitude 8.1 Tonankai event, and it is this geometry that makes this margin and others like it particularly prone to tsunami genesis."

https://openalex.org/W2040378600,"Genome-wide studies in S. cerevisiae reveal that the transcriptome includes numerous antisense RNAs as well as intergenic transcripts regulated by the exosome component Rrp6. We observed that upon the loss of Rrp6 function, two PHO84 antisense transcripts are stabilized, and PHO84 gene transcription is repressed. Interestingly, the same phenotype is observed in wild-type cells during chronological aging. Epistasis and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the loss of Rrp6 function is paralleled by the recruitment of Hda1 histone deacetylase to PHO84 and neighboring genes. However, histone deacetylation is restricted to PHO84, suggesting that Hda1 activity depends on antisense RNA. Accordingly, the knockdown of antisense production prevents PHO84 gene repression, even in the absence of Rrp6. Together, our data indicate that the stabilization of antisense transcripts results in PHO84 gene repression via a mechanism distinct from transcription interference and that the modulation of Rrp6 function contributes to gene regulation by inducing RNA-dependent epigenetic modifications.

Together, our data indicate that the stabilization of antisense transcripts results in PHO84 gene repression via a mechanism distinct from transcription interference and that the modulation of Rrp6 function contributes to gene regulation by inducing RNA-dependent epigenetic modifications. Recent studies in various organisms, from yeast to mammals, provide evidence that genomes are transcribed on a scale larger than previously assumed (Johnson et al., 2005Johnson J.M. Edwards S.

In the yeast S. cerevisiae, genome-wide studies reveal that many protein coding sequences also encode antisense transcripts and that a large fraction of intergenic regions are transcribed as cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) subjected to degradation by the nuclear exosome component Rrp6 (David et al., 2006David L.

The nuclear exosome is a complex of 3′ to 5′ exonucleases implicated in RNA processing and quality control (Houseley et al., 2006Houseley J. LaCava J. Tollervey D. RNA-quality control by the exosome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Detailed studies show that the degradation of CUTs implicates TRAMP, a complex containing the poly(A) polymerase Trf4, which polyadenylates intergenic transcripts and promotes their degradation by facilitating the recruitment of Rrp6 (LaCava et al., 2005LaCava J. Houseley J. Saveanu C. Petfalski E. Thompson E. Jacquier A. Tollervey D.

Whether this widespread and unstable transcriptome just reflects nonspecific RNA polymerase II activity or participates in the control of gene expression is still unclear. In S. cerevisiae, the SER3 and IME4 genes are regulated by a mechanism of transcription interference. The SER3 promoter encodes a short SRG1 RNA whose transcription competes with the binding of activators to the downstream SER3 promoter, thereby repressing SER3 transcription (Martens et al., 2004Martens J.A. Laprade L. Winston F. Intergenic transcription is required to repress the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SER3 gene.Nature. 2004; 429: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In the case of the IME4 gene, antisense transcription interferes with sense transcription (Hongay et al., 2006Hongay C.F. Grisafi P.L. Galitski T. Fink G.R. Antisense transcription controls cell fate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Cell. 2006; 127: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For both IME4 and SER3, noncoding RNA transcription prevents gene expression via a cis-acting mechanism distinct from the RNAi-mediated gene silencing described in other eukaryotes. In fission yeast and higher eukaryotes, short double-stranded interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been implicated in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), a process mediated by components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. In S. pombe, TGS is promoted by the RNA-mediated cotranscriptional recruitment of the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex. The subsequent association of chromatin-modifying activities including histone methyl transferases and histone deacetylases then results in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing (Almeida and Allshire, 2005Almeida R.

Regulation of heterochromatic silencing and histone H3 lysine-9 methylation by RNAi.Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, components of the RNAi machinery are absent, and gene repression can be mediated by histone deacetylation. Histone acetylation and deacetylation occur through both targeted and global mechanisms. In the targeted mechanism, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are recruited to promoters by specific transcriptional activators and repressors, respectively. In the global mechanism, HATs and HDACs modify histones through large chromatin domains, including coding sequences (Kurdistani and Grunstein, 2003Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Histone acetylation and deacetylation in yeast.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Yeast expresses at least three classes of HDACs. Hda1 is an evolutionary conserved class II HDAC that functions in a complex with the Hda2 and Hda3 cofactors to deacetylate mainly histone H2B and H3 (Wu et al., 2001aWu J. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Suka N. Grunstein M. HDA2 and HDA3 are related proteins that interact with and are essential for the activity of the yeast histone deacetylase HDA1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

TUP1 utilizes histone H3/H2B-specific HDA1 deacetylase to repress gene activity in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the absence of Hda1, intergenic regions close to promoters as well as Hda1-affected subtelomeric (HAST) domains become enriched in histone H3 acetylated at position Lys18 (H3K18), resulting in increased gene expression (Robyr et al., 2002Robyr D. Suka Y. Xenarios I. Kurdistani S.K. Wang A. Suka N. Grunstein M. Microarray deacetylation maps determine genome-wide functions for yeast histone deacetylases.Cell. 2002; 109: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that PHO84 gene transcription is repressed in the absence of Rrp6, indicating a role for the exosome in efficient gene transcription. PHO84 is also downregulated during aging in wild-type (WT) cells, suggesting a decrease in Rrp6 function over time. In both conditions, the loss of Rrp6 function leads to the stabilization of PHO84 antisense transcripts and the subsequent inhibition of PHO84 gene transcription. The data support that PHO84 repression is not due to transcription interference but results from antisense RNA-induced histone deacetylation by the Hda1/2/3 complex. While studying PHO84 gene expression, we serendipitously discovered that PHO84 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels progressively decrease during chronological aging. Yeast cells are chronologically aged by maintaining fresh cells for a certain number of days on plates at 4°C prior to 24 hr exponential growth in minimum medium at 25°C, RNA extraction, and northern blotting (Figures 1A and 1B). PHO84 mRNA levels gradually decrease with time and are as much as 20-fold lower in the progeny of cells kept on plates for 10 days compared to those kept on plates for only 3 days (Figure 1C). The low levels of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) bound to PHO84 5′ and 3′ ends in aged cells indicate that PHO84 transcription is repressed over time (Figure 1D). Although the decrease in PHO84 mRNA levels occurs faster in cells kept on plates at room temperature (data not shown), the slow and progressive decrease at 4°C allowed us to identify the order of events underlying the repression process (see below). The analysis of the PHO8 and AAH1 genes showed that the repression is specific to PHO84 under these conditions (Figure 2A). Indeed, PHO8 and AAH1 expression, regulated like PHO84 by phosphate and glucose levels, respectively (Escusa et al., 2006Escusa S. Camblong J. Galan J.M. Pinson B. Daignan-Fornier B. Proteasome- and SCF-dependent degradation of yeast adenine deaminase upon transition from proliferation to quiescence requires a new F-box protein named Saf1p.Mol.

New components of a system for phosphate accumulation and polyphosphate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed by genomic expression analysis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), is unaffected in the progeny of older cells. Moreover, the expression of the two genes adjacent to PHO84, GTR1 and TUB3, is unaltered, indicating that the effect on PHO84 transcription is localized (Figures 1A and 2A). To verify that PHO84 gene repression is due to chronological aging, we maintained cells in stationary liquid cultures for 1–3 days before exponential growth and RNA analysis. The data confirmed that the progeny of cells maintained in stationary phase for longer time inherits a lower PHO84 expression level (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the swapping of the media of young and old cell cultures did not invert PHO84 mRNA levels, indicating that PHO84 repression is not due to the secretion or depletion of some metabolite in the culture medium (Figure 2C). Finally, this low PHO84 mRNA level is not due to acquisition of mutations during aging because the silent PHO84 state can be reversed by the streaking of cells on a fresh YEPD plate (Figure 2D). Overall, these data suggest that if grown in minimum medium, the progeny of aged cells inherits a transcriptional silent state of the PHO84 gene. Interestingly, the decrease in PHO84 expression with aging is paralleled by the appearance of a longer transcript (Figure 1C). This RNA is also detected with a probe specific for the short hypothetical open reading frame (ORF) YML122C upstream of PHO84, indicating that the long transcript spans both YML122C and PHO84 sequences (Figures 1A and 1C). To address the potential role of this transcript in PHO84 repression, we further characterized its origin and orientation. We generated sense and antisense SP6 riboprobes and found that not one but two antisense transcripts appear over time (Figure 1C). The longer one corresponds to a PHO84-YML122 chimeric RNA, whereas the shorter one is similar in length to the PHO84 sense mRNA (Figure 1A). 5′ RACE experiments identified several antisense transcript start sites located between 20 and 80 bp downstream of the PHO84 stop codon (Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The decrease in PHO84 gene expression upon appearance of antisense transcripts raises the possibility that antisense RNAs participate in PHO84 repression. To define whether antisense RNA accumulation is the cause or the consequence of PHO84 gene repression, we attempted either to increase the amount of antisense RNAs without increasing their transcription or to abolish PHO84 gene transcription. The first aim was achieved by the loss of the exosome component Rrp6, resulting in strong stabilization of the antisense transcripts and accelerated gene repression (Figure 3A). The comparison of sense and antisense PHO84 transcripts in Δrrp6 cells kept on plates for 3 or 6 days indicates that the accumulation of antisense transcripts precedes PHO84 downregulation. Next, to confirm that the stabilization of PHO84 antisense transcripts is not secondary to a decrease in sense transcription, we took advantage of the Δhpr1 strain, in which we found that PHO84 transcription initiation is almost totally abrogated. Hpr1, previously described as being required for transcription elongation (Chavez et al., 2000Chavez S. Beilharz T. Rondon A.G. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Lithgow T. Aguilera A.

Verstrepen K.J. Jansen A. Runner V.M. Buratowski S. Fink G.R. Genes with internal repeats require the THO complex for transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 14423-14428Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), appears to participate as well in PHO84 gene transcription initiation. Indeed, virtually no TATA-binding protein (TBP) or RNA Pol II is associated with the PHO84 promoter and coding regions compared to the WT, and no sense RNAs can be detected (Figures 3B and 3C). The absence of PHO84 transcription in Δhpr1 cells is not accompanied by an increase in antisense levels (Figure 3C). Similarly, loss of the Pho4 transcription factor completely inhibits sense transcription without affecting antisense levels (Figure 3D), confirming that antisense transcript accumulation is not the consequence of a block in sense transcription. Furthermore, antisense RNAs strongly accumulate upon the loss of Rrp6 in both mutants, demonstrating that antisense amounts depend on Rrp6 function rather than the level of sense transcription (Figures 3C and 3D). Together, these data discard a simple transcription interference mechanism and favor a process in which the stabilization of antisense transcripts participates in the repression of PHO84 transcription. The establishment of low PHO84 expression levels over time could either be due to a complex signaling cascade or specifically to antisense accumulation caused by a decrease in Rrp6 function. To address this question, we looked for a condition in which PHO84 antisense transcripts do not appear over time, thus allowing us to test the effect of RRP6 disruption alone. When cells are grown in a YEPD rich medium, PHO84 antisense transcripts never accumulate and mRNA levels are not reduced in the progeny of old WT cells (Figure 4A). In contrast, PHO84 mRNA levels are strongly reduced in Δrrp6 cells under these conditions. Interestingly, although antisense transcripts are revealed in Δrrp6 cells, the repression of PHO84 still depends on the time mother cells spend on plates before inoculation, indicating that if antisense transcript accumulation is a primary event, additional time-dependent steps are required for the silencing of PHO84 (Figures 3A and 4A). To confirm that this phenotype is not specific to W303, we performed the same experiment in the MCY829 background. The loss of Rrp6 similarly stabilizes antisense RNAs and results in PHO84 repression, but these changes occur faster and are detected already after 2 days on plates in this strain (Figures 4B and 4C). Because PHO84 antisense transcripts are polyadenylated (Figure 4B), we tested whether the Trf4 poly(A) polymerase, implicated in the polyadenylation of Rrp6 targets (LaCava et al., 2005LaCava J. Houseley J. Saveanu C. Petfalski E. Thompson E. Jacquier A. Tollervey D.

The loss of Trf4 also results in increased PHO84 antisense and decreased PHO84 sense RNA levels (Figure 4D). Note that antisense transcript levels in Δtrf4 are weaker than in Δrrp6, possibly reflecting the activity of the redundant Trf5 poly(A) polymerase (LaCava et al., 2005LaCava J. Houseley J. Saveanu C. Petfalski E. Thompson E. Jacquier A. Tollervey D. RNA degradation by the exosome is promoted by a nuclear polyadenylation complex.Cell. 2005; 121: 713-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, PHO84 becomes repressed in Δtrf4, indicating that PHO84 silencing can be established in the presence of limited amounts of antisense RNA. Thus, Trf4 is likely to restrict antisense transcript accumulation and to maintain PHO84 sense mRNA production in cooperation with Rrp6. All together, these data provide additional evidence that the stabilization of PHO84 antisense transcripts is a necessary event for the initiation of PHO84 gene silencing. The role of antisense RNA stabilization in PHO84 repression in both Δrrp6 and the progeny of old WT cells (Figures 1C, 3A, and 4A) prompted us to investigate the loss of Rrp6 function over time. Because Rrp6 interacts with chromatin (Andrulis et al., 2002Andrulis E.D. Werner J. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lis J.T. The RNA processing exosome is linked to elongating RNA polymerase II in Drosophila.Nature. 2002; 420: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Hieronymus et al., 2004Hieronymus H. Yu M.C. Silver P.A. Genome-wide mRNA surveillance is coupled to mRNA export.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2652-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we asked whether its association with the PHO84 gene is affected in the progeny of aged cells. Indeed, we observed that although the global levels of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Rrp6 are unaffected during aging, the binding of HA-tagged Rrp6 over the PHO84 locus decreases significantly in the progeny of 15- versus 2-day-old cells (Figures 5A and 5B). Thus, antisense stabilization and PHO84 silencing over time could result from the weaker association of Rrp6 with the PHO84 gene. To address whether aging might have a general effect on Rrp6 function, we examined other Rrp6 targets under these conditions. Rrp6 has been involved in Nab2 mRNA degradation (Roth et al., 2005Roth K.M. Wolf M.K. Rossi M. Butler J.S. The nuclear exosome contributes to autogenous control of NAB2 mRNA levels.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1577-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and Nab2 protein levels are increased in the Δrrp6 strain (Figure 5C). However, Nab2 protein levels are not affected in the progeny of 15-day-old cells (Figure 5B), consistent with the absence of a significant decrease in the binding of Rrp6 to the NAB2 gene under these conditions (Figure 5A). Similarly, no defect in the processing and accumulation of other Rrp6 substrates, including 7S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAS (rRNAs), as well as U24 and snR72, is detected in aged cells (Figure 5D). Finally, the examination of PHO84 sense and antisense RNAs in two earlier described rrp6 mutants (Phillips and Butler, 2003Phillips S. Butler J.S. Contribution of domain structure to the RNA 3′ end processing and degradation functions of the nuclear exosome subunit Rrp6p.RNA. 2003; 9: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) shows that the more severe rrp6-3 mutant behaves like Δrrp6, with high antisense RNA levels and no detectable sense RNA, whereas the rrp6-13 mutant shows a milder phenotype with lower antisense and higher sense RNA levels. These observations are consistent with a direct role of Rrp6 in PHO84 gene regulation. These data taken together suggest that during chronological aging, it is not the ability of Rrp6 to degrade its targets that seems to be affected, but rather its ability to access a subset of substrates within specific genomic regions. In addition, they support the view that Rrp6 degrades its targets when associated with chromatin and hence that these transcripts act in cis to repress PHO84 transcription. Notably, Rrp6 also binds the neighboring TUB3 and GTR1 genes, and this association is similarly reduced in aged cells (Figure 5A). Yet, TUB3 and GTR1 RNA levels are not affected under these conditions (Figure 2A), presumably because these loci do not encode Rrp6-regulated antisense transcripts. Our results indicate that antisense transcript stabilization represents an initial event in PHO84 repression and that additional time-dependent steps are required for the establishment of PHO84 gene silencing (Figures 1C, 3A, and 4A). The progressively lower PHO84 mRNA levels observed in WT cells upon chronological aging could reflect the inheritance of epigenetic modifications. To address this possibility, we first tested whether PHO84 remains repressed when cells are grown over more generations. When we inoculated old cells for 25 days in minimum medium and allowed them to proliferate exponentially for 96 hr instead of 24 hr, PHO84 expression was not restored (Figure 6A). Remarkably, PHO84 repression also occurs when fresh cells are grown for prolonged time under exponential conditions in minimum medium (Figure 6A). These observations suggest that over time, the cell population progressively acquires some epigenetic marks resulting in PHO84 gene silencing. Gene repression often correlates with histone deacetylation (Ekwall, 2005Ekwall K. Genome-wide analysis of HDAC function.Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 608-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism by which PHO84 becomes repressed, we examined PHO84 mRNA levels in mutant strains lacking various histone deacetylases or their cofactors in conditions under which PHO84 antisense transcripts are stabilized (Figure 6B). Strikingly, time-dependent PHO84 repression does not occur in mutants lacking Hda1, Hda2, and Hda3, which belong to the same complex. PHO84 repression is slightly compromised in the absence of Cpr1 but is not affected in the absence of other histone deacetylases including Rpd3, Hos1, Sir2, or Hst1 (Figure 6B and data not shown). These observations suggest that PHO84 transcription repression in aging cells specifically requires the Hda1/2/3 histone deacetylase complex. To confirm that Hda1/2/3 is also required for PHO84 gene silencing when antisense transcripts accumulate in the absence of Rrp6 (Figure 3, Figure 4), we examined PHO84 mRNA levels in Δrrp6, Δhda1, and Δhda2 simple mutants or in Δrrp6Δhda1 and Δrrp6Δhda2 double mutants (Figure 6C). PHO84 is well expressed in the WT, Δhda1, and Δhda2, but repressed in Δrrp6. However, PHO84 expression is rescued in Δrrp6 by the disruption of HDA1 or HDA2 despite the accumulation of PHO84 antisense transcripts in these double mutants, indicating that Δhda1 and Δhda2 are epistatic to Δrrp6. Together, these observations indicate that once antisense RNAs are stabilized, Hda1/2/3 is required for the repression of PHO84. The absence of PHO84 repression in the Δrrp6Δhda1 and Δrrp6Δhda2 double mutants (Figure 6C) suggests that the loss of Rrp6 and/or antisense transcript stabilization facilitates Hda1-dependent histone deacetylation and gene repression. To verify that the role of Hda1 is direct, we compared the binding of myc-tagged Hda1 to PHO84 and the adjacent genes TUB3 and GTR1 in WT and Δrrp6 strains (Figure 6D). Hda1-myc association with the promoter and coding regions of PHO84 increases at least 5-fold in Δrrp6, and this increase extends into the neighboring TUB3 and GTR1 genes. Western analysis of Hda1-myc confirms that this increase is not due to higher global levels of Hda1 in Δrrp6 (Figure 5C). Thus, antisense RNA stabilization in Δrrp6 is paralleled by the increased recruitment of Hda1 to the PHO84 locus. Next, to assess whether Hda1 recruitment results in histone deacetylation, we examined the level of histone H3 acetylation on lysine 18 (H3K18Ac). Remarkably, although H3 acetylation modestly decreases at the 5′ end of the GTR1 and TUB3 genes (1.3- to 1.5-fold), it is strongly reduced (7- to 8-fold) in the PHO84 promoter and 5′ coding regions but not at the PHO84 3′ end (Figure 7A and see Discussion). Thus, histone deacetylation does not strictly correlate with Hda1 recruitment in Δrrp6 but is restricted to a region where Hda1 and antisense RNA overlap. Finally, to define whether the repression in aged cells of PHO84, but not GTR1 and TUB3 (Figure 2A), could also result from targeted histone deacetylation, we compared H3K18Ac levels over this region in fresh and old WT cells (Figure 7B). Strikingly, the pattern of H3K18Ac in old cells was identical to that observed in Δrrp6, strongly suggesting that PHO84 repression implicates the same mechanism in both situations (Figures 7A and 7B). These results confirm that PHO84 repression by Hda1 is direct and suggest a new mechanism in S. cerevisiae in which targeted PHO84 gene silencing depends on antisense RNA accumulation and RNA-induced histone deacetylation. Finally, to confirm that antisense RNA indeed plays a direct role in PHO84 gene silencing, we blocked its production by inserting a HIS5 gene cassette within the PHO84 coding region, such that the antisense transcripts terminate at the HIS5 terminator (Figure 7C and Figure S2). In control cells, antisense transcripts accumulate in the absence of Rrp6, and PHO84 sense transcription is repressed. In contrast, in the +HIS5 mutant strain, an antisense RNA of intermediate size is detected in Δrrp6 with the 3′ but not the 5′- (YML122C) specific probe. This chimeric antisense RNA starts at the 3′ end of the PHO84 gene and ends at the HIS5 terminator. Importantly, the PHO84 gene is not repressed in this mutant and produces a longer PHO84-HIS5-PHO84 chimeric sense RNA both in the presence and absence of Rrp6 (Figure 7C and Figure S2). This result demonstrates that antisense RNA is directly implicated in the mechanism of PHO84 transcriptional silencing and that PHO84 gene repression is not an indirect effect of the absence of Rrp6. A recent study has implicated IME4 antisense transcripts in the downregulation of the sense IME4 mRNA via a cis-acting transcription-interference mechanism (Hongay et al., 2006Hongay C.F. Grisafi P.L. Galitski T. Fink G.R. Antisense transcription controls cell fate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Cell. 2006; 127: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Here, we find that stabilization, rather than the increased transcription of PHO84 antisense transcripts, is implicated in PHO84 repression. The data rule out a simple transcription-interference model and support a mechanism in which the accumulation of antisense RNAs leads to targeted histone deacetylation by Hda1 and the silencing of sense transcription (Figure 7D). Our observations further indicate that PHO84 antisense RNAs are stabilized in aged cells and could therefore be regulated upon changes in physiological conditions"

However, the exact function of HspB8 is not yet clear. We previously demonstrated that overexpression of HspB8 in cultured cells prevents the accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins such as the polyglutamine protein Htt43Q. Here we report that HspB8 forms a stable complex with Bag3 in cells and that the formation of this complex is essential for the activity of HspB8. Bag3 overexpression resulted in the accelerated degradation of Htt43Q, whereas Bag3 knockdown prevented HspB8-induced Htt43Q degradation. Additionally, depleting Bag3 caused a reduction in the endogenous levels of LC3-II, a key molecule involved in macroautophagy, whereas overexpressing Bag3 or HspB8 stimulated the formation LC3-II. These results suggested that the HspB8-Bag3 complex might stimulate the degradation of Htt43Q by macroautophagy. This was confirmed by the observation that treatments with macroautophagy inhibitors significantly decreased HspB8- and Bag3-induced degradation of Htt43Q. We conclude that the HspB8 activity is intrinsically dependent on Bag3, a protein that may facilitate the disposal of doomed proteins by stimulating macroautophagy.

The intracellular aggregation of proteins, whether it occurs as a result of proteotoxic stress or genetic mutations, represents a major threat in the crowded environment of the cell. Consequently, efficient mechanisms of protein quality control exist involving molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, which can recognize and bind to unfolded proteins thereby preventing their aggregation (1Lindquist S.

The fate of the chaperone substrates is determined by associated co-chaperones. CHIP, a ubiquitin E3 ligase and Bag1, a member of the Bag family of proteins (Bag1-Bag6) that contains a ubiquitin-like domain, associate with Hsp70 and facilitate the targeting of Hsp70 substrates to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (5Connell P.

In contrast, by associating with Hsp70, Bag2 hampers CHIP activity and favors substrate renaturation (7Dai Q. Qian S.B. Li H.H. McDonough H. Borchers C. Huang D. Takayama S. Younger J.M. Ren H.Y.

The role of chaperone complexes containing Hsp70 has been experimentally highlighted in a range of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates (10Wyttenbach A.

However, it is within the HspB group of heat shock proteins (also known as small heat shock proteins) that mutations have first been associated with human diseases (15Benndorf R. Welsh M.J. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We previously showed that HspB8 (H11/Hsp22), a member of this family, has chaperone activity in vivo toward Htt43Q, a pathogenic form of huntingtin that contains an expanded polyglutamine stretch making the protein prone to aggregation. Overexpression of HspB8 but not two closely related family members, HspB1 (Hsp27) or HspB5 (αB-crystallin), accelerated the degradation of Htt43Q and prevented both aggregation and formation of inclusion bodies (16Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chavez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A similar chaperone activity was observed using as substrate the androgen receptor protein containing a 65 glutamine extension (16Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chavez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), suggesting that this chaperone activity could at least be generalized to polyglutamine-containing proteins. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of action of HspB8. We found that HspB8 forms a stable stoichiometric complex with the co-chaperone Bag3. We further show that Bag3 stimulates macroautophagy, thus facilitating the degradation of mutated huntingtin.

Anti-Bag3 was from GeneTex except for the data of Fig. 1b, where an in-house antibody was used, which was raised against the recombinant glutathione S-transferase-human Bag3 fusion protein. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Cell Staining—All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (Invitrogen). HeLa (human cervical cancer), HEK-293T (human embryonal kidney), and COS-1 (African green monkey kidney) cells were grown in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas 5% fetal bovine serum was used for CCL39 (Chinese hamster lung fibroblast) cells and 10% bovine calf serum was used for NIH3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (16Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chavez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfection of siRNA for HspB8 (target sequence: agagcaguuucaacaacga), HspB1 (target sequence: ugagacugccggcaaguaa), Bag3 (target sequence: gcaugccagaaaccacuca), and a control sequence (Dharmacon's siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA) were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described (16Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chavez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), except that the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 30 min at -20 °C. For statistical analysis samples from three independent experiments were analyzed for each condition using the one-way analysis of variance test. l-[35S]Methionine Metabolic Labeling and Co-immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were incubated overnight in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 4% fetal bovine serum and 15 μCi/ml of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete EDTA-free (Roche). The cell lysates were centrifuged and cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose beads complexed with anti-HspB8 antibody or non-immune rabbit serum were added to the pre-cleared lysates. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the immune complexes were centrifuged and the supernatants (output) collected. Beads were washed 4 times with the lysis buffer; both co-immunoprecipitated proteins and output fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Dried polyacrylamide gel was exposed overnight using a Molecular Dynamic Storage Phosphor Screen (Kodak). Co-immunoprecipitations from non-labeled HeLa cells were performed as described above. Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells using anti-HspB8 antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The polypeptides migrating at ∼70-80 kDa were excised from the gel and send to the Southern Alberta Mass Spectrometry Centre for Proteomics (University of Calgary) for analyses by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, using an ESI-TRAP instrument. Filter Trap Assay and SDS-soluble and -insoluble Cell Extracts—SDS-insoluble proteins were analyzed either by filter trap assay or PAGE. For filter trap assay, the cells were scraped and homogenized in 2% SDS filter trap assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm dithiothreitol). Four different dilutions of each sample were heated at 98 °C for 3 min and applied with mild suction onto a cellulose acetate membrane. The membrane was washed with 0.1% SDS filter trap assay buffer and processed for Western blot analysis. For PAGE analysis of SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble proteins, the cells were scraped, homogenized, and heated for 10 min at 100 °C in 2% SDS sample buffer supplemented with 50 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were centrifuged for 20 min at room temperature and the supernatants were used as the SDS-soluble fraction. The pellets (SDS-insoluble fraction) were incubated with 100% formic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, lyophilized overnight, and finally resuspended in the same volume of 2% SDS sample buffer as the SDS-soluble fraction. Both SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble fractions were processed for Western blotting. Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—NIH 3T3 cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection by sonication in 1 ml of a 3.33% glycerol HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were loaded on top of a 11-ml linear gradient of glycerol (10-40%) made in HEPES buffer. The tubes were centrifuged for 16 h at 34,000 × g in a SW40 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated and the distribution of HspB8 and Bag3 was analyzed by Western blotting. The gradient was calibrated from the positions of known protein complexes (19Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). HspB8 Forms a Stable Stoichiometric Complex with Bag3—Upon expression in cells, poly(Q) proteins such as Htt43Q forms small aggregates all over the cytoplasm, which gradually become SDS-insoluble and fuse to each other to form large amorphous inclusion bodies that accumulate in the juxtanuclear area of the cells (16Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chavez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We previously described that the overexpression of HspB8 prevented the accumulation of HA-tagged Htt43Q (HA-Htt43Q), presumably by accelerating its degradation. This effect was not observed when overexpressing two other members of the HspB family, HspB1 or HspB5. In an initial attempt to determine the mechanism of action of HspB8 as a molecular chaperone, we investigated whether functional partners of HspB8 could be identified. Extracts prepared from HeLa cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine were immunoprecipitated with specific anti-HspB8 antibodies. A protein with an apparent relative molecular mass of 80,000 abundantly co-immunoprecipitated with HspB8 and was identified as Bag3 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1a). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blots performed in HeLa cells (Fig. 1b) and also in COS-1 cells (data not shown) confirmed the specificity of the interaction between HspB8 and Bag3. Bag3, but not Bag1, was co-immunoprecipitated by HspB8 antibodies, whereas HspB8, but not HspB1, was co-immunoprecipitated with Bag3 antibodies. HspB8 and Bag3 contain 5 and 10 methionine residues, respectively. From the amount of radioactivity associated with each of the two immunoprecipitated proteins, a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 was determined for the HspB8-Bag3 complex. The complex was further characterized by glycerol gradient analysis in NIH3T3 cells, a cell line used here because it expresses very little endogenous HspB8. When expressed at high concentrations (transfecting 3 μg of plasmid), HspB8 sedimented with an apparent molecular mass of about 50 kDa, as expected for a homodimer, the basic building unit of the HspB protein family (Fig. 1c) (19Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, when expressed at lower concentrations (transfecting 0.3 μg of plasmid), a portion of the protein multimerized into large complexes sedimenting between the 62- and 350-kDa markers, consistent with the molecular mass of 130 kDa predicted for the 2:1 HspB8-Bag3 complex. This suggested that upon transfection of HspB8, endogenous Bag3 becomes limiting for the formation of the HspB8-Bag3 complex. In agreement with this idea, co-expressing Bag3 with HspB8 allowed a higher proportion of HspB8 to incorporate into the approximate 130-kDa complex (Fig. 1c). We also determined that the presence of Bag3 was important for the stability of HspB8. In CCL39 and HeLa cells, overexpressing Bag3 together with HspB8 yielded a much higher expression of HspB8 than overexpressing HspB8 alone or HspB8 with Hsp70 (taken as control) (Fig. 1d). This was not caused by an increased transcriptional activity because HspB8 mRNA levels were not affected by Bag3 overexpression (supplemental Fig. S1). These findings suggested that the HspB8 proteins may be less stable when Bag3 is limiting. Accordingly, knocking down Bag3 expression by 75% using siRNA resulted in a 75% decrease in endogenous HspB8 expression, without affecting the expression of HspB1 (Fig. 1e). In contrast, reducing the HspB8 concentration below detectable levels caused little reduction in Bag3 (Fig. 1f). As an additional control, knocking down HspB1 caused no significant change in the expression level of either HspB8 or Bag3 (Fig. 1g). The reduction of HspB8 endogenous levels following treatment with Bag3 siRNA was observed not only in HeLa cells, where the complex has been first identified, but also in HEK-293T cells (see Fig. 4). All together these observations suggest that in different cell types, most HspB8 is associated with a pool of Bag3 and that this complex contributes importantly to HspB8 stability. Bag3 Also Prevents Htt43Q Accumulation—We next investigated whether overexpression of Bag3 in cultured cells, like HspB8, prevents the accumulation of the polyglutamine protein Htt43Q. Cells were transfected with vectors encoding HA-Htt43Q alone or HA-Htt43Q and either Myc-HspB8, His-tagged Bag3 or both. The accumulation of Htt43Q aggregates was analyzed 44 h after transfection using the filter trap assay (filtration of the SDS lysates through a cellulose acetate membrane, which entraps the aggregates). Expression of Bag3, like HspB8, but not expression of Hsp70, dramatically reduced the accumulation of insoluble Htt43Q in both CCL39 cells (Fig. 2a), the cell line where the activity of HspB8 was initially characterized (16Carra S. Sivilotti M. Chavez Zobel A.T. Lambert H. Landry J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and in HeLa cells (Fig. 2b). Similar results were also obtained in HEK-293T and COS-1 cells (see Figs. 3, 4, 6, and supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that the activity was cell line-independent. Notably, an additive effect was observed when HspB8 and Bag3 were expressed together (Fig. 2, a and b). In control experiments in which green fluorescent protein was co-transfected with mutated huntingtin, HspB8 or Bag3 produced no reduction in the percentage of cells expressing green fluorescent protein nor in the survival of these cells, indicating that the reduction of HA-Htt43Q expression was not a consequence of toxicity (data not shown).FIGURE 3HspB8 requires Bag3 to efficiently prevent the accumulation of Htt43Q. HEK-293T cells were either sham-treated (-) or treated (+) with a 50 nm solution of control siRNA (siRNA con.), siRNA targeting Bag3 (siRNA Bag3), or siRNA targeting HspB8 (siRNA HspB8). Twenty-four h later, the cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-Htt43Q together with an empty vector (-), Myc-HspB8, or His-tagged Bag3 (+). SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble fractions were prepared 44 h post-transfection. HA-Htt43Q levels were analyzed in both the SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble fractions. The empty arrowheads show HA-Htt43Q migrating at ∼21 kDa. The efficiency of the siRNA treatments or transfections were measured by probing in the SDS-soluble fraction the levels of endogenous Bag3 (endo-Bag3), endogenous HspB8 (endo-HspB8), transfected HspB8 (myc-HspB8), transfected Bag3 (his-Bag3), and γ-tubulin (a and b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Basal and HspB8/Bag3-stimulated degradation of Htt43Q is regulated by macroautophagy. a, HEK-293T and COS1 cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding HA-Htt43Q.

HEK-293T cells were transfected with a control siRNA sequence or with a specific siRNA directed against Bag3. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were transfected with vectors encoding HA-Htt43Q alone or with myc-HspB8. Cells were incubated for an additional 48 h before being analyzed for the presence of SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble HA-Htt43Q. Knocking down Bag3 expression efficiently blocked the ability of HspB8 to prevent Htt43Q accumulation (Fig. 3a). This was not due to a decreased expression of myc-HspB8 after the Bag3 siRNA treatment, thus suggesting that HspB8 requires Bag3 to exert its full chaperone function. A similar experiment was performed to investigate the impact of HspB8 knock-down on Bag3 activity. Fig. 3b shows that overexpressed Bag3 can block Htt43Q accumulation also in the absence of HspB8. All together these results suggested that Bag3 is an essential element of the HspB8-Bag3 complex and is responsible for the activity ascribed to HspB8 in decreasing Htt43Q accumulation. Decreasing Endogenous Bag3 Expression Resulted in Enhanced Htt43Q Aggregation—Both Bag3 and HspB8 are up-regulated upon proteotoxic stress such as exposures to heavy metal or heat shock (20Pagliuca M.G. Lerose R. Cigliano S. Leone A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Chowdary T.K. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, HspB8 and/or Bag3 overexpression experiments mimic well the cellular stress response activated by misfolded proteins and aimed at their clearance. From the data presented in Fig. 3, however, it seemed that knocking down the expression of Bag3 or HspB8 alone had no significant effect on the accumulation of HA-Htt43Q. To better evaluate the role of endogenous HspB8 and Bag3 on Htt43Q accumulation, we repeated the experiment transfecting HEK-293T cells with a lower amount of cDNA encoding for HA-Htt43Q. Fig. 4a shows that pre-treatment with Bag3 and HspB8 siRNA together caused a significant increase in the amount of SDS-insoluble HA-Htt43Q as compared with cells transfected with control siRNA. This effect was quantified in two independent experiments and corresponded to a 2-fold increase in the amount of SDS-insoluble Htt43Q. Treatments with Bag3 siRNA alone (which, as described in Fig. 1e, also induced the depletion of HspB8) resulted in a similar increase of SDS-insoluble HA-Htt43Q. In contrast, depleting HspB8 alone had no effect. These results strongly suggested that Bag3 plays an active role in the basal capacity of the cells to eliminate badly folded proteins as they are produced. Whether or not Bag3 does it as part of the HspB8-Bag3 complex and uses alternative partners when HspB8 levels are decreased remains to be determined. Htt43Q Accumulation in Cells Depleted for Bag3 Correlates with Decreased Macroautophagy Activity—A previous report indicated that Bag3 inhibits rather than stimulates the proteasomal degradation of proteins, suggesting that a alternative mechanism of protein degradation might be stimulated by Bag3 (9Doong H.

Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 33Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings we investigated the implication of macroautophagy in the Bag3 mechanism of action. We first asked whether the accumulation of SDS-insoluble HA-Htt43Q observed following HspB8/Bag3 depletion correlated with an altered macroautophagy activity. This question was addressed by measuring the expression of the macroautophagy marker LC3. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8, undergoes complex post-translational modifications leading to 2 main forms: LC3 I, which has a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution and LC3 II, a lipidated form of LC3 I specifically found associated with macroautophagic vacuoles at all stages of formation (18Kabeya Y.

Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Levels of LC3 II are considered a good indicator of macroautophagy activity. Intriguingly, we found that knocking down Bag3 alone or with HspB8, but not knocking down HspB8 alone, produced a decrease in the endogenous level of LC3 II (Fig. 4, black arrowheads). These results strongly suggested that macroautophagy is involved in the HspB8/Bag3 mechanism of action. HspB8/Bag3 Stimulates Macroautophagy—To determine whether the accelerated degradation of Htt43Q observed upon overexpression of HspB8/Bag3 could be due to a stimulation of macroautophagy, we analyzed the effect of HspB8 or Bag3 overexpression on the levels of LC3 II. Myc-LC3 was transfected in HEK-293T cells alone or with either HspB8 or His-Bag3. Western blot analysis of the cell extracts using anti-Myc confirmed the accumulation of LC3 II upon expression of HspB8 or Bag3 (F"

This force-velocity relationship is the primary determinant of muscle performance in vivo. Here we exploited the quasi-crystalline order of myosin II motors in muscle filaments to determine the molecular basis of this relationship by X-ray interference and mechanical measurements on intact single cells. We found that, during muscle shortening at a wide range of velocities, individual myosin motors maintain a force of about 6 pN while pulling an actin filament through a 6 nm stroke, then quickly detach when the motor reaches a critical conformation. Thus we show that the force-velocity relationship is primarily a result of a reduction in the number of motors attached to actin in each filament in proportion to the filament load. These results explain muscle performance and efficiency in terms of the molecular mechanism of the myosin motor."

https://openalex.org/W2001110139,"The 25 kDa Mad2 protein is a key player in the spindle assembly checkpoint, a safeguard against chromosome segregation errors in mitosis. Mad2 combines three unusual properties. First, Mad2 adopts two conformations with distinct topologies, open (O) and closed (C) Mad2. Second, C-Mad2 forms topological links with its two best-characterized protein ligands, Mad1 and Cdc20. Third, O-Mad2 and C-Mad2 engage in a ""conformational"" dimer that is essential for spindle checkpoint function in different organisms. The crystal structure of the O-Mad2-C-Mad2 conformational dimer, reported here, reveals an asymmetric interface that explains the selective dimerization of the O-Mad2 and C-Mad2 conformers. The structure also identifies several buried hydrophobic residues whose rearrangement correlates with the Mad2 topological change. The structure of the O-Mad2-C-Mad2 conformational dimer is consistent with a catalytic model in which a C-Mad2 template facilitates the binding of O-Mad2 to Cdc20, the target of Mad2 in the spindle checkpoint."

Combined brain imaging and reversible pharmacological inactivation of motor cortical regions suggest that the recovery involves the bilateral primary motor cortex during the early recovery stage and more extensive regions of the contralesional primary motor cortex and bilateral premotor cortex during the late recovery stage. These changes in the activation pattern of frontal motor-related areas represent an adaptive strategy for functional compensation after spinal cord injury.

The regulation of this priming process controls the strength and plasticity of synaptic transmission between neurons, which in turn determines many complex brain functions. We show that CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential components of the synaptic vesicle priming machinery. CAPS-deficient neurons contain no or very few fusion competent synaptic vesicles, which causes a selective impairment of fast phasic transmitter release. Increases in the intracellular Ca2+ levels can transiently revert this defect. Our findings demonstrate that CAPS proteins generate and maintain a highly fusion competent synaptic vesicle pool that supports phasic Ca2+ triggered release of transmitters."
https://openalex.org/W2101606325,"The status of spindle checkpoint signaling depends on the balance of two opposing dynamic processes that regulate the highly unusual two-state behavior of Mad2. In mitosis, a Mad1-Mad2 core complex recruits cytosolic Mad2 to kinetochores through Mad2 dimerization and converts Mad2 to a conformer amenable to Cdc20 binding, thereby facilitating checkpoint activation. p31(comet) inactivates the checkpoint through binding to Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2, thereby preventing Mad2 activation and promoting the dissociation of the Mad2-Cdc20 complex. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Mad2-p31(comet) complex. The C-terminal region of Mad2 that undergoes rearrangement in different Mad2 conformers is a major structural determinant for p31(comet) binding, explaining the specificity of p31(comet) toward Mad1- or Cdc20-bound Mad2. p31(comet) adopts a fold strikingly similar to that of Mad2 and binds at the dimerization interface of Mad2.

Pre-β-HDL is considered antiatherogenic, because it mediates ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-dependent efflux of cholesterol from foam cells as part of the reverse cholesterol transport. Pre-β-HDLs, the precursor of mature HDLs, are ∼7-nm particles containing apoA-I and phospholipid and can be derived from two sources (4Kunitake S.T. La Sala K.J. Kane J.P. J.

Collet X. Barbaras R. Jaspard B. Manent J. Vieu C. Chap H. Perret B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11572-11577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown how apoM might affect pre-β-HDL formation.ApoM (188 amino acids) is 80% identical at the amino acid level in mice and humans and is found in primitive organisms (e.g. fish and frogs) (21Deakin J.E. Papenfuss A.T. Belov K. Cross J.G. Coggill P. Palmer S. Sims S. Speed T.P. Beck S. Graves J.A. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 281Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In humans and mice, apoM is expressed in hepatocytes and in kidney proximal tubule cells (2Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 22Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Kidney-derived apoM appears to be secreted into preurine and is normally reabsorbed in a megalin-dependent fashion (23Faber K. Hvidberg V. Moestrup S.K. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, liver-derived apoM probably is the main source of plasma apoM. ApoM is secreted from the liver without cleavage of the hydrophobic signal peptide, which probably serves as an anchor in the lipid moiety of plasma lipoproteins (2Xu N. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31286-31290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Structurally, the remaining portion of apoM resembles retinol-binding protein. Thus, apoM was assigned to the lipocalin protein superfamily, whose members bind small lipophilic ligands in a common hydrophobic binding pocket (24Duan J. Dahlback B. Villoutreix B.O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although the physiological ligand is unknown, recombinant human and mouse apoM can bind retinol and retinoic acid (25Ahnstrom J. Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1754-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In human plasma, ∼5% of the HDL particles contain apoM (26Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the apoM-containing HDL is as heterogenous as the total HDL population in size, density, and protein composition (26Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although apoM is not present on all HDL particles, recent data have shown a positive association between apoM plasma levels and HDL-cholesterol concentrations in humans (27Axler O. Ahnstrom J. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1772-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This supports the possibility that apoM may play a role in HDL metabolism.To explore roles of apoM in HDL metabolism and atherosclerosis, we generated mice that constitutively lack apoM or overexpress human apoM. The data suggest that plasma apoM is mainly associated with α-HDL and that it affects their conversion into pre-α- and pre-β-HDL particles. Moreover, the data demonstrate that doubling the apoM concentration leads to reduced development of atherosclerosis. This may result from effects of apoM on the enzymatic modulation of plasma HDL, cholesterol efflux from foam cells, and/or an antioxidative effect of apoM-containing HDL.MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneration of Human ApoM-Tg Mice and ApoM Gene-targeted Mice—Human apoM-Tg mice were generated with a 6817-bp genomic DNA fragment spanning the human apoM coding sequences and 2844 bp 5′ to the transcription start site and 1729 bp 3′ to the poly(A) sequences. Upon breeding of hemizygous transgenic mice from both lines with WT mice, ∼50% of the offspring were transgenic. To create apoM–/– mice, we cloned an APOM targeting vector designed to delete 39 bp of the endogenous APOM sequences in exon 2 and insert a neomycin resistance-encoding cassette in the APOM locus. An APOM gene-targeting vector was cloned in embryonic stem cells that were subsequently used to make chimeric APOM-targeted mice. Genotyping was done with real time PCR using two sets of primers amplifying the intact APOM and the neomycin resistance-encoding cassette, respectively. Of 103 offspring from crosses of apoM+/– male and females, 26 (25%) were apoM–/–, 57 (55%) were apoM–/+, and 20 (19%) were apoM+/+. Breeding of apoM–/– male and females (n = 9 pairs) resulted in litters of 9.4 ± 0.4 pups. For a detailed description of molecular biology methods, please see the supplemental material.Animals—Mice were housed at the Panum Institute (University of Copenhagen) in a temperature-controlled facility with a 12-h dark/light cycle and fed standard chow (Altromin number 1314; Brogaarden) unless otherwise noted. Human apoM-transgenic mice were back-crossed for at least five generations with C57B6/J mice. All apoM-Tg mice studied were hemizygous and compared with littermate controls. Founder apoM+/– mice were back-crossed with C57B6/J background for two generations and intercrossed to obtain apoM–/– and WT apoM+/+ littermate controls.ApoM-TgN male mice (back-crossed five times with C57B6/J mice) were crossed with LDLR–/– female mice on the C57B6/J genetic background (Taconic Europe) to obtain apoM-TgN/LDLR–/– and littermate control LDLR–/– mice. Beginning at 4 weeks of age, mice started a cholic acid-free diet containing 0.3% cholesterol (D01061402; Brogaarden) (28Teupser D. Persky A.D. Breslow J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1907-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Atherosclerosis was assessed at 20 weeks of age.Blood samples were taken from the venous plexus in the orbital cavity into Na2EDTA- or heparin-containing tubes and kept on ice. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at –80 °C or –20 °C. To inhibit LCAT, 1.5 mm 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DNTB) (Sigma) was added to plasma immediately after the removal of blood cells. All procedures were approved by the Animal Experiments Inspectorate, Ministry of Justice, Denmark.mRNA Quantification—Tissue biopsies were placed in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) and examined on an RNA Nano LabChip (Agilent Technologies). First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real time PCR analysis with a Lightcycler was performed as described (29Bartels E.D. Lauritsen M. Nielsen L.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with primers for human APOM (h-apoM-51 and -31), mouse APOM (22Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and β-ACTIN (29Bartels E.D. Lauritsen M. Nielsen L.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or with the following primers (used to evaluate the mRNA expression of genes located in the same chromosomal region as APOM): BAT1 (5′-tctgtgctggtgatgtgtca-3′ and 5′-gtgggcagttcttcttcagc-3′), TNT (5′-gaactggcagaagaggcact-3′ and 5′-agggtctgggccatagaact-3′), LST1 (5′-tcctcctcctgcttgtcatc-3′ and 5′-cgatgcaggcatagtcagtg-3′), AIF1 (5′-agcttttggactgctgaagg-3′ and 5′-ctttctccagcattcgcttc-3′), BAT2 (5′-tggaagggcatcaaacctac-3′ and 5′-ggccatgatgaagtttggag-3′), BAT3 (5′-gagcccatggagtcagaaga-3′ and 5′-cgctgtaggaaaggctgaag-3′), and BAT4 (5′-ctggtggactcccttgatgt-3′ and 5′-gcaccacagtcctcacagaa-3′).Plasma Lipids—Lipids in plasma and size exclusion chromatography fractions were measured with enzymatic kits (CHOD-PAP from Roche Applied Science, GPO-Trinder from Sigma, phospholipids B R1/R1A from TriChem Aps, and free cholesterol C, COD-PAP, from Wako Chemicals).Quantification of ApoM, ApoA-I, and ApoE—Human apoM was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using two monoclonal anti-apoM antibodies (M58 and M42), as described (26Christoffersen C.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1772-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To evaluate the relative concentrations of apoM in human and mouse plasma, we performed Western blotting of mouse and human plasma (see below) with a rabbit antiserum (anti-h/m-apoM) that recognizes human and mouse apoM with similar efficacy; rabbits were immunized with an apoM peptide (LRTEGRPDMKT) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by m-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Cambridge Research Biochemicals). The peptide has 100% homology with both mouse and human apoM. Mouse apoA-I and apoE were quantitated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (30Siggins S. Jauhiainen M. Olkkonen V.M. Tenhunen J.

In addition, the d > 1.063 g/ml fraction was isolated from 50 μl of mouse plasma using 200-μl ultracentifugation tubes and a TLA 100 rotor at 100,000 rpm and 15 °C for 4 h. The densities were adjusted with NaBr. Purified VLDL/LDL and HDL were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm PBS with 0.1 g/liter Na2EDTA (PBS-EDTA) at 4 °C and stored at –20 °C. Human HDL3 (1.125 < d < 1.21 g/ml) was prepared as described (32Pussinen P.J. Malle E. Metso J. Sattler W. Raynes J.G. Jauhiainen M. Atherosclerosis. 2001; 155: 297-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Size exclusion chromatography of mouse plasma (200 μl) was performed at 20–24 °C using PBS-EDTA and Superose 6 and Superose 12 10/300 GL fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) columns (GE Healthcare). The flow rate was 0.2–0.4 ml/min. Fractions of ∼250 μl were collected and stored at –20 °C.For agarose gel electrophoresis, Litex agarose (0.8%) (Medinova) was dissolved in a Tris/barbital buffer (365 mmol/liter Tris and 123 mmol/liter barbital, pH 8.5) and cast on glass plates (0.23 ml/cm2). Plasma (2–4 μl) or HDL (9 μg of total protein in Tris/barbital buffer) was subjected to electrophoresis at 20 °C and 300 V until the dye front had migrated 5.5 cm. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) by semidry electroblotting. For protein staining, gels were fixed in 16:4:1 ethanol/H2O/ acetic acid for 45 min, stained for 20 min in Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and destained in 77:25:8 H2O/ethanol/acetic acid.For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, HDL was separated with 0.8% Litex agarose gels. After electrophoresis, the lipoprotein-containing portion of each lane was cut into eight consecutive 3-mm slices and placed in 40 μl of nondenaturing sample buffer for 12–16 h at 4 °C to elute proteins. The eluted proteins were separated with nondenaturing 4–20% Novex Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) followed by silver staining or were denatured and reduced before electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western blotting.Western blotting of SDS-polyacrylamide gels was done as described (26Christoffersen C.

Vermeulen P. Jauhiainen M. van Gent T. van den Berg P. Ehnholm S. Grosveld F. van der Kamp A. de Crom R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The first dimension electrophoresis was done in a native 1.0% agarose gel at 270 V until the dye front had migrated 4 cm. The agarose slip was cut from the gel and attached to a gel bond film with an anti-mouse apoA-I antiserum-containing agarose gel; the separated proteins and a control plasma sample (1 μl) were subjected to second dimension electrophoresis into the antiserum-containing gel (50 V for 16 h). After drying, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The areas of the pre-β- and α-HDL peaks were calculated as the width of the peak at 50% of the peak height multiplied by the peak height.Plasma Activity of LCAT, PLTP, and HL—Mouse plasma activities of LCAT, PLTP, and HL on exogenous substrates were measured using radiometric assays, as described (18Huuskonen J.

The heart with 2–3 mm of the aortic arch was immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT Compound (Sakura Finetek). Aortic cross-sections (10 μm) from the aortic valve area were cut with a Microm HM560 microtome (Brock & Michelsen). Series of 12 sections were collected on three slides with four sections on each slide and 30 μm between sections on a slide. Two consecutive slides from a series were stained with Oil Red O (O-0625; Sigma) to visualize neutral lipids; the third slide was stained with Picro Sirius red (Direct Red 80; Sigma) to visualize collagen. Stained areas were measured with a Leica imaging program IM50 (Leica Microsystems Imaging Solutions). Total en face plaque area fraction in the thoracic aorta (from the heart to the 6th rib) was measured as described (36Bro S. Bentzon J.F. Falk E. Andersen C.B. Olgaard K. Nielsen L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2466-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Subsequently, aortic lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol and quantified with a thin layer chromatography-based method (37Christoffersen C. Bollano E. Lindegaard M.L. Bartels E.D. Goetze J.P. Andersen C.B. Nielsen L.B. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).Oxidation of Lipoproteins—Lipoproteins were incubated with Cu2+, and oxidation was assessed from the formation of conjugated dienes as described (26Christoffersen C.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Cholesterol Efflux—Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from C57B6/J mice 5 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 3% BBL thioglycollate (BD Biosciences) and cultured in 24-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) in 0.5 ml of serum-free medium with 30 μg/ml cholesterol (C8667; Sigma) and 200,000 dpm/ml [3H]cholesterol ([1α,2α-3H]cholesterol; GE Healthcare) for 24 h. Foam cell formation was also induced by loading the cells with acetylated LDL, as previously described (26Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). After washing and equilibration in 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin-containing (Sigma) and serum-free medium for 24 h, the cells were incubated with total HDL (12.5 μg of protein/well) from WT, apoM-TgN, or apoM-TgH mice. [3H]Cholesterol in medium was measured after 0, 8, 16, and 24 h to assess cholesterol efflux (26Christoffersen C. Nielsen L.B. Axler O. Andersson A. Johnsen A.H. Dahlback B. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Statistics—Differences between groups were analyzed with t tests. Welch's correction for unequal variances was used whenever appropriate. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.RESULTSGenerating Human ApoM Transgenic and ApoM–/– Mice—Five human apoM transgenic (apoM-Tg) founders were generated by pronuclear injection of a ∼6.8-kb genomic fragment with the apoM-coding sequences and 2.8 kb of 5′ and 1.7 kb of 3′ sequences. A founder with ∼38 copies of the human APOM (apoM-TgH) and one with ∼22 copies (apoM-TgN), as determined by real time PCR, were bred for further investigations. The tissue-specific expression of human apoM mRNA in liver and kidney (supplemental Fig. 1A) was similar to that of the endogenous apoM gene (22Faber K. Axler O. Dahlback B. Nielsen L.B. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1272-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Overexpression of human apoM did not affect the expression of mouse apoM mRNA in either tissue (not shown). In apoM-TgH and apoM-TgN mice, human apoM was detectable in plasma (supplemental Fig. 1B) at ∼100 and ∼1000% of the concentration in pooled plasma from healthy blood donors (supplemental Fig. 1C). Western blot analyses with a rabbit antiserum against a common peptide epitope in human and mouse apoM showed that the average apoM concentration was similar in human and WT mouse plasma (not shown). Thus, the apoM-TgH and apoM-TgN lines have ∼11-fold and ∼2-fold more apoM than WT mice.ApoM–/– mice were generated with an APOM targeting vector (supplemental Fig. 2A). Homologous recombination of the vector with chromosomal DNA in embryonic stem cells was verified by Southern blotting with an external probe (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B) and long range PCR (supplemental Fig. 2, A and C). Southern blotting with an internal probe confirmed that the vector had integrated only in the APOM locus (not shown).In apoM+/– mice, plasma apoM concentrations were reduced by ∼42% (as judged from Western blots); apoM–/– mice had no detectable apoM in plasma (supplemental Fig. 2D). Accordingly, apoM mRNA could not be amplified from apoM–/– mouse liver cDNA with primers in exons 2 and 3 of APOM (supplemental Fig. 2E). In apoM–/– mice, hepatic mRNA expression of genes in the same chromosomal region as APOM (BAT1, TNF, LST, AIF3, BAT2, BAT3, and BAT4), measured with real time PCR, were 95 ± 8%, 79 ± 13%, 98 ± 25%, 122 ± 14%, 98 ± 8%, 88 ± 20%, and 99 ± 10% (n = 7), respectively, of the average level in apoM+/+ livers (n = 9).Plasma Lipids and Lipoproteins in ApoM-Tg and ApoM–/– Mice (supplemental Table 1)—In apoM-TgH mice, total plasma cholesterol was increased by 13% (p < 0.005) in males and 22% (p < 0.001) in females. Cholesterol levels were not affected in apoM-TgN mice but were 17% lower in male (p = 0.06) and 21% lower in female (p < 0.05) apoM–/– mice than in gendermatched apoM+/+ littermates. Free cholesterol constituted ∼20% of total plasma cholesterol in apoM-TgH, apoM-TgN, apoM–/–, and WT mice (not shown). Plasma triglycerides were increased by 25% in male (p < 0.05) and 41% in female (p < 0.05) apoM-TgH mice and decreased by 34% (p < 0.05) in female apoM–/– mice but were not affected in male apoM–/– or apoM-TgN mice. Plasma phospholipids were increased by 11% (p < 0.05) and 25% (p < 0.001) in apoM-TgH males and females but were unaffected in apoM–/– and apoM-TgN mice.The effect of apoM overexpression or deficiency on plasma lipoprotein size distribution was determined by size exclusion chromatography. The cholesterol and phospholipid elution profiles did not differ in apoM-TgH, apoM-TgN, and WT mice (Fig. 1A; not shown). Also, ApoM deficiency did not alter cholesterol or phospholipid elution profiles (Fig. 1B; not shown), and the size distribution of apoA-I-containing particles was similar in apoM–/– and control mice (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in apoM–/– mice generated from two independent embryonic stem cell lines. Mice lacking the hepatic transcription factor HNF-1α have almost no apoM (22Faber K. Axler O.

https://openalex.org/W2166702347,"In our continuing quest for knowledge, robots are powerful tools for accessing environments too dangerous or too remote for human exploration. Early systems functioned under close human supervision, effectively limited to executing preprogrammed tasks. However, as exploration moves to regions where communication is ineffective or unviable, robots will need to carry out complex tasks without human supervision. To enable such capabilities, robots are being enhanced by advances ranging from new sensor development to automated mission planning software, distributed robotic control, and more efficient power systems. As robotics technology becomes simultaneously more capable and economically viable, individual robots operated at large expense by teams of experts are increasingly supplemented by teams of robots used cooperatively under minimal human supervision."
https://openalex.org/W2009090535,"In the time between speciation and extinction, a species' ecological and biogeographic footprint—its occupancy—will vary in response to macroecological drivers and historical contingencies. Despite their importance for understanding macroecological processes, general patterns of long-term species occupancy remain largely unknown. We documented the occupancy histories of Cenozoic marine mollusks from New Zealand. For both genera and species, these show a distinct pattern of increase to relatively short-lived peak occupancy at mid-duration, followed by a decline toward extinction. Thus, species at greatest risk for extinction are those that have already been in decline for a substantial period of time. This pattern of protracted rise and fall stands in contrast to that of incumbency, insofar as species show no general tendency to stay near maximal occupancy once established."
https://openalex.org/W1968317950,"Memory processes are modulated by the biological clock, although the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that in the diurnal zebrafish both learning and memory formation of an operant conditioning paradigm occur better during the day than during the night. Melatonin treatment during the day mimics the nighttime suppression of memory formation. Training in constant light improves nighttime memory formation while reducing endogenous melatonin concentrations. Treatment with melatonin receptor antagonists at night dramatically improves memory. Pinealectomy also significantly improves nighttime memory formation. We adduce that melatonin is both sufficient and necessary for poor memory formation during the night."
https://openalex.org/W1979174978,"RecBCD is a DNA helicase comprising two motor subunits, RecB and RecD. Recognition of the recombination hotspot, chi, causes RecBCD to pause and reduce translocation speed. To understand this control of translocation, we used single-molecule visualization to compare RecBCD to the RecBCD(K177Q) mutant with a defective RecD motor. RecBCD(K177Q) paused at chi but did not change its translocation velocity. RecBCD(K177Q) translocated at the same rate as the wild-type post-chi enzyme, implicating RecB as the lead motor after chi. P1 nuclease treatment eliminated the wild-type enzyme's velocity changes, revealing a chi-containing ssDNA loop preceding chi recognition and showing that RecD is the faster motor before chi. We conclude that before chi, RecD is the lead motor but after chi, the slower RecB motor leads, implying a switch in motors at chi. We suggest that degradation of foreign DNA needs fast translocation, whereas DNA repair uses slower translocation to coordinate RecA loading onto ssDNA."

The longer α-neurexins function at both glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synapses in coupling to presynaptic calcium channels. Binding of α-neurexins to neuroligins was recently reported, but the role of the α-neurexins in synapse development has not been well studied. Here we report that in COS cell neuron coculture assays, all three α-neurexins induce clustering of the GABAergic postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin and neuroligin 2 but not of the glutamatergic postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 or neuroligin 1/3/4. α-Neurexins also induce clustering of the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit. This synapse promoting activity of α-neurexins is mediated by the sixth LNS (laminin neurexin sex hormone-binding protein) domain and negatively modulated by upstream sequences. Although inserts at splice site 4 (S4) in β-neurexins promote greater clustering activity for GABA than glutamate proteins in coculture assay, α-neurexin-specific sequences confer complete specificity for GABA proteins. We further report a developmental increase in the ratio of -S4 to +S4 forms of neurexins correlating with an increase in glutamate relative to GABA synaptogenesis and activity regulation of splicing at S4. Thus, +S4 β-neurexins and, even more selectively, α-neurexins may be mediators of GABAergic synaptic protein recruitment and stabilization. β-Neurexin and neuroligin cell adhesion molecules contribute to synapse development in the brain.

These coculture studies suggest that neurexins and neuroligins play some role in synapse development in vivo, perhaps in protein recruitment and stabilization of synaptic complexes. There are 4-5 neuroligins in mammals. Neuroligin 1 localizes primarily at glutamatergic synapses (8Song J.Y. Ichtchenko K. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, the absence of the splice site 4 (S4) insert in β-neurexins and presence of the B insert in neuroligin 1 selectively promotes function at glutamatergic synapses (12Boucard A.A.

Overexpression or knockdown of neuroligins in cultured neurons also affects synapse development, altering the function and ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses (22Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K.

Ross B. Naughton G. Berg D.K. Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). α-Neurexins terminate in the same LNS domain, transmembrane region, and intracellular region with PDZ domain binding site as β-neurexins but contain additionally five LNS domains and three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains organized into three modules. Analysis of triple knock-out mice for α-neurexin 1/2/3, leaving expression of the β-neurexins intact, revealed a surprising function in coupling presynaptic calcium channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis (27Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2003; 424: 939-948Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). α-Neurexins function in transmitter release linked to N- and P/Q-type calcium channels at central nervous system synapses, in calcium-triggered exocytosis of secretory granules in endocrine cells, and to a lesser degree contribute to efficient neuromuscular transmission (28Zhang W.

Intracellularly, α- and β-neurexins bind CASK, Mint, syntenin, and synaptotagmin (31Hata Y. Davletov B. Petrenko A.G. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C.

Extracellularly, α-neurexins presumably have unique binding partners to explain the calcium channel coupling phenotype that is not shared with β-neurexins. Known extracellular binding partners of α-neurexins include dystroglycan (35Sugita S. Saito F. Tang J. Satz J. Campbell K. Sudhof T.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and the secreted peptides neurexophilins (36Missler M. Hammer R.E. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34716-34723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), although the significance of these interactions is not well understood. Originally, it was reported that α-neurexins did not bind neuroligins (11Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B. Missler M. Moomaw C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), but while the current work was in progress it became clear that α-neurexins also bind some neuroligins (12Boucard A.A. Chubykin A.A. Comoletti D. Taylor P. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 2005; 48: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Neurexin-1α with or without the S4 insert binds to neuroligins 2 and 3 and the minor variant of neuroligin 1 lacking a B insert but not to the major variant of neuroligin 1 containing a B insert (Fig. 3 of Boucard et al. (12Boucard A.A. Chubykin A.A. Comoletti D. Taylor P. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 2005; 48: 229-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar)). Neurexin 1α lacking the S4 insert was also reported to induce clustering of gephyrin and neuroligin 2 but not PSD-95 when presented on COS cells to dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons (14Chih B. Gollan L. Scheiffele P. Neuron. 2006; 51: 171-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We set out here to characterize the activity of α-neurexins in COS cell neuron coculture assays; that is, to test the ability of α-neurexins to induce glutamatergic and/or GABAergic postsynaptic differentiation in comparison with β-neurexins. We further explore the structural basis for the difference in synapse-promoting activity of α-compared with β-neurexins and the regulated expression patterns of neurexins with an emphasis on regulation at the S4 splice site. Primary Neuronal Culture and COS Cell Coculture—Dissociated primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) rats as previously described (37Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar, 38Kaech S. Banker G. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were dissociated by trypsinization and trituration. Dissociated neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 300,000 cells/dish and cocultured over a monolayer of glia. After 2 days, cytosine arabinoside (5 μm) was added to neuron cultures to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Cultures were maintained in serum-free minimal essential medium with N2 supplements, 0.1% ovalbumin, and 1 mm pyruvate, with replacing ⅓ of the media per dish once per week. Neurons were treated with 100 μm 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV, Research Biochemicals) beginning on day 7. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The flat shape of COS cells was preferred for coculture compared with the rounder shape of HEK cells preferred for confocal analysis of surface association. Transfected COS cells were trypsinized 24 h after transfection, washed, and plated at 200,000 cells/dish onto neurons pre-grown for 8-12 days in vitro (DIV). After 24 h of coculture, cells were fixed for 15 min in warm phosphate-buffered saline with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. For experiments involving immunocytochemistry for neuroligins in the cocultures, cells were fixed in -20 °C methanol for 10 min. Construction of Expression Vectors—Neurexin-1β-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (+S4) was described previously (13Graf E.R. Kang Y. Hauner A.M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4256-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To generate neurexin-1α-CFP, the N-terminal portion of rat neurexin 1α was cloned by RT-PCR and joined with the C-terminal portion of the mouse cDNA (BC047146; Open Biosystems) at the internal BstEII site and inserted in-frame into the pECFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Neurexin 2α (AK129239) and neurexin 3α (BC060719) were first corrected for apparent errors and then cloned into pECFP-N1. For neurexin 2α, the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to restore CAG in place of a premature TAG at residue 1301. For neurexin 3α, the splice site 1 insert consisting of an apparent duplication of exons 2 and 3 was removed by an overlap PCR method. To generate neurexin 2β′ and 3β′, the LNS domain of neurexin 1β (residues 84-261) was replaced with the equivalent residues of LNS6 of neurexin 2α or 3α, altering the junctional amino acids GT to EF and amino acids EV to ST to facilitate cloning. Neurexin 1αBC contained a deletion of residues 31-473, and neurexin 1αC contained a deletion of residues 31-899 (numbering according to (39Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1992; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), each with the addition of an extra LV at the junction. All neurexin variants used in this paper have the insert at the splice site 4 position. Immunocytochemistry and Imaging—Fixed neuron/COS cell cocultures were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumen (30 min; 37 °C) and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumen (overnight; room temperature) and then with secondary antibodies (45 min; 37 °C). Coverslips were mounted in elvanol (Tris-HCl, glycerol, and polyvinyl alcohol with 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane). For Figs. 1 and 2, cocultures were stained with anti-gephyrin (mAb7a, IgG1, 1:500; Synaptic Systems), anti-PSD-95 (6G6-1C9, IgG2a, 1:500; Affinity Bioreagents), and anti-synapsin (rabbit, 1:1000; Chemicon) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488, Alexa 568, and Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes), respectively. For Fig. 4, cocultures were labeled for neuroligin-1/3/4 (4F9, IgG2a, 1:1000; Synaptic Systems) or neuroligin-2 (Graf et al. (13Graf E.R. Kang Y. Hauner A.M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4256-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), rabbit, 1:400) in the Alexa 568 channel and anti-synapsin (46.1, IgG1, 1:100; Synaptic Systems) in the Alexa 647 channel. For Fig. 5, cocultures were labeled for GABAA receptor γ2 (rabbit; 1:200; Alomone) in the Alexa 568 channel and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 (GAD6, IgG2A, 1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) in the Alexa 488 channel. For Fig. 6, cocultures were labeled for neuroligin-2, gephyrin, or PSD-95 in the Alexa 568 channel and anti-synapsin in the Alexa 488 channel. For supplemental Fig. S3, cocultures were incubated live with anti-GABAR α2 (kind gift of J. M. Fritschy (40Brunig I. Scotti E. Sidler C. Fritschy J.M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 443: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)) or γ2 antibodies for 30 min in the neuronal medium plus 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at room temperature, washed extensively, fixed, permeabilized, and then incubated with anti-synapsin followed by secondary antibodies. Fluorescence and phase contrast images were captured with a Photometrics Sensys-cooled CCD camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with a 63× 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective using MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Devices) and customized filter sets. Controls lacking specific antibodies confirmed no detectable bleed-through between channels CFP, Alexa 488 (imaged through a yellow fluorescent protein filter set), Alexa 568, and Alexa 647. Images were acquired as grey scale from individual channels, and pseudo-color overlays prepared using Adobe Photoshop software. For quantification, sets of cells were cocultured and stained simultaneously. Images of transfected COS cells showing extensive contact with dendrites were taken in all fluorescence channels using the same exposure time for all constructs. For supplemental Fig. S4, optical sections were captured on an Olympus Fluoview FV500 confocal on a BX61W microscope with a 60× 1.4 numerical aperture oil objective, 442-nm laser, and customized filter set.FIGURE 2β-Neurexins induce clustering of the inhibitory synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin and the excitatory synaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95. COS cells expressing the neurexin variants tagged intracellularly with CFP were overlaid on hippocampal neurons pre-grown for 8-10 days in culture. After 1 day of coculture, cells were fixed and immunolabeled for PSD-95, gephyrin, and synapsin; full field overlays are shown of PSD-95 (green) plus synapsin (blue) or gephyrin (red) plus synapsin (blue). Endogenous inter-neuronal synapses have apposed clusters of postsynaptic PSD-95 or gephyrin and presynaptic synapsin; thus, clusters appear turquoise or purple, respectively, in the color overlays (arrows). In contrast, clusters of PSD-95 or gephyrin lacking associated synapsin appear green or red, respectively, in the color overlays and were induced by all β-neurexins (arrowheads). By alignment with the phase contrast images, induced clusters of PSD-95 and gephyrin can be seen corresponding to sites of neuronal process contact with the neurexin-expressing COS cells and were frequently but not always localized near the edges of transfected COS cells, presumably where the COS cells come into closest contact with the neighboring neurons. Although the induced clusters of gephyrin and PSD-95 appear to overlap at low resolution, at higher resolution they usually resolve into separate clusters side by side (enlarged regions at the bottom of triple overlay of PSD-95 (green), gephyrin (red), and synapsin (blue)). All neurexin constructs used in this paper contain the splice site 4 insert.

After 1 day of coculture, cells were fixed and immunolabeled for neuroligin 1/3/4 (with an antibody that recognizes all three) or neuroligin 2 (red) and synapsin (green).

In contrast, the endogenous synaptic clusters of GABARγ2 at axon-dendrite contacts are associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase-positive GABAergic input (yellow).

A, neurexin 1β, 1α, and derivatives of 1α mutated in a predicted calcium binding residue in LNS6 (1αD1176A), lacking module A (1αBC), or lacking modules A and B (1αC) were tagged intracellularly with CFP (blue) and tested for postsynaptic protein clustering activity in the COS cell-neuron coculture assay. Activity was considered positive if the contacting dendrites exhibited any clusters of PSD-95, gephyrin, or neuroligin 2 (red) lacking synapsin (green). Neurexin 1αD1176A had no detectable clustering activity. For PSD-95, all neurexin-1α derivatives also had no detectable clustering activity; PSD-95 clustering was only observed in response to neurexin 1β (compare these images with Figs. 1, 2, and 4). For gephyrin and neuroligin 2, the clustering activity of neurexin 1αBC was indistinguishable from that of 1α. In contrast, the clustering activity of neurexin 1αC was higher than that of 1α and intermediate between that of 1α and 1β. Scale bar, 10 μm.

There is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. Here we show the intrinsic RdRP activity of Pol II with only pure polymerase, an RNA template-product scaffold and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Crystallography reveals the template-product duplex in the site occupied by the DNA-RNA hybrid during transcription. RdRP activity resides at the active site used during transcription, but it is slower and less processive than DNA-dependent activity. RdRP activity is also obtained with part of the HDV antigenome. The complex of transcription factor IIS (TFIIS) with Pol II can cleave one HDV strand, create a reactive stem-loop in the hybrid site, and extend the new RNA 3' end. Short RNA stem-loops with a 5' extension suffice for activity, but their growth to a critical length apparently impairs processivity. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2056108859,"Converging evidence indicates that aberrant aggregation of mutant Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (mutSOD1) is strongly implicated in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). MutSOD1 forms high molecular weight oligomers, which disappear under reducing conditions, both in neural tissues of FALS transgenic mice and in transfected cultured cells, indicating a role for aberrant intermolecular disulfide cross-linking in the oligomerization and aggregation process. To study the contribution of specific cysteines in the mechanism of aggregation, we mutated human SOD1 in each of its four cysteine residues and, using a cell transfection assay, analyzed the solubility and aggregation of those SOD1s. Our results suggest that the formation of mutSOD1 aggregates are the consequence of covalent disulfide cross-linking and non-covalent interactions. In particular, we found that the removal of Cys-111 strongly reduces the ability of a range of different FALS-associated mutSOD1s to form aggregates and impair cell viability in cultured NSC-34 cells. Moreover, the removal of Cys-111 impairs the ability of mutSOD1s to form disulfide cross-linking. Treatments that deplete the cellular pool of GSH exacerbate mutSOD1s insolubility, whereas an overload of intracellular GSH or overexpression of glutaredoxin-1, which specifically catalyzes the reduction of protein-SSG-mixed disulfides, significantly rescues mutSOD1s solubility. These data are consistent with the view that the redox environment influences the oligomerization/aggregation pathway of mutSOD1 and point to Cys-111 as a key mediator of this process."

The development of the intron-exon structure of eukaryotic genes permitted the expansion of the coding capacity of genomes during evolution. A key property was the ability to splice pre-mRNA transcripts in various ways (Kim et al., 2004Kim H. Klein R. Majewski J. Ott J.

The minor spliceosome shares most proteins with its major counterpart (Will et al., 1999Will C.L. Schneider C. Reed R. Luhrmann R.

Moreover, it shows a considerably lower rate of splicing (Patel et al., 2002Patel A.A. McCarthy M. Steitz J.A.

In addition to the common U5 snRNA, the minor spliceosome contains distinct snRNAs (U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac), which functionally correspond to the U1, U2, U4, and U6 snRNAs of the classical major spliceosome (Patel and Steitz, 2003Patel A.A.

Flies homozygous for insertions in the U12 and U6atac snRNA genes die during embryonic and third instar larval stages, respectively (Otake et al., 2002Otake L.R. Scamborova P. Hashimoto C.

The causes of the lethal phenotypes, however, have not been identified. Minor-class introns seem to be most prevalent in humans and other vertebrates, here representing 0.15%–0.34% of all introns (Burge et al., 1998Burge C.B. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A.

Among the groups for which full sequence information is available, such introns and minor spliceosomal components were not found in yeast (Burge et al., 1998Burge C.B. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A.

The functional relevance of two parallel splicing systems and how they could have evolved remain basic, unanswered questions. Given that minor-class introns can be converted to major-class ones during evolution (Burge et al., 1998Burge C.B. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A. Evolutionary fates and origins of U12-type introns.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the marked evolutionary conservation of a small proportion of minor-class introns suggests that the minor splicing system is associated with unique properties, underlying its function in higher eukaryotes. To shed light on these putative properties, we analyzed the function of the minor splicing machinery in zebrafish development and in mammalian cells. Our findings indicate the surprising cytoplasmic segregation of the minor splicing system and an essential role for this system in cell proliferation of vertebrates. The decoupling from the classic nuclear splicing compartment seems associated with the escape of the system from mitotic downregulation. It may thus link minor splicing to the cell-division cycle. Accompanied by such new properties, the cytoplasmic segregation may also account for the amazing evolutionary conservation of this low-abundant, parallel splicing system. To explore whether the two splicing machineries could be differentially distributed on the organismal level in vertebrates, we initially analyzed the expression of their component snRNAs in various zebrafish tissues and developmental stages. We performed in situ hybridization experiments on whole-mount embryos as well as on sagittal sections of adult zebrafish. To be able to detect the very low-abundant minor-class snRNAs, we employed locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified DNA-oligonucleotide probes, which show a high thermal stability and hybridization affinity, allowing the sensitive and specific detection of small RNAs (Kloosterman et al., 2006Kloosterman W.P. Wienholds E. de Bruijn E. Kauppinen S. Plasterk R.H. In situ detection of miRNAs in animal embryos using LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, Wienholds et al., 2005Wienholds E. Kloosterman W.P. Miska E. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Berezikov E. de Bruijn E. Horvitz H.R. Kauppinen S. Plasterk R.H. MicroRNA expression in zebrafish embryonic development.Science. 2005; 309: 310-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). We could not detect differences in tissue distribution between the major (U2 and U5) and the minor spliceosomal snRNAs (U12, U6atac, and U5) examined (data not shown). To our surprise, however, there was a striking difference in the subcellular localization of the snRNA species. As expected from previous reports on the localization of major spliceosomal snRNAs in human cell lines (Carmo-Fonseca et al., 1991Carmo-Fonseca M. Tollervey D. Pepperkok R. Barabino S.M. Merdes A. Brunner C. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Hurt E. Lamond A.I. Mammalian nuclei contain foci which are highly enriched in components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Huang and Spector, 1992Huang S. Spector D.L. U1 and U2 small nuclear RNAs are present in nuclear speckles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a probe for U2 snRNA resulted in strong nuclear staining in sections of different zebrafish tissues (Figure 1A). In contrast, the probes for the minor-class snRNAs U12 and U6atac showed marked perinuclear and cytoplasmic staining, and no or very weak nuclear staining, in all tissues analyzed (Figure 1A). The introduction of mismatches into the LNA probes served as a control and resulted in a marked reduction in the staining (see Figure 1A, right panels), indicating specific hybridization of the snRNA probes. The differences in localization patterns of major- and minor-class snRNAs were also observed in whole-mount zebrafish embryos at very early stage (sphere stage, 3.5–4 hr post fertilization, hpf), and at 24 hpf in all tissues examined (data not shown, and Figure 1B). Thus, the results in zebrafish embryos and adults indicate that the predominantly extranuclear localization pattern is a general feature of the minor-class snRNAs. To test whether the difference in subcellular localization of snRNAs is also evident in mammalian cells, we performed in situ hybridization experiments in primary human fibroblasts and in murine NIH 3T3 cells followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown for NIH 3T3 cells in Figure 1C, we could detect nucleoplasmic staining for the major-class U2 snRNA (with somewhat brighter staining in a few foci), as confirmed by the merge with the DRAQ5 DNA counterstaining. The probes for the minor-spliceosome-specific U12 and U6atac snRNAs showed an extremely low nucleoplasmic signal but clear staining around the nucleoplasm and in the cytoplasm (Figure 1C; this staining pattern was present in all cells). In contrast, hybridization signals of mismatch-containing probes were barely detectable (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). U5 snRNA, which is common to both spliceosomes, showed both nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic staining (Figure 1C). Thus, we conclude that the distinct snRNA staining patterns reflect a difference in the localization of major and minor spliceosomes or spliceosome assembly stages. Consistently, we also observed a difference in subcellular snRNA localization upon nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of the cells. We encountered the vast majority of U2 snRNA in the nuclear fraction, while U6atac snRNA was similarly abundant in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Figure 1D, lanes 1 and 2). The higher proportion of nuclear U6atac snRNA compared with that predicted by the in situ studies is likely to be explained by its association with outer nuclear/perinuclear structures, which would copurify with the “nuclear” fraction. The U2 snRNA distribution and the fact that cytoplasmic snRNA levels did not increase with longer times of membrane lysis (lanes 3–6) suggest that the high U6atac snRNA levels in the cytoplasm are not caused by nuclear leakage. Thus, both the in situ hybridization and cell-fractionation experiments point to a distinct subcellular localization of snRNAs specific for the two splicing systems. Minor snRNAs appear to be enriched in the cytoplasm, whereas their major-class counterparts are mainly nucleoplasmic. Does the distinct snRNA localization pattern reflect a subcellular separation of the two splicing systems? If minor-class splicing were to occur mainly outside the nucleus, one would have to postulate that transcripts containing unspliced (mostly single) minor-class introns can leave the nucleus. Furthermore, inhibition of minor-class splicing should result in accumulation of such transcripts in the cytoplasm. We tested nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of NIH 3T3 cells for transcripts of the nucleolar proliferation-associated antigen P120 (Hall and Padgett, 1996Hall S.L. Padgett R.A. Requirement of U12 snRNA for in vivo splicing of a minor class of eukaryotic nuclear pre-mRNA introns.Science. 1996; 271: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) for the presence of one of its major-class introns (intron G) or for the single minor-class intron (intron F). We detected only a minor proportion of RNA containing the major-class intron G in the nuclear fraction by RT-PCR (Figure 2A, lower panel, lanes 1, 3, and 5), consistent with rapid major-class splicing (Patel et al., 2002Patel A.A. McCarthy M. Steitz J.A. The splicing of U12-type introns can be a rate-limiting step in gene expression.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3804-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in the nucleus. No such transcripts were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction (lanes 2, 4, and 6), suggesting that no intron G-containing RNA reached the cytoplasm. In contrast, and as expected by the lack of nuclear splicing and/or the lower rate of minor splicing (Patel et al., 2002Patel A.A. McCarthy M. Steitz J.A. The splicing of U12-type introns can be a rate-limiting step in gene expression.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3804-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Pessa et al., 2006Pessa H.K. Ruokolainen A. Frilander M.J. The abundance of the spliceosomal snRNPs is not limiting the splicing of U12-type introns.RNA. 2006; 12: 1883-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the proportion of transcripts containing the minor-class intron F was much higher in the nuclear fraction, indeed equivalent to the levels of spliced RNA (Figure 2A, upper panel, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Given the likely presence of material derived from outer nuclear structures in the nuclear fractions (see U6atac data, Figures 1C and 1D), spliced RNA may be overrepresented therein. Most importantly, RNA containing the minor-class intron F was detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 2A, upper panel, lanes 2, 4, and 6). This seems not to be caused by nuclear leakage during cell fractionation, since major-intron containing RNA is not detectable, even at higher amplification levels (Figure 2A, lower panel, lanes 9 and 10). Furthermore, selective inhibition of minor-class splicing resulted in accumulation of partially spliced transcripts containing minor-class introns in the cytoplasmic fraction, as shown for several genes in Figure 2B (compare lanes 4 and 6). Suppression of minor splicing was achieved by interfering with the function of U6atac snRNA upon transfection of an antisense-morpholino oligomer into the cells (Matter and Konig, 2005Matter N. Konig H. Targeted ‘knockdown’ of spliceosome function in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This approach inhibits removal of the single minor-class (U12-type) intron, leaving splicing of major-class (U2-type) introns (only one is shown) unaffected (Figure 2B). Taken together, these findings suggest that transcripts with single unspliced minor-class introns reach high steady-state levels in the nucleus and are exported to the cytoplasm. To test more directly whether minor-class splicing could occur outside the nucleus in vivo, we wished to restrain an inhibiting U6atac morpholino oligomer in the cytoplasm. Because the concentration of morpholinos usually appears to be higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (Summerton, 1999Summerton J. Morpholino antisense oligomers: the case for an RNase H-independent structural type.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), we conjugated the U6atac morpholino to a nuclear-export-sequence (NES) peptide from the HIV Rev protein. The NES peptide has previously been shown to successfully export oligodeoxynucleotides to the cytoplasm (Meunier et al., 1999Meunier L. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. The nuclear export signal-dependent localization of oligonucleopeptides enhances the inhibition of the protein expression from a gene transcribed in cytosol.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2730-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We initially demonstrated that the NES peptide can localize the morpholino conjugate to the cytoplasm in living NIH 3T3 cells, whereas the same morpholino conjugated to a mutant, nonactive NES peptide appears to be enriched in the nucleus (Figure 2C). Proper cytoplasmic localization required transfection of low conjugate concentrations to avoid overloading of the nuclear export system (data not shown; Meunier et al., 1999Meunier L. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. The nuclear export signal-dependent localization of oligonucleopeptides enhances the inhibition of the protein expression from a gene transcribed in cytosol.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2730-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, we wished to monitor inhibition of splicing after short time periods (2–4 hr), thus minimizing peptide degradation (Nelson et al., 2005Nelson M.H. Stein D.A. Kroeker A.D. Hatlevig S.A. Iversen P.L. Moulton H.M. Arginine-rich peptide conjugation to morpholino oligomers: effects on antisense activity and specificity.Bioconjug. Chem. 2005; 16: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To be able to monitor changes in minor-class splicing under these conditions, we employed real-time quantitative RT-PCR. If the minor splicing system were to act in the cytoplasm, one should expect splicing inhibition by the cytoplasmic NES-morpholino conjugate. Furthermore, the inhibition could be even more effective than that of the mutant conjugate, which may inhibit splicing only by binding to the newly synthesized U6atac snRNA in the nucleus (before it is exported) and/or by its small cytoplasmic fraction. At a concentration resulting in mainly cytoplasmic localization, the NES-morpholino conjugate (NES) interfered with intron F splicing from endogenous P120 pre-mRNA (Figure 2D; see the increase in the proportion of unspliced RNA). Furthermore, it did so more efficiently as compared to the mutated conjugate (mNES, Figure 2D), enriched in the nucleus (compare Figure 2C). Similar results were obtained for splicing from a transfected P120 minigene construct (data not shown). These data indicate a function for U6atac snRNA in minor-class splicing in the cytoplasm and suggest the physical separation of the minor splicing system from the nuclear major one in vivo. We reasoned that the cytoplasmic segregation of the minor system could result in its uncoupling from nuclear processes, like transcription (Maniatis and Reed, 2002Maniatis T. Reed R. An extensive network of coupling among gene expression machines.Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), and that the system might be functional during mitosis (M) phase of the cell-division cycle when the nucleus undergoes reorganization. In vitro splicing reactions with extracts from mitotic cells suggested inhibition of major-class splicing when cells are arrested in mitosis by nocodazole treatment (Shin and Manley, 2002Shin C.

Whether such inhibition occurs in vivo has, however, not been reported. To test for potential differences between the two splicing systems under these conditions, we transfected an in vitro-synthesized human P120 transcript (see scheme in Figure 3A) into mouse NIH 3T3 cells arrested in mitosis (Figure 3B). We could not detect splicing of the major-class introns (introns E and G) from the transfected transcript (Figure 3C, lanes 2–4). In contrast, correct excision of the minor-class intron (intron F) was readily detectable (Figure 3C, upper panel, lanes 2–4) and was verified by sequencing. The relatively low proportion of spliced RNA is likely related to the fact that the low-abundant minor-spliceosome components are saturated by high levels of exogenous RNA (Pessa et al., 2006Pessa H.K. Ruokolainen A. Frilander M.J. The abundance of the spliceosomal snRNPs is not limiting the splicing of U12-type introns.RNA. 2006; 12: 1883-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We wished to test whether this result reflects a differential activity of the two systems in mitotic cells or a difference in their ability for posttranscriptional splicing. Therefore, we also transfected the pre-mRNA substrate into asynchronously growing (cycling) cells. We could detect splicing of the minor-class intron, but no major-class splicing (Figure S2). However, the transfection resulted in cytoplasmic localization of the pre-mRNA (Figure S2). Thus, this result may be attributed to the cytoplasmic localization of the pre-mRNA rather than the inability of the major spliceosome to splice already synthesized pre-mRNA. Therefore, we analyzed major and minor class splicing of endogenous P120 pre-mRNA by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in cycling cells and in cells arrested in M phase (see Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3D, the percentage in the mitotic cells of P120 transcripts with unspliced major-class introns G and E was increased up to 2-fold when compared to cycling cells, pointing to mitotic downregulation of major splicing. In contrast, we found the proportion of mRNA containing the minor-class intron F almost unchanged (Figure 3D). Taken together, the results of the different approaches support the notion that the minor splicing system can function independently of transcription and can evade mitotic downregulation. To address the function of the vertebrate minor-class splicing system at the organismal level, we developed a strategy to selectively suppress the two spliceosomes in developing zebrafish embryos. It is based on the morpholino-mediated approach that we previously developed in mammalian cell lines (Matter and Konig, 2005Matter N. Konig H. Targeted ‘knockdown’ of spliceosome function in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; see also Figure 2B). To target zebrafish minor-class snRNAs and to check the success of the strategy, we identified the zebrafish U12 and U6atac snRNA-encoding sequences by BLAST search (Figure S3). Furthermore, we screened for putative U12-type introns in zebrafish genes. In humans, they were predicted to often occur in larger gene families and seem to be overrepresented in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Levine and Durbin, 2001Levine A. Durbin R. A computational scan for U12-dependent introns in the human genome sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4006-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In all the zebrafish orthologs of human genes with a predicted U12-type intron (Levine and Durbin, 2001Levine A. Durbin R. A computational scan for U12-dependent introns in the human genome sequence.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4006-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) we examined, we found putative U12-type introns at homologous positions (Figure S3). The low number of genes with putative U12-type introns in humans led us to hypothesize that by blocking the minor spliceosome we could detect specific cellular and developmental processes dependent on minor-class splicing. To test this hypothesis, we first injected fertilized zebrafish eggs with a morpholino sequence masking the branch-point recognition sequence of U2 snRNA (Matter and Konig, 2005Matter N. Konig H. Targeted ‘knockdown’ of spliceosome function in mammalian cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that should inhibit removal of major-class introns. Owing to the poor conservation of U2-type branch points (Zhuang and Weiner, 1989Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M. A compensatory base change in human U2 snRNA can suppress a branch site mutation.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1545-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the efficiency of inhibition should, however, vary from intron to intron. The morpholino oligomer interfered with the splicing of U2-type introns of several genes in a dose-dependent manner, to varying degrees (Figure 4A, lanes 1–3, see different ratios of unspliced and spliced RNAs represented by upper and lower bands, respectively). A nonspecific control morpholino sequence (lane 4) and a U12 snRNA-specific morpholino (lane 5), injected at a concentration that blocks U12-type splicing (see Figure 4A, bottom panel), had no effect, suggesting selective interference with major-class splicing. The interference with U2-type splicing resulted in a developmental arrest as soon as 4.5 hpf, i.e., before gastrulation. Epiboly, the cell movement process whereby the blastoderm grows over the yolk cell and completely surrounds it by 9 hpf (Kimmel et al., 1995Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Stages of embryonic development of the zebrafish.Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8115) Google Scholar), was completely blocked in injected embryos (Figures 4C and 4E). This phenotype is very similar to that obtained by inhibition of transcription (Muller et al., 2001Muller F. Lakatos L. Dantonel J. Strahle U. Tora L. TBP is not universally required for zygotic RNA polymerase II transcription in zebrafish.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 282-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and can be explained by the need for zygotic transcription, and thus splicing, at this early time point. For suppressing U12-type splicing, we injected a morpholino oligomer complementary to the branch-point recognition element of the minor-class U12 snRNA (Matter and Konig, 2005Matter N. Konig H.

These brain-based devices (BBDs) contain simulated brains that autonomously categorize signals from the environment without a priori instruction.

Darwin X puts together the “what,”“when,” and “where” from cues in the environment into an episodic memory that allows it to find a desired target. Although these BBDs are designed to provide insights into how the brain works, their principles may find uses in building hybrid machines.

The ability to sense small molecules is key for every life form and provides information about the extracellular milieu, monitors intracellular physiological status, or establishes cell-cell communication.

Chem. 2003; 10: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). sGC is comprised of an α and β subunit with the α1/β1 isoform being the most ubiquitous (3Koesling D. Russwurm M. Mergia E. Mullershausen F. Friebe A. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 45: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The H-NOXA domain is a central subdomain in both subunits: in sGCβ1, it is flanked by the N-terminal H-NOX domain and C-terminal predicted coiled-coil (CC) (9Shiga T. Suzuki N. Zoolog. Sci. 2005; 22: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Anantharaman V. Balaji S. Aravind L. Biol. Direct. 2006; 1: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and catalytic guanylyl cyclase (GC) domain (Fig. 1A). sGCα1 has a similar subunit arrangement except that its N-terminal domain does not bind heme. As in sGCα1 and sGCβ1, the H-NOXA domains in STHK and 2-CHSR are followed by a CC domain further strengthening their evolutionary connection (1Iyer L.M. Anantharaman V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Structural information on sGC is limited and comes mostly from the structures of the homologous adenylyl cyclase catalytic domain (11Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Even less is structurally known about the H-NOXA/CC region except that it was found to contain two distinct regions key for dimerization: one comprises H-NOXA β1 residues 204-244, and the second contains CC residues 379-408 with the intervening sequences postulated to contribute to a functional binding region (17Zhou Z.

Analogous regions in sGCα1 have also been shown to be important for sGC activity via deletion studies (9Shiga T. Suzuki N. Zoolog. Sci. 2005; 22: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These regions in sGCα1 and sGCβ1 have recently been further narrowed down (18Rothkegel C. Schmidt P.M. Atkins D.J. Hoffmann L.S. Schmidt H.H. Schroder H. Stasch J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The α1 and β1 H-NOXA domains are 38% sequence identical and also share ∼35% sequence identity with the H-NOXA domains in the STHK from Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (NpSTHK) and the 2-CHSR from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Fig. 1B). Unlike the sGC subunits, the H-NOXA domain of the STHK was amendable to crystallographic analysis. We describe here the 2.1-Å crystal structure of the dimerized H-NOXA domain of NpSTHK revealing a PAS fold, a fold commonly found in sensory signaling proteins. We carried out additional structure-function studies in sGC and find that the H-NOXA subdomains of sGC could likely form a similarly arranged PAS-type heterodimer with an important role for functional sGC heterodimerization by the H-NOXA domains. Cloning of the H-NOXA Domain of NpSTHK—The genomic DNA of N. punctiforme PCC 73102 was used as the template to PCR the 1-121 H-NOXA fragment of STHK Npun02000820 using the forward primer, 5′-ggaattccatatggctcctcctcaccttacg-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ccggaattctcatttgagtttgatacccaaaggagc-3′. To obtain the 8-121 (Δ7) H-NOXA construct, the 5′-ggaattccatatgctttcaccagagttactggcga-3′ forward primer was used. The PCR-amplified fragments were inserted into a pET28a (Novagen) expression vector. Expression and Purification of NpSTHK H-NOXA Domains—Both the 1-121 and truncated Δ7 H-NOXA domains were expressed as N-terminal His-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) Star cells (Invitrogen) using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction. The cells were pelleted and sonicated for 5 min on ice in the following buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) beads. The beads were washed with the washing buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole. The protein was released from the beads by thrombin (Enzyme Research labs) digestion. Further purification was performed by gel filtration in a Sephadex-75 (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Subcloning, Expression, and Purification of the H-NOXA Domain of sGCβ1—Residues 202-344 of the H-NOXA domain of rat sGCβ1 were subcloned into pET22b using the forward primer, 5′-ggaaattccatatgggtacccaggactcccgtatc-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-gcgaattctcagtggtggtggtggtggtgtccagggatgtcactcaggtacag-3′. The C-terminal His-tagged sGCβ1 H-NOXA protein was expressed and purified similarly to the homologous NpSTHK counterpart except that the protein was eluted from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads by an imidazole gradient instead of thrombin digestion. The Ala-scanning mutants of the sGCβ1 H-NOXA domain were introduced into pET22b plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene) to confirm the sequence. Mutagenesis of Rat sGC and Transfection in COS-7 Cells—Templates were cDNAs encoding the α1 and β1 subunits of rat sGC cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 (19Yuen P.S. Doolittle L.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 791-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations described in the text were introduced by PCR (QuikChange, Stratagene) and sequenced. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells were transfected for 48 h with Superfect reagent using the protocol of the supplier (Qiagen). Cytosol Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped off the plate in cold lysis buffer: phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Cells were broken by sonication (3 pulses of 3 s) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the soluble fraction (referred to as cytosol in the text). To determine the efficiency of transfection for wt sGC or mutants in COS-7 cells, 15 μg of cytosol was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-sGC (anti-α1 subunit and anti-β1 subunit; Cayman Chemicals). sGC Activity Assay—GC activity was determined by formation of [α-32P]cGMP from [α-32P]GTP, as previously described (20Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed for 5 min at 33 °C in a final volume of 100 μl, in a 50 mm HEPES pH 8.0 reaction buffer containing 500 μm GTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2. Typically, 40 μg of COS-7 cytosol transfected with either wt or mutants were used in each assay reaction. All assays were done in duplicate and each experiment repeated twice. Enzymatic activity was stimulated with the NO-donor SNAP (Calbiochem) at 100 μm. sGC activity is expressed in pmol min-1 mg-1 and mean ± S.E. NpSTHK Crystallization—Crystals of the NpSTHK-(8-121) protein construct were grown at 4 °C by sitting-drop vapor diffusion. Protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution: 1.7-1.9 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7-9.0. Crystals were prepared for data collection by fast transfer into cryoprotectant solution containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm Tris-HCl with 15% glycerol. The 1-121 NpSTHK protein was concentrated to 15 mg/ml after the gel-filtration step and mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1.5 m lithium sulfate monohydrate. Crystals appeared after 3 days at 20 °C. For data collection, the crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant containing 25% glycerol in addition to the crystallization solution and dunked into liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Crystals of selenomethionine substituted 8-121 protein were used for single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing. NpSTHK Structure Determination and Refinement—Due to great difficulty in obtaining diffraction quality crystals for the 1-121 NpSTHK construct, the initial structure determination was carried out using crystals of the shorter 8-121 construct. A native 2.0-Å resolution dataset for the 8-121 NpSTHK protein was collected at ALS (Beamline 4.2.2) and processed with D*trek (21Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P6122, with cell dimensions a = b = 72.3 Å, c = 169.1 Å and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. To obtain crystallographic phase information, a SeMet crystal of the 8-121 NpSTHK construct was used for SAD phasing. A 2.6-Å SAD data set was collected at the selenium peak wavelength at ALS. SOLVE/RESOLVE (22Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used for phasing and automatic model building. Manual model building was carried out in Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) was used for refinement. The final model includes NpSTHK residues 8-113 of molecule A and residues 10-119 of molecule B and 95 waters and 2 sulfate ions. The final model yielded an R/Rfree of 23.9/27.8%. For 1-121 H-NOXA, a native 2.1-Å resolution data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Beamline 19ID) belonging to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 95.2 Å, b = 44.4 Å, c = 59.7 Å and 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure of this larger construct was determined via Molecular Replacement using PHASER (25McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) using one of the truncated monomer structures from the P6122 space group. Coot and REFMAC were used for model building and crystallographic refinement yielding a final model includes residues 1-107 of molecule A, 1-105 of molecule B, and 55 waters (R/Rfree are 19.9/26.2%).

Two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit form a dimer. The final refined model of the NpSTHK dimer contains residues 1-107 of molecule A and 1-105 of molecule B. The NpSTHK monomer structure is comprised of a 7-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel flanked by several α-helices (Fig. 1C). The structure of the NpSTHK monomer is similar to that of the PAS fold: its most similar structural neighbors are two heme containing sensors bjFixL and EcDOS (Protein Data Bank codes 1DRM and 1V9Z), followed by dPER (1WA9), HIF-2α (1P97), and photoactive yellow protein (3PYP) with DALI Z-scores (29Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) ranging from 8.3 to 7.6, respectively. A superposition of the NpSTHK and EcDOS PAS domain (30Kurokawa H. Lee D.S. Watanabe M. Sagami I. Mikami B. Raman C.S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20186-20193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D) details their close structural similarity (r.m.s. deviation of 2.2 Å for 70 Cα atoms). Their structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 1B) reveals only 10% sequence identity. The canonical PAS fold contains 5 β-strands (31Hefti M.H. Francoijs K.J. de Vries S.C. Dixon R. Vervoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) but both NpSTHK and EcDOS contain an additional short βC strand; NpSTHK contains even an additional 7th (βD) strand (Fig. 1D). The region between the two N-terminal strands (βA/βB) and three C-terminal strands (βE/βF/βG) usually harbors 4 helices in PAS domains (31Hefti M.H. Francoijs K.J. de Vries S.C. Dixon R. Vervoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Three of those helices are present in NpSTHK (Fig. 1B) although helix αD is in a somewhat different orientation (Fig. 1D). This multihelix containing region between βB and βE is structurally the most variable part of PAS domains, and can have as few as 2 helices such as CitA (32Reinelt S. Hofmann E. Gerharz T. Bott M. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39189-39196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), possibly dictated by whether or not the PAS domain binds a ligand and if so, the type of ligand (31Hefti M.H. Francoijs K.J. de Vries S.C. Dixon R. Vervoort J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33Pandini A. Denison M.S. Song Y. Soshilov A.A. Bonati L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 696-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The similarity between NpSTHK and EcDOS is thus remarkable despite little sequence identity and extends beyond the PAS fold because they both contain an additional N-terminal helix, αA (Fig. 1D). A structure-based sequence analysis of the homologous sGC subunits using the NpSTHK H-NOXA domain structure was used to probe sequence conservation and sites of insertions and deletions (Fig. 1B). Both sGC subunits have a large insertion between the βE and βF strands in their H-NOXA domain: a 9-residue insertion for α1 and 19 for β1. In addition, there are some smaller 1 residue insertions and deletions around the βC strand (Fig. 1B). To test whether the sGC subunit sequences are compatible with the PAS-fold of NpSTHK, MODELLER (34John B. Sali A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3982-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) was used to build homology models for the α1 and β1 H-NOXA domains using the alignment in Fig. 1B. The resulting models yielded no negative VERIFY3D structure validation (35Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar) scores (or even scores with values lower than 0.1) indicating that both subunits can adopt the PAS fold of NpSTHK (the 19-residue insertion in β1 was omitted from the modeling due to its size and lack of template). NpSTHK Dimer Organization—The two dimerized NpSTHK molecules make extensive interactions burying 2,395 Å2 of surface (67% hydrophobic; surface calculations done using MSCON (36Connolly M.L. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 139-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2, A-D). Dimer interface analysis programs ranked the significance of this interface very high yielding a maximal complexation significance score of 1.0 and a PITA score of 90 (37Krissinel E. Henrick K. Berthold M.R. Computational Life Sciences. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2005: 163-174Google Scholar, 38Ponstingl H. Kabir T. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1116-1122Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Truncated Δ7 NpSTHK forms a flipped dimer (Fig. 2E), buries less surface (1,888 Å2) with many water-mediated interactions, and is likely non-physiological as indicative of the lower complexation significance score and PITA dimer evaluation scores of 0.44 and 47.1, respectively, the latter being below the threshold value of 67 (38Ponstingl H. Kabir T. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1116-1122Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The two NpSTHK domains comprising the full-length dimer are related by an approximate 2-fold non-crystallographic axis (178.5°) and are very similar in conformation (r.m.s. deviation of 0.45 Å for 105 Cα atoms). Dimerization involves juxtapositioning of the N-terminal helices and preceding residues and the face of the β-sheet (Fig. 2, A-D). The dimer interface contains a central cluster of hydrophobic residues (including Leu8, Leu13, Phe17, Phe100, and Leu102) and hydrogen bonds (involving side chains of residues Thr7, Ser9, Gln31, Gln89, and Gln93 and main chain atoms of several other residues) (Fig. 2, B and C). The resemblance of NpSTHK with EcDOS extends beyond the monomer fold because their dimer organizations are also similar involving N-terminal helix juxtapositioning (Fig. 3). The dimeric NpSTHK and EcDOS structures can be superimposed with r.m.s. deviations of 3.5 Å (for 2 × 70 Cα atoms), which is higher than the r.m.s. deviations of 2.2 Å for the monomer superposition yet low enough to indicate a similar dimer arrangement. Their similar dimer organization is attained because the hydrophobic nature of several residues at the core of the dimer interface is conserved (Leu13, Phe100, and Leu102 in NpSTHK correspond to Leu26, Leu127, and Leu129, respectively, in EcDOS; see Fig. 1B). The same fold and dimer organization are also present in another heme containing oxygen sensor, RmFixL (39Miyatake H. Mukai M. Park S.Y. Adachi S. Tamura K. Nakamura H. Nakamura K. Tsuchiya T. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), also an STHK protein (Fig. 3). Furthermore, such PAS dimerization was also recently observed in AvNifL (40Key J. Hefti M. Purcell E.B. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), which led to the suggestion that this is a conserved dimerization motif for a subset of PAS domains (40Key J. Hefti M. Purcell E.B. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3614-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Evidence for a NpSTHK-type Dimer for the H-NOXA Domains of sGC—The N-terminal region of the H-NOXA domain of NpSTHK provides most of the dimer contacts, which is in agreement with the corresponding sGCβ1 residues 204-244 found to be important for sGC dimerization (Fig. 1B) (17Zhou Z. Gross S. Roussos C. Meurer S. Muller-Esterl W. Papapetropoulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24935-24943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dimer interface region is largely conserved in sGCα1 and sGCβ1 (Fig. 4A), suggestive of a similar dimerization function in sGC. The hydrophobic nature of all 5 residues comprising the central cluster of the dimerization interface (Leu8, Leu13, Phe17, Phe100, and Leu102) is conserved as well suggesting that sGCα1 and sGCβ1 H-NOXA domains could similarly heterodimerize, or homodimerize as observed in solution for the sGCβ1 H-NOXA domain (Fig. 4B). To test whether a heterodimeric sGC indeed could adopt a similar NpSTHK dimer arrangement, a homology model was constructed for the α1β1 sGC H-NOXA heterodimer using MODELER, which resulted in similar (non-negative) VERIFY3D scores as was observed for the individual monomers. The modeled sGC heterodimer structure was additionally validated by carrying out dimer analysis calculations using PISA resulting in a ΔG for dimer formation of -16.9 kcal/mol and 2,156 Å2 of buried surface (α2β1 yielded similar results). These values are very similar to that calculated for the experimentally determined NpSTHK dimer itself, whereas a MODELLER generated α1β1 heterodimer homology model based on the likely non-physiological Δ7 NpSTHK dimer yielded only a ΔG of -7.9 kcal/mol (1,742 Å2 of buried surface). These automated modeling and analysis results suggest that the sGC H-NOXA domain sequences are indeed compatible with formation of a NpSTHK-type heterodimer. To further validate the presence of a NpSTHK-type dimer interface in sGC we mutated 8 putative H-NOXA interface residues to alanines (see Figs. 1B, 2, B and C, and 4 for the NpSTHK interface residue positions that were targeted for mutagenesis of the corresponding residue in sGC). We tested the effect of these mutations on dimerization of the isolated sGCβ1 H-NOXA domain and the dimerization and activity of full-length sGC. The 8 Ala mutations were made in sGCβ1; two of the mutations were also generated at the corresponding positions in sGCα1. All mutations had a negative effect, with varying degrees, on dimerization of the β1 H-NOXA domain (Fig. 4B). The β1 mutations that caused the largest effects o"

These lesions are located one or two nucleotides apart on the opposite strands and covalently link them, blocking DNA replication and transcription (1Bessho T. J. Biol.

The first critical step for repairing ICLs in any given model is to release the ICL from one of the strands by making two incisions that bracket an ICL (unhooking the ICL). The unhooking of ICLs permits strand separation. In Escherichia coli and yeast, nucleotide excision repair (NER) makes dual incisions bracketing the ICL on one of the cross-linked strands to unhook ICLs (2Dronkert M.L. Kanaar R. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 3Noll D.M. Mason T.M. Miller P.S. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 277-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NER is dispensable in mammalian ICL repair (5Cipak L. Watanabe N. Bessho T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In contrast to NER-defective mutants in E. coli and yeast, the NER-defective mammalian cells (except for ERCC-1 and ERCC-4 cells) are only moderately sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) (8De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 9Niedernhofer L.J. Garinis G.A. Raams A. Lalai A.S. Robinson A.R. Appeldoorn E.

Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, biochemical studies demonstrated that the dual incisions by mammalian NER do not “unhook” ICLs (12Bessho T. Mu D. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6822-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2446-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, mammalian cells evidently have a unique mechanism(s) to initiate ICL repair. Notably, double strand break (DSB) repair-defective mutant cells, including those deficient in Rad51 paralogs or BRCA2, are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents such as MMC (10Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that ICLs in the mammalian genome are removed during S-phase and the DNA replication-mediated formation of a DSB is the key intermediate in ICL repair in mammalian cells (1Bessho T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5250-5254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell.

These data indicate that mammalian ICL repair goes through three critical processes: the formation of DNA replication-mediated DSBs, unhooking of the ICLs (separation of the two linked strands), and repair of the DSBs (restoration of the collapsed replication fork). It is unknown whether the formation of DSBs precedes the unhooking reaction. When the DNA replication complex encounters an ICL, the strand separation by a replicative helicase and/or the chain elongation reaction by replicative DNA polymerases is inhibited before the ICL, and a stalled fork structure is generated at (or near) the cross-linked site. One possible structure at the stalled fork is Y-shaped DNA, generated by the ICL at the junction of two newly replicated double-stranded arms and the unreplicated duplex (see Fig. 6). This unique DNA structure provides an opportunity for structure-specific endonucleases to act. The outcome of the process will be the formation of a DSB at the stalled fork. We reasoned that the XPF-ERCC1 complex is one of the nucleases that are able to generate DSBs during ICL repair. The structure-specific DNA endonuclease XPF-ERCC1 complex is a multifunctional DNA repair factor (16Gillet L.C. Schärer O.D. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 253-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 17Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). The complex generates a nick in the double-stranded DNA 3–5 nt 5′ from the junction of double-stranded and 3′-single-stranded DNA. The XPF-ERCC1 complex makes a 5′-incision during NER (17Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar) and also trims non-homologous 3′-single strand tails during targeted homologous recombination (18Adair G.M. Rolig R.L.

Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Curiously, ERCC-1 and ERCC-4 (XP-F) mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells are extremely sensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, whereas other NER-defective mutants, such as ERCC-5 (XP-G), are only moderately sensitive to the same agents (8De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 11Thompson L.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, the XPF-ERCC1 complex plays a role in ICL repair without the aid of other NER factors. To test our hypothesis, we prepared Y-shaped DNA with a single psoralen ICL at the junction of three double-stranded arms and examined the endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex. We found that the XPF-ERCC1 complex generates an ICL-specific nick 3′ to the ICL (on the template for leading strand synthesis), which results in the formation of a DSB at the stalled fork. Moreover, the XPF-ERCC1 complex generates two incisions bracketing a psoralen ICL on the Y-shaped DNA to unhook the ICL. These results strongly implicate the participation of the XPF-ERCC1 complex in the generation of DNA replication-mediated DSBs associated with ICLs and in the unhooking of ICLs to initiate mammalian ICL repair. Cell Culture—ERCC-4 (UV41) cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 vector containing the human XPF gene using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells that were transfected with the plasmid were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 in Minimal Essential Medium Alpha medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Individual clones of the stably transfected UV41 cells were isolated. Western Blotting—The expression level of XPF in the clones was determined by Western blotting. Cell lysates were generated using lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl). Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-XPF antibody (Ab-1; NeoMarkers). Generation of an Endonuclease-defective Mutant Form of XPF—The XPF(DA) mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis as described by Enzlin and Schärer (20Enzlin J.H. Schärer O.D.

Our construct includes 11 amino acids at the extreme N terminus of XPF (GenBank™ accession number NM005236) that were not included by Enzlin and Schärer (20Enzlin J.H. Schärer O.D.

Colony-forming Assay—One day before the DNA damage treatment, 500 cells were seeded per 10-cm dish. The cells were exposed to MMC at the concentrations indicated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After the MMC was removed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for 1 week in fresh medium. To determine UV sensitivity, cells were exposed to UVC light (254 nm) at 2 or 4 J/m2 after washing with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 week in fresh medium. Colonies formed were stained with Giemsa and counted.

A Y-shaped substrate with a psoralen ICL was prepared by two steps (Fig. 3A). A 73-mer oligonucleotide containing a single psoralen furan-side monoadduct in the middle was prepared by ligation of 32P-labeled Y1, Pso, and Y2 after annealing to YC. After purification from a 10% sequencing gel, the labeled 73-mer with a psoralen monoadduct was annealed with a 5-fold molar excess of Y3, Y4, and Y5. The 3′-half of Y3 is complementary to the 5′-half of the 73-mer with a psoralen monoadduct; Y4 and Y5 are complementary to the 3′-half of the 73-mer with a psoralen monoadduct and the 5′-half of Y3, respectively. The labeled Y-shaped DNA with a psoralen monoadduct was purified from a 5% native gel and then was irradiated with UVA light (365 nm) to convert the monoadduct to an ICL. The psoralen ICL is located 37 and 38 nt from the 5′-end of the labeled strand (Fig. 3B). Preparation of Undamaged DNA Substrates—Undamaged DNA substrates were prepared using Ytop (whose sequence is identical to the strand with a psoralen monoadduct), Y3, Y4, and Y5 listed above. Briefly, Ytop was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed with 5-fold molar excess of Y3 for the splayed substrate, Y3 and Y5 for the flapped substrate, or Y3, Y4, and Y5 for the Y-shaped substrate. These substrates were purified from a 5% native gel. Purification of the XPF-ERCC1 Complex—BL21(DE3) cells cotransformed with pACYC-ERCC1 and pET-XPF were grown in 2 liters of Luria Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. After cooling to 16 °C for 1 h without shaking, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The induction continued at 16 °C for 17 h with shaking. The cells were lysed in 60 ml P-200 buffer (40 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) by sonication. The cleared lysate was diluted to P-100 by the addition of an equal volume of P-0 (40 mm HEPES and 10% glycerol) and then loaded onto a 30-ml DEAE column. The column was washed with 500 ml of P-100 buffer before the proteins were eluted with 150 ml of P-1000 buffer (40 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol). The protein peak fractions were pooled, and then imidazole was added to a final concentration of 30 mm. This pool was loaded on a 5-ml nickel column. The nickel column was washed with 50 ml of P-1000 containing 30 mm imidazole, and then proteins were eluted with 25 ml of P-I100 (40 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 100 mm imidazole) followed by 25 ml of P-I300 (40 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 300 mm imidazole). The P-I300 elution pool was subjected to a 2-ml heparin column, washed with 250 ml of P-100 buffer, and eluted with a 10-ml gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl. The fractions with the XPF-ERCC1 complex were identified on 10% SDS-PAGE by silver stain and dialyzed against HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol). Endonuclease Assay—5′ 32P-labeled DNA substrate was incubated with purified proteins in the reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, 25 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm MnCl2) at 30 °C for the indicated time. Reaction products were separated on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The reaction products were quantitated by measuring incision was calculated by dividing the reaction product band by the total substrate in each lane. An Endonuclease Domain of XPF Is Essential to ICL Repair—Chinese hamster ovary mutant ERCC-4 (UV41) cells, which do not express the XPF protein, are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents (Fig. 1) (8De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7980-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 11Thompson L.H. Mutat. Res. 1996; 363: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It has been believed that the endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex is required for ICL repair; however, there has been no direct proof. Therefore, we examined whether the endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex is essential to ICL repair by expressing a mutant XPF protein, which specifically lacks the endonuclease activity, in ERCC-4 cells. It was reported that the active site mutant XPF, XPF(DA), forms a stable complex with ERCC1 but is devoid of structure-specific endonuclease activity (20Enzlin J.H. Schärer O.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2045-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 9). We expressed XPF(DA) in ERCC-4 cells and tested the cellular sensitivity of the clones to MMC. XPF(DA) is unable to restore cellular resistance to MMC or UV irradiation whereas the ERCC-4 cells expressing wild-type XPF are resistant to MMC and UV irradiation to the level of the ICL repair-proficient AA8 cells (Fig. 1). The expression levels of the wild type and the mutant XPF protein are comparable (Fig. 1, below the graph). The data clearly demonstrate that the endonuclease domain of XPF is essential to both ICL repair and NER. It is also noted that the overexpression of the wild type and the mutant XPF protein in AA8 cells does not have any effect on cellular resistance to MMC and UV irradiation (data not shown).FIGURE 2Purification of the wild type and the endonuclease-defective XPF-ERCC1 complex. A, 1 μg of the endonuclease-defective XPF(DA)-ERCC1 complex (DA) and 0.7 μg of purified wild type (WT) were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. B, a Y-shape is a poor substrate for the XPF-ERCC1 complex. Purified XPF-ERCC1 complex (25 nm: 37.5 ng) was incubated with 0.4 nm splayed DNA (lane 2), flapped DNA (lane 4), and Y-shaped DNA (lane 6) at 30 °C for 30 min. All of the substrates were labeled at the 5′-end of the top strand in the structures depicted above the gel. After the reaction, the incised fragments were analyzed on a 10% sequencing gel. The arrow shows the major incision site, which is located 4 nt 5′ to the junction of the single-stranded and double-stranded regions. 27 and 8% of the substrate were incised in lanes 2 and 4, respectively. Lanes 1, 3, and 5 are control reactions without the XPF-ERCC1 complex. M, 33- and 23-nt size marker, C+T, Maxam-Gilbert cytosine and thymine chemical sequence ladder of the top strand. C, the endonuclease activity of the XPF(DA)-ERCC1 complex was examined using splayed DNA as a substrate. The reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 1 h. Wild type XPF-ERCC1 displayed structure-specific endonuclease activity (lane 8). The XPF(DA)-ERCC1 complex lacks structure-specific endonuclease activity (lane 9). The arrow indicates the major incision product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An ICL-specific Activity of the XPF-ERCC1 Complex—Having established the requirement of the endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex in ICL repair in vitro, we investigated an ICL-specific endonuclease activity of the complex on a Y-shaped DNA substrate, which mimics a replication fork stalled by an ICL (Fig. 3). The endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex on the cross-linked Y-shaped DNA was investigated. A monoadducted and a non-modified Y-shaped DNA were used as controls. It has been reported that the XPF-ERCC1 complex does not incise a Y-shaped DNA without DNA damage (Fig. 2, lane 6) (21de Laat W.L. Appeldoorn E. Jaspers N.G. Hoeijmakers J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7835-7842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the XPF-ERCC1 complex incises the substrate 5′ to the psoralen lesions (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4). The nick was generated 3–4 nt away from the three-way junction. This nicking position coincides with the signature incision site of the XPF-ERCC1 complex on the 3′-single-stranded DNA, such as splayed DNA (Fig. 2, lane 2). The XPF-ERCC1 complex generates the 5′-incision on the monoadducted and the cross-linked Y-shaped DNA with a similar efficiency. Control experiments with the endonuclease-defective XPF(DA)-ERCC1 complex were conducted to eliminate the possibility of contamination of our protein preparation with additional exo/endonucleases. The XPF(DA)-ERCC1 complex and the wild type XPF-ERCC1 complex on a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained 10% SDS gel show that the additional bands, representing degradation products and/or contaminants, are present and equivalent in both preparations (Fig. 2A). Because no activity was detected using the XPF(DA)-ERCC1 preparation, we conclude that the activity detected is that of XPF-ERCC1 and not a contaminating endonuclease (Fig. 4C, lanes 11 and 12). As far as we know, this is the first report to demonstrate a DNA damage-specific activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex. Interestingly, we also detected fragments, which migrated between the 73-nt and the cross-linked 146-nt fragments, upon incubation of the cross-linked Y-shaped DNA with the XPF-ERCC1 complex (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–9). The generation of these products is intrinsic to the XPF-ERCC1 complex because the endonuclease-defective XPF(DA)-ERCC1 complex did not show this activity (Fig. 4C, lane 12). These fragments were presumably the products of an incision by the complex 3′ to the ICL. Photoreversal treatment of the reaction products revealed that the incision sites were indeed located 5–10 nt to the 3′-side of the ICL (Fig. 4D, lane 15). The incision activity 3′ of the DNA damage was specific to the ICL (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4), unlike the 5′-incision activity, which was also detected with the mono-adducted Y-shaped DNA. Thus, we discovered an ICL-specific activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex that generates a nick 3′ to the ICL. We expect the 3′-incision by the XPF-ERCC1 complex on the cross-linked Y-shaped DNA to generate a DSB near the three-way junction. To verify this, the reaction products were analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel. In fact, a fragment that migrated a similar distance to the 73-bp double-stranded DNA was detected (Fig. 5, lane 2, fragment B). Fragments A and B were purified from the native gel for further analysis. The XPF-ERCC1 complex incises both 5′ and 3′ of the ICL on the Y-shaped substrate (Fig. 4). If the two incisions occur on the same molecule, the ICL will be unhooked by the XPF-ERCC1 complex. The isolated fragment B could be a mixture of the products with a 3′-incision by the XPF-ERCC1 complex with or without a 5′-incision. In contrast, products from a single 5′-incision without a 3′-incision by the XPF-ERCC1 complex still contain the ICL and thus retain the Y-shaped structure. Thereby, the 5′-incised products migrate with the non-processed substrate (Fig. 5, fragment A in lane 2). One tenth of fragment A and all of fragment B isolated from the native gel were denatured and run on a 10% sequencing gel. A majority of the products from fragment B contained a single 3′-incision with the intact ICL (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6, marked by an asterisk), whereas the products from fragment A contained the non-processed substrate and the 5′-incision products (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 5). Significantly, we detected a 5′-incision product in fragment B among the 3′-incised products (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 6, marked by arrow). These results strongly suggest that a 5′ and a 3′-incision by the XPF-ERCC1 complex can occur on the same strand to unhook an ICL. It has been postulated that the processing of a DNA replication fork stalled by an ICL is critical and one of the earliest events in mammalian ICL repair (5Cipak L. Watanabe N. Bessho T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Niedernhofer L.J. Lalai A.S. Hoeijmakers J.H.

In this report, we studied a role of the XPF-ERCC1 complex in this processing, using a model Y-shaped substrate with a single psoralen ICL that mimics a stalled fork. We provided genetic evidence for the essential role of the endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex in ICL repair and further demonstrated biochemical evidence that 1) the XPF-ERCC1 complex unhooks a psoralen ICL on the Y-shaped substrate by generating both 5′ and 3′-incisions around the ICL, and that 2) the 3′-incision is ICL-specific, leading to the induction of a DSB on the cross-linked Y-shaped substrate. We propose a model for the processing of an ICL at a stalled fork by XPF-ERCC1 in Fig. 6. The XPF-ERCC1 complex makes a 3′-incision 5–10 nt away from the ICL on the Y-shaped substrate (Fig. 4D). The 3′-incision sites are close enough to the three-way junction to generate a DSB under the conditions used (Fig. 5). The XPF-ERCC1 complex also makes a 5′-incision 3–4 nt away from the ICL on the Y-shaped substrate (Fig. 4). It would be interesting to know if the two activities are coupled. It is attractive to speculate that a 5′-incision triggers the induction of a DNA structure suitable for a 3′-incision by the XPF-ERCC1 complex. Because the 5′-incision occurs both on monoadducted and cross-linked substrates (Fig. 4A), the 5′-incision likely precedes the 3′-incision if the two activities are coupled. A 3′-incision product should be produced only from a 5′-incision product in this scenario. However, only a small fraction of the 3′-incised products contains a 5′-incision. Therefore, it is highly likely that the two incisions are generated independently. The ICL-unhooking activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex might be the result of the 3′-incision reaction coupled with the exonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex. The human XPF-ERCC1 complex and the yeast homolog, RAD1-RAD10 complex, contain a 3′ 5′-exonuclease activity (13Mu D. Bessho T. Nechev L.V. Chen D.J. Harris T.M. Hearst J.E. Sancar A. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2283-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An ICL-specific 3′-incision by the XPF-ERCC1 complex might generate a substrate for its own 3′ 5′-exonuclease activity, which would unhook the ICL (Fig. 6). Our results strongly implicate the XPF-ERCC1 complex in processing a stalled replication fork by unhooking an ICL and concomitantly generating a DSB. This activity is vital for mammalian ICL repair. An induction of DSBs associated with DNA replication has been demonstrated and is considered to be an important intermediate in mammalian ICL repair (1Bessho T. J. Biol.

To date, the endonuclease(s) that induces DSBs during mammalian ICL repair has not been identified, although the XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-MMS4 complexes are prime candidates. Inactivation of the XPF-ERCC1 complex or the MUS81-MMS4 complex in mammalian cells results in a hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, suggesting their role in ICL repair (8De Silva I.U.

In addition, both heterodimeric complexes have a structure-specific endonuclease activity with a similar specificity that is suitable to process a stalled replication fork during ICL repair (26Chen X.B. Melchionna R. Denis C.M. Gaillard P.H. Blasina A. Van de Weyer I. Boddy M.N. Russell P. Vialard J. McGowan C.H. Mol.

Interestingly, both ERCC1–/– and MUS81–/– cells are proficient in generating replication-mediated DSBs associated with ICLs; these results suggest that XPF-ERCC1 and MUS81-MMS4 complexes could both perform this function, such that there is redundancy for this step in ICL repair (19Niedernhofer L.J. Essers J. Weeda G. Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtjens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 24Dendouga N. Gao H. Moechars D. Janicot M. Vialard J. McGowan C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7569-7579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an unidentified nuclease could generate DSBs during ICL repair. Recently, it was demonstrated with MUS81–/– cells that the induction of DSBs is dependent on the MUS81-MMS4 complex only when the cells were exposed constantly to MMC (28Hanada K. Budzowska M. Modesti M. Maas A. Wyman C. Essers J. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4921-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, DSBs induced in the cells that were exposed to MMC for a short period are MUS81-independent (28Hanada K. Budzowska M. Modesti M. Maas A. Wyman C. Essers J. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4921-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Our results support the XPF-ERCC1 complex as one of the nucleases that induce DSBs during ICL repair. The DNA structure(s) at a replication fork stalled by an ICL is unknown. Many three-way junction structures can be considered. Unwinding of DNA by a replicative helicase can be impeded by an ICL before DNA polymerases encounter the ICL. The helicase might stall several nucleotides away from the cross-linked site. Therefore, replicative polymerases will be stalled farther away from the cross-linked site. It is possible that the stalled helicase at the cross-linked site might dissociate from DNA. Once the helicase dissociates, DNA chain elongations by the stalled replicative DNA polymerases might resume up to or near the site of the ICL. The location of a three-way junction relative to an ICL and the extent of the single-stranded region at these Y-shapes will significantly influence the specificity and the efficacy of the endonuclease activity of the XPF-ERCC1 complex. Kuraoka et al. (29Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol.

The dual incisions bracketing the ICL resulted in the unhooking of the ICL (29Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26632-26636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the XPF-ERCC1 complex generates an ICL-specific 3′-incision on a Y-shaped substrate that contains double-stranded regions at the three-way junction, and unhooks the ICL (Figs. 4 and 5). The XPF-ERCC1 complex is capable of inducing a DSB at a stalled fork site by introducing a nick on the template for the leading strand synthesis, allowing the unhooking of the cross-linked strands. We also found that the XPF-ERCC1 complex makes a 5′-incision on a Y-shaped substrate in a DNA damage-dependent manner. The XPF-ERCC1 complex might possess an affinity for DNA damage on a Y-shaped structure or the introduction of a lesion on this substrate might generate single-strandedness around the three-way junction under the conditions used in this study. The biological relevance of the 5′-incision activity on the monoadducted substrate is unclear. In general, single-stranded DNA lesions, such as psoralen monoadducts and alkylated purines, are poor inducers of replication-mediated DSBs (1Bessho T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5250-5254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8De Silva I.U. McHugh P.J. Clingen P.H. Hartley J.A. Mol. Cell.

In contrast to the replication forks stalled by ICLs, where the entire replisome might stall, the replicative helicase and polymerases can be uncoupled at forks stalled by single-stranded lesions (30Paulsen R.D. Cimprich K.A. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 953-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, an opportunity to expose a Y-shaped structure at a stalled fork by a single-stranded DNA lesion might be very limited. Thus, a stalled fork by a single-stranded DNA lesion will be processed and resolved by different mechanisms without generating a DSB. We thank Joyce Solheim for critical reading of the manuscript."

Previous work with the angiotensin AT1a receptor has shown that Gq/11 activation leads to a rapid and transient rise in ERK1/2 activity, whereas β-arrestin binding supports sustained ERK1/2 activation by scaffolding a Raf·MEK·ERK complex associated with the internalized receptor. In this study, we compared the role of the two β-arrestin isoforms in AT1a receptor desensitization, ERK1/2 activation and transcription using selective RNA interference. In HEK293 cells, both the native AT1a receptor and a G protein-coupling deficient DRY/AAY mutant recruited β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 upon angiotensin binding and internalized with the receptor. In contrast, only β-arrestin2 supported protein kinase C-independent ERK1/2 activation by both the AT1a and DRY/AAY receptors. Using focused gene expression filter arrays to screen for endogenous transcriptional responses, we found that silencing β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 individually did not alter the response pattern but that silencing both caused a marked increase in the number of transcripts that were significantly up-regulated in response to AT1a receptor activation. The DRY/AAY receptor failed to elicit any detectable transcriptional response despite its ability to stimulate β-arrestin2-dependent ERK1/2 activation. These results indicate that the transcriptional response to AT1a receptor activation primarily reflects heterotrimeric G protein activation.

Many GPCRs activate the Ras cascade through paracrine transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor (1Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C.

Some appear to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation cascades controlling gene expression through direct interaction with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src family and Janus kinases (5Ali M.S.

Recently, the arrestins, a family of four GPCR-binding proteins originally described for their role in the GPCR desensitization, have been found to interact with Src family kinases and to serve as scaffolds for activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 mitogen-activated protein kinases (7Ferguson S.S.

STKE 2005. 2005; : cm10Google Scholar). Interestingly, arrestin-dependent GPCR signaling does not appear to require heterotrimeric G protein activation, since G protein-uncoupled mutants of the AT1a angiotensin and β2 adrenergic receptors have been shown to activate ERK1/2 by recruiting arrestin (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 11Shenoy S.K. Drake M.T.

Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 12Azzi M. Charest P.G.

In this context the arrestin-bound GPCR functions as a passive scaffold, binding the components of the ERK1/2 cascade, c-Raf1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, localizing them to a membrane surface upon which Raf is activated and protecting phosphorylated ERK1/2 from rapid dephosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (14Jafri F.

Indeed, the only essential role of the GPCR in the process appears to be to provide a ligand-regulated arrestin docking site, since GPCR-independent recruitment of arrestin to the plasma membrane is sufficient to activate ERK1/2 (15Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor angiotensin II type 1a D125A/R126A-mutated AT1a receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 guanine nucleotide-binding protein green fluorescent protein GPCR kinase influenza virus hemagglutinin protein kinase C red fluorescent protein small interfering RNA mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase lysophosphatidic acid. Currently available data suggest that arrestin binding mediates a distinct form of GPCR signaling that is not only G protein-independent but directly antagonistic to G protein signaling. Upon agonist binding, GPCR kinases (GRKs) rapidly phosphorylate specific sites within the intracellular domains or C-terminal tails of the receptor to generate high affinity arrestin binding sites (16Stoffel R.H. II I Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Arrestin binding uncouples the receptor and G protein leading to homologous desensitization of the receptor. In addition, the two non-visual arrestin isoforms, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 (arrestin2 and arrestin3), contain C-terminal binding sites for clathrin and the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP-2 complex that allow them to target GPCRs for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, arrestin binding effectively serves to “switch” the receptor from a G protein signaling mode that transmits short-lived signals from the plasma membrane via small molecule second messengers and ion channels to a β-arrestin signaling mode that transmits a distinct set of signals that are initiated as the receptor internalizes and transits the intracellular compartment. Not surprisingly then, the kinetics of G protein and arrestin signaling differ. In the case of the AT1a receptor expressed in HEK293 cells, G protein-dependent ERK1/2 activation is mediated primarily via PKC activation and is rapid in onset but transient, with most of the signal waning within 10 min of stimulation (17Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In contrast, the arrestin-dependent component of the signal becomes maximal at 10 min and persists for at least 30 min without attenuation. The spatial distribution of ERK1/2 activity also differs. PKC activation generates phosphorylated ERK1/2 that is distributed throughout the cytosol and nucleus, whereas the arrestin pathway activates a discrete pool of the kinase that colocalizes with the receptor-arrestin complex, initially on the plasma membrane and later in endosomal vesicles (18Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Although we are beginning to understand the mechanisms and the temporal and spatial characteristics of arrestin-mediated signals, currently little is known about the functional relevance of these and other G protein-independent signals. Some recent data suggest an important role for G protein-independent signaling in the control of gene transcription. Cardiac-specific overexpression of a G protein-uncoupled mutant AT1a receptor produces greater angiotensin-stimulated Src activation and cytosolic accumulation of active ERK1/2 and promotes a histologically distinct form of cardiac hypertrophy with greater cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and less cardiac fibrosis than that caused by a similar level of overexpression of the wild type receptor, suggesting that G protein-independent signals orchestrate a distinct subset of AT1a receptor responses (19Zhai P. Yamamoto M. Galeotti J. Liu J. Masurekar M. Thaisz J. Irie K. Holle E. Yu X. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Wagner T. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3045-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In response to stimulation of the δ-opioid receptor, β-arrestin1 reportedly translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with the p27 and c-Fos promoters and stimulates transcription by recruiting histone acetyltransferase p300 and enhancing local histone H4 acetylation (20Kang J. Shi Y. Xiang B. Qu B. Su W. Zhu M. Zhang M. Bao G. Wang F. Zhang X. Yang R. Fan F. Chen X. Pei G. Ma L. Cell. 2005; 123: 833-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Ma L. Pei G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To begin to address the broad question of how β-arrestin-dependent GPCR densensitization and signaling affect transcription, we have employed selective RNA interference to determine whether silencing β-arrestin1 and/or β-arrestin2 expression affects AT1a receptor-mediated transcription and tested whether a G protein-uncoupled mutant of the AT1a receptor that mediates β-arrestin2-dependent ERK1/2 activation is able to elicit a transcriptional response. We find that both β-arrestin isoforms contribute to AT1a receptor desensitization but that only β-arrestin2 supports G protein-independent ERK1/2 activation. Analysis of the short term transcriptional response to angiotensin assayed using cDNA arrays containing markers for 96 signal-regulated transcripts revealed that silencing either β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 alone does not affect the transcriptional response, whereas silencing both leads to an increase in the number of AT1a receptor-regulated genes. Consistent with this, β-arrestin2-dependent ERK1/2 activation does not elicit a detectable response, even among ERK1/2-regulated genes. Our data indicate that although β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 are functionally specialized with respect to their roles in receptor desensitization and G protein-independent ERK1/2 activation, the transcriptional response to AT1a receptor activation primarily results from G protein-dependent signaling.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Routine transient transfection of HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding wild type and DRY/AAY AT1a receptors was performed in 100-mm dishes using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions with 3–6 μg of total plasmid DNA/dish and 3 μl of FuGENE/μg of DNA. Before each experiment, transfected cells were seeded into multiwell plates as appropriate, and monolayers were incubated for 24 h in serum-free growth medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and penicillin/streptomycin. Levels of receptor expression were 0.9–1.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein in all experiments. Silencing β-Arrestin Expression Using RNA Interference—Isoform-selective silencing of β-arrestins employed double-stranded siRNAs with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′ dTdT overhangs. The siRNA sequences for β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were 5′-AAAGCCUUCUGCGCGGAGAAU-3′ and 5′-AAGGACCGCAAAGUGUUUGUG-3′, corresponding to positions 439–459 and 148–168 relative to the start codon, respectively (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The non-silencing RNA duplex 5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′ was used for the negative control. HEK293 cells at 40–50% confluence in 10-cm plates were transfected simultaneously with 2 μg of pcDNA3.1-HA-AT1AR or pcDNA3.1-DRY/AAY and 20 μg of control, β-arrestin1, or β-arrestin2 siRNA using 50 μl of GeneSilencer transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h cells were seeded into multiwell plates as appropriate and serum-deprived overnight. All assays were performed 72 after siRNA transfection. Silencing of β-arrestin isoforms was confirmed by immunoblotting whole cell lysates of siRNA-treated cells using rabbit polyclonal anti-β-arrestin IgG with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—To visualize β-arrestin recruitment and RFP-ERK2 distribution, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild type or DRY/AAY AT1a receptor, GFP-tagged β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2, and RFP-ERK2 as specified in the figure legends. Transfected cells were seeded in collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes, stimulated as described in the figure legends, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope using a Zeiss 63× 1.4 numerical aperture water immersion lens using dual line switching excitation (488 nm for GFP, 568 nm for rhodamine) and emission (515–540 nm GFP, 590–610 nm rhodamine) filter sets. FLIPR™ Assay of Angiotensin-stimulated Calcium Influx—Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were passed at 70–80% confluence onto collagen-coated black well/clear bottom 96-well plates, allowed to grow for 24–48 h, then placed in serum-free medium for 5–6 h before assay. Fresh FLIPR™ Calcium 3 assay reagent (100 μl/well) was added, and plates were preincubated for an additional 1 h before stimulation. Stimulations were carried out on the FLIPR™ instrument (Molecular Devices) with 488-nm excitation wavelength per the manufacturer's operating instructions. ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—To assay ERK1/2 phosphorylation, serum-starved cell monolayers in 12-well plates were stimulated at 37 °C as described in the figure legends and lysed directly with 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Sonicated samples were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 IgG with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Total ERK1/2, measured to confirm equal loading of whole cell lysate samples, was detected using polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 IgG. Immune complexes were visualized on x-ray film by enzyme-linked chemiluminescence and quantified using a Fluor-S MultiImager. RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Profiling—Appropriately transfected HEK293 cells were grown to 75% confluence in 15-cm plates and serum-starved for 16–20 h before stimulation for 90 min as described. After stimulation, cells were harvested, and total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent and purified using the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total RNA with A260/A280 > 1.9 was used for synthesis of cDNA probes. Expression profiles were created using the SuperArray™ Human Signal Transduction PathwayFinder cDNA GEArray. These nylon filter arrays contain 96 cDNA probes for commonly regulated transcripts along with standardization control markers. cDNA probes were synthesized from purified total RNA using GEarray-specific primers incubated with biotin-16-dUTP, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and RNase inhibitor. Gene arrays were prehybridized with sheared salmon sperm DNA before cDNA probe hybridization. Hybridization was done overnight at 60 °C for 16 h. Chemiluminescence gene array images were recorded on x-ray film. Scanalyze™ software was used to analyze optimally exposed radiographs. The abundance each transcript was normalized to housekeeping gene markers on each array. Gene Expression by Quantitative Real Time PCR—The expression of Egr1 and Ptgs2 mRNA was measured by quantitative real time PCR using an iCycler iQ™ Multicolor real-time detection system. Total RNA was isolated from cells with the High Pure RNA isolation kit. cDNA for quantitative real time PCR was synthesized from 0.1 μg of RNA using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit amplified through one cycle by PCR with random hexamer DNA primers as templates. The specific primer sets were designed to span intron-exon borders to distinguish amplified cDNA from genomic DNA. The primers used for Egr1 amplification were: sense, 5′-GATGATGCTGTGACAATAAG-3′; antisense, 5′-TACGGTCAAGCAGTATTTAC-3′. The primers used for Ptgs2 were: sense, 5′-TTCTCTAACCTCTCCTATTATAC-3′; antisense 5′-TTCCACAATCTCATTTGAATC-3′. The expression level of Egr1 and Ptsg2 from each sample was normalized to the mRNA expression level of a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. β-Arrestin1 and β-Arrestin2 Both Support AT1a Receptor Desensitization, but Only β-Arrestin2 Mediates G Protein-independent ERK1/2 Activation—We took two approaches to study the role of β-arrestins in modulating the transcriptional response to AT1a receptor activation. The first was to determine the effect of isoform-selective down-regulation of β-arrestin expression on wild type AT1a receptor signaling. The second was to characterize responses mediated by the G protein-uncoupled DRY/AAY mutant AT1a receptor, which we have previously shown activates ERK1/2 via a β-arrestin-dependent mechanism (10Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A compares the functional G protein coupling of wild type and DRY/AAY mutant AT1a receptors, measured as intracellular calcium flux due to Gq/11-dependent phospholipase Cβ activation. As shown, stimulation of transiently expressed wild type AT1a receptors with angiotensin II produced a rapid and transient rise in intracellular calcium. The response was absent in untransfected HEK293 cells and cells expressing a comparable level of the DRY/AAY mutant. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, stimulated wild type and DRY/AAY receptors internalized in complex with either GFP-tagged β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2, confirming that both isoforms bind AT1a receptors (23Oakley R.H.

Jagadeesh G. Zhang M. Spat A. Catt K.J. Hunyady L. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2220-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares the contribution of Gq/11-dependent PKC activation and β-arrestin coupling to ERK1/2 activation by the wild type and DRY/AAY receptors. Endogenous β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were down-regulated using isoform-selective RNA interference, as shown in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B depicts ERK1/2 activation by the wild type AT1a receptor under conditions of varying β-arrestin expression. As shown, 5 min of exposure to angiotensin II produced robust ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the PKC inhibitor, Ro31–8425. Silencing β-arrestin1 expression had no significant effect on either the magnitude of the signal or its PKC dependence. In contrast, β-arrestin2 silencing reduced angiotensin II-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation by about 60%, consistent with its reported function as an AT1a receptor-regulated signaling scaffold (18Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 26Ahn S. Wei H. Garrison T.R. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7807-7811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The residual signal was significantly Ro31–8425-sensitive, suggesting that it was transmitted in large part through Gq/11 activation. Silencing both β-arrestin isoforms simultaneously produced a modest, but significant, enhancement in angiotensin II-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was also partially sensitive to the PKC inhibitor. These results are consistent with a model in which both β-arrestin isoforms contribute to receptor desensitization, i.e. termination of receptor-G protein coupling, but only β-arrestin2 supports ERK1/2 activation. Results obtained with the DRY/AAY mutant also support this conclusion. As shown in Fig. 2C, stimulation of the DRY/AAY mutant produces ERK1/2 activation that is sensitive to down-regulating β-arrestin2 expression but is not significantly inhibited by PKC inhibition. The formation of stable AT1a receptor “signalsome” complexes affects the spatial distribution of ERK1/2 such that, upon endocytosis, a fraction of the ERK1/2 pool colocalizes in endosomes containing the internalized β-arrestin-bound receptor (18Luttrell L.M. Roudabush F.L. Choy E.W. Miller W.E. Field M.E. Pierce K.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2449-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 27Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J.

This is shown in Fig. 3, where the redistribution of co-transfected GFP-β-arrestin2 and RFP-ERK2 upon AT1a receptor stimulation was monitored using confocal fluorescence microscopy. In unstimulated cells, GFP-β-arrestin2 was predominantly cytosolic in distribution, whereas RFP-ERK2 was found diffusely throughout the cytosol and nucleus. After 30 min of exposure to angiotensin II, GFP-β-arrestin2 had redistributed to the endosomal pool that contains the sequestered AT1a receptor (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). At the same time a substantial amount of the cytosolic pool of RFP-ERK2 redistributed such that it co-localized with GFP-β-arrestin2, whereas the nuclear pool of RFP-ERK2 was retained in the nucleus, consistent with its being tethered by binding to nuclear proteins (28Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). As shown, stimulus-dependent signalsome assembly is independent of G protein activation, since the DRY/AAY mutant receptor behaved similarly to the wild type. β-Arrestin Expression Dampens AT1a Receptor-mediated Transcription—From the preceding, it is clear that with respect to the AT1a receptor, β-arrestin1 functions primarily in receptor desensitization and sequestration. Although it binds the receptor (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1964914253,"The serine threonine kinase Raf-1 plays a protective role in many cell types, but its function in pancreatic beta-cells has not been elucidated. In the present study, we examined whether primary beta-cells possess Raf-1 and tested the hypothesis that Raf-1 is critical for beta-cell survival. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence, we identified Raf-1 in human islets, mouse islets, and in the MIN6 beta-cell line. Blocking Raf-1 activity using a specific Raf-1 inhibitor or dominant-negative Raf-1 mutants led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in cell death, assessed by real-time imaging of propidium iodide incorporation, TUNEL, PCR-enhanced DNA laddering, and Caspase-3 cleavage. Although the rapid increase in apoptotic cell death was associated with decreased Erk phosphorylation, studies with two Mek inhibitors suggested that the classical Erk-dependent pathway could explain only part of the cell death observed after inhibition of Raf-1. An alternative Erk-independent pathway downstream of Raf-1 kinase involving the pro-apoptotic protein Bad has recently been characterized in other tissues. Inhibiting Raf-1 in beta-cells led to a striking loss of Bad phosphorylation at serine 112 and an increase in the protein levels of both Bad and Bax. Together, our data strongly suggest that Raf-1 signaling plays an important role regulating beta-cell survival, via both Erk-dependent and Bad-dependent mechanisms. Conversely, acutely inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Akt had more modest effects on beta-cell death. These studies identify Raf-1 as a critical anti-apoptotic kinase in pancreatic beta-cells and contribute to our understanding of survival signaling in this cell type."

https://openalex.org/W1974052770,"The transthyretin amyloidoses appear to be caused by rate-limiting tetramer dissociation and partial monomer unfolding of the human serum protein transthyretin, resulting in aggregation and extracellular deposition of amorphous aggregates and amyloid fibrils. Mice transgenic for few copies of amyloid-prone human transthyretin variants, including the aggressive L55P mutant, failed to develop deposits. Silencing the murine transthyretin gene in the presence of the L55P human gene resulted in enhanced tissue deposition. To test the hypothesis that the murine protein interacted with human transthyretin, preventing the dissociation and partial unfolding required for amyloidogenesis, we produced recombinant murine transthyretin and human/murine transthyretin heterotetramers and compared their structures and biophysical properties to recombinant human transthyretin. We found no significant differences between the crystal structures of murine and human homotetramers. Murine transthyretin is not amyloidogenic because the native homotetramer is kinetically stable under physiologic conditions and cannot dissociate into partially unfolded monomers, the misfolding and aggregation precursor. Heterotetramers composed of murine and human subunits are also kinetically stable. These observations explain the lack of transthyretin deposition in transgenics carrying a low copy number of human transthyretin genes. The incorporation of mouse subunits into tetramers otherwise composed of human amyloid-prone transthyretin subunits imposes kinetic stability, preventing dissociation and subsequent amyloidogenesis. The transthyretin amyloidoses appear to be caused by rate-limiting tetramer dissociation and partial monomer unfolding of the human serum protein transthyretin, resulting in aggregation and extracellular deposition of amorphous aggregates and amyloid fibrils. Mice transgenic for few copies of amyloid-prone human transthyretin variants, including the aggressive L55P mutant, failed to develop deposits. Silencing the murine transthyretin gene in the presence of the L55P human gene resulted in enhanced tissue deposition. To test the hypothesis that the murine protein interacted with human transthyretin, preventing the dissociation and partial unfolding required for amyloidogenesis, we produced recombinant murine transthyretin and human/murine transthyretin heterotetramers and compared their structures and biophysical properties to recombinant human transthyretin.

The incorporation of mouse subunits into tetramers otherwise composed of human amyloid-prone transthyretin subunits imposes kinetic stability, preventing dissociation and subsequent amyloidogenesis. Protein misfolding and subsequent aggregation cause many human diseases, among them are the systemic amyloidoses (1Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In these disorders the misfolded and misassembled proteins display a gain of toxic function phenotype associated with compromised organ function through a mechanism(s) that remains obscure. Although the characteristic feature of all amyloid diseases is the extracellular deposition of one protein as cross-β-sheet amyloid fibrils, additional aggregate morphologies are almost always observed in humans including amorphous aggregates, spherical aggregates, and protofibrils (5Teng M.H.

Wild type TTR amyloidogenesis occurs in the hearts of 10–25% of humans older than 80 years, resulting in senile systemic amyloidosis, often leading to congestive heart failure (9Cornwell G.G.

More than 100 amyloidogenic mutations in TTR are responsible for the autosomal dominant disorders, familial amyloid polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy (10Connors L.H. Lim A. Prokaeva T. Roskens V.A.

TTR is synthesized and secreted by the liver, the choroid plexus of the brain and the retina (4Buxbaum J.N. Hochberg S.S.W.W.S.C. Rheumatology. Elsevier, London2005: 1669-1680Google Scholar). It circulates in cerebrospinal fluid where it is the primary transporter of thyroxine (T4) and in plasma where it acts as a backup carrier of T4 and as the primary transporter of holo retinol-binding protein. TTR may have other physiological functions, since silencing the gene by targeted disruption in mice results in a behavioral phenotype that does not seem to be attributable to either thyroid dysfunction or vitamin A insufficiency (12Sousa J.C. Grandela C. Fernandez-Ruiz J. de Miguel R. de Sousa L. Magalhaes A.I. Saraiva M.J. Sousa N. Palha J.A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TTR is a tetramer exhibiting a dimer of dimers architecture, wherein each 127-residue subunit adopts a β-sheet rich tertiary structure (13Klabunde T. Petrassi H.M. Oza V.B. Raman P. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Dissociation of the TTR tetramer into its constituent monomers is the rate-limiting step of the aggregation process in vitro and presumably in vivo (14Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). However, dissociation is not sufficient, and the released monomer also has to partially unfold to misassemble into oligomers, soluble aggregates including protofibrils, insoluble aggregates, and amyloid fibrils in a downhill misassembly process (16Hurshman A.R. White J.T. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7365-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The dimer-dimer interface bisected by the crystallographic 2-fold (x) axis (Fig. 1) and making up the T4 binding sites is the kinetically labile interface (17Foss T.R. Wiseman R.L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15525-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Small molecule binding at this interface imposes kinetic stability on the tetrameric TTR and prevents aggregation and fibril formation (18Miroy G.J. Lai Z. Lashuel H.A. Peterson S.A. Strang C. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15051-15056Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 19Johnson S.M. Wiseman R.L. Sekijima Y. Green N.S. Adamski-Werner S.L. Kelly J.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This kinetic stability results from an increase in the free energy barrier associated with tetramer dissociation. Thus, the protein is effectively locked into its native tetrameric quaternary structure, because the energetic barrier is too high relative to the energy available at 37 °C (19Johnson S.M. Wiseman R.L. Sekijima Y. Green N.S. Adamski-Werner S.L. Kelly J.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2005; 38: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Covalent tethering of the subunits making up each of the T4 binding sites also precludes dissociation of the quaternary structure, providing further support that this is the kinetically labile interface (17Foss T.R. Wiseman R.L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15525-15533Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that there is a relationship between the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of TTR and its propensity to form amyloid fibrils (20Hammarstrom P. Jiang X.

Tissue culture studies have demonstrated that a conformationally heterogeneous monomer or small TTR oligomers are cytotoxic to cells of neuronal and cardiac origin, whereas large soluble aggregates and mixtures of amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates are not (22Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In pre-symptomatic carriers of the amyloidogenic V30M TTR variant there is evidence of non-fibrillar TTR deposition with an inflammatory response in peripheral nerve biopsies, supporting the idea that non-amyloid oligomers are involved in early stages of the disease (6Sousa M.M.

Successful models, i.e. those exhibiting amyloidogenesis, and most closely resembling the human disease, use the human TTR gene regulated by its own promoter with tissue specific expression. They require integration of multiple copies of the gene and production of large amounts of the human protein in the mouse. Transgenic animals expressing low concentrations of amyloid-prone mutant human TTR, including the very aggressive L55P variant (L55P TTR) do not develop amyloid deposits. Silencing the murine gene by targeted disruption in the presence of the human L55P TTR gene resulted in tissue deposition (27Tagoe C. Reixach N. Friske L. Mustra D. French D. Gallo G. Buxbaum J.N. Amyloid. 2007; 14: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Sousa M.M. Fernandes R. Palha J.A. Taboada A. Vieira P. Saraiva M.J. Am. J.

These observations suggest that incorporation of endogenous murine TTR subunits into heterotetramers otherwise composed of transgene-encoded human TTR increases the kinetic stability of such heterotetramers, thereby preventing dissociation, aggregation, and deposition. To test this hypothesis, we expressed, purified, and characterized the recombinant murine TTR (Mu-TTR) homotetramer as well as human/murine TTR heterotetramers (Hu/Mu-TTR) and compared their biophysical properties and aggregation propensities with those of recombinant human wild type TTR (Hu-TTR). We also crystallized Mu-TTR, determined its structure, and compared it to previously reported structures of wild type and mutant human TTRs (13Klabunde T. Petrassi H.M. Oza V.B. Raman P. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 30Blake C.C.F. Geisow M.J. Oatley S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that incorporation of murine TTR subunits into TTR heterotetramers otherwise composed of human TTR subunits within the cellular secretory pathway imposes kinetic stability on the resulting heterotetramers, preventing their dissociation, which is the rate-limiting step in TTR misfolding, misassembly, and amyloidogenesis, processes associated with proteotoxicity (22Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon, referred to as interallelic transsuppression, has been observed in human carriers of both the amyloidogenic V30M TTR mutation and the naturally occurring suppressor variant T119M TTR. Compound heterozygotes carrying these mutations on distinct alleles are protected from the highly penetrant peripheral neuropathy caused by the V30M TTR mutation, because the incorporated T119M subunits kinetically stabilize the V30M/T119M TTR heterotetramers (31Coelho T. Carvalho M. Saraiva M. Alves I. Almeida M.R. Costa P.P. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20 (abstr. 0.19): 179Google Scholar, 32Hammarstrom P. Schneider F. Kelly J.W.

Recombinant TTR—Human TTR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (22Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Mouse TTR was obtained by subcloning a cDNA mouse TTR clone (ATCC 1243583) into pMMHa vector (the same vector used for human TTR expression) at the NdeI and KpnI restriction sites. The rare codon for proline in position 2 (CCC) was mutagenized to a common proline codon (CCT). The identity of the insert as that encoding mouse TTR was verified by DNA sequencing. Mu-TTR was overexpressed in E. coli as above. The murine protein was precipitated from the supernatant after centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g, 4 °C) of the lysed cells in the 40–92% ammonium sulfate fraction (1.8–3.6 m) at 4 °C. The precipitate containing Mu-TTR was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA (phosphate buffer). An equal volume of 200 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.3, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA was added to achieve a final pH of 4.4, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C to precipitate impurities. After centrifugation (30 min, 30,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare) eluting with phosphate buffer. The purity of the protein was >98% as determined by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Blue staining. The yield of mouse TTR was 15 mg/liter of culture. Monomeric mouse TTR was obtained by introducing two mutations at the dimer-dimer interface (F87M and L110M) in the Mu-TTR plasmid DNA by site-directed mutagenesis. These two mutations have been previously introduced to monomerize Hu-TTR (34Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarstrom P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11442-11452Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Preparation and purification of the protein was done as described for Hu-TTR (22Reixach N. Deechongkit S. Jiang X. Kelly J.W. Buxbaum J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2817-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The identities of all the proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry (liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Solution of Mu-TTR—Full-length Mu-TTR in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA at 10 mg/ml was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether as precipitant dissolved in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6. Plate-like crystals grew in space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 120.51 Å, c = 113.19 Å. Using 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant added to the crystallization solution, a complete dataset was collected to 2.05 Å resolution on a Rigaku FR-E x-ray generator and processed with HKL2000 (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Six copies of chain A from the structure of Hu-TTR (Protein Data Bank code 1dvq) (13Klabunde T. Petrassi H.M. Oza V.B. Raman P. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) were placed in the asymmetric unit using Phaser (36McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) (chains A-F in the final model). After one round of simulated annealing refinement with CNS (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar), it became apparent that electron density for further copies of the monomeric subunit was present. Their position could not be determined by molecular replacement using available programs, but they were manually placed in the electron density with the program O (38Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), generating chains G and H. Further refinement with Refmac5 (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) with translation-liberation-screw (TLS) analysis (one group per subunit) and model building in Coot (40Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar) yielded a final model with R/Rfree = 0.198/0.246. Tight non-crystallographic symmetry positional restraints were used throughout the refinement to tether the geometry of the lower quality chains G and H to those of A and C, respectively (see below). Of the eight subunits in the asymmetric unit, four (A, B, C, D) form one tetramer, whereas the remaining four represent two half-tetramers; for each pair of subunits E/F and G/H, a full tetramer can be generated by rotation around the crystallographic 2-fold rotation axis, which coincides with the 2-fold axis that relates subunits within the monomer. Electron density is excellent for the ABCD tetramer, and we will refer to this when discussing our results. For the GHGH tetramer the quality of electron density is more than satisfactory in the vicinity of the crystallographic 2-fold axis but progressively deteriorates when moving toward the periphery of the molecule. The EFEF tetramer is in an intermediate situation. The final model contains residues 8–10 to 123–124 for each of the eight polypeptide chains and 349 solvent molecules. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in supplemental Table S1. Model quality is excellent as assessed with Procheck (41Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) with no outliers observed in the Ramachandran plot. Aggregation and Amyloid Fibril Formation Experiments—Solutions of murine or human TTR (0.4 mg/ml in phosphate buffer were diluted 1:1 with 200 mm buffer (100 mm KCl and 1 mm EDTA) to achieve the desired pH (sodium citrate for pH <3.2, sodium acetate for pH 3.5–5.3, and sodium phosphate buffer for pH >5.3). The protein solutions were incubated at 37 °C in cluster tubes. At the time of measurement the solutions were vortexed for 5 s and transferred to 96-well UV-transparent plates in triplicate (50 μl), and the turbidity was measured at 330 and 400 nm. The percentage of aggregation, including fibril formation, was calculated with the 100% value corresponding to the maximum signal of Hu-TTR. All measurements were made in triplicate in at least two independent experiments. Chaotrope Stability—TTR denaturation curves were obtained by incubation of the proteins (0.1 mg/ml) in various concentrations of urea for 96 h or guanidinium hydrochloride (GndHCl) for 72 h at 25 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA. TTR reconstitution curves were performed by first unfolding the proteins in 6.5 m GndHCl (2 days at 25 °C). TTR was then diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in pre-designated concentrations of GndHCl in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA. To prepare the reconstitution solutions in urea, TTRs (Hu-TTR or Mu-TTR) were first unfolded in 6.5 m GndHCl (Mu-TTR does not unfold in urea), the buffer was exchanged into 8 m urea, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. After buffer exchange, both TTRs were still completely unfolded, as discerned by tryptophan fluorescence (see below). Dilutions were performed to yield a final TTR concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in a range of urea concentrations (0.8–8 m) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and incubated for 24 h at 25 °C before recording their tertiary and quaternary structures (see below). Stocks of urea (9 m) and GndHCl (8 m) were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA. TTR Tetramer Stability Measured by Resveratrol Binding Fluorescence—Resveratrol is a stilbene that binds in the T4 binding pocket of folded tetrameric TTR (13Klabunde T. Petrassi H.M. Oza V.B. Raman P. Kelly J.W. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) resulting in a sizable increase in its fluorescence quantum yield. Resveratrol fluorescence is linear with tetrameric TTR concentration for both Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR (supplemental Fig. S1). Resveratrol does not bind to or exhibit the dramatic environment-sensitive fluorescence with the double TTR mutant F87M/L110M TTR, a variant of TTR that is typically monomeric (34Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarstrom P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11442-11452Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and it does not shift the TTR monomer-tetramer equilibrium toward tetramer at the concentrations used in these experiments (20Hammarstrom P. Jiang X. Hurshman A.R. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16427-16432Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Each TTR solution (in urea or GndHCl) was vortexed for 5 s. Resveratrol (1 mm in Me2SO) was added to achieve a final resveratrol concentration of 19 μm. The samples and blank solutions (prepared in parallel) were vortexed again for 5 s and transferred into black 96-well plates. Fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation/emission 320/394 nm with a 10-nm bandwidth in a Safire 2 fluorimeter (Tecan). The concentration of urea or GndHCl at which 50% of TTR was tetrameric (Cm) was calculated with GraphPrism software (GraphPad) fitting the data to a dose-response curve with variable slope. The percentage of tetrameric protein at each denaturant concentration was calculated from the values of resveratrol binding of TTR samples that had not been denatured (100% tetramer) and those that were completely denatured (0% tetramer). All experiments were measured in duplicate in at least two independent assays. TTR Tertiary Structure Measured by Tryptophan Fluorescence—We used the 355/335-nm emission intensity ratio (F355/F335) to follow TTR denaturation (unfolding) as reported previously (42Hammarstrom P. Jiang X. Deechongkit S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11453-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Exposure of the tryptophans with increasing chaotrope concentration increased the F355/F335 ratio from 0.85 to 1.4 and from 1.0 to 1.4 upon denaturation for Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR, respectively. The TTR solutions incubated in different concentrations of urea or GndHCl (both unfolding and reconstitution solutions) were vortexed for 5 s, and 100 μl of each solution were transferred into black 96-well plates. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured with excitation at 295 nm and emission at 335 and 355 nm with a 5-nm bandwidth in a Safire 2 fluorimeter. In some experiments fluorescence was measured on a Varian Cary 50 spectrofluorometer as described elsewhere (17Foss T.R. Wiseman R.L. Kelly J.W.

The concentration of urea or GndHCl at which 50% of TTR was folded (Cm) was calculated with GraphPrism software fitting the data to a dose-response curve with variable slope. The proportion of folded protein at each denaturant concentration was calculated from the fluorescence ratios of native (100% folded) or completely denatured (0% folded) TTR samples. All experiments were measured in duplicate in at least two independent assays. Subunit Exchange Experiments—Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR were dialyzed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and stock solutions at 0.4 mg/ml were prepared. Equal volumes of Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for up to 7 days and at 4 °C for 1 day. After incubation, SDS-loading buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE without pre-boiling. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Formation and Purification of Human/Mouse TTR Heterotetramers (Hu/Mu-TTR)—Equal amounts of Mu-TTR and Hu-TTR were denatured in 6.5 m GndHCl for 2 days at 25 °C and then reconstituted by dilution (1:100) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. The refolded protein was re-purified by gel filtration in phosphate buffer before analysis. Analysis of Hu/Mu-TTR Heterotetramers—To assess whether the purified TTR tetramers resulting from denaturation/reconstitution of a solution containing equal amounts of Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR were heterotetramers (see above), we incubated 100 μl of this solution at 6 μg/ml with 100-μl equivalents of magnetic beads (Dynal protein A beads) pre-cross-linked with anti-human TTR antibody (Dako A0002) for 1 h at 4 °C following the supplier's directions. In solution, this antibody is specific for human TTR subunits and does not bind native mouse TTR or its subunits. As controls, we incubated the beads with the same amounts of Hu-TTR, Mu-TTR, and an equimolar mixture of human and mouse TTR (homotetramers) to demonstrate that the antibody is specific for Hu-TTR and that Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR do not exchange subunits during the experimental procedure. The TTR captured by the antibody beads was eluted with 100 μl of 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5. The samples were buffer exchanged in water using a Microcon filter device (3 kDa, Millipore) and adjusted to the same final volume (20 μl). SDS-loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 8 min in water before loading onto 15% acrylamide/bisacrylamide Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE gels and run at 100 V. The proteins were transferred overnight to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 30 V at 4 °C. The membranes were blocked for 2 h in 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature and incubated with an anti-TTR antibody (Dako A0002). This antibody recognizes both denatured Hu-TTR and Mu-TTR (27Tagoe C. Reixach N. Friske L. Mustra D. French D. Gallo G. Buxbaum J.N.

In this study, RA is found to cause MAPK activation with sustained association of RAF to MEK or ERK, leading to a MAPK-dependent accumulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 and binding to CDK2 blocking G1/S transition. BLR1, a chemokine receptor, was found to function as a critical component of RA-triggered MAPK signaling. Unlike wild-type parental cells, RA-treated BLR1 knock-out cells failed to show RAF and consequential MEK and ERK phosphorylation, failed to accumulate CDK inhibitors that control G1/S transition, and failed to differentiate and arrest in response to RA, whereas ectopically overexpressing BLR1 enhanced MAPK signaling and caused accelerated RA-induced differentiation and arrest. Ectopic overexpression of RAF enhanced BLR1 expression in response to RA, whereas inhibition of RAF or MEK by inhibitors or knockdown of RAF by short interfering RNA diminished RA-induced BLR1 expression and attenuated differentiation and growth arrest. Ectopic expression of the RAF CR3, the catalytically active domain, in the BLR1 knock-out restored RA-induced MAPK activation and the ability to differentiate and arrest, indicating that RAF effects MAPK signaling by BLR1 to propel differentiation/arrest.

MAPK signaling has now been implicated in a wide variety of processes. Enigmatically it may also cause cell growth arrest and differentiation. How the signal is evoked to cause arrest and differentiation in contrast to mitogenesis is not well defined. Retinoic acid is a form of vitamin A that has known roles governing cell growth and differentiation in embryogenesis, nutrition, and chemotherapy of cancer. It can cause leukemic cell growth arrest and differentiation in a process that depends on sustained MAPK signaling (1Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yen A. Sturgill R. Varvayanis S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 36: 249-255Crossref Google Scholar, 3Yen A. Williams M. Platko J.D. Der C. Hisaka M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar), but the origin and regulation of that signaling are not well understood. It has thus been an elusive goal to find a paradigm that might rationalize how retinoic acid gives rise to the sustained MAPK signal that is needed to propel arrest and differentiation or a potential receptor that is seminal for that signal. mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase retinoic acid short interfering RNA enhanced green fluorescent protein open reading frame reverse transcription 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein cyclin-dependent kinase retinoic acid-recepter retinoic acid-response element nitro blue tetrazolium neomycin farnesyltransferase inhibitor 277. mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase retinoic acid short interfering RNA enhanced green fluorescent protein open reading frame reverse transcription 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein cyclin-dependent kinase retinoic acid-recepter retinoic acid-response element nitro blue tetrazolium neomycin farnesyltransferase inhibitor 277. BLR1, also known as CXCR5, is a putative serpentine heterotrimeric G protein-coupled CXC chemokine receptor. BLR1 was first found in a differential screen comparing malignant Burkitt lymphoma cells against Epstein-Barr virus-transformed normal B lymphocytes (4Dobner T. Wolf I. Emrich T. Lipp M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It was thus a potential determinant of the malignant phenotype of Burkitt lymphoma. The sequence is highly related to the interleukin-8 receptor. In humans BLR1 expression was originally found restricted to mature resting B cells and a subset of T-helper memory cells (5Forster R. Emrich T. Kremmer E. Lipp M. Blood. 1994; 84: 830-840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kaiser E. Forster R. Wolf I. Ebensperger C. Kuehl W.M. Lipp M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2532-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The pathology of BLR1 knock-out mice suggested a role for BLR1 in lymphocyte migration and activation (7Forster R. Mattis A.E. Kremmer E. Wolf I. Brem G. Lipp M. Cell. 1996; 87: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). However, its function is still unclear, and a clear demonstration of its ability to regulate cellular proliferation or differentiation remained elusive. Although originally implicated as a determinant of B cell malignancy, its cellular functions have not been elucidated. Expression of the BLR1 is induced by retinoic acid, and there is evidence such receptors can utilize MAPK signaling (8Battle T.E. Levine R.A. Yen A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Battle T.E. Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Varvayanis S. Yen A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). BLR1 may thus be of relevance to the mechanism of action of RA. As a known regulator of cell differentiation and proliferation, RA regulates BLR1 transcription through a novel retinoic acid-response element (RARE) that differs from the canonical AGGTCA half-sites. The RARE is a 17-bp 5′-element containing two GT boxes located ∼1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start (10Wang J. Yen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2423-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent binding of RAR and retinoid X receptor to this RARE precipitates assembly of a complex containing Oct1, NFATc3, and CREB2 bound to their cognate sites 3′ of the GT box element. After recruitment of these tethered downstream transcription factors into the complex, CREB2 dissociates, leaving a transcriptionally active complex. The RARE in the BLR1 promoter suggests that it may have a role in mediating the effects of retinoic acid on cell differentiation and the cell cycle. Treating HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells with RA causes early expression of BLR1, enhanced ERK activation in the MAPK signaling pathway, and subsequently terminal cell differentiation along the myeloid lineage and G0 cell cycle arrest (8Battle T.E. Levine R.A. Yen A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Battle T.E. Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Varvayanis S. Yen A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to classical MAPK signaling in response to peptide growth factors where a transient MAPK signal leads to mitogenesis, MAPK signaling here is prolonged and leads to differentiation and G0 arrest (1Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yen A. Sturgill R. Varvayanis S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 36: 249-255Crossref Google Scholar, 3Yen A. Williams M. Platko J.D. Der C. Hisaka M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 103-113PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hong H.Y. Varvayanis S. Yen A. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Inhibiting MAPK signaling blocks RA-induced differentiation indicating that it is necessary for RA to induce differentiation and arrest. This is consistent with the paradigm that although a short MAPK signal is mitogenic, a prolonged MAPK signal leads to differentiation and/or growth arrest as proposed earlier by Cohen and co-workers (12Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) in studies on the action of nerve growth factor. This paradigm has been validated in RA-treated HL-60 cells. Significantly, the question of how the MAPK signal originates or is sustained in response to RA is still outstanding. The relatively slower onset of MAPK activation in response to RA suggests a dependence on gene expression. Ectopic expression of BLR1 in stable transfectants resulted in enhanced ERK activation compared with parental HL-60, suggesting BLR1 may be a candidate RA-targeted gene important to RA-induced MAPK activation (8Battle T.E. Levine R.A. Yen A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Battle T.E. Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Varvayanis S. Yen A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The BLR1 stable transfectants underwent accelerated terminal myeloid differentiation and G0 arrest in response to RA, further suggesting a functional consequence of RA-induced BLR1 expression consistent with the known role of MAPK in propelling RA-induced cell differentiation and G0 arrest. BLR1 thus emerges as an attractive candidate for mediating the cell differentiation and cell cycle arrest attributed to RA. To test this, a BLR1 knock-out of HL-60 cells was created in the presently reported studies. Treating these cells with RA would thus elicit all effects except those dependent on BLR1 expression. Because WT HL-60 cells do not express BLR1 until treated with RA, the untreated knock-out would suffer no deleterious or potentially unanticipated effects because of loss of BLR1. RA failed to induce RAF, MEK, or ERK activation in the knock-out cells. Unlike WT cells, RA also failed to increase expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 and its binding to CDK2, and the cells failed to cell cycle arrest or terminally differentiate. Ectopic expression of the RAF CR3 domain, which is the catalytically active kinase domain devoid of the N-terminal negative regulatory regions, in the BLR1 knock-out cells restored ERK activation and rescued their ability to undergo differentiation and G0 arrest in response to retinoic acid. Overexpression of RAF in WT cells enhanced RA-induced BLR1 expression, whereas down-regulation of RAF attenuated BLR1 expression consistent with MAPK-positive feedback regulation of BLR1 expression. Inhibiting RAF or MEK inhibited RA-induced ERK activation and BLR1 expression, indicating that transcriptional activation of BLR1 depended initially on basal levels of MAPK signaling. Because MAPK signaling was enhanced by RA-induced BLR1 expression, a positive feedback loop could thus propel BLR1 expression and amplify MAPK signaling, offering a potential mechanism of prolonged BLR1 signaling that contributes to the prolonged MAPK signal needed to elicit cell differentiation and arrest in response to RA. Consistent with such a loop, inhibiting MEK was found to inhibit RAF activation. The data thus demonstrate a function for BLR1 and its attendant RAF signal in propulsion of RA-induced cell differentiation and G0 cell cycle arrest through a positive feedback loop using the RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling pathway driven by BLR1. This feedback loop amplifies basal levels of MAPK signaling to promote BLR1 expression and propel differentiation and arrest. This establishes a new function for BLR1 and a clear demonstration of a role in regulating cell differentiation and the cell cycle. Reagents–Antibodies against ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2, MEK1/2 and phospho-MEK1/2, RAF1 and phospho-RAF1(Ser-259), CDK2, p21Waf1/Cip1, and β-actin were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); the antibody against phospho-RAF1(Ser-621) was from BIOSOURCE/Invitrogen; allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD11b was from BD Biosciences; retinoic acid, Ras inhibitor farnesyltransferase inhibitor 277 (FTI-277), RAF inhibitor GW5074, MEK inhibitor PD98059, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were from Sigma; DCF reagent 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester, and G418 were from Invitrogen; radioactive materials were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; PCR primers were from Operon (Huntsville, AL); mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA); PCR kit was from Clontech. ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kits were purchased from Pierce. siRNAs was ordered from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cell Culture–HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells and their derivatives, including wild-type, BLR1 knock-outs, BLR1 stable transfectants, RAF1 stable transfectants, and RAF1CR3 stable transfectants, were cultured in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and maintained in continuous exponential growth. Experimental cultures were initiated by reculturing exponentially growing cells at a density of 0.2 × 106 cells/ml and sampled at the indicated times for different analyses as described. RT-PCR and Northern Analysis–Total RNA was extracted from HL-60 cells by using a RNA-Bee kit (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR for cloning of BLR1 ORF or RAF1 ORF or RAF1 CR3 coding sequences was performed with TITANIUM One-step RT-PCR kit with a pair of primers at 5′ or 3′ of the BLR1 cDNA sequence 5′CTGGGAACTGGACAGATTGGACAAC3′ and 5′GAACGTGGTGAGAGAGGTGGC3′. The RT-PCR amplified coding sequences for BLR1 exon 2 was used as a probe for Northern detection. The protocols for RT-PCR and Northern analysis were described previously (10Wang J. Yen A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2423-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Generation of BLR1 Knock-out Cell Line–To generate a BLR1 knock-out cell line, a human genomic BLR1 fragment was cloned from HL-60 cells by PCR. The BLR1 targeting vector includes a total of 5571 bp of genomic sequence, EGFP gene, neomycin resistance gene (Neo), and cytomegalovirus promoter-driven herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (CMV-TK). The BLR1 gene consists of two exons encoding a 372-amino acid protein. The first exon encodes only 17 amino acids, and separated by a 10-kb intron, the second exon encodes the majority of the protein, including most known functional domains and all three putative phosphorylation sites. Homologous recombination between the targeting vector and the wild-type BLR1 allele results in deletion of a 148-bp region of the BLR1 gene in exon 2 and replacement of this sequence with CMV-EGFP gene followed by neomycin (thymidine kinase promoter directed). After RA treatment, the disrupted BLR1 gene is expected to yield a 1.9-kb BLR1-EGFP fusion mRNA molecule that contains only 189 bp representing the N-terminal 63 amino acids of BLR1 and then EGFP. In the disrupted BLR1 gene reading frame, the thymidine kinase promoter-directed Neo open reading frame has a stop codon followed by a poly(A) signal, so sequences downstream of Neo will no longer be transcribed. As a result, in BLR1 knock-out cells (BLR1-) the full-length BLR1 protein of 372 amino acids is lost, and expression of only 63 amino acids from exon 1 (17 amino acids) and 5′ exon 2 (46 amino acids) occurs under RA induction. SalI-linearized targeting vector was electroporated into HL-60 cells, and clones were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 and 2 μm gancyclovir for 3 weeks. Serial dilution under the same selection pressure was used to derive clones for screening. The clones were examined by PCR using a forward primer at Neo and the reverse primer at BLR1 exon 2. Eight positive clones contained integration of the homologously recombined targeting vector. To get a biallelic knock-out, the positive clones underwent selection with a higher concentration of G418 (2 mg/ml) while continuing 2 μm gancyclovir for another month. Southern analysis of these positive clones using a 1250-bp probe spanning BLR1 exon 2 and its flanking sequence of genomic DNA after a BamHI and HindIII restriction digest identified negative clones with the predicted 3877-bp band for wild-type BLR1 alleles, positive clones with the predicted three bands of 3877, 3561, and 668 bp for heterozygous mutant BLR1 alleles, or positive clones with two bands of 3361 and 668 bp for homozygous mutant BLR1 alleles. Northern analysis with the same probe used in the Southern analysis confirmed new expression of a 1.9-kb transcript representing the short BLR1 fragment and EGFP fusion mRNA in homologous recombinants compared with the 2.9-kb wild-type BLR1 mRNA in WT HL-60. The expected EGFP fluorescence in the BLR1 knock-out cell line was also confirmed by cytometry. The BLR1 knock-outs used in this study is a pool of the above eight positive clones. Generation of Stable Transfectants–1) BLR1 stable transfectants were generated using a modified pIRES-EGFP expression vector, namely the plasmid pEF-IRES2-EGFP (pEIE) (13Lamkin T.J. Chin V. Varvayanis S. Smith J.L. Sramkoski R.M. Jacobberger J.W. Yen A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1328-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Lamkin T.J. Chin V. Yen A. Am. J. Hematol. 2006; 81: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of BLR1 was isolated by RT-PCR and cloned into the EcoRI site of pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) with a pair of primers as follows: forward primer, 5′GGAATTCATGAACTACCCGCTAACGC3′, and reverse primer, 5′GAATTCTAGAACGTGGTGAG3′. The base A at +4 (right after the BLR1 ATG start codon) was mutated to G to create an NcoI site for cloning with a mutagenesis primer 5′GCTGGAATTCATGGACTACCCGCTAACGC3′ using the Stratagene mutagenesis kit. The mutated BLR1 ORF (now starting with an NcoI site sequence) was PCR-amplified with a BamHI site incorporated at the 3′ end with a pair of primers, forward primer 5′GCCATGGACTACCCGCTAACGC3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGGATCCTAGAACGTGGTGAG3′, and inserted into NcoI and BamHI sites of the pEIE vector. The G +4 base was mutated back to base A to restore the wild-type BLR1 ORF sequence with a mutagenesis primer 5′GCCACCATGAACTACCCGCTAACGC3′. After the mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing, the vector was transfected into HL-60 cells by electroporation facilitated with DEAE-dextran (1 ng/μl) and subjected to G418 (1 mg/ml) selection for 3 weeks. The transfectants were then sorted on the basis of EGFP fluorescence by flow cytometry to derive a population exceeding 99% positive. Enhanced BLR1 expression because of stable transfection was detected by Northern analysis using the full-length of BLR1 exon 2 sequence as a probe to identify a 3-kb BLR1 ORF-EGFP fusion mRNA (data not shown). 2) RAF1 stable transfectants were generated using the pEIE vector. The RAF1 open reading frame was amplified by RT-PCR from HL-60 cells with a pair of primers, forward primer 5′GGGATCCATGGAGCACATACAGGG3′ and reverse primer 5′GGGATCCTAGAAGACAGGCAGCC3′. The RAF1 ORF was then cloned into the BamHI site of the pEIE vector, and the proper orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. After transfection by DEAE-dextran added electroporation, RAF1 transfectant cells were selected with G418 selection for 3 weeks and further sorted by cytometry. The enhanced RAF1 expression was then confirmed by Western analysis. 3) RAF1 CR3 stable transfectants were generated using a pIRESpuro3 vector (Clontech). The cDNA for the kinase domain (CR3) of RAF1 with an added ATG translation start codon was isolated by RT-PCR from total RNA extracted from HL-60 cells with a pair of primers, forward primer 5′GGGAATATGTCACAGCCGAAAACCCCC3′ and reverse primer 5′GGGATCCTAGAAGACAGGCAGCC3′. The amplified fragment was then cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pIRESpuro3 vector, which contains a puromycin marker after the internal ribosome entry site. This allowed selection of CR3-transfected BLR1- cells, which already expressed Neo and EGFP. The RAF1 CR3 DNA construct was sequenced and transfected into BLR1 knock-out cells by DEAE-dextran-aided electroporation and was subject to selection with puromycin (10 ng/μl) for 4 weeks. Western analysis of the selected cells confirmed expression of the CR3 domain protein. Similarly, ectopic expression of BLR1 in BLR1 knock-outs was achieved by constructing plasmid pIRESpuro3-BLR1 (BamHI is the site where BLR1 ORF was cloned in pIRE-Spuro3) and stably transfecting pIRESpuro3-BLR1 into BLR1 knock-outs, followed by the above same selection with puromycin. siRNA Interference–Human siRNAs to specifically interfere with RAF1 expression were designed based on siRNA design software ordered from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), siRNA sequence 1, 5′AAGCCAGCAGGCACCACTTTT3′ (sense strand), and siRNA sequence 2, 5′AAGGCCCAGCCTTGTGTAGAT3′ (sense strand). The two siRNAs both targeting human RAF gene were pooled at equal molarity with a final concentration for each siRNA of 20 nm. For each treatment, 5 million HL-60 cells were transfected with a total of 40 nm of siRNAs using Nucleofector solution (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. RA was added immediately after transfection for the designated times for Western or cytometric analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation–50 μg of antibody against each bait protein was immobilized in coupling gel, and each 50 μg of cell lysates prepared from different cell lines with or without 1 μm of RA treatment was incubated with the antibody-immobilized coupling gel using a ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis. Differentiation Assays–1) For DCF assay, one-half million cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. 1 μl of TPA and 1 μl of DCF, 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (Invitrogen), were added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 20 min. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (15Reiterer G. Yen A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7765-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 2) For NBT assay, the percentage of cells capable of inducible oxidative metabolism, a functional marker for mature myelomonocytic cells, was measured as the percentage of cells capable of reducing NBT to intracellular formazan because of superoxide as described previously (16Yen A. Reece S.L. Albright K.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 118: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Yen A. Powers V. Fishbaugh J. Leuk. Res. 1986; 10: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and scored by microscopy for formazan. 3) For CD11b staining, the percentage of cells expressing the myelomonocytic cell surface differentiation-specific marker CD11b was measured by immunofluorescence using allophycocyanin-conjugated CD11b antibody and flow cytometry. One-half million cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. 5 μl of allophycocyanin-conjugated CD11b antibody was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Samples were analyzed using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The threshold to exceed for positive staining was set so that 95% of control untreated cells were negative. Cell Growth Arrest Assay–The distribution of cells in the cell cycle was measured by flow cytometric analysis of hypotonic propidium iodide-stained nuclei to derive the percentage of cells with G1/0 DNA content as described previously (1Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yen A. Reece S.L. Albright K.L. J. Cell.

RA Induces BLR1 Expression, Prolonged RAF/MEK/ERK Activation, and Increased p21Waf1/Cip1 Expression and Its Binding to CDK2–To assess how loss of BLR1 affects RA-induced MAPK signaling and subsequent changes in the expression and interactions of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their inhibitors, the RA-induced responses were first characterized in WT HL-60. As reported previously (8Battle T.E. Levine R.A. Yen A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Battle T.E. Roberson M.S. Zhang T. Varvayanis S. Yen A. Eur. J.

Onset is apparent at about 48 h, and most cells are differentiated and arrested after 72 h of RA treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A, RA induced BLR1 expression with low levels detectable after ∼9 h, progressively increasing thereafter, peaking at ∼48 h, and still persisting at 72 h before declining. Western blots (Fig. 1B) showed that although requiring hours to become detectable, RA significantly enhanced phosphorylation of RAF (Ser-621) and induced phosphorylation of MEK (Ser-217/221) and ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204). Cells not treated with RA had no detectable changes in phosphorylation of these three kinases (data not shown; see also Fig. 8 for ERK activation in untreated control versus RA). Interestingly, RA also induced an increase in total MEK expression that roughly coincided with when MEK was phosphorylated, suggesting RA could regulate MEK phosphorylation and/or expression levels in HL-60 cells (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 8RAF1 CR3 restores the ability of BLR1 knock-out cells to undergo RA-induced G0 arrest and differentiation. A, Western analysis showing ectopic expression of the RAF1 CR3 domain in transfected BLR1-cells (CR3/BLR1-) and WT RAF1 in parental BLR1- cells. The CR3 domain of RAF1 was cloned into the pIRESpuro3 vector and stably transfected into BLR1 knock-out cells to produce ectopic CR3 expression.

https://openalex.org/W1979387226,"Protein kinase C-related kinase 1 (PRK1 or PKN) is involved in regulation of the intermediate filaments of the actin cytoskeleton, as well as having effects on processes as diverse as mitotic timing and apoptosis. It is activated by interacting with the Rho family small G proteins and arachidonic acid or by caspase cleavage. We have previously shown that the HR1b of PRK1 binds exclusively to Rac1, whereas the HR1a domain binds to both Rac1 and RhoA. Here, we have determined the solution structure of the HR1b-Rac complex. We show that HR1b binds to the C-terminal end of the effector loop and switch 2 of Rac1. Comparison with the HR1a-RhoA structure shows that this part of the Rac1-HR1b interaction is homologous to one of the contact sites that HR1a makes with RhoA. The Rac1 used in this study included the C-terminal polybasic region, which is frequently omitted from structural studies, as well as the core G domain. The Rac1 C-terminal region reverses in direction to interact with residues in switch 2, and the polybasic region itself interacts with residues in HR1b. The interactions with HR1b do not prevent the polybasic region being available to contact the negatively charged membrane phospholipids, which is considered to be its primary role. This is the first structural demonstration that the C terminus of a G protein forms a novel recognition element for effector binding."

The amino acid sequence placed the enzyme in the thioredoxin-like superfamily with Cys44 being the active site. The enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli as well as the native enzyme catalyzed not only the reduction of prostamide H2 to prostamide F2α but also that of PGH2 to PGF2α. The Vmax and Km values for prostamide H2 were about 0.25 μmol/min·mg of protein and 7.6 μm, respectively, and those for PGH2 were about 0.69 μmol/min·mg of protein and 6.9 μm, respectively. Neither PGE2 nor PGD2 served as a substrate for this synthase. Based on these data, we named the enzyme prostamide/PGF synthase. Although the enzyme showed a broad specificity for reductants, reduced thioredoxin preferentially served as a reducing equivalent donor for this enzyme. Moreover, Northern and Western blot analyses in addition to the prostamide F synthase activity showed that the enzyme was mainly distributed in the brain and spinal cord, and the immunohistochemical study in the spinal cord showed that the enzyme was found mainly in the cytosol.

We also demonstrated that PGF synthase reduced prostamide D2 to 9α, 11β-prostamide F2 and that the prostamide F2 analog and anti-glaucoma agent Bimatoprost potently inhibited PGD2 11-ketoreductase, PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase, and prostamide D2 11-ketoreductase activities (23Koda N. Tsutsui Y Niwa H Ito S. Woodward D.F. Watanabe K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 424: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, we did not examine the synthesis of prostamide F2α directly from prostamide H2. Because prostamide H2 is not commercially available and would nonenzymatically degrade to prostamides D2, E2, and to a lesser extent to prostamide F2α due to the instability of its endoperoxide group, it has been difficult to examine the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of prostamide F2α from prostamide H2 directly. In the present study we synthesized [14C]prostamide H2 from [14C]anadamide by using cyclooxygenase-2. With [14C]prostamide H2 as a substrate, we measured the prostamide F2α synthase activity of PGF synthase (EC 1.1.1.188) directly. Although PGF synthase also has prostamide H2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase activity with Km and Vmax values for prostamide H2 of about 10 μm and 60 nmol/min·mg of protein, respectively, this synthase is mainly localized in the lungs and liver (24Watanabe K. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Int. 1981; 2: 603-610Google Scholar). On the other hand, prostamide F synthase activity was mainly localized in the spinal cord and brain. Thus, we found a novel enzyme that directly synthesized prostamide F2α from prostamide H2. This enzyme catalyzed only the reduction of the endoperoxide group of PGH2 or prostamide H2 but did not catalyze the reduction of the keto-group of PGD2 or PGE2. We demonstrated that the enzyme belongs to the thioredoxin-like superfamily, the members of which basically have the CXXC motif as their active site and that thioredoxin served as a reducing equivalent donor for this enzyme. arachidonyl 1-ethanolamide prostaglandin prostaglandin ethanolamide thioredoxin Trx reductase potassium phosphate buffer central nervous system membrane-associated PGE. arachidonyl 1-ethanolamide prostaglandin prostaglandin ethanolamide thioredoxin Trx reductase potassium phosphate buffer central nervous system membrane-associated PGE. Thioredoxin (Trx), a small protein of ∼100 amino acid residues with the CXXC active site, is ubiquitously present and has been evolutionally conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes such as plants and vertebrates (25Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Takahashi S. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19160-19166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, thioredoxin was first identified as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase. In eukaryotic cells, thioredoxin has been involved in a wide variety of biochemical and biological functions. It can function as a reducing equivalent donor to its target proteins, can facilitate refolding of disulfide-containing proteins, and can modulate the activity of some transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1. Moreover, thioredoxin is an efficient antioxidant that can reduce hydrogen peroxide, scavenge free radicals, and protect cells against oxidative stress. Human cytosolic thioredoxin, which is a key component of cellular redox biochemistry and regulation, acts as a co-cytokine upon leaderless secretion (26Pekkari K. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Prostamide/PGF synthase is, thus, a novel enzyme different from PGF synthase previously reported, based on its amino acid sequence, substrate specificity, reductant requirement, and distribution. In this present study we clarified that prostamide/PGF synthase synthesized prostamide/PGF2α from prostamide/PGH2 by using thioredoxin as a reducing equivalent donor. Consequently, we suggest that this system should be added as a new physiological role of thioredoxin.

Other materials and commercial sources were as follows; NADP, NADPH, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from bakers' yeast (type IX) were from Sigma; Q Sepharose (Hiload 26/10), HiTrap Blue, HiTrap Q, HiTrap heparin, and phenyl-Superose PC 1.6/5 were from GE Healthcare; precoated silica gel glass plates (F254) were from Merck KGaA. Other chemicals were at least of reagent grade. Preparation and Identification of Prostamide H2—Preparation of prostamide H2 is described in the supplemental materials. Prostamide H2 was identified by the liquid chromatographic-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) technique under the condition of a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/H2O/acetic acid (115/185/0.5; v/v). The liquid chromatographic-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry procedures were carried out as described previously (23Koda N. Tsutsui Y Niwa H Ito S. Woodward D.F. Watanabe K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 424: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Prostamide H2 exhibited distinct chromatographic and mass spectral characteristics. Supplemental Fig. 1A shows its negative-ion mass chromatograms. Prostamide H2 had m/z 376.1 ([M-H-H2O]–) as the most abundant ion (supplemental Fig. 1B) followed by m/z 430.1 ([M+Cl]–), 358.0 ([M-H-2H2O]–), 393.9 ([M-H]–), and 454.1 ([M+CH3COO–]–) in this order. These ions identified the compound synthesized from anadamide by cyclooxygenase-2 as prostamide H2. [14C]Prostamide H2 was used as a substrate for prostamide F synthase. Preparation of Various Mouse Tissues—Mice (C57BL6J, 8 weeks) weighing about 30 g (male) or 23 g (female) were sacrificed by perfusion with ice-cold saline under anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg of body weight), and various tissues were removed quickly. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. The tissues were weighed and then cut into small pieces and mixed with 3 volumes of 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB (pH 7.0)). Each mixture was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer, and after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was used as the enzyme source. Purification of Prostamide F Synthase from Swine Brain and Its Partial Amino Acid Sequence—Purification of prostamide F synthase from swine brain is described in the supplemental material. The partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was identified by Peptide Mass Fingerprint Analysis (Shimadzu Biotech, Tsukuba, Japan). The purified enzyme was digested with trypsin, and the molecular weights of the resulting peptides were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequences of these peptides were analyzed by using Mascot. Construction of Expression Vector—A Mus musculus brain cDNA clone (Riken Fantom clone ID: 1500010G21, accession number AK005188) was used as a template. The full amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA clone was named PM/PGFS. The PM/PGFS fragment was amplified by the PCR using primers PM/PGFS NdeI forward (5′-GGACGGAGCATATGATGAATGTGGTGGACC-3′) and PM/PGFS EcoRI reverse (5′-CAGGCTGGAATTCTCACCTCCCACACACC-3′). The conditions for the PCR were as follow: 1 cycle at 98 °C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The amplified PM/PGFS fragment was digested with NdeI/EcoRI and inserted into the NdeI/EcoRI site of pColdII as pColdII-PM/PGFS. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA fragment was verified by Applied Biosystems Big-Dye Version 1.1 chemistry on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resultant plasmid was used to transform E. coli BL21. Purification of the Expressed Prostamide/PGF Synthase—BL21 cells were cultured at 37 °C for 6 h in 500 ml of LB medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cold shock at 15 °C was applied for 30 min to cultures having 0.4–0.5 absorbance at 600 nm. This was followed by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and culturing at 15 °C overnight. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min and stored at –80 °C until the purification was begun. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. The cells were thawed and suspended in 30 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 3% glycerol (buffer A). They were then sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-agarose column (Probond, Invitrogen) previously equilibrated with buffer A, and the expressed protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.5 m imidazole in buffer A. The fractions with prostamide F synthase activity were concentrated by Centriprep-10, and buffer A was exchanged for 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 3% glycerol (buffer B). The concentrated enzyme was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column that had been previously equilibrated with buffer B. The expressed protein was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.6 m KCl in buffer B. The purified enzyme in 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 3% glycerol was used as the expressed prostamide/PGF synthase. Immunological Procedure—A polyclonal antibody against prostamide/PGF synthase was raised in a rabbit by the same procedure as described previously (16Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7035-7041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with peptide GDKVLLHFVQKSPGDY, amino acids 155–170, of the enzyme used as the immunogen. For Western blot analysis, the enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN BA85, Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany). Protein bands were immunostained with the anti-prostamide/PGF synthase antibody (IgG) and visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit, Lumi-Light PLUS and Lumi Imager (Roche Diagnostics). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers for the C44S,C47S, and C44S,C47S mutants are shown in supplemental Table 1. The plasmid containing PM/PGFS cDNA was amplified with Pfu Ultra polymerase and 2 complementary primers containing the desired mutation by using a thermal cycler (1 cycle at 95 °C for 30 s and 18 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 1.5 min). After amplification, mutated plasmids containing staggered nicks were generated. The products were digested with DpnI and used to transform E. coli BL21 cells. The nucleotide sequences of the products were verified. The expressed proteins were purified by the same method as described above under “Purification of the Expressed Prostamide/PGF Synthase.” Construction of Expression Vector of E. coli Trx Reductase (TrxR) and Purification of the Expressed Trx and E. coli TrxR—Construction of expression vector of E. coli TrxR and Purification of the expressed Trx and E. coli TrxR are described in the supplemental materials. Enzyme Assays—The standard reaction mixture for prostamide F synthase activity contained 40 μm [1-14C]prostamide H2 (4.1 kBq), 0.1 m KPB (pH 7.0), Trx generating system (0.5 mm NADPH, 2 μm Trx, 3.3 μm TrxR) (27Grippo J.F. Holmgren A. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1 m ammonium sulfate, and enzyme in a total volume of 50 μl. Incubation was carried out at 24 °C for 1 min. The reaction was started by the addition of prostamide H2 and terminated by that of 5 μl of 2 m HCl, and termination was followed by immediate extraction with 250 μl of chloroform:methanol (20:1). Prostamide F2α (about 10 μg) was added to the solution as an authentic marker. The organic phase was subjected to TLC, and the chromatogram was developed with the solvent system of benzene/dioxane/acetic acid (30/50/1). The positions of resultant products (prostamides) on the chromatogram were visualized with iodine vapor, and the radioactivity on the TLC plate was monitored with a bioimaging analyzer FLA-2000. The silica gel was scraped off in those sections corresponding to prostamide F2α and others, and radioactivity was measured with a Packard liquid scintillation analyzer (TRI-CARB 2100TR, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Emulsifier-Scintillator Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PGH2 9,11-endoperoxide reductase, PGD2 11-ketoreductase, and PGE2 9-ketoreductase activities were measured as described previously (16Watanabe K. Yoshida R. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol.

The hydrogen peroxide reductase activities were measured spectrophotometrically at 24 °C by following the decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm of NADPH in the assay mixture consisting of 0.1 m KPB (pH 7.0), Trx generating system, 1 m ammonium sulfate, various concentrations of substrate (hydrogen peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, or cumene hydroperoxide) and enzyme in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Protein concentrations were determined by using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from various mouse tissues, and 1 μg/lane was electrophoresed in 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde and transferred to Nylon positively charged membranes (Roche Diagnostics). As a probe for hybridization, mouse cDNA (606 bp) for the coding region of prostamide/PGF synthase was amplified by PCR using primers mouse PM/PGFS F (5′-GGACGGAGCATATGATGAATGTGGTGGACC-3′) and mouse PM/PGFS R (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCACCTCCCACACACCTCTTC-3′), and the sequence was confirmed. The PCR conditions were 1 cycle at 98 °C for 1 min and 30 cycles for 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The probe was labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Diagnostics) and incubated with the membrane at 65 °C according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After hybridization and washing, the blot was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit, Lumi-LightPLUS (Roche Diagnostics). Immunohistochemical Studies on Mouse Spinal Cord—Immunohistochemical studies on mouse spinal cord are described in the supplemental materials. Tissue Distribution of Prostamide F Synthase—We previously showed that NADPH or glutathione (GSH) are required for PGF synthase activity (28Urade Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, the prostamide F synthase activity of the cytosolic fraction of various mouse tissues was measured in the presence of NADPH or GSH. As shown in Fig. 1A, the prostamide F synthase activity in the presence of NADPH was highest in the ovary, with decreasing activity in the uterus, testis, and vesicular glands in this order, and was almost the same as that in the presence of GSH. In organs besides the genital ones, prostamide F synthase activity in the presence of NADPH was high in thymus, brain, and heart (Fig. 1B). The activity in the presence of GSH was the highest in the heart and was almost the same in other organs, including the eyes. In the presence of GSH, the enzyme activity was detected in most tissues as that in the presence of NADPH. Because the distribution of prostamide F synthase activity was different from that of PGF synthase (PGD 11-ketoreductase) activity (24Watanabe K. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. Biochem. Int. 1981; 2: 603-610Google Scholar), an enzyme specific for the synthesis of prostamide F2α was, thus, expected. For the purification of the enzyme, we tested swine tissues as enzyme sources: brain, heart, lung, and eye. The enzyme activity of the cytosolic fraction of each tissue was measured in the presence of NADPH. These specific activities of swine tissues were almost the same as those of mouse tissues, and the activity in swine brain was the highest (data not shown). Therefore, swine brain was used for the purification of prostamide F synthase as an enzyme source.

Subtle structural variations that are known to be crucial for both their virulence and the permeability of their cell envelope occur in mycolic acids. Among these are the introduction of cyclopropyl groups and methyl branches by mycolic acid S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (MA-MTs). While the functions of seven of the M. tuberculosis MA-MTs have been either established or strongly presumed nothing is known of the roles of the remaining umaA gene product and those of M. smegmatis MA-MTs. Mutants of the M. tuberculosis umaA gene and its putative M. smegmatis orthologue, MSMEG0913, were created. The lipid extracts of the resulting mutants were analyzed in detail using a combination of analytical techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical degradation methods. The M. smegmatis mutants no longer synthesized subtypes of mycolates containing a methyl branch adjacent to either trans cyclopropyl group or trans double bond at the “proximal” position of both α- and epoxy-mycolates. Complementation with MSMEG0913, but not with umaA, fully restored the wild-type phenotype in M. smegmatis. Consistently, no modification was observed in the structures of mycolic acids produced by the M. tuberculosis umaA mutant. These data proved that despite their synteny and high similarity umaA and MSMEG0913 are not functionally orthologous.

Mycolic acids, α-branched β-hydroxylated long chain fatty acids, represent major and very specific constituents of the lipid-rich envelope of mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, and play an important structural role in the envelope architecture (1Asselineau C. Asselineau J. Lanéelle G. Lanéelle M.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 2Barry C.E. II I Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A.

For instance, mycolic acids bound to the cell wall arabinogalactan are organized with other lipids to form an outer barrier with an extremely low fluidity that confers an exceptional low permeability to mycobacteria and may explain their intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics (5Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Other natural constituents containing mycolic acids, such as trehalose mycolates, are known to be implicated in numerous biological functions related both to the physiology and virulence of M. tuberculosis (3Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, their biosynthesis is the only clearly identified target inhibited by the major antitubercular drug, isoniazid (2Barry C.E. II I Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G.

Mycolic acids are found in mycobacterial species as a mixture of structurally related molecules that differ primarily from one another by the nature of the chemical groups at the so-called “proximal” and “distal” positions of their main (meromycolic) chain (Fig. 1). In M. tuberculosis and phylogenetically close species, as well as in several slow growing mycobacteria, three types of mycolates commonly occur (7Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Levy-Frebault V. David H. Ann. Microbiol. (Paris). 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar, 8Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett J.H. Goodfellow M. Magnusson M. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The least polar α-mycolates of M. tuberculosis consist of C76-82 fatty acids (9Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contain two cis cyclopropyl groups. The more polar mycolates are composed of C80-89 (9Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contain both a cis or trans (with a methyl group on the vicinal carbon atom) cyclopropyl group at the proximal position, and a methoxy- or keto-group (with a methyl group on the vicinal carbon atom) at the distal position (Fig. 1A). Mutations resulting in either the loss or the modification of these chemical functions profoundly alter the permeability of the cell envelope to solutes and severely affect the virulence and pathogenicity of the mutant strains in experimental infections (10Dubnau E.

In M. smegmatis and other rapid growing mycobacterial species, which are generally non pathogens, cis and trans double bonds are found in place of cyclopropyl groups in both α-mycolates and related oxygenated molecules (Fig. 1B). mycolic-acid S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases kanamycin streptomycin hygromycin open reading frame thin layer chromatography nuclear magnetic resonance gas chromatography mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. M. tuberculosis has eight predicted MA-MTs (cmaA1-2, mmaA1-4, pcaA, and umaA) (15Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry C.E.

Of the eight MA-MT genes, four have been unambiguously characterized through gene inactivation. Characterization of the resulting mutant strains has shown that the cmaA2 gene encodes a methyltransferase required for the synthesis of trans cyclopropyl at the proximal position of methoxy-and keto-mycolates in M. tuberculosis (16Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) whereas the mmaA2 gene catalyzes the introduction of a cis cyclopropyl group at both the distal position of α-mycolates and proximal position of methoxy- and keto-mycolates (17Glickman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mmaA4 gene (18Yuan Y. Barry 3rd, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), also called hma, has been shown to be necessary for the synthesis of both keto- and methoxy-mycolic acids (10Dubnau E. Chan J.

Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) whereas the umaA2 (Rv0470c) gene has been shown to encode the methyltransferase that is responsible for the cyclopropanation of the double bound at the proximal position of α-mycolates in M. tuberculosis and, accordingly, renamed pcaA (12Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). PcaA has been shown to be required for both the cording of the tubercle bacillus and its long term virulence in mice (12Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and is absent from the genome of the non pathogenic M. smegmatis. For the remaining candidates, the cmaA1, mmaA1, and mmaA3 genes from M. tuberculosis have been overexpressed in a surrogate host, M. smegmatis, and the three putative MA-MTs have been shown to function as methyltransferases (18Yuan Y. Barry 3rd, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry C.E. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) although subsequent inactivation of cmaA1 in M. tuberculosis has led to no phenotypical change (17Glickman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, nothing is known on the reaction catalyzed by the remaining umaA (Mt-umaA) gene product. M. smegmatis has at least seven MA-MT paralogues; two genes are present in the mmaA1-4 region, and one in the umaA-pcaA region in the same orientation as Mt-umaA. The cmaA1 and cmaA2 regions are not present in M. smegmatis although other genes in these regions are conserved. M. smegmatis has four additional paralogues. All seven proteins are similar (73-77% similarity) and the conserved gene arrangement in some loci suggests that some of the M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis genes may be or may have been orthologues. Mt-umaA is most similar to M. smegmatis MSMEG0913 in terms of homology (85% similarity) and is also syntenic. The present study was undertaken in order to determine whether the two genes are orthologues and to investigate their functions. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis strains were cultured on Middlebrook 7H10 agar. For liquid cultures, Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) and 0.05% Tween 80 was used with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC) supplement (Becton Dickinson) for M. tuberculosis strains. M. tuberculosis cultures contained hygromycin (Hyg) (100 μgml-1), kanamycin (Kan) (20 μg ml-1), gentamicin (10 μgml-1), and X-gal (50 μgml-1 and M. smegmatis cultures contained streptomycin (Str), Hyg or Kan (20 μgml-1) where required. All cultures were incubated at 37 °C and with shaking for liquid cultures. Isolation of a M. smegmatis MSMEG0913 Mutants—A library of Tn611 (20Guilhot C. Otal I. Rompaey I.v. Martin C. Gicquel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 535-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mutants of M. smegmatis was screened using inverse PCR and amplification of the chromosomal sequence flanking the site of insertion with the Tn611-specific oligonucleotide primers (Supplemental Table S1) on a genomic DNA template that had been digested with RsaI and then self-ligated. One mutant, Myco69, had a Tn611 insertion 117-bp upstream of the MSMEG0913 start codon. A mutant of M. smegmatis where the MSMEG0913 open reading frame (ORF) was disrupted was made by inserting a kan resistance gene into the ORF. A 2.5-kb fragment containing MSMEG0913 was PCR-amplified from M. smegmatis mc2155 using oligonucleotide primers 436 and 437 (Supplemental Table S1) and the PCR product was cloned into pBLUNTII-TOPO (Invitrogen). The insert was excised from this plasmid with Xba1 and cloned into the Xba1 site of the sacB-str suicide vector, pHBJ428 (21Jeevarajah D. Patterson J.H. Taig E. Sargeant T. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6792-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pHBJ474 was linearized with Nco1 within the MSMEG0913 ORF and a kan resistance cassette was inserted to disrupt the ORF. The kan cassette was in the opposite orientation to the MSMEG0913 ORF. The resulting plasmid, pHBJ489, was transformed into M. smegmatis and transformants were plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing either kan or str. A single crossover strain, Myco734 was isolated and grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth with no antibiotics for 3 days. The cultures were spread on Middlebrook 7H10 agar containing kan and sucrose (10% w/v). A mutant, Myco735, with a double crossover (kanR strS) was isolated. Disruption of MSMEG0913 in Myco735 was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Both MSMEG0913 mutants had the same colony morphology and growth characteristics as M. smegmatis mc2155 when grown on Middlebrook media. Construction of a M. tuberculosis umaA Mutant—Mutagenesis was carried out essentially as described previously (22Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of M. tuberculosis H37Rv umaA with flanking DNA, 978-bp upstream and 977-bp downstream of the gene was amplified by PCR using primers umaA1 and umaA2 (Supplemental Table S1) in a reaction with 10% v/v Me2SO. The PCR product was phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase and cloned into the PmlI site of plasmid p2NIL, producing pFM173. The umaA1 gene was eliminated by inverse PCR, using umaAR1 and umaAR2 (Supplemental Table S1) in a reaction with 5% v/v Me2SO. The PCR product consisting of the vector and the regions originally flanking umaA was phosphorylated using polynucleotide kinase followed by re-ligation (pFM183). Following insertion of a gene cassette carrying lacZ and sacB from pGOAL19 into the vector PacI site to produce pFM194, the DNA was introduced into M. tuberculosis H37Rv by electroporation. Cells carrying single-crossovers were isolated by selection for blue hygR kanR colonies on Middlebrook 7H11 agar containing OADC supplement (Difco). One single crossover colony was plated onto agar containing 2% w/v sucrose to isolate bacteria with a double crossover event. Mutant strains were selected by PCR and confirmed by Southern analysis (data not shown). One of these (FAME89) was analyzed further. Complementation of the M. smegmatis MSMEG0913 Mutant—The mutant, Myco735, was complemented with MSMEG0913, which had been amplified by PCR using primers 420 and 421 (Supplemental Table S1) and cloned as a BamH1/HindIII fragment into pVV16-creating strain Myco740. Myco735 with a vector control was named Myco742. This construct contained the entire MSMEG0913 gene, and part of each flanking gene. Mt-umaA and Mt-mmaA1 genes were each PCR-amplified (primer 604 and 605 and 612 and 613, respectively (Supplemental Table S1) and cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO then subcloned individually as a BamH1-HindIII fragments into pVV16, which had been digested with the same enzymes producing pHBJ616 (Mt-umaA) and pHBJ624 (Mt-mmaA1). A second Mt-umaA complementation construct was made in a version of pVV16 in which the hsp60 promoter had been removed by Xba1 digestion. The cloned fragment of M. tuberculosis DNA contained the 5′-end of Mt-uma through to 1-kb upstream of the gene, including the natural promoter. All complementation constructs expressed recombinant proteins with C-terminal hexahistidine epitopes. The expression of the proteins in M. smegmatis strains was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates with anti-hexahistidine monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). Purification of Mycolic Acids—Whole cells or bacterial residues obtained after lipid extraction with organic solvents (10Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A.

After acidification, fatty acids were extracted with diethyl ether and methylated with an ethereal solution of diazomethane (7Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Levy-Frebault V. David H. Ann. Microbiol. (Paris). 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar). The mycolate patterns of the strains were determined by analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 (Silica Gel 60 Macherey-Nagel) using either eluent A (dichloromethane) or eluent C (petroleum ether/diethyl ether; 9:1, v/v, five runs). Revelation of lipid spots was performed by spraying the plates with molybdophosphoric acid (10% in ethanol), followed by charring. The different classes of mycolates were separated by chromatography on a Florisil column irrigated with increasing concentrations of diethyl ether (0, 10, 20, 30, and 50%, v/v) in petroleum ether and purification was achieved by preparative TLC using eluent A (9Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To search for the presence of ethylenic compounds, the various purified mycolate types were analyzed and fractionated on AgNO3-impregnated silica gel TLC plates developed with eluent A (CH2Cl2). The various purified types and subtypes of mycolates were quantified by weighing. Degradative Techniques—Cleavage of double bonds was performed by permanganate-periodate oxidation (23Von Ruddloff E. Can. J. Chem. 1956; 34: 1413-1418Crossref Google Scholar) at 30 °C in tertiary butanol as solvent. The acids obtained from the oxidative cleavages were methylated and purified on preparative TLC with dichloromethane as eluent. Miscellaneous Analytical Techniques—1H NMR spectra of purified mycolic acid methyl esters were obtained in CDCl3 (100% D) using a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer at 298 K. Chemical shifts values (in p.p.m.) were relative to the internal CHCl3 resonance (at 7.27 ppm). MALDI-MS detection of purified samples in reflectron mode was performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Voyager DE-STR, Framingham, MA) equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (355 nm) operating by pulses of 500 ps with a frequency of 200 Hz. 2500 shots were accumulated in positive ion mode and MS data were acquired using the instrument default calibration. Mycolates samples were dissolved in chloroform, at the concentration of 1 mm, and were directly spotted onto the target plate as 0.5-μl droplets, followed by the addition of 0.5 μl of matrix solution. Samples were allowed to crystallize at room temperature. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml) in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v). Gas chromatography (GC) of fatty acid methyl esters derived either from the saponification of whole cells or from degradation of purified mycolates was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II apparatus equipped with an OV1 capillary column (0.30 mm × 25 m) using helium gas. The temperature separation program involved an increase from 100 to 300 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, followed by 10 min at 300 °C. M. smegmatis MSMEG0913 Mutants Have Subtle Modifications in the Structures of Mycolates—Lipids of M. smegmatis mc2155 and mutants Myco69 and Myco735 were analyzed as described. All the strains contained the same types of major extractable lipids, which included triacylglycerol, glycerol mycolate, trehalose mono- and di-mycolates, and phospholipids (data not shown). M. smegmatis mc2155, Myco69, and Myco735, had comparable contents in extractable lipids (20% of the bacterial dry mass) and in wall-linked mycolates (9% of the bacterial residue dry mass). They also showed identical C16-C24 fatty acid methyl ester profiles on GC and types of mycolates on silica gel TLC, namely α-, α′- and epoxy-mycolates (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the inactivation of the MSMEG0913 resulted in the absence methyl branches in the mycolates of the mutant strains, the various types of mycolates of the parental and mutant strains of M. smegmatis were purified and comparatively analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (9Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Déon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and 1H NMR spectroscopy (24Dinadayala P. Laval F. Raynaud C. Lemassu A. Lanéelle M.A. Lanéelle G. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7310-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mass and NMR spectra of purified mycolates of the Myco69 and Myco735 were superimposable but different from those of the mc2155. As a consequence, only the data from Myco735 will be presented hereafter. Although the mass spectra of the α-mycolates of the wild-type and the mutant contained pseudomolecular ion (M+Na)+ peaks assignable to C74 to C82 α-mycolic acid methyl esters the major peaks were observed at 1160 and 1188 m/z (corresponding to C77 and C79, respectively) in the mass spectra of mc2155 whereas they were seen at 1146, 1174 m/z (corresponding to C76 and C78), respectively, in the mass spectra of the mutant strains (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the major pseudomolecular ion peaks assignable to epoxymycolates were observed at 1204 and 1218 m/z (corresponding to C79 and C80, respectively) in the mass spectra of mc2155 whereas they were seen at 1176 m/z (C77) and 1204 m/z (C79) in the mass spectra of the mutant strains (Fig. 3B). These differences were independent from both the temperature and the phase of growth of the strains and suggested that modifications have occurred in the structures of both α- and epoxy-mycolates of Myco69 and Myco735. In contrast, comparable intense pseudomolecular ion peaks attributable to C62 and C64 α′-mycolic acid methyl esters, at 951.92 and 979.95 m/z, were observed in the mass spectra of the purified mycolates from all strains (data not shown), confirming the absence of methyl branch in α′-mycolates (3Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification and Characterization of the Subtypes of α-Mycolates from M. smegmatis—To further structurally characterize the mycolates from the mutant strains and those of the parent the various purified mycolates were further analyzed by AgNO3-impregnated TLC (Fig. 2B), a layer that is known to have an affinity for cis-ethylenic bonds. A single spot was detected for α′-mycolates from mc2155 and the mutants, as expected (data not shown). In contrast, four major α-mycolate spots, called α1 to α4 and a minor α5 form, were detected and isolated by preparative AgNO3-impregnated TLC from mc2155 whereas three of them, α1, α3, and α5 were observed in the mutants (Fig. 2B). The α1-mycolates, present in all the strains, exhibited the same mobility on AgNO3-impregnated TLC as the dicyclopropanated mycolic acid methyl esters from the control strain while the α2- and α3-mycolates had a migration consistent with the presence of one cyclopropyl group and one double bond of trans and cis configuration, respectively. The more polar α4- and α5-mycolates may correspond to diethylenic molecules. Analysis of the MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the various purified compounds showed that the α1-mycolates from mc2155 were composed of C78, C80, C81, and C83 molecules. In contrast, the α1-mycolates from the mutant Myco735 were devoid of molecules containing odd number of carbon (Table 1). α2-mycolates from mc2155, a subclass of mycolates that were absent from the mutants, consisted of C78, C80, and C82 constituents whereas α3- and α4-mycolates were mainly composed of C77 and C79 molecules (Table 1). α5-mycolates that was abundantly produced by the mutant consisted of C76, C78, and C80. To discriminate between the various structural possibilities for the different α-mycolates, especially in terms of contents in cyclopropyl groups and/or double bonds, the purified subclasses of α-mycolates were examined by NMR spectroscopy.TABLE 1Comparative data from TLC, MALDI-TOF MS and NMR analyses of subtypes of α- and epoxy-mycolates from M. smegmatis mc2155 and Myco735 mutantRfRatioaThe amounts of the different subtypes of mycolates were determined by weighing the purified compounds; the amounts of α1 and E1 from the mc2155 strain were arbitrary fixed to 1Carbon number deduced from the analysis of MALDI-TOF MSChemical functions present in the mero-chain as deduced from 1H NMRα1 mc21550.501.0C78, C80, C81, C83bThe number of carbon for the major component is indicated in boldcis CP + trans CPccis and trans indicated the configuration of double bonds (DB) and cyclopropyl (CP) groups in the different subtypes of α- and epoxymycolates (E)α1 Myco7350.481.0C80, C82cis CPα2 mc21550.262.2C78, C80, C82cis CP + trans DBα2 Myco735----α3 mc21550.131.3C75, C77, C79cis CP + cis DBα3 Myco7350.132.5C77, C79, C81cis CP + cis DBα4 mc21550.063.0C77, C79cis DB + trans DBα4 Myco735----α5 mc21550.030.6C76, C78, C80-α5 Myco7350.037.5C76, C78, C80cis DBE1 mc21550.261.0C78, C80, C81, C83trans E + trans CP or trans E + cis CPE1 Myco7350.261.0C78, C80, C82trans E + cis CPE2 mc21550.131.0C78, C80trans E + trans DBE2 Myco735----E3 mc21550.061.5C77, C79trans E + cis DBE3 Myco7350.062.0C77, C79trans E + cis DBa The amounts of the different subtypes of mycolates were determined by weighing the purified compounds; the amounts of α1 and E1 from the mc2155 strain were arbitrary fixed to 1b The number of carbon for the major component is indicated in boldc cis and trans indicated the configuration of double bonds (DB) and cyclopropyl (CP) groups in the different subtypes of α- and epoxymycolates (E) Open table in a new tab Analysis of the different types of purified mycolates by 1H NMR showed that all the spectra contained the huge signal attributed to the isolated methylene proton resonances (at 1.29 ppm, broad signal), signals due to terminal methyl groups (at 0.85 ppm, triplet), methoxyl from the carboxyl methyl ester (at 3.71 ppm, singlet), methine located at position C-2 (at 2.50 ppm, multiplet). In addition, the spectrum of α1-mycolates from mc2155 (Fig. 4a) contained signal resonances of both cis- (at -0.33, +0.57 and +0.64 ppm) and trans- (at 0.15 and 0.47 ppm) cyclopropyl protons and devoid of signal resonances of double bond protons (at δ 5.34). This observation was consistent with the data obtained by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry showing that these mycolates were composed of molecules containing both odd and even numbers of carbon. It could thus be deduced that the α1-mycolates of mc2155 were composed of two types of dicyclopropanated mycolates: (i) molecules with an even number of carbon containing only cis cyclopropyl rings and (ii) compounds with an odd number of carbon containing one cis and one trans cyclopropyl groups. As trans cyclopropyl rings are known to have an adjacent methyl branch (3Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed"

Its functional role has been best described in muscle regulation; however its much wider role in cytoskeletal actin regulation is still to be clarified. Isoforms vary in size from 284 or 248 amino acids in vertebrates, to 199 and 161 amino acids in yeast, spanning from 7 to 4 actin binding sites respectively. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the larger yTm1 protein is produced by an internal 38-amino acid duplication, corresponding to a single actin-binding site. We have produced an ultra-short Tm with only 125 amino acids by removing both of the 38 amino acid repeats from yTm1, with the addition of an Ala-Ser extension used to mimic the essential N-terminal acetylation. This short Tm, and an M1T mutant of it, bind to actin with a similar affinity to most Tms previously studied (K50% ∼ 0.5 μm). However, an equilibrium fluorescence binding assay shows a much greater inhibition of myosin binding to actin than any previously studied Tm. Actin cosedimentation assays show this is caused by direct competition for binding to actin. The M1T mutant shows a reduced inhibition, probably due to weaker end-to-end interactions making it easier for myosin to displace Tm. All previously characterized Tms, although able to sterically block the myosin-binding site, are able to bind to actin along with myosin. By showing that Tm can compete directly with myosin for the same binding site these new Tms provide direct evidence for the steric blocking model.

It is an actin-associated protein, the dimeric units interacting end-to-end along actin filaments to form a continuous strand that wraps around the surface of the actin filament (6Vibert P. Craig R.

Biol. 1993; 332 (discussion 22–14): 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this way it acts to stabilize actin filaments, as shown by the effect of knockouts of TPM1 in yeast, which have a sickly phenotype due to loss of their actin stress fibers (8Liu H.P. Bretscher A. Cell. 1989; 57: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be an essential protein in yeast, with knockouts expressing no Tm being lethal (9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However Tm functions not just as a structural protein, but also a regulatory one. Its role is best understood in the regulation of muscle contraction, where it is directly involved in regulating the myosin-actin interaction (reviewed in Ref. 10Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Its wider role in regulation of non-muscle actin filaments is less well understood, although it is becoming clear that it plays an important role in functional regulation of the cytoskeleton (11Gunning P.W.

From its essential roles in cytoskeletal and muscle regulation it is clearly important to understand how Tm functions. Although structurally it appears like a simple rod-like molecule, higher vertebrates express a large diversity of Tm isoforms. Mammals express over 20 isoforms from four different genes (1Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). As highlighted in the skTm sequence shown in Fig. 1A, alternate splicing of the 9 exon mammalian tropomyosins is limited to 3 areas, the N and C termini and exon 6. A number of studies have been made on the effects of isoform and sequence changes in these regions, showing these areas to be significant in modulating Tm function (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M.

Fig. 1A also shows the decrease in Tm size from the higher eukaryote Tms, which have 284 residues or 248 residues (the shorter formed by exclusion of exon 2) and span 7 or 6 actins, to those from lower eukaryotes, which have 199 or 161 residues and span 5 or 4 actins. Thus size as well as sequence varies and is presumed to relate to Tm function. The coiled-coil structure of Tm by itself necessitates a degree of repetitiveness within the sequence to allow it to fold and form a pair of correctly interacting helices. A heptad repeat (referred to from A to G) is necessary for formation of the coiled-coil. This constrains residues in the core A and D positions to generally be hydrophobic, while those in the adjacent E and G positions are often charged to allow hydrogen bonding (22Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16797-16805Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Wagschal K. Tripet B. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 785-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It must also have a further higher order repeat to allow binding to multiple, identical, actin binding sites. Despite these constraints, Tms in higher animals lack any true sequence repeats within their structure, as shown by the dot-plot of human skeletal Tm shown in Fig. 1B. In contrast yeast Tms have an easily identifiable internal repeat of 38 residues (Fig. 1C) with the two Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tms differing in size by the number of these repeats. Yeast Tm1 is 199 residues with two repeats, while yTm2 is 161 residues and has only one copy of the sequence (8Liu H.P. Bretscher A. Cell. 1989; 57: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Drees B. Brown C. Barrell B.G. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This provides a clearly identifiable actin binding repeat, which differs from those identified in the skeletal sequence by McLachlan and Stewart (24McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), where they constrained their repeats to multiples of the heptad repeat of either 35 or 42 residues. A number of deletion studies have been made of mammalian tropomyosins to examine the significance of the core actin repeats (25Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Song Y. Moraczewska J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2104-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. An Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1990; 214: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previous to this study, the shortest functional Tm made by sequence deletions was a 4 actin-spanning Tm based on skTm, of similar size to the shortest yeast Tms (27Landis C. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The experimental data for these short vertebrate Tms indicated that they significantly inhibited myosin-actin interaction in comparison to the full-length Tm. This information was then used to support a regulatory model involving a conformational change in the actin filament following release of steric blocking (27Landis C. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Models linking regulation to conformational changes on actin have also been proposed by others (30Chen Y. Yan B. Chalovich J.M. Brenner B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2338-2349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Ansari S. El-Mezgueldi M. Marston S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; 24: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study we have produced several yeast deletion mutants to further investigate the relationships between structure and function in Tms. Comparison of Fig. 1, B and C shows the significant advantage of using the yeast Tm sequence for deletion studies over the skeletal Tm previously used. There are no obvious sequence repeats within the skTm sequence, meaning that deletion studies have been based upon the pseudorepeats identified by McLachlan and Stewart (24McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However the yeast sequence has two highly conserved 38-residue repeats, which are the appropriate size to be actin-binding repeats. We therefore produced an ultra-short Tm by deletion of both of these sites, as shown in Fig. 1A. A family of proteins with varying N termini based on this deletion construct have been characterized in both biophysical and biochemical assays. Although the constructs are well behaved in terms of their binding to actin, they are anomalous in their regulation of the myosin-actin interaction. An explanation for the unexpected regulatory behavior and its implications in differentiating between steric-blocking and actin-based regulatory models are provided. DNA Constructs—General recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described in Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsh E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the supplier. Yeast TPM1 and TPM2 clones were available in the pJC20 expression vector from previous work (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The new constructs were produced by PCR using Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) with suitable primers. The internal deletion was made by a 2-step PCR process in which 5′- and 3′-fragments with matching overlap extensions were first made and then combined together in a second reaction to produce the final product with the internal deletion. External primers were designed to match the N- and C-terminal coding regions and including NdeI and BamHI (underlined) subcloning sites, respectively, for insertion into pJC20. The sequences used for the external primers were as follows: 5′-GGG CCC ATA TGG ACA AAA TCA GAG AAA AGC TA (yTm1 5′-forward primer), 5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GGC GAG CAT GGA CAA AAT CAG AGA AAA GC (TPM1(n2) 5′-forward primer), and 5′-CCC TTG GGA TCC TCA CAA GTT TTC CAG AGA TGC AGC (yTm1 3′-reverse primer), 5′-CCC TTG GGA TCC TCA GTT TTC CAG AGA TGC AGC (yTm1 L199 × 3′-reverse primer). PCR products were cut with NdeI and BamHI, ligated into pJC20, and transformed into the Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue. The sequences for the primers used for the internal deletions were as follows 5′-CGC GGA TCC CTA GTT TTC CAG AGA TGC (TPM1 site1 R), 5′-GGA GCA AGA GTC TCA CCA CTT GCA GTC CAA CAA CG (TPM1 site1–4 F). The entire coding regions of the mutants were verified by sequencing (MWG-Biotech). Protein Expression and Purification—For protein expression the purified plasmids were transformed into competent BL21(DE3) pLys cells and plated for colony isolation. Trial expressions were performed by inoculating single colonies from each into 1 ml of LB medium containing 100 mg/l ampicillin. These were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 nm of 0.6–1.0. Cells were then grown for 3 h at 37°C and 0.125 ml samples harvested and SDS-PAGE used to check expression levels. Cultures showing good levels of expression were then used to seed 1-liter cultures for protein production. Cultures were grown to late exponential phase and induced overnight with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g, resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/liter DNase, 1 mg/liter RNase) and lysed by sonication. The samples were then heat treated at 80 °C for 10 min, cooled, then spun at 10,000 × g to pellet-precipitated protein and cell debris. Soluble Tm was then isoelectric-precipitated from the supernatant at pH 4.5 by addition of 0.3 m HCl. The solution was then left at 4 °C for 15 min, and the precipitate pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Dependent upon yield the pellet was then resuspended in 10–20 ml of buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) and the pH readjusted to 7 after the pellet was dissolved. This was then further purified using a 5 ml of Amersham Biosciences HiTrap-Q column, eluted with a 150–400 mm NaCl gradient, the Tm eluting at around 200–250 mm salt. Fractions containing Tm, as shown by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated by isoelectric precipitation. Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and comparison of 280/260 nm absorbance ratio. Protein concentrations were estimated using extinction coefficients E1% of 6.0, 8.3, and 9.0 cm–1 for yTm1, yTm2, and yTm1Δ23 based clones, respectively, calculated from the sequences using AnTheProt (Gilbert Deleage, IBCP-CNRS). Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—Protein molecular weight was determined by electrospray MS. For this, 10 μm stock samples were dialyzed overnight against 1 mm Tris, pH 7.0. These samples were then acidified by addition of formic acid to 1% v/v and methanol to 10% v/v. Samples were applied at flow rates of 3–5 μl/minute to a Finnegan Mat LCQ ion-trap MS. Mass accuracy for yTm samples is expected to be 2–3 Da (1/10,000). Predicted molecular weights for proteins were calculated using AnTheProt (Gilbert Deleage, IBCP-CNRS). Other Proteins and Reagents—Myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of rabbit myosin, as described by Weeds and Taylor (34Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Its molar concentration was calculated from absorbance measurement at 280 nm using an E1% of 7.9 cm–1 and a molecular weight of 115,000 Da. Rabbit actin was purified by the method of Spudich & Watt (35Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its molar concentration was determined by its absorbance at 280 nm using an E1% of 11.08 cm–1 and a molecular weight of 40,000 Da. The preparation of pyrene-labeled actin was as previously described (36Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Phalloidin (Sigma) stabilized F-actin was made by incubating a solution of 10 μm pyrene-actin with 10 μm phalloidin overnight in experimental buffer (20 mm MOPS pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C. CD and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Initial CD spectra were measured using 0.5 mg/ml samples of protein in 10 mm sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a Jasco 600 CD spectrophotometer from 190 to 250 nm using a 0.5 mm cell at 20 °C. For measurement of melting, the temperature was adjusted and allowed to equilibrate for at least 5 min at each temperature before recording a spectrum. Exact cell temperature was recorded using a platinum resistance thermocouple mounted against the cell surface. Melting plots were then produced from a cross section through the spectra at the 222 nm peak. Fluorescence titrations were measured at 20 °C using a Perkin Elmer 50B spectrofluorimeter, exciting at 365 nm with a 10-nm bandwidth and measuring emission at 405 nm with a 15-nm bandwidth. A total working volume of 2 ml was used in a constantly stirred 10 × 10 mm cell. Autotitrations were made by the continuous addition up to 50 μl of a concentrated S1 stock solution using a Harvard Apparatus Syringe Infusion Pump 22 driving a 100-μl glass syringe (Hamilton) as described previously (37Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Data were acquired over a period of 250 s, with data points being collected every 0.5 s, using an integration time of 0.45 s. Recorded data were corrected for the dilution effect (a maximum of 2.5%) before analysis. Buffer solutions for the titrations were syringe-filtered (0.22 μm) to reduce background noise in the stirred cell. Mixing and equilibration of the reaction in the cell were checked as detailed previously to ensure that the reaction was effectively at equilibrium on the time scale of the experiment (37Maytum R. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cosedimentation and Quantitative Electrophoresis—Cosedimentation assays were performed by mixing actin with tropomyosins at the concentrations specified in the standard assay buffer (20 mm MOPS pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) in a total volume of 100 μl. These were then incubated at 20 °C for 20 min. The actin was then pelleted (along with any bound proteins) by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 minutes (Beckmann TLA110). Equivalent samples of pellet and supernatant were then separated by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (38Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) using 13.5% acrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. Gel quantification was carried out using an Epson 4990 Photo scanner with transparency adapter attached to a computer. The scanner was calibrated using an Agfa Agfatrans (Agfa) density step tablet and scanned TIFF images were analyzed using the Image-PC program (Scion Corp. based upon NIH-Image). Electron Microscopy and Helical Reconstruction—Tm (20 μm) was combined with F-actin (20 μm) at room temperature (∼25 °C). After ∼10 min of incubation the sample was diluted 40-fold and applied to carbon-coated electron microscope grids and negatively stained as previously described (39Moody C. Lehman W. Craig R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electron micrograph images of decorated filaments were recorded on a Philips CM120 electron microscope at ×60,000 magnification under low dose conditions (∼12e–/Å2). Micrographs were digitized at a pixel size corresponding to 0.7 nm in the filaments. Well-stained regions of filaments were selected and straightened as before (40Hodgkinson J.L. Marston S.B. Craig R. Vibert P. Lehman W. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2398-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 41Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Helical reconstruction was carried out by standard methods (42DeRosier D.J. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 43Amos L.A. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 44Owen C.H. Morgan D.G. DeRosier D.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as previously described (6Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Production and Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The clones of yeast TPM1 and TPM2 were available from previous work, both with and without sequence encoding the N-terminal Ala-Ser- extension commonly used to substitute for N-terminal acetylation in recombinant versions expressed in E. coli (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences for the genes actually encodes (Met)-Ala-Ser-, but the N-terminal Met is removed post-translationally to leave just the dipeptide extension on the yTm1n2 and yTm2n2 proteins (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), as shown for other similar N-terminal sequences (16Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Novy R.E. Liu L.F. Lin C.S. Helfman D.M. Lin J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To simplify nomenclature in this article, henceforth all constructs will be assumed to have the dipeptide extension unless otherwise stated and will just be referred to as yTm1 and yTm2. The new constructs made for this work were based upon deletion of both of the 38-residue internal repeats found in the yTm1 sequence as shown in Fig. 1A. Three versions of this construct were planned, a native form without any extension, one with the Ala-Ser- extension and another based on the native form, but with the C-terminal residue deleted. The latter (ΔC) version was made to facilitate future crystallization trials, as it had been previously shown that deletion of the C-terminal Leu of native acetylated Tm prevented binding to actin (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the clones showed all to have the correct sequence, apart from one of the two yTm1 clones sequenced, which contained a mutation of the first Met of the native sequence to Thr. This is an unusual mutation as it is within the primer sequence used for PCR and would be unlikely unless there is an error in the primer resulting in all clones containing the error. As this M1T mutation was within the N-terminal region that has been shown to have significant effects upon Tm regulatory properties (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), protein was produced and characterized along with the other clones. Yields after purification were good for all clones (10–30 mg/liter cells), and within the range previously shown for yTm1 and yTm2 constructs (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of each purified protein was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Predicted masses are 14952.4, 14922.3, 14794.2, and 14681.1 for 1d23, 1d23M1T, 1d23-Ac, and 1d23ΔC, respectively. Determined masses were 14952.0, 14927.0, 14794.0, and 14681.0 corresponding within the expected error for these measurements. Tropomyosin Binding to Actin—Initial qualitative binding studies of the constructs were done by adding an excess of each of the Tms (∼3 μm) to 10 μm F-actin and quantifying bound and free Tm on a gel as detailed previously (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The gel in Fig. 2 shows comparison of binding of yTm1, yTm2, and yTm1d23 constructs. Although not further included in this study, the inclusion of yTm2n2 allows comparison of 5, 4, and 3 actin-spanning Tms (∼199, 161, and 123 residues, respectively) on a single gel. All of the yeast tropomyosin constructs run at higher than their expected weight on SDS-PAGE. The new yTm1d23 (referred to henceforth as 1d23) constructs run approximately halfway between the 14-kDa and 23-kDa markers, significantly higher than their <15-kDa size. The gel shows all the 1d23 constructs behaved as would be predicted from previous work (12Maytum R. Geeves M.A. Konrad M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11913-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Maytum R. Konrad M. Lehrer S.S. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7334-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Ala-Ser- versions of the 1d23 and 1d23M1T constructs bind to actin with a similar affinity to that previously characterized for yTm1 and yTm2 (1d23M1T not shown in Fig. 2, but see Fig. 3 and Table 1). Also as expected there is no significant binding of either the unacetylated-Ac native or -AcΔC versions. The gel also shows however that an yTm1ΔC construct retains some binding affinity to actin.FIGURE 3Binding curves of 1d23 (open squares) and 1d23M1T (filled circles) to actin determined by cosedimentation of increasing concentrations of Tm (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 μm) with 10 μm actin as described in the legend to Fig. 2. After separation by SDS-PAGE the concentrations of free and bound tropomyosin were determined by quantitative scanning of the Coomassie blue-stained gels. For simplicity the y-axis is plotted as the staining ratio, the ratio of the absorbance of the Tm/actin bands in the pellet. Curve fits to the data using the Hill equation are shown as solid lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Binding data of Tms to actin (data for skTm and yTm1 from Maytum et al.
