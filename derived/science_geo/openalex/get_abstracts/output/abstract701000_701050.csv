https://openalex.org/W4296701485,"Although melanoma is notorious for its high degree of heterogeneity and plasticity1,2, the origin and magnitude of cell-state diversity remains poorly understood. Equally, it is unclear whether growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. Here, by combining mouse genetics, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying the cell-fate specification and differentiation of the embryonic neural crest. We show that tumorigenic competence is associated with a spatially localized perivascular niche, a phenotype acquired through an intercellular communication pathway established by endothelial cells. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of cells are fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells with a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumour growth but, instead, constitute a pool of metastatic initiating cells that switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Our data provide a spatially and temporally resolved map of the diversity and trajectories of melanoma cell states and suggest that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of cells. The observation that these phenotypic competencies can be dynamically acquired after exposure to specific niche signals warrant the development of therapeutic strategies that interfere with the cancer cell reprogramming activity of such microenvironmental cues. A hierarchical model of melanoma tumour growth mirrors the cellular and molecular logic of cell-fate specification and differentiation of the underlying embryonic neural crest, and suggests that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of cells."
https://openalex.org/W4296907580,"Abstract Faculty hiring and retention determine the composition of the US academic workforce and directly shape educational outcomes 1 , careers 2 , the development and spread of ideas 3 and research priorities 4,5 . However, hiring and retention are dynamic, reflecting societal and academic priorities, generational turnover and efforts to diversify the professoriate along gender 6–8 , racial 9 and socioeconomic 10 lines. A comprehensive study of the structure and dynamics of the US professoriate would elucidate the effects of these efforts and the processes that shape scholarship more broadly. Here we analyse the academic employment and doctoral education of tenure-track faculty at all PhD-granting US universities over the decade 2011–2020, quantifying stark inequalities in faculty production, prestige, retention and gender. Our analyses show universal inequalities in which a small minority of universities supply a large majority of faculty across fields, exacerbated by patterns of attrition and reflecting steep hierarchies of prestige. We identify markedly higher attrition rates among faculty trained outside the United States or employed by their doctoral university. Our results indicate that gains in women’s representation over this decade result from demographic turnover and earlier changes made to hiring, and are unlikely to lead to long-term gender parity in most fields. These analyses quantify the dynamics of US faculty hiring and retention, and will support efforts to improve the organization, composition and scholarship of the US academic workforce."

Here, using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Env protein immunogen priming in rhesus monkeys followed by a long period without further immunization, we demonstrate germinal centre B (BGC) cells that last for at least 6 months. A 186-fold increase in BGC cells was present by week 10 compared with conventional immunization. Single-cell transcriptional profiling showed that both light- and dark-zone germinal centre states were sustained. Antibody somatic hypermutation of BGC cells continued to accumulate throughout the 29-week priming period, with evidence of selective pressure. Env-binding BGC cells were still 49-fold above baseline at 29 weeks, which suggests that they could remain active for even longer periods of time. High titres of HIV-neutralizing antibodies were generated after a single booster immunization. Fully glycosylated HIV trimer protein is a complex antigen, posing considerable immunodominance challenges for B cells1,2. Memory B cells generated under these long priming conditions had higher levels of antibody somatic hypermutation, and both memory B cells and antibodies were more likely to recognize non-immunodominant epitopes. Numerous BGC cell lineage phylogenies spanning more than the 6-month germinal centre period were identified, demonstrating continuous germinal centre activity and selection for at least 191 days with no further antigen exposure. A long-prime, slow-delivery (12 days) immunization approach holds promise for difficult vaccine targets and suggests that patience can have great value for tuning of germinal centres to maximize antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W4296691527,"Medulloblastoma (MB) comprises a group of heterogeneous paediatric embryonal neoplasms of the hindbrain with strong links to early development of the hindbrain1–4. Mutations that activate Sonic hedgehog signalling lead to Sonic hedgehog MB in the upper rhombic lip (RL) granule cell lineage5–8. By contrast, mutations that activate WNT signalling lead to WNT MB in the lower RL9,10. However, little is known about the more commonly occurring group 4 (G4) MB, which is thought to arise in the unipolar brush cell lineage3,4. Here we demonstrate that somatic mutations that cause G4 MB converge on the core binding factor alpha (CBFA) complex and mutually exclusive alterations that affect CBFA2T2, CBFA2T3, PRDM6, UTX and OTX2. CBFA2T2 is expressed early in the progenitor cells of the cerebellar RL subventricular zone in Homo sapiens, and G4 MB transcriptionally resembles these progenitors but are stalled in developmental time. Knockdown of OTX2 in model systems relieves this differentiation blockade, which allows MB cells to spontaneously proceed along normal developmental differentiation trajectories. The specific nature of the split human RL, which is destined to generate most of the neurons in the human brain, and its high level of susceptible EOMES+KI67+ unipolar brush cell progenitor cells probably predisposes our species to the development of G4 MB. Derailed differentiation of human-specific progenitors of the developing cerebellar rhombic lip is the cause of group 4 medulloblastoma, the most common childhood brain tumour."
https://openalex.org/W4296700653,"Most current therapies that target plasma membrane receptors function by antagonizing ligand binding or enzymatic activities. However, typical mammalian proteins comprise multiple domains that execute discrete but coordinated activities. Thus, inhibition of one domain often incompletely suppresses the function of a protein. Indeed, targeted protein degradation technologies, including proteolysis-targeting chimeras1 (PROTACs), have highlighted clinically important advantages of target degradation over inhibition2. However, the generation of heterobifunctional compounds binding to two targets with high affinity is complex, particularly when oral bioavailability is required3. Here we describe the development of proteolysis-targeting antibodies (PROTABs) that tether cell-surface E3 ubiquitin ligases to transmembrane proteins, resulting in target degradation both in vitro and in vivo. Focusing on zinc- and ring finger 3 (ZNRF3), a Wnt-responsive ligase, we show that this approach can enable colorectal cancer-specific degradation. Notably, by examining a matrix of additional cell-surface E3 ubiquitin ligases and transmembrane receptors, we demonstrate that this technology is amendable for 'on-demand' degradation. Furthermore, we offer insights on the ground rules governing target degradation by engineering optimized antibody formats. In summary, this work describes a strategy for the rapid development of potent, bioavailable and tissue-selective degraders of cell-surface proteins."

https://openalex.org/W4296700534,"Medulloblastoma, a malignant childhood cerebellar tumour, segregates molecularly into biologically distinct subgroups, suggesting that a personalized approach to therapy would be beneficial1. Mouse modelling and cross-species genomics have provided increasing evidence of discrete, subgroup-specific developmental origins2. However, the anatomical and cellular complexity of developing human tissues3—particularly within the rhombic lip germinal zone, which produces all glutamatergic neuronal lineages before internalization into the cerebellar nodulus—makes it difficult to validate previous inferences that were derived from studies in mice. Here we use multi-omics to resolve the origins of medulloblastoma subgroups in the developing human cerebellum. Molecular signatures encoded within a human rhombic-lip-derived lineage trajectory aligned with photoreceptor and unipolar brush cell expression profiles that are maintained in group 3 and group 4 medulloblastoma, suggesting a convergent basis. A systematic diagnostic-imaging review of a prospective institutional cohort localized the putative anatomical origins of group 3 and group 4 tumours to the nodulus. Our results connect the molecular and phenotypic features of clinically challenging medulloblastoma subgroups to their unified beginnings in the rhombic lip in the early stages of human development. Multi-omic mapping shows that group 3 and group 4 medulloblastomas have a common, human-specific developmental origin in the cerebellar rhombic lip, providing a basis for their ambiguous molecular features and overlapping anatomical location, and for the difficulty of modelling these tumours in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4296699773,"Chitin, the most abundant aminopolysaccharide in nature, is an extracellular polymer consisting of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) units1. The key reactions of chitin biosynthesis are catalysed by chitin synthase2-4, a membrane-integrated glycosyltransferase that transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to a growing chitin chain. However, the precise mechanism of this process has yet to be elucidated. Here we report five cryo-electron microscopy structures of a chitin synthase from the devastating soybean root rot pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora sojae (PsChs1). They represent the apo, GlcNAc-bound, nascent chitin oligomer-bound, UDP-bound (post-synthesis) and chitin synthase inhibitor nikkomycin Z-bound states of the enzyme, providing detailed views into the multiple steps of chitin biosynthesis and its competitive inhibition. The structures reveal the chitin synthesis reaction chamber that has the substrate-binding site, the catalytic centre and the entrance to the polymer-translocating channel that allows the product polymer to be discharged. This arrangement reflects consecutive key events in chitin biosynthesis from UDP-GlcNAc binding and polymer elongation to the release of the product. We identified a swinging loop within the chitin-translocating channel, which acts as a 'gate lock' that prevents the substrate from leaving while directing the product polymer into the translocating channel for discharge to the extracellular side of the cell membrane. This work reveals the directional multistep mechanism of chitin biosynthesis and provides a structural basis for inhibition of chitin synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W4296693414,"The ability to program new modes of catalysis into proteins would allow the development of enzyme families with functions beyond those found in nature. To this end, genetic code expansion methodology holds particular promise, as it allows the site-selective introduction of new functional elements into proteins as noncanonical amino acid side chains1-4. Here we exploit an expanded genetic code to develop a photoenzyme that operates by means of triplet energy transfer (EnT) catalysis, a versatile mode of reactivity in organic synthesis that is not accessible to biocatalysis at present5-12. Installation of a genetically encoded photosensitizer into the beta-propeller scaffold of DA_20_00 (ref. 13) converts a de novo Diels-Alderase into a photoenzyme for [2+2] cycloadditions (EnT1.0). Subsequent development and implementation of a platform for photoenzyme evolution afforded an efficient and enantioselective enzyme (EnT1.3, up to 99% enantiomeric excess (e.e.)) that can promote intramolecular and bimolecular cycloadditions, including transformations that have proved challenging to achieve selectively with small-molecule catalysts. EnT1.3 performs >300 turnovers and, in contrast to small-molecule photocatalysts, can operate effectively under aerobic conditions and at ambient temperatures. An X-ray crystal structure of an EnT1.3-product complex shows how multiple functional components work in synergy to promote efficient and selective photocatalysis. This study opens up a wealth of new excited-state chemistry in protein active sites and establishes the framework for developing a new generation of enantioselective photocatalysts."
https://openalex.org/W4296552193,"Naturally evolved enzymes, despite their astonishingly large variety and functional diversity, operate predominantly through thermochemical activation. Integrating prominent photocatalysis modes into proteins, such as triplet energy transfer, could create artificial photoenzymes that expand the scope of natural biocatalysis1–3. Here, we exploit genetically reprogrammed, chemically evolved photoenzymes embedded with a synthetic triplet photosensitizer that are capable of excited-state enantio-induction4–6. Structural optimization through four rounds of directed evolution afforded proficient variants for the enantioselective intramolecular [2+2]-photocycloaddition of indole derivatives with good substrate generality and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% enantiomeric excess). A crystal structure of the photoenzyme–substrate complex elucidated the non-covalent interactions that mediate the reaction stereochemistry. This study expands the energy transfer reactivity7–10 of artificial triplet photoenzymes in a supramolecular protein cavity and unlocks an integrated approach to valuable enantioselective photochemical synthesis that is not accessible with either the synthetic or the biological world alone. Triplet photoenzymes developed through genetic encoding and directed evolution result in excited-state photocatalysts that provide a valuable approach to enantioselective photochemical synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4296700072,"Clinical outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are highly heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The factors underlying this heterogeneity remain insufficiently understood. Genetic association studies have suggested that genetic variants contribute to the heterogeneity of COVID-19 outcomes, but the underlying potential causal mechanisms are insufficiently understood. Here we show that common variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, homozygous in approximately 3% of the world's population1 and associated with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and anti-tumour immunity2-5, affect COVID-19 outcome in a mouse model that recapitulates increased susceptibility conferred by male sex and advanced age. Mice bearing the APOE2 or APOE4 variant exhibited rapid disease progression and poor survival outcomes relative to mice bearing the most prevalent APOE3 allele. APOE2 and APOE4 mice exhibited increased viral loads as well as suppressed adaptive immune responses early after infection. In vitro assays demonstrated increased infection in the presence of APOE2 and APOE4 relative to APOE3, indicating that differential outcomes are mediated by differential effects of APOE variants on both viral infection and antiviral immunity. Consistent with these in vivo findings in mice, our results also show that APOE genotype is associated with survival in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK Biobank (candidate variant analysis, P = 2.6 × 10-7). Our findings suggest APOE genotype to partially explain the heterogeneity of COVID-19 outcomes and warrant prospective studies to assess APOE genotyping as a means of identifying patients at high risk for adverse outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4296770177,"Cholinergic neurons in the medial septum (MS) constitute a major source of cholinergic input to the forebrain and modulate diverse functions, including sensory processing, memory, and attention. Most studies to date have treated cholinergic neurons as a single population; as such, the organizational principles underling their functional diversity remain unknown. Here, we identified two subsets (D28K+ versus D28K-) of cholinergic neurons that are topographically segregated in mice, Macaca fascicularis, and humans. These cholinergic subpopulations possess unique electrophysiological signatures, express mutually exclusive marker genes (kcnh1 and aifm3 versus cacna1h and gga3), and make differential connections with physiologically distinct neuronal classes in the hippocampus to form two structurally defined and functionally distinct circuits. Gain- and loss-of-function studies on these circuits revealed their differential roles in modulation of anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory. These results provide a molecular and circuitry-based theory for how cholinergic neurons contribute to their diverse behavioral functions."

IntroductionIn the natural world, animals continuously face the problem of deciding whether to approach, avoid, or ignore a novel stimulus.

Behavioral responses to novelty have been modeled in different ways across fields. Within the field of reinforcement learning (RL), novelty is often thought of as either a rewarding outcome or a predictor of a potential reward, thereby prompting exploration before the first rewards are received (Kakade, and Dayan, 2002Kakade S. Dayan P. Dopamine: Generalization and bonuses.Neural Netw. 2002; 15: 549-559https://doi.org/10.1016/S0893-6080(02)00048-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar; Xu et al., 2021Xu H.A.

Biol. 2021; 17: e1009070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this way, novelty can be incorporated into existing RL frameworks. Similarly, artificial intelligence models have been created that are “curious” or intrinsically motivated (Colas et al., 2019Colas C. Fournier P. Chetouani M. Sigaud O. Oudeyer P.-Y. CURIOUS: Intrinsically motivated modular multi-goal reinforcement learning.in: Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning.

Massachusetts University, 2005Crossref Google Scholar). Some of these models use information gain, a reduction in the difference between the current event and what was expected over time, to define event novelty (Jaegle et al., 2019Jaegle A. Mehrpour V. Rust N. Visual novelty, curiosity, and intrinsic reward in machine learning and the brain.Curr. Opin.

In search of the neural circuits of intrinsic motivation.Front. Neurosci. 2007; 1: 225-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, although many computational models of novelty capture the neophilic aspects of novelty behavior, they fail to capture the neophobia and the interplay between approach and avoidance in response to novelty, observed in natural novelty responses.Dopamine regulates reward-related behaviors, and electrophysiology studies have shown that dopamine signals the discrepancy between actual and predicted reward value (Montague et al., 1996Montague P.R. Dayan P. Sejnowski T.J. A framework for mesencephalic dopamine systems based on predictive Hebbian learning.J.

In RL, dopamine can be used as an evaluation signal to reinforce a rewarding action. However, recent studies have found that some dopamine neurons are activated by novelty (Horvitz et al., 1997Horvitz J.C. Stewart T. Jacobs B.L.

Importantly, the canonical dopamine system—comprising those neurons that project from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the ventral striatum (VS)—does not respond to novel stimuli at the population level (Menegas et al., 2017Menegas W.

Recent studies in monkeys also found that dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) do not respond to novelty per se (Ogasawara et al., 2022Ogasawara T. Sogukpinar F. Zhang K.

Functionally, TS-projecting dopamine neurons facilitate avoidance of a threatening stimulus, including a novel object (Menegas et al., 2018Menegas W. Akiti K. Amo R. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M. Dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum reinforce avoidance of threatening stimuli.Nat.

First, previous studies treated novelty-related behavior as a binary choice of either approach (orient, saccade) or avoidance and often ignored the behavioral complexity, dynamics, and individual variability that are essential to understand the computations underlying novelty responses. Variability in the novelty-triggered behavioral data had even been interpreted as experimental deficits (Corey, 1978Corey D.T. The determinants of exploration and neophobia.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1978; 2: 235-253https://doi.org/10.1016/0149-7634(78)90033-7Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, individual variability is an important factor to understand the neural computations (Marder, and Goaillard, 2006Marder E. Goaillard J.-M. Variability, compensation and homeostasis in neuron and network function.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 563-574https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Second, many previous studies were conducted in constrained environments that limited behavioral choices (Menegas et al., 2017Menegas W. Babayan B.M. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M.

It has been reported that animals respond differently to novel objects depending on whether they are in a small environment (“forced exposure”) or in a sufficiently large enclosure to be able to choose between exploring or totally avoiding a novel object (“voluntary exploration”) (Corey, 1978Corey D.T. The determinants of exploration and neophobia.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1978; 2: 235-253https://doi.org/10.1016/0149-7634(78)90033-7Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar; Rebec et al., 1997Rebec G.V.

Third, the definition of novelty has varied across studies. Recent studies emphasize the computational difference between stimulus novelty and contextual novelty: the former refers to the quality of not being previously experienced or encountered, and the latter refers to the “surprise” when what is experienced does not match with what was expected in time and/or context (i.e., prediction error) (Barto et al., 2013Barto A.

Novelty is not surprise: Human exploratory and adaptive behavior in sequential decision-making.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2021; 17: e1009070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar).In this study, we used machine learning to characterize individual variability in behavioral novelty responses while mice freely explored a novel object placed in a large arena. We subsequently examined the effects of two types of novelty, the first in which a mouse explored a new stimulus (“stimulus novelty”) and the second in which a mouse explored a familiar stimulus in a new location (“contextual novelty”). These different novelty manipulations induced distinct patterns of behavior, which were differentially affected by ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons. The diversity and the dynamics of the observed novelty behaviors were well captured by a simple RL model, which incorporates the concepts of initial estimation (“shaping bonus”) and uncertainty. We propose that novelty avoidance is a critical defensive strategy in which a novel stimulus causes default estimation of potential threat when the outcome is unknown. Because death or significant injury prevent learning, the brain may have adapted to estimate the degree of threat posed by a novel object through its physical salience, signaled by dopamine in the TS.ResultsNovelty triggers diverse behaviors with a stereotypical risk-assessment responseWe designed an open arena novelty exploration paradigm (Figure 1). Mouse movements were captured using an overhead camera that recorded four channels: three color channels (RGB) and one channel for depth (Microsoft Kinect). DeepLabCut (Mathis et al., 2018Mathis A. Mamidanna P. Cury K.M. Abe T. Murthy V.N. Mathis M.W. Bethge M. DeepLabCut: markerless pose estimation of user-defined body parts with deep learning.Nat.

On the first day of novelty (N1), when the mice were first encountering the object, they exhibited diverse behaviors; some spent more and some spent less time within the object area compared with habituation days (Figure 1B). The observed diversity was not random noise because time spent near the object (see STAR Methods) in each individual was strongly correlated across sessions (Figure 1B). Novel object approach frequency and approach bout duration also varied across mice, although both of these parameters co-varied within a given mouse (Figures 1C and 1D).Close examination of nose and tail trajectories revealed that during the first several approach bouts, mice oriented themselves to face the object (Figure 2). As a result, when the mouse reached the closest point to the object, the closest body part was always the nose, not the tail (Figure 2C, N1). These data suggest that the novelty response characterized by “approach with tail behind” is unique to early interactions with a novel object.Figure 2Stereotypic behavioral response to noveltyShow full caption(A) Trajectory of nose or tail (in red and black, respectively) from an example mouse in the first 20 bouts of each session.(B) Nose and tail position relative to object in an example animal.(C) The closest position to object within each bout for nose and tail in an example animal.(D) Frequency of approach bout with tail behind.

The frequency of approach with the tail behind decreased over time (Figure 2D). Over the course of the first day, some mice started to expose their tails to the object, while some mice did not expose their tails to the object during entire sessions (Figure 2E).Thus, mice exhibit a robust and stereotyped response at the beginning of interactions with a novel object, one that resembles a form of behavior described as “risk assessment” (Blanchard et al., 1991Blanchard D.C.

In contrast, post-assessment behaviors were diverse, with individual animals exhibiting a wide spectrum of approach or avoidance behaviors. We operationally refer to post-assessment approach as “tail exposure engagement,” to distinguish it from risk assessment.Post-assessment engagement is suppressed by stimulus noveltyInitial encounters with a novel object inevitably include both stimulus novelty (as the object has not yet been encountered) and contextual novelty (as the object has not been encountered in any context). In order to understand that the stimulus is novel, the brain has to search its stored memory of all objects encountered in the past (Barto et al., 2013Barto A. Mirolli M. Baldassarre G. Novelty or surprise?.Front. Psychol. 2013; 4: 907Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To understand that, in addition, the object is unexpected in the current context, the brain has to compare the current state with the predicted state (Ranganath, and Rainer, 2003Ranganath C. Rainer G. Neural mechanisms for detecting and remembering novel events.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 193-202https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar).To separate the impact of different kinds of novelty on behavior, we incorporated object pre-exposure into our behavioral paradigm (Figure 3), which dramatically changed the animal’s reaction to the object in test sessions. As shown above (Figures 1 and 2), some mice spent more time near a novel object on N1, while others spent less (Figure 3A, left). In contrast, mice consistently approached an unexpected familiar object (Figure 3A, middle). As a population, mice with an unexpected familiar object spent significantly more time near the object than mice with a novel object (Figure 3A, right); they exhibited a limited tail-behind approach and quickly switched to tail exposure (Figure 3B). Mice interacting with a novel object used the tail-behind approach significantly more frequently than mice with an unexpected familiar object and used the tail-exposure approach significantly less frequently (Figures 3B and 3C).Figure 3Suppression of post-assessment engagement with stimulus noveltyShow full caption(A) Time spent near an object.

However, in response to an unexpected familiar object, mice exhibited a quick transition to an approach with tail exposure (engagement), suggesting that stimulus novelty suppresses engagement.Ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons biases post-assessment behavior toward approachTo understand the computational role of dopamine in the TS in novelty-driven behaviors, we performed ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons with 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) (Figures 4 and S1). Consistent with our previous study (Menegas et al., 2018Menegas W. Akiti K. Amo R. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M. Dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum reinforce avoidance of threatening stimuli.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1421-1430https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0222-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), animals with the ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons spent more time near a novel object than animals with the injection of a vehicle (Figure 4B) and showed longer duration of approach bouts (Figure S2). When analyzing risk assessment and engagement, all ablation mice as well as sham-lesioned animals expressed approach with the tail behind in early periods of N1 (Figure 4C, left). After risk assessment, more ablation mice showed a transition to the tail exposure approach, resulting in a higher frequency of tail exposure as a population (Figures 4C and 4D).Figure 4Ablation of TS-projecting dopamine neurons promotes post-assessment engagementShow full caption(A) Coronal sections (bregma −1.5 mm) from sham (left) and ablation (right) animals.

https://openalex.org/W4296797655,"Magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) is a novel reliable technique with excellent potential for thermal therapies and treating breast tumours. This method involves injecting a magnetic nanofluid into the tumour and applying an external AC magnetic field to induce heat in the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and raise the tumour temperature to ablation temperature ranges. Because of the complexity of considering and coupling all different physics involves in this phenomenon and also due to the intricacy of a thorough FEM numerical study, few FEM-based studies address the entire MFH process as similar to reality as possible. The current study investigates a FEM-based three-dimensional numerical simulation of MFH of breast tumours as a multi-physics problem. An anatomically realistic breast phantom (ARBP) is considered, some magnetic nanofluid is injected inside the tumour, and the diffusion phenomenon is simulated. Then, the amount of heat generated in the MNP-saturated tumour area due to an external AC magnetic field is simulated. In the end, the fraction of tumour tissue necrotized by this temperature rise is evaluated. The study's results demonstrate that by injecting nanofluid and utilizing seven circular copper windings with each coil carrying 400 A current with a frequency of 400 kHz for generating the external AC magnetic field, the temperature in tumour tissue can be raised to a maximum of about 51.4°C, which leads to necrosis of entire tumour tissue after 30 minutes of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure. This numerical platform can depict all four various physics involved in the MFH of breast tumours by numerically solving all different equation sets coupled together with high precision. Thus, the proposed model can be utilized by clinicians as a reliable tool for predicting and identifying the approximate amount of temperature rise and the necrotic fraction of breast tumour, which can be very useful to opt for the best MFH therapeutic procedure and conditions based on various patients. In future works, this numerical platform's results should be compared with experimental in-vivo results to improve and modify this platform in order to be ready for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4296807937,"Background and purpose Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a group of microvascular occlusive disorders that presents with neurological involvement in up to 87% of the cases. Although the central nervous system (CNS) is an important target organ in TMA, the role of neurological manifestations in the disease clinical course is not well established. In this study, we described the neurological manifestations and CNS radiological aspects in patients with a first, acute TMA event. We also examined the association between severe neurological involvement and adverse clinical outcomes in TMA. Methods A cohort of patients diagnosed with a first TMA event between 1995 and 2016 was included, their medical charts and imaging tests were retrospectively evaluated. Results A total of 49 patients were included, 85.7% were women and the mean age was 36.5 years-old (SD 13.0). Neurological manifestations were described in 85.7% of the patients, most of them (88%) were considered severe and consisted of confusion, compromised sensorimotor function, stupor, seizures, and personality change. Imaging tests were performed in 62% of the patients with neurological manifestations and detected acute CNS lesions, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were observed, in 7 (27%) of them. While the need for intensive care unit admission was greater and longer among patients with severe neurological manifestations, the number of plasma exchange sessions, the total duration of hospitalization and in-hospital death were similar between groups. Conclusions Severe neurological manifestations are common in first TMA events and are responsible for a worse disease presentation at admission. While the effect of neurological manifestations on acute TMA clinical course seems to be modest, these manifestations may have an important impact on the development of chronic cognitive impairment, which highlights the need for proper diagnosis and treatment."

Mutated wild KAZ with 16 amino acid substitutions (nanoKAZ/nanoLuc) utilizes bis -coelenterazine ( bis -CTZ) as the preferred substrate and exhibits over 10-fold higher maximum intensity than CTZ. To understand the substrate selectivity of nanoKAZ between CTZ and bis -CTZ, we prepared the reverse mutants of nanoKAZ by amino acid replacements with the original amino acid residue of wild KAZ. The reverse mutant with L18Q and V27L substitutions (QL-nanoKAZ) exhibited 2.6-fold higher maximum intensity with CTZ than that of nanoKAZ with bis -CTZ. The catalytic properties of QL-nanoKAZ including substrate specificity, luminescence spectrum, luminescence kinetics, luminescence products of CTZ, and luminescence inhibition by deaza-CTZ analogs were characterized and were compared with other CTZ-utilizing luciferases such as Gaussia and Renilla luciferases. Thus, QL-nanoKAZ with CTZ could be used as a potential reporter protein for various luminescence assay systems. Furthermore, the crystal structure of QL-nanoKAZ was determined at 1.70 Å resolution. The reverse mutation at the L18Q and V27L positions of α2-helix in nanoKAZ led to changes in the local structures of the α4-helix and the β6- and β7-sheets, and might enhance its binding affinity and oxidation efficiency with CTZ to emit light."
https://openalex.org/W4296793393,"Background Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is curable if detected in its early stages. However, the clinical recognition of CMM is challenging. An American research group has shown promising results in detecting CMM based on RNA profiles sampled from suspicious lesions with tape strips. We aim to further develop this technique and validate if RNA profiles sampled with tape strips can detect CMM. Methods This prospective cohort study will include approximately 200 lesions clinically suspected of CMM requiring surgical removal. Tape stripping of the lesions will be performed just before surgical excision. Subsequently, RNA on the tape strips is analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan technology. The results are combined into a binary outcome where positive indicates CMM and negative indicates no CMM. The histopathological diagnosis of the lesions will be used as the gold standard. The main outcome is the results of the RNA test and the histopathological diagnosis, which, combined, provide the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Discussion The accuracy of the clinical examination in CMM diagnostics is limited. This clinical trial will explore the ability to use RNA analysis to improve the management of suspicious lesions by enhancing early diagnostic accuracy. Hopefully, it can reduce the number of benign lesions being surgically removed to rule out CMM and decrease patient morbidity.

https://openalex.org/W4296798147,"Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common skin cancer and one of the most aggressive cancers and its incidence has risen dramatically over the past few decades. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of cutaneous melanoma. Nevertheless, the dynamics modulation of the immune and stromal components in the TME is not fully understood. In this study, 471 CM samples were obtained from TCGA database, and the ratio of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) in the TME were estimated using the ESTIMATE algorithms and CIBERSORT computational method. The differently expressed genes (DEGs) were applied to GO and KEGG function enrichment analysis, establishment of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and univariate Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, we identified a predictive factor: HLA-DRB1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1) by the intersection analysis of the hub genes of PPI network and the genes associated with the prognosis of the CM patients obtained by univariate Cox regression analysis. Correlation analysis and survival analysis showed that the expression level of HLA-DRB1 was negatively correlated with the Stage of the patients while positively correlated with the survival, prognosis and TME of melanoma. The GEPIA web server and the representative immunohistochemical images of HLA-DRB1 in the normal skin tissue and melanoma tissue from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database were applied to validate the expression level of HLA-DRB1. CIBERSORT analysis for the ratio of TICs indicated that 9 types of TICs were positively correlated with the expression level of HLA-DRB1 and only 4 types of TICs were negatively correlated with the expression level of HLA-DRB1. These results suggested that the expression level of HLA-DRB1 may be related to the immune activity of the TME and may affect the prognosis of CM patients by changing the status of the TME."
https://openalex.org/W4296806924,"Background Linear and parallel are the two leading models of metastatic progression. In this study we propose a simple way to differentiate between them. While the linear model predicts accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations within the primary tumor by founder cells before spreading as waves of metastases, the parallel model suggests preclinical distribution of less advanced disseminated tumor cells with independent selection and expansion at the ectopic sites. Due to identical clonal origin and time of dispatching, linear metastases are expected to have comparable diameters in any specific organ while parallel metastases are expected to appear in variable sizes. Methods and findings Retrospective revision of chest CT of oncological patients with lung metastases was performed. Metastasis number and largest diameters were recorded. The sum number of metastases with a similar diameter (c) and those without (i) was counted and the linear/parallel ratio (LPR) was calculated for each patient using the formula (∑c-∑i)/(∑c+∑i). A LPR ratio of 1 implies pure linear progression pattern and -1 pure parallel. 12,887 metastases were measured in 503 patients with nine malignancy types. The median LPR of the entire group was 0.71 (IQR 0.14–0.93). In carcinomas of the pancreas, prostate, and thyroid the median LPR was 1. Median LPRs were 0.91, 0.65, 0.60, 0.58, 0.50 and 0.43 in renal cell carcinomas, melanomas, colorectal, breast, bladder, and sarcomas, respectively. Conclusions Metastatic spread of thyroid, pancreas, and prostate tumors is almost exclusively by a linear route. The spread of kidney, melanoma, colorectal, breast, bladder and sarcoma is both linear and parallel with increasing dominance of the parallel route in this order. These findings can explain and predict the clinical and genomic features of these tumors and can potentially be used for evaluation of metastatic origin in the individual patient."
https://openalex.org/W4296810245,"Caspase-2 is a member of the caspase family that exhibits both apoptotic and non-apoptotic properties, and has been shown to mediate synaptic deficits in models of several neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and Lewy Body dementia (LBD). Our lab previously reported that caspase-2 protein levels are elevated in these diseases, leading us to hypothesize that elevated caspase-2 protein levels are due to increased transcription of caspase-2 mRNA. There are two major isoforms of caspase-2 mRNA, caspase-2L and caspase-2S. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the levels of these mRNA isoforms normalized to levels of RPL13 mRNA, a reference gene that showed no disease-associated changes. Here, we report no increases in caspase-2L mRNA levels in any of the three diseases studied, AD (with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), HD and LBD, disproving our hypothesis. Caspase-2S mRNA showed a non-significant downward trend in AD. We also analyzed expression levels of SNAP25 and βIII-tubulin mRNA. SNAP25 mRNA was significantly lower in AD and there were downward trends in MCI, LBD, and HD. βIII-tubulin mRNA expression remained unchanged between disease groups and controls. These findings indicate that factors besides transcriptional regulation cause increases in caspase-2 protein levels. The reduction of SNAP25 mRNA expression suggests that presynaptic dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits in neurodegeneration."

Studies of metabolites released into the extracellular space (secretome) allow understanding the metabolic dynamics of tissues and changes caused by therapeutic interventions. Although quite advanced in the field of proteomics, studies on the secretome of low molecular weight metabolites (< 1500 Da) are still very scarce. We present an untargeted metabolomic protocol based on the hybrid technique of liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry for the analysis of low-molecular-weight metabolites released into the culture medium by 3D cultures and co-culture (secretome model). For that we analyzed HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in 3D-monoculture and 3D-co-culture. The putative identification of the metabolites indicated a sort of metabolites, among them arachidonic acid, glyceric acid, docosapentaenoic acid and beta-Alanine which are related to cancer and obesity. This protocol represents a possibility to list metabolites released in the extracellular environment in a comprehensive and untargeted manner, opening the way for the generation of metabolic hypotheses that will certainly contribute to the understanding of tissue metabolism, tissue-tissue interactions, and metabolic responses to the most varied interventions. Moreover, it brings the potential to determine novel pathways and accurately identify biomarkers in cancer and other diseases. The metabolites indicated in our study have a close relationship with the tumor microenvironment in accordance with the literature review."
https://openalex.org/W4296801112,"Introduction Medical tourism is characterized by people seeking treatment abroad for various medical conditions due to varied reasons, many of whom benefit from specialized care for non-communicable diseases. Conversely, there are associated negative effects such as medical complications and weakened health systems.

This study sought to compare patient-related factors associated with choice of cancer treatment center locally or abroad, to understand reasons for seeking treatment outside Kenya. Materials and methods As a case-control study, 254 cancer patients were randomly sampled to compare responses from those who chose to receive initial treatment abroad or in Kenya. The cases were recruited from Ministry of Health while the controls from Kenyatta National Hospital and Texas Cancer Center. Data was analyzed using SPSS Software Version 21. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out. Level of significance was set at 5%. Results Out of 254 respondents, 174 (69.5%) were treated for cancer in Kenya and 80 (31.5%) in India. We found that cost effectiveness was a significant factor for over 73% of all respondents. The study revealed independent predictors for seeking treatment in India were: monthly income higher than US$ 250; every additional month from when disclosure to patients was done increased likelihood by 1.16 times; physician advice (Odds Ratio(OR) 66; 95% Confidence Interval(CI) 7.9–552.9); friends and family (OR 42; 95% CI 7.07–248.6); and perception of better quality of care (OR 22.5; 95% CI 2.2–230.6). Conclusion Reasons patients with cancer sought treatment in India are multifactorial. Several of these can be addressed to reverse out-ward bound medical tourism and contribute to improving the in-country cancer healthcare. It will require strengthening the health system accordingly and sensitizing the medical fraternity and general public on the same."

These interviews were thematically coded and analysed to address the research objectives.Despite most peer education programme activities being stopped, delayed, or disrupted during the pandemic and subsequent lockdown, some communication networks previously established, helped facilitate public health communication regarding COVID-19 and RKSK, between health workers, PEs, and adolescents. There was repurposing of RKSK health workers and PEs' role towards COVID-19 response-related activities. PEs, with support from health workers, were involved in disseminating COVID-19 information, maintaining migrant and quarantine records, conducting household surveys for recording COVID-19 active cases and providing essential items (grocery, sanitary napkins, etc.) to communities and adolescents.PEs with support from community health workers are able to play a crucial role in meeting the needs of the communities during a pandemic. There is a need to further engage, involve and build the skills of PEs to support the health system. PEs can be encouraged by granting more visibility and incorporating their role more formally by paying them within the public health system in India."
https://openalex.org/W4296712321,"The naturally occurring ectoparasite salmon lice (Lepeophtherirus salmonis) poses a great challenge for the salmon farming industry, as well as for wild salmonids in the Northern hemisphere. To better control the infestation pressure and protect the production, there is a need to provide fish farmers with sensitive and efficient tools for rapid early detection and monitoring of the parasitic load. This can be achieved by targeting L. salmonis DNA in environmental samples. Here, we developed and tested a new L. salmonis specific DNA-based assay (qPCR assay) for detection and quantification from seawater samples using an analytical pipeline compatible with the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) for autonomous water sample analysis of gene targets. Specificity of the L. salmonis qPCR assay was demonstrated through in-silico DNA analyses covering sequences of different L. salmonis isolates. Seawater was spiked with known numbers of nauplii and copepodite free-swimming (planktonic) stages of L. salmonis to investigate the relationship with the number of marker gene copies (MGC). Finally, field samples collected at different times of the year in the vicinity of a salmon production farm in Western Norway were analyzed for L. salmonis detection and quantification. The assay specificity was high and a high correlation between MGC and planktonic stages of L. salmonis was established in the laboratory conditions. In the field, L. salmonis DNA was consequently detected, but with MGC number below that expected for one copepodite or nauplii. We concluded that only L. salmonis tissue or eDNA residues were detected. This novel study opens for a fully automatized L. salmonis DNA quantification using ESP robotic to monitor the parasitic load, but challenges remain to exactly transfer information about eDNA quantities to decisions by the farmers and possible interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4296713158,"Large-scale climatic indices are extensively used as predictors of ecological processes, but the mechanisms and the spatio-temporal scales at which climatic indices influence these processes are often speculative. Here, we use long-term data to evaluate how a measure of individual breeding investment (the egg volume) of three long-lived and long-distance-migrating seabirds is influenced by i) a large-scale climatic index (the North Atlantic Oscillation) and ii) local-scale variables (food abundance, foraging conditions, and competition). Winter values of the North Atlantic Oscillation did not correlate with local-scale variables measured in spring, but surprisingly, both had a high predictive power of the temporal variability of the egg volume in the three study species, even though they have different life-history strategies. The importance of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation suggests carry-over effects of winter conditions on subsequent breeding investment. Interestingly, the most important local-scale variables measured in spring were associated with food detectability (foraging conditions) and the factors influencing its accessibility (foraging conditions and competition by density-dependence). Large-scale climatic indices may work better as predictors of foraging conditions when organisms perform long distance migrations, while local-scale variables are more appropriate when foraging areas are more restricted (e.g. during the breeding season). Contrary to what is commonly assumed, food abundance does not directly translate into food intake and its detectability and accessibility should be considered in the study of food-related ecological processes."
https://openalex.org/W4296793776,"T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a rare blood cancer with poor prognosis. Overexpression of the proto-oncogene TCL1A and missense mutations of the tumor suppressor ATM are putative main drivers of T-PLL development, but so far only little is known about the existence of T-PLL gene expression subtypes. We performed an in-depth computational reanalysis of 68 gene expression profiles of one of the largest currently existing T-PLL patient cohorts. Hierarchical clustering combined with bootstrapping revealed three robust T-PLL gene expression subgroups. Additional comparative analyses revealed similarities and differences of these subgroups at the level of individual genes, signaling and metabolic pathways, and associated gene regulatory networks. Differences were mainly reflected at the transcriptomic level, whereas gene copy number profiles of the three subgroups were much more similar to each other, except for few characteristic differences like duplications of parts of the chromosomes 7, 8, 14, and 22. At the network level, most of the 41 predicted potential major regulators showed subgroup-specific expression levels that differed at least in comparison to one other subgroup. Functional annotations suggest that these regulators contribute to differences between the subgroups by altering processes like immune responses, angiogenesis, cellular respiration, cell proliferation, apoptosis, or migration. Most of these regulators are known from other cancers and several of them have been reported in relation to leukemia (e.g. AHSP, CXCL8, CXCR2, ELANE, FFAR2, G0S2, GIMAP2, IL1RN, LCN2, MBTD1, PPP1R15A). The existence of the three revealed T-PLL subgroups was further validated by a classification of T-PLL patients from two other smaller cohorts. Overall, our study contributes to an improved stratification of T-PLL and the observed subgroup-specific molecular characteristics could help to develop urgently needed targeted treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4296794246,"In preterm and term infants who require intermediate or intensive care Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection can lead to significant morbidity. In this study MRSA colonization and infection were assessed in a mixed tertiary neonatal intensive and intermediate care unit in Germany over an 8-year period (2013–2020). We investigated patient-related factors, associated with nosocomial MRSA acquisition, and we discuss our infection control concept for MRSA. Of 3488 patients treated during the study period, 24 were MRSA positive patients, corresponding to 26 patient hospital stays. The incidence was 0.7 MRSA patients per 100 patients. The incidence density was 0.4 MRSA patient hospital stays per 1000 patient days. Twelve patients (50%) acquired MRSA in the hospital. One patient developed a hospital acquired MRSA bloodstream infection 9 days after birth (i.e., 0.03% of all patients on the ward during the study period). A total of 122 patients had to be screened to detect one MRSA positive patient. In a logistic regression model, the use of 3 rd generation intravenous cephalosporin (cefotaxim) was associated with nosocomial MRSA acquisition compared with matched control patients who did not acquire MRSA. In sum, the burden of MRSA colonization and infection in the ward was low during the study period. A comprehensive infection control concept that included microbiologic colonization screening, prospective infection surveillance together with isolation and emphasis on basic hygiene measures is essential to handle MRSA in this specialized setting."
https://openalex.org/W4296798142,"To solve the problems of poor permeability and low leaching rate in ore heap leaching, solid surface physical chemistry, seepage mechanics theory for porous media, CT scanning and SEM were used to carry out column leaching tests with a homemade segmented removable plexiglass column; the variation law for the permeability coefficients of each segment of the leaching column before and after leaching was analyzed. The experimental results showed that there was little difference in the permeability coefficient of ore at different heights before leaching. After leaching, the permeability coefficients were unevenly distributed along the column height, and the lowest value was located at the bottom of the leaching column. The addition of surfactant provided an obvious improvement in the permeability of the leaching column. The permeability coefficient at the bottom of the leaching column was 6% higher than that of the control group. At the same time, the addition of surfactant increased the leaching rate of ore by nearly 10%. A theoretical analysis showed that the surfactant improved the permeability of ore heaps mainly by preventing physical blockage by fine particles and inhibiting deposition of chemical products."
https://openalex.org/W4296800703,"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) share a considerable amount of biological similarity with mammals, including identical or homologous gene expression pathways, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cellular receptors. Zebrafish also display complex social behaviors like shoaling and schooling, making them an attractive model for investigating normal social behavior as well as exploring impaired social function conditions such as autism spectrum disorders. Newly-formed and established shoals exhibit distinct behavior patterns and inter-member interactions that can convey the group's social stability. We used a three-chamber open-swim preference test to determine whether individual zebrafish show a preference for an established shoal over a newly-formed shoal. Results indicated that both sexes maintained greater proximity to arena zones nearest to the established shoal stimulus. In addition, we report the novel application of Shannon entropy to discover sex differences in systematicity of responses not revealed by unit-based measurements; male subjects spent more time investigating between the two shoals than female subjects. This novel technique using established versus newly-formed shoals can be used in future studies testing transgenics and pharmacological treatments that mimic autism spectrum disorder and other disorders that affect social interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4296803377,"Breast cancer is still a recognized public health issue in Ethiopia. Despite this, the viewpoints and comprehensions of young women about the situation are unknown. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the knowledge and perceptions of young adult women in Southwest Ethiopia about breast cancer and breast self-examination (BSE).A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in the Gurage zone, southwest Ethiopia, in 2021. A total of 392 young adult women were randomly selected from both urban and rural strata using a three-stage stratified sampling process. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect the data. For data entry, Epi-data 4.6 with a double-entry approach was used, and for analysis, SPSS 26 was used. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with BSE behavior. A p-value of 0.05 or below was considered statistically significant with a 95% CI.The respondents' ages ranged from 20 to 24, with a mean of 21.25 (±1.32) years. Breast cancer and BSE were unknown to more than 80% of the study participants. A large proportion of young adult women had low perceived susceptibility (97.6%), low threat of breast cancer (96%), and low self-efficacy to perform BSE (91.4%). BSE was conducted by 23.1% of the participants occasionally. Being married (AOR = 5.31, 95% CI = 2.19-12.90), having good outcome expectations of BSE (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.16-3.61), having good BSE knowledge (AOR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.45), having high perceived susceptibility (AOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05-1.20), high perceived severity (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.02-3.09), and having high self-efficacy to do BSE (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.09) were all significant predictors of BSE practice.Young adult women were less concerned about breast cancer and had insufficient knowledge of breast cancer and breast self-examination. They have little knowledge of, confidence in, or experience with BSE. The practice of BSE was associated with increased perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, severity, outcome expectations, and BSE knowledge. Therefore, these variables should be considered when developing educational interventions for young women."
https://openalex.org/W4296806928,"Background Leptospirosis causes significant economic losses and is an occupational risk in the swine industry, especially in developing tropical regions where social and geoclimatic conditions are favorable for the transmission of this disease. Although vaccination can reduce infection risk, efficacy is diminished if local genetic and antigenic variants of the pathogen are not accounted for in the vaccine. Identifying and characterizing strains hosts, and potential mechanisms of transmission is therefore critical for public health mitigation practices. Methodology/Principal findings Our study was conducted on a rural breeding farm in Ecuador, where we used a PCR assay that targets lipL32 to detect Leptospira spp. and targeted gene sequencing to identify Leptospira santarosai in the kidneys, testicles, and ejaculate of a vaccinated boar. MAT results showed low titers against serovars found in the vaccine, but the MAT panel did not include serovars of L . santarosai . The boar showed no symptoms of leptospirosis but did show blood in the semen. However, no postmortem histopathological lesions were observed tissue samples. Vaccinated sows that were artificially inseminated with the semen from this boar had reproductive problems, suggesting that transmission had occurred. This is the first documented case of Leptospira santarosai in the reproductive tract of a boar. Conclusions/Significance As L . santarosai is pathogenic in other livestock species and humans, our finding highlights the need to evaluate the prevalence and epidemiological significance of this pathogen in livestock and consider the possibility of venereal transmission. In addition, further studies are needed to identify and characterize local serovars that may impact diagnosis and vaccination programs to better control leptospirosis in livestock and spillover into the human population."
https://openalex.org/W4296807210,"Osteoporotic fractures have a tremendous impact on quality of life and may contribute to fatality, but half of patients may discontinue their anti-osteoporosis medication. The study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the persistence of anti-osteoporosis medication. Between June 2016 and June 2018, we recruited 1195 participants discontinuing prior anti-osteoporosis medication. Telephone interviews were conducted to discern the reasons for discontinuation. Comparisons among groups and risks of self-discontinuation were analyzed. Among 694 patients who have no records of continuing anti-osteoporosis medication, 374 (54%) self-discontinued, 64 (9.2%) discontinued due to physicians' suggestion, and 256 (36.8%) with unintended discontinuation. Among patients with self-discontinuation, 173 (46.3%) forgot to visit outpatient clinics; 92 (24.5%) discontinued because of medication-related factors; 57 (15.2%) thought the severity of osteoporosis had improved and therefore discontinued; 30 (8%) stopped due to economic burden; 22 (5.9%) were lost to follow-up because of newly diagnosed diseases other than osteoporosis. Additionally, older age, male gender, calcium supplement, teriparatide therapy and hip fractures in teriparatide users were associated with adherence to anti-osteoporosis drugs. In conclusion, our results indicate that younger age, female gender, non-use of calcium supplements, and anti-resorptive medication were independent risk factors associated with drug discontinuation. Identifying high-risk patients and providing timely health education are crucial for adherence to anti-osteoporosis medication."
https://openalex.org/W4296809105,"Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus can produce a variety of secondary metabolites with broad spectrum bioactivity against microorganisms. We investigated the antibacterial activity of Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus against 15 antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. Photorhabdus extracts had strong inhibitory the growth of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) by disk diffusion. The P. akhurstii s subsp. akhurstii (bNN168.5_TH) extract showed lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC). The interaction between either P. akhurstii subsp. akhurstii (bNN141.3_TH) or P. akhurstii subsp. akhurstii (bNN168.5_TH) or P. hainanensis (bNN163.3_TH) extract in combination with oxacillin determined by checkerboard assay exhibited partially synergistic interaction with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of 0.53. Time-killing assay for P. akhurstii subsp. akhurstii (bNN168.5_TH) extract against S. aureus strain PB36 significantly decreased cell viability from 105 CFU/ml to 103 CFU/ml within 30 min (P < 0.001, t-test). Transmission electron microscopic investigation elucidated that the bNN168.5_TH extract caused treated S. aureus strain PB36 (MRSA) cell membrane damage. The biosynthetic gene clusters of the bNN168.5_TH contained non-ribosomal peptide synthetase cluster (NRPS), hybrid NRPS-type l polyketide synthase (PKS) and siderophore, which identified potentially interesting bioactive products: xenematide, luminmide, xenortide A-D, luminmycin A, putrebactin/avaroferrin and rhizomide A-C. This study demonstrates that bNN168.5_TH showed antibacterial activity by disrupting bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and the draft genome provided insights into the classes of bioactive products. This also provides a potential approach in developing a novel antibacterial agent."
https://openalex.org/W4296809692,"Decoding brain activity related to specific tasks, such as imagining something, is important for brain computer interface (BCI) control. While decoding of brain signals, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and electroencephalography (EEG) signals, during observing visual images and while imagining images has been previously reported, further development of methods for improving training, performance, and interpretation of brain data was the goal of this study. We applied a Sinc-EEGNet to decode brain activity during perception and imagination of visual stimuli, and added an attention module to extract the importance of each electrode or frequency band. We also reconstructed images from brain activity by using a generative adversarial network (GAN). By combining the EEG recorded during a visual task (perception) and an imagination task, we have successfully boosted the accuracy of classifying EEG data in the imagination task and improved the quality of reconstruction by GAN. Our result indicates that the brain activity evoked during the visual task is present in the imagination task and can be used for better classification of the imagined image. By using the attention module, we can derive the spatial weights in each frequency band and contrast spatial or frequency importance between tasks from our model. Imagination tasks are classified by low frequency EEG signals over temporal cortex, while perception tasks are classified by high frequency EEG signals over occipital and frontal cortex. Combining data sets in training results in a balanced model improving classification of the imagination task without significantly changing performance in the visual task. Our approach not only improves performance and interpretability but also potentially reduces the burden on training since we can improve the accuracy of classifying a relatively hard task with high variability (imagination) by combining with the data of the relatively easy task, observing visual images."
https://openalex.org/W4296810513,"Pregnancy in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) women is associated to increased risk of clinical and obstetrical complications. Placentas from SCD pregnancies can present increased abnormal findings, which may lead to placental insufficiency, favoring adverse perinatal outcome. These placental abnormalities are well known and reported, however little is known about the molecular mechanisms, such as epigenetics. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the DNA methylation profile in placentas from women with SCD (HbSS and HbSC genotypes), compared to uncomplicated controls (HbAA). We included in this study 11 pregnant women with HbSS, 11 with HbSC and 21 with HbAA genotypes. Illumina Methylation EPIC BeadChip was used to assess the whole placental DNA methylation. Pyrosequencing was used for array data validation and qRT-PCR was applied for gene expression analysis. Our results showed high frequency of hypermethylated CpGs sites in HbSS and HbSC groups with 73.5% and 76.2% respectively, when compared with the control group. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) also showed an increased hypermethylation status for the HbSS (89%) and HbSC (86%) groups, when compared with the control group methylation data. DMRs were selected for methylation validation (4 DMRs-HbSS and 3 DMRs the HbSC groups) and after analyses three were validated in the HbSS group, and none in the HbSC group. The gene expression analysis showed differential expression for the PTGFR (-2.97-fold) and GPR56 (3.0-fold) genes in the HbSS group, and for the SPOCK1 (-2.40-fold) and ADCY4 (1.80-fold) genes in the HbSC group. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SCD (HbSS and HbSC genotypes) can alter placental DNA methylation and lead to gene expression changes. These changes possibly contribute to abnormal placental development and could impact in the clinical course, especially for the fetus, possibly leading to increased risk of abortion, fetal growth restriction (FGR), stillbirth, small for gestational age newborns and prematurity."
https://openalex.org/W4296793630,"Objective This study used machine learning (ML) to test an empirically derived set of risk factors for marijuana use. Models were built separately for child welfare (CW) and non-CW adolescents in order to compare the variables selected as important features/risk factors. Method Data were from a Time 4 (M age = 18.22) of longitudinal study of the effects of maltreatment on adolescent development (n = 350; CW = 222; non-CW = 128; 56%male). Marijuana use in the past 12 months (none versus any) was obtained from a single item self-report. Risk factors entered into the model included mental health, parent/family social support, peer risk behavior, self-reported risk behavior, self-esteem, and self-reported adversities (e.g., abuse, neglect, witnessing family violence or community violence). Results The ML approaches indicated 80% accuracy in predicting marijuana use in the CW group and 85% accuracy in the non-CW group. In addition, the top features differed for the CW and non-CW groups with peer marijuana use emerging as the most important risk factor for CW youth, whereas externalizing behavior was the most important for the non-CW group. The most important common risk factor between group was gender, with males having higher risk. Conclusions This is the first study to examine the shared and unique risk factors for marijuana use for CW and non-CW youth using a machine learning approach. The results support our assertion that there may be similar risk factors for both groups, but there are also risks unique to each population. Therefore, risk factors derived from normative populations may not have the same importance when used for CW youth. These differences should be considered in clinical practice when assessing risk for substance use among adolescents."

Discussions with a patient partner group found that none of the frequently used cardiology PROMs captured their unique experiences.To capture the experiences and important issues for LVAD recipients. Develop a conceptual map of domains and items that should be reflected in patient reported outcomes.Group concept mapping (GCM) web-based software was used to remotely capture and structure recipients' experiences across a wide geographical area. GCM is a semi-quantitative mixed method consisting of 3 stages: item generation, item sorting and rating (importance, relevance and frequency). Patient partners were involved in all aspects of the study design and development.18 LVAD recipients consented to take part. 101 statements were generated and multi-dimensional scaling, and hierarchical cluster analysis identified 9 clusters. Cluster themes included: Activities, Partner/family support, Travel, Mental wellbeing, Equipment and clothing, Physical and cognitive limitations, LVAD Restrictions, LVAD Challenges and positive impact of the LVAD (LVAD Positives). LVAD Positives were scored highest across all the rating variables, e.g., frequency (2.85), relevance (2.44) and importance (2.21). Other domains rated high for importance included physical and cognitive limitations (2.19), LVAD restrictions (2.11), Partner/family support (2.02), and Equipment and clothing (2.01).Online GCM software facilitated the inclusion of geographically dispersed recipients and provided useful insights into the experiences of LVAD recipients.

https://openalex.org/W4296793781,"Alpine skiing, as an outdoor winter sport, is particularly vulnerable to the variation of meteorological conditions. Scattered and multi-source big data cannot be fully utilized to conduct effective decision analyses by conventional data analysis methods. Presently, knowledge graphs are the most advanced organization form of knowledge base, which can make explicit the complex relationships among different objects. Thus, introducing knowledge graph to the event management of alpine skiing is significant to improve the ability of risk prediction and decision-making. In this research, we analyze the components and dynamic characteristics of alpine skiing, and construct an ""Object-Characteristic-Relation"" representation model to express multi-level knowledge. Moreover, we propose a ""Characteristic-value- Relationship"" representation method based on the multi-source data, to construct the knowledge graph of alpine skiing. With the proposed method, comprehensive relationships between meteorological conditions and alpine skiing can be represented clearly, and support further knowledge reasoning for the event management under meteorological conditions. We have tested the utility of the proposed method in a case study of 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang. The case study realizes an semi-automatic construction of knowledge graph for alpine skiing, provides decision supports for event risk managements, according to different meteorological conditions, and grounds a foundation for future knowledge graph construction of other large-scale sport events."
https://openalex.org/W4296793791,"Study objectives We aimed to estimate the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) and associated risk factors in married women in rural villages of Gilgit Baltistan in Pakistan. Methods A cross-sectional design to assess the magnitude and factors associated with IPV in a random sample of 789 married women aged 18–49 years. A World Health Organization screening instrument was used to assess the presence of IPV in the previous 12 months. A locally validated instrument was adopted to identify self-reported symptoms of major depression according to the DSM IV. Trained nurses obtained socio-demographic and reproductive history through structured interviews. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate prevalence and identify significant predictors of IPV. Results The mean age of the participants was 38.3 years (SD: ±12.8). The prevalence of IPV in women was 22.8% (95% Confidence Interval: 20.0–25.9), 18.5% in pregnant women (95% CI: 11.7–27.9) and significantly associated with depression in 55.1% of IPV cases. Husband education level (college/higher) (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.40; 95%CI: 0.22–0.70) and high household income (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.29–0.68) were protective against IPV. Increase in age (AOR;1.02; 95% CI: 1.01–1.02) and poor relationship with mother-in-law increased the risk of IPV (AOR = 2.85; 95% CI: 1.90–4.28). IPV was positively associated with symptoms of depression (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI:1.39–2.77), poor perceived quality of life (AOR = 3.54; 95% CI: 1.90–6.58) and poor health (AOR = 2.74; 95% CI: 1.92–3.92). Conclusion IPV is substantial public health burden significantly associated with depressive symptoms, poor perceived health and the quality of life."

In some selected cases tumours develop from donor-derived tissue.We hypothesised that there is a clinical value to investigate donor/recipient origin in urologic malignancies in renal transplant recipients.In this retrospective study, including patients transplanted between the years 1969 and 2014 at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, 11 patients with malignancies in urinary tract and 4 patients with malignancies in kidney transplants were investigated. Donor/recipient origin of tumour tissue was analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH analysis) of sex chromosomes. HLA genotype and sex chromosomes of the tumour were compared to the known HLA genotype and sex chromosomes of recipient and donor.Three of ten cancers in the urinary tract and three of four cancers in the kidney transplants were donor-derived.We suggest that urologic malignancies in renal transplant recipients can be investigated for transplant origin. In addition to conventional therapy the allograft immune response against these tumours can be valuable to treat donor-derived cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4296795728,"Employing as a quasi-natural experiment an unexpected judgment by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that raised the difficulty of shareholder litigation, we explore the effect of shareholder litigation rights on board gender diversity. Our difference-in-difference estimates show that an exogenous reduction in shareholder litigation risk results in significantly less female board representation, a decline by 11.44% in particular. Our findings corroborate the view that strong shareholder litigation rights strengthen internal governance such as board oversight. Therefore, when shareholder litigation rights are weakened, there is a drop in board quality. Additionally, we document a decline in board independence and an increase in board size following the Ninth Circuit ruling, both of which are associated with poorer board monitoring. Further analysis validates the results. i.e., propensity score matching, entropy balancing, GMM dynamic panel data estimation, and Oster’s (2019) testing for coefficient stability. Based on a quasi-natural experiment, our conclusion probably reflects a causal influence, rather than a mere correlation."

Whilst rifampicin resistance is known to be associated with resistance to other rifamycins (rifapentine and rifabutin) as well as isoniazid and pyrazinamide, rifampicin discordant strains have shown high rates of susceptibility to isoniazid and rifabutin. However, pyrazinamide susceptibly testing results have not been reported.We evaluated pyrazinamide resistance in 80 rifampicin discordant and 25 rifampicin and isoniazid susceptible isolates from KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa using Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube method and sequencing of the pncA. We also compared susceptibility of pyrazinamide with that of isoniazid.Pyrazinamide resistance was found in 6/80 (7.5%) rifampicin discordant isolates. All pyrazinamide resistant isolates were also resistant to isoniazid and pyrazinamide resistance was found to be associated with isoniazid resistance. No pyrazinamide resistance was found among the isoniazid susceptible isolates.Given the low prevalence of pyrazinamide resistance in rifampicin discordant TB, this anti-TB drug still has a significant role in the treatment of these patients. Performing pyrazinamide susceptibility testing remains a challenge, our findings show that isoniazid susceptible isolates are unlikely to be resistant to pyrazinamide among the discordant TB isolates."

We aimed to identify aneurysm recurrence patterns associated with hemorrhage. Material and methods We investigated radiological data of patients who underwent coiling for intracranial aneurysms in 2008–2016 and were followed-up for at least 6 months. Aneurysm recurrence patterns were classified as: type Ⅰ, enlargement of aneurysm neck; type Ⅱ, recurrent cavity within the coil mass; type Ⅲ, recurrent cavity along the aneurysm wall; and type Ⅳ, formation of a daughter sac. We evaluated the incidence of various recurrence patterns with or without hemorrhage. Results Of the 173 aneurysms included in the study (mean follow-up period, 32 months; range, 6–99 months), 22 (13%) recurred and required re-treatment. The recurrence patterns included type Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ in 7 (4%), 4 (2%), 9 (5%), and 2 (1%) cases, respectively. Most of the type Ⅰ, Ⅱ, and Ⅲ recurrences occurred within 1 year, and type Ⅳ occurred at 7 years after coiling. Three aneurysms exhibited hemorrhage, one with type Ⅲ and two with type Ⅳ pattern. The two aneurysms with type Ⅳ recurrence initially occurred as type Ⅰ; however, the recurrent neck enlarged gradually, resulting in new sac formation. Conclusions We recommend prompt re-treatment for aneurysms recurring with type Ⅲ or Ⅳ patterns, as such patterns were associated with hemorrhage. Furthermore, we need a special care to type Ⅰ recurrence with enlargement of recurrent neck because this specific pattern may develop to type Ⅳ."

Although some studies have been conducted on overweight/obesity in Ethiopia, most of them have focused on school children and adolescents, and there is limited evidence of overweight/obesity among adults at the community level. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the magnitude of overweight/obesity and risk factors among adults in Welkite town, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A Community-based cross-sectional study was done among 524 adults aged 18 and more years in Welkite town, Southern Ethiopia, from February through March 2020. A multistage sampling technique was undertaken to recruit study participants. An interviewer-guided structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Overweight or obesity was identified using body mass index. The bivariate and multivariate analyses were employed to see an association using binary logistic regression. Results The magnitude of overweight and obesity was 22.2% (95% CI: 0.19, 0.26). Being female (AOR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.34, 4.27), age group 30–47 years (AOR = 3.26, 95% CI: 1.52, 6.97) and 48–66 years (AOR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.07, 6.08), average monthly income (AOR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.51, 4.60), had own transport (AOR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.03, 5.93), eating meat ≥ four times per week (AOR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.03, 10.74), not involve vigorous-intensity activity (AOR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.55, 5.64), spent sitting or reclining ≥181 minutes per day (AOR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.08, 3.26), and consuming alcohol (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.82) were risks for overweight and obesity. Conclusions The magnitude of overweight and obesity among adults was high. Factors such as being female, increasing age, physical inactivity, having own transportation, high average monthly income, eating meat, sitting or reclining more and equal to 181+ minutes per day, and consumption of alcohol increased the risk of overweight and obesity significantly. Hence, preventive interventions focusing on females, age groups of 30-66yrs, encouraging Physical activity, reducing meat frequency, and reducing alcohol consumption are essential to prevent the emergence of adulthood overweight/obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4296808858,"The dynamics of neuronal microtubules are essential for brain plasticity. Vesicular transport and synaptic transmission, additionally, requires acetylation of α-tubulin, and aberrant tubulin acetylation and neurobiological deficits are associated. Prolonged exposure to a stressor or consumption of drugs of abuse, like marihuana, lead to neurological changes and psychotic disorders. Here, we studied the effect of psychosocial stress and the administration of cannabinoid receptor type 1 drugs on α-tubulin acetylation in different brain regions of mice. We found significantly decreased tubulin acetylation in the prefrontal cortex in stressed mice. The impact of cannabinoid drugs on stress-induced microtubule disturbance was investigated by administration of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212–2 and/or antagonist rimonabant. In both, control and stressed mice, the administration of WIN55,212–2 slightly increased the tubulin acetylation in the prefrontal cortex whereas administration of rimonabant acted antagonistically indicating a cannabinoid receptor type 1 mediated effect. The analysis of gene expression in the prefrontal cortex showed a consistent expression of ApoE attributable to either psychosocial stress or administration of the cannabinoid agonist. Additionally, ApoE expression inversely correlated with acetylated tubulin levels when comparing controls and stressed mice treated with WIN55,212–2 whereas rimonabant treatment showed the opposite."
https://openalex.org/W4296809112,"Deep Learning has a large impact on medical image analysis and lately has been adopted for clinical use at the point of care. However, there is only a small number of reports of long-term studies that show the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in such an environment. In this study, we measured the long-term performance of a clinically optimized DNN for laryngeal glottis segmentation. We have collected the video footage for two years from an AI-powered laryngeal high-speed videoendoscopy imaging system and found that the footage image quality is stable across time. Next, we determined the DNN segmentation performance on lossy and lossless compressed data revealing that only 9% of recordings contain segmentation artifacts. We found that lossy and lossless compression is on par for glottis segmentation, however, lossless compression provides significantly superior image quality. Lastly, we employed continual learning strategies to continuously incorporate new data into the DNN to remove the aforementioned segmentation artifacts. With modest manual intervention, we were able to largely alleviate these segmentation artifacts by up to 81%. We believe that our suggested deep learning-enhanced laryngeal imaging platform consistently provides clinically sound results, and together with our proposed continual learning scheme will have a long-lasting impact on the future of laryngeal imaging."

This study uses an ensemble learning approach to evaluate hypertension care coverage in a nationally representative Iranian survey.The data source was the cross-sectional 2016 Iranian STEPwise approach to risk factor surveillance (STEPs). Hypertension was based on blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg, reported use of anti-hypertensive medications, or a previous hypertension diagnosis. The four steps of care were screening (irrespective of blood pressure value), diagnosis, treatment, and control. The proportion of patients reaching each step was calculated, and a random forest model was used to identify features associated with progression to each step. After model optimization, the six most important variables at each step were considered to demonstrate population-based marginal effects.The total number of participants was 30541 (52.3% female, median age: 42 years). Overall, 9420 (30.8%) had hypertension, among which 89.7% had screening, 62.3% received diagnosis, 49.3% were treated, and 7.9% achieved control. The random forest model indicated that younger age, male sex, lower wealth, and being unmarried/divorced were consistently associated with a lower probability of receiving care in different levels. Dyslipidemia was associated with reaching diagnosis and treatment steps; however, patients with other cardiovascular comorbidities were not likely to receive more intensive blood pressure management.Hypertension care was mostly missing the treatment and control stages. The random forest model identified features associated with receiving care, indicating opportunities to improve effective coverage."
