https://openalex.org/W1483986092,"Abstract The addition of androstenedione and NADPH to human placental microsomes results in a marked increase in the rate of O2 and NADPH utilization concomitant with estrogen formation. Initially, 5 to 12 moles of O2 and an equivalent amount of NADPH are consumed per mole of estrogen formed, the ratio varying from one microsomal preparation to another. In the presence, however, of 10 to 20 mm KCN, 3 moles of O2, and 3 moles of NADPH are consumed per mole of estrogen formed. This ratio was invariant even when a concentration of KCN sufficiently high to inhibit aromatization was employed. Both NADPH and O2 are required for the conversion of 19-hydroxyandrostenedione to 19-oxoandrostenedione, suggesting that a second hydroxylation is responsible for this conversion rather than oxidoreduction of the 19-alcohol. These results are consistent with previous data suggesting three successive hydroxylations catalyzed by a mixed function oxidase(s) are required during C19 steroid aromatization. The rate of appearance of estrogen intermediates was examined in an effort to determine to what extent the accumulation of these compounds might account for the high rate of O2 consumption observed in the absence of KCN. It was determined that essentially all of the O2 consumed could be accounted for by accumulation of 19-hydroxyandrostenedione and 19-oxoandrostenedione and estrogens. In the presence of KCN, the rates of formation of 19-hydroxyandrostenedione and 19-oxoandrostenedione were greatly inhibited under steady state conditions while the rate of aromatization was only slightly decreased. Moreover, under all conditions, the rate of formation of 19-hydroxyandrostenedione was greater than its rate of conversion to estrogen. Also, the rate of formation of 19-oxoandrostenedione was greater than its rate of disappearance in the absence of KCN. These observations suggest that the final hydroxylation is the rate-limiting step in the aromatization of androstenedione."

Using the [14C]acetylated glycopeptide as a substrate, an endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase was purified 2400-fold from the culture fluid of Diplococcus pneumoniae. The enzyme preparation was practically free from various exoglycosidases and proteases. The enzyme cleaved the di-N-acetylchitobiose structure of the [14C]acetylated glycopeptide, yielding equimolar amounts of [14C]acetyl-Asn-GlcNAc and (Man)5(GlcNAc). The enzyme had a pH optimum of 6.5, with a Km of 0.25 mm and with a Vmax of 4.67 µmoles per mg of protein per min toward the substrate. A mouse myeloma IgG glycopeptide and a bovine IgG glycopeptide was hydrolyzed by the enzyme, only after treatment with β-galactosidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. In both cases the products of the enzymic action were a fucose-containing glycopeptide fragment and a mannose-containing oligosaccharide whose reducing end was N-acetylglucosamine. The enzyme had a strict specificity with respect to the structures of oligomannosyl cores of glycopeptides. Thus, the enzyme hydrolyzed only 20% of glycopeptide mixtures from ovalbumin. Furthermore, the enzyme hydrolyzed porcine thyroglobulin glycopeptides, Unit B (sialic acid containing heteropolysaccharide unit) which had been treated with neuraminidase, β-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, but did not hydrolyze calf thyroglobulin glycopeptides, Unit A (mannose-N-acetylglucosamine unit)."
https://openalex.org/W2068015386,"An iodine-labeled β-adrenergic inhibitor (125l-hydroxybenzylpindolol) binds specifically to a site on turkey erythrocyte membranes. A series of β-adrenergic agonists and inhibitors compete for this binding site, with apparent affinities paralleling biological effectiveness as activators or inhibitors of catecholaminestimulated adenylate cyclase. The activity of d-(+) agonists or inhibitors was 1 percent (or less) than that of the corresponding l-(-) isomers in competing for binding of the iodinated blocker as well as in affecting catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. 1-(-)-Norepinephrine was about one-tenth as active as l-(-)-isoproterenol in competing for the β-blocking agent site. The stereospecificity of the interaction with the iodinated β-blocking agent and the correspondence between affinity for site and biological potency of analogs suggested that this interaction is involved in function of the β-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1568509972,"Abstract Perfused rat liver and suspensions of isolated rat liver cells have been used to study the influence of the transaminase inhibitors aminooxyacetate and dl-cycloserine on the rate of acetaldehyde utilization, and the effects of acetaldehyde on the state of reduction of cytosolic and mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides. In the presence of 4-methylpyrazole to inhibit acetaldehyde reduction to ethanol, acetaldehyde removal was constant over the range from 0.1 to 0.4 mm at a rate of approximately 400 µmoles per g dry weight per hour. Between 0.4 and 10 mm acetaldehyde, the rate of acetaldehyde uptake increased by 60% with increasing acetaldehyde concentrations, with a half-maximum increment of uptake being achieved at about 1 mm acetaldehyde. dl-Cycloserine had no effect on acetaldehyde uptake at low concentrations of acetaldehyde but almost completely inhibited the stimulation of uptake observed at high concentrations. Neither dl-cycloserine nor aminooxyacetate had any inhibitory effect on the reduction of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides induced by acetaldehyde. At high acetaldehyde concentrations (3 to 4 mm) pyruvate stimulated acetaldehyde uptake, but little effect was observed at low acetaldehyde concentrations (0.3 mm). Acetaldehyde uptake was inhibited by fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, and amobarbital, and stimulated by acetoacetate. Oxidation of endogenous fatty acid was diminished by acetaldehyde. These data indicate that oxidation of acetaldehyde by rat liver occurs almost entirely in the mitochondrial compartment when the mean arterial-venous acetaldehyde concentration is below about 0.4 mm. At higher acetaldehyde concentrations, oxidation occurs also in the cytosol, and reducing equivalents generated in the cytosol by a high Km NAD-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase are transported to the mitochondria mainly by the malate-aspartate cycle. It may be concluded that acetaldehyde generated during ethanol metabolism is oxidized to acetate predominantly in the mitochondria, so that only 1 eq of NADH is generated in the cytosol per mole of ethanol oxidized via alcohol dehydrogenase."

The three substrates required in the catalysis, cinnamic acid, TPNH, and O2 have Km values in the micromolar range. The same microsomal fraction contained cytochromes P-450 and b5 at 0.10 and 0.55 nmoles · mg of protein-1, respectively. Preparation of a photodissociation action spectrum on carbon monoxide inhibition of the cinnamic acid hydroxylase indicated a requirement for cytochrome P-450 in the catalysis. When challenged with a range of potential inhibitors, the hydroxylase behaved in a manner that is fairly typical of the more extensively studied P-450 monooxygenases of nonplant tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1989901076,Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) injected into the third ventricle of male rats promotes the release of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) but not follicle-stimulating hormone. When GABA was injected directly into the pituitary it was ineffective in promoting LH release. This evidence suggests that GABA may play a role in controlling the discharge of hypothalamic luteinizing hormone releasing factor.

Using this assay guanylate cyclase was purified about 30-fold from rat brain soluble fraction by ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by calcium phosphate gel adsorption and elution. Mn2+ was essential for the activity and neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ could substitute Mn2+. In the presence of a low concentration of Mn2+ the enzyme was stimulated severalfold by Ca2+. The topographical distribution of both guanylate cyclase and guanosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase in rat brain was also described."
https://openalex.org/W1519815511,"Abstract Low concentrations of palmitoyl coenzyme A inhibit yeast glucose-6-P dehydrogenase (Taketa, K., and Pogell, B. M. (1966) J. Biol. Chem. 241, 720). This inhibition is prevented or reversed by bovine serum albumin, mycobacterial polysaccharides, or alkylated cyclodextrins. Sephadex chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation show that palmitoyl-CoA inhibits by dissociating the tetrameric dehydrogenase to dimeric, enzymatically inactive subunits. These structural changes are accompanied by firm binding of palmitoyl-CoA to the dimeric subunit and by release of NADP. After removal of the (nondialyzable) inhibitor from the palmitoyl-CoA-dimer complex by alkylated cyclodextrin the subunits reaggregate to enzymatically active tetramer. Reaggregation does not require NADP. In contrast to palmitoyl-CoA, sodium dodecyl sulfate dissociates yeast dehydrogenase to monomers. It is concluded that palmitoyl-CoA, unlike the synthetic anionic detergent, perturbs the dehydrogenase subunit structure in a controlled manner which may be important for regulating the activity of lipogenic enzymes. The dimeric glucose-6-P dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides is inhibited only by high concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA. In this instance palmitoyl-CoA neither binds to the enzyme nor dissociates it. Torulopsis utilis glucose-6-P dehydrogenase, also dimeric, is irreversibly converted to inactive monomers by low concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1544154484,"Abstract Fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis were studied in several cell lines in culture. Two of these cell lines, L-M and NCTC 1469, demonstrated an 8.6- and 7.2-fold increase, respectively, in acetate incorporation into fatty acids and a 5.2- and 2.4-fold increase, respectively, in acetate incorporation into sterols within 24 hours after serum-containing medium was replaced with serum-free medium. Three other cell lines, Chang liver, HeLa, and NCTC 2544, demonstrated little change in fatty acid or sterol synthesis 48 hours after serum removal from the medium, but they demonstrated up to an 8-fold increase in fatty acid synthesis and a 3-fold increase in sterol synthesis 48 hours after serum removal when insulin was present in the serum-free medium. The increased fatty acid synthesis following transfer of L-M and NCTC 1469 cells to serum-free medium could be attributed to increased activities of both acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase, whereas increased synthesis in Chang liver, HeLa, and NCTC 2544 cells was associated primarily with increased fatty acid synthetase activity. In Chang liver cells fatty acid synthetase activity did not change during the first 24 hours after replacement of serum-containing medium with serum-free medium. During the subsequent 24 hours activity increased approximately 160 % in the absence of insulin and approximately 450 % in the presence of insulin. Insulin at a concentration of 2 x 10-9 m produced 50 % of the maximal increase in synthetase activity, while proinsulin at 1.2 x 10-7 m was required for 50 % of maximal increase. The continued presence of insulin was necessary for maintenance of elevated fatty acid synthetase activity as demonstrated by the decrease observed when insulin was removed from the medium. Immunotitration experiments, using antiserum produced against pure fatty acid synthetase, indicated that the increased fatty acid synthetase activity observed after the removal of serum from the medium or the addition of insulin to serum-free medium was due to increased levels of enzyme in the cells. An increase in fatty acid synthetase synthesis presumably accounted for the increased levels of the enzyme since the effects of serum removal and insulin addition were blocked by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. In Chang liver cells low levels of actinomycin D and camptothecin, inhibitors of RNA synthesis, prevented the induction of fatty acid synthetase by serum removal or insulin addition. A combination of theophylline and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate also prevented induction."

This protein component and NADPH may be replaced by sodium borohydride which acts by reducing (S-CoM)2 to 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (HS-CoM) prior to methylation. Evidence suggests that reduction by borohydride is chemical rather than enzyme directed. Catalysis by 100-fold purified methyltransferase requires only methylcobalamin and HS-CoM. The assay is accurate, reliable, and may be used to determine the usual enzyme kinetic parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1559770835,"Abstract The Neurospora crassa (5297a) assimilatory nitrite reductase (EC 1.6.6.4) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent formation of ammonia from nitrite, a 6 electron reduction. The enzyme has been purified 90-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionations, polyethylene glycol treatment (to remove nucleic acids), DEAE-cellulose, and molecular sieve chromatography. Associated with this NADPH-nitrite reductase activity are NADH-nitrite reductase activity, dithionite-nitrite reductase activity, NADPH-hydroxylamine reductase activity, and NADH-hydroxylamine reductase activity. All the activities are manifestations of a single protein complex as shown by their co-elution from DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 columns, and by their co-sedimentation during sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The molecular weight was calculated to be 290,000 using a relative s0.72520, w value of 9.4 determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and a Stokes radius of 76 A estimated from Sephadex G-200 gel filtration data. The absorption spectrum of a partially purified sample of nitrite reductase exhibited maxima at 405, 555, 585, and g600 nm showing some characteristics of other nitrite and sulfite reducing enzymes which have been studied. The apparent Km for nitrite is 0.01 mm whereas that for hydroxylamine is 2 orders of magnitude higher, 3 mm, suggesting that nitrite is the physiological substrate. The reduced pyridine nucleotide-dependent activities, which require FAD for maximal activity, are more heat-labile and more sensitive to inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate than the dithionite-dependent activity. All the activities of the nitrite reductase complex are sensitive to inhibition by cyanide, sulfide, sulfite, and o-phenanthroline. The enzyme activities are inhibited on preincubation with either reduced pyridine nucleotide electron donor (NADPH or NADH), provided FAD is present. The electron acceptors, nitrite and hydroxylamine, protect against this inactivation. No evidence of feedback inhibition was found with the variety of nitrogenous compounds tested."

Rat-thyroid slices incorporate amino acids into subunits, but cannot form mature thyroglobulin from the newly synthesized subunits. This defect leads to an accumulation of 16S and 12S proteins, although the preexisting thyroglobulin is 19S. Accumulation of 16S and 12S proteins can be produced in rat thyroids by the administration to the animals of a thiocarbamide derivative, methimazole. Upon withdrawal of methimazole, iodination of the 16S and 12S proteins proceeds, and 19S protein appears."

https://openalex.org/W1533740475,"Abstract Cytochrome oxidase activities have been determined and characterized in isolated nuclei, nuclear membranes, and chromatin subfractions from rat liver and rat thymus, and compared with mitochondrial fractions isolated in parallel from the same tissues. Spectral data on these fractions were obtained at both room and low temperatures. The cytochrome oxidase activities observed in the nuclear fractions and subfractions (up to about 10% per mg of protein of that of the corresponding mitochondrial fraction) correlate well with the amounts of cardiolipin and mitochondria-type cytochromes (a, a3, b, c1) present, as well as with the activities of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex and the mitochondrial contaminations determined by electron microscopic morphometry. It does not correlate so well with the succinate dehydrogenase activities (5 to 7% per mg of protein of that of the heavy mitochondrial membranes prepared in parallel) but this appears to be due to the higher sensitivity of this enzyme to preparative stress. When nuclear membranes are separated from membrane contaminants of the nuclear fraction, cytochrome oxidase activities (per mg of protein or phospholipid) are significantly reduced concomitant with the decreases of other mitochondrial markers. When isolated mitochondria or cytochrome oxidase solubilized from mitochondria with Triton X-100 are mixed with isolated nuclei, the oxidase activity becomes tenaciously bound to nuclear material or is recovered in the same sucrose gradient band as the nuclear membranes, respectively. The data strongly suggest that the activities observed in nuclear fractions are introduced by mitochondrial contaminants."

Compared to previous tests in which the pesticides were applied on glass surfaces, a significant reduction of the toxicity of the insecticides to fruit flies and of the synergistic effects of atrazine was observed with soils, particularly a silt loam. The effects of atrazine as a synergist in soil declined rapidly within 4 days. The toxicity of parathion in water and its synergism by atrazine were significantly reduced by soil sediments, depending on the type and amount of soil present. Soils were highly effective in turbulent water: in water containing the relatively high parathion concentration of 0.3 part per million, 93 percent of the mosquito larvae present died within 24 hours, yet this solution was rendered nontoxic by being mixed with 5 grams of a loam soil. With atrazine present in the latter system, however, 38 percent of the mosquito larvae died. Thus, insecticides can be more or less toxic, depending on their concentrations, the presence of synergists, and the environmenetal conditions."

A membrane fraction containing mesosomal vesicles was obtained by differential centrifugation of protoplast suspensions. The mesosome fraction displayed significantly reduced levels (25- to 30-fold) of the protoplast membrane marker NADH oxidase. The specific activities of phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase and teichoic acid synthetase, two membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze important steps leading to cell wall formation, were found to be about 100-fold higher in the protoplast membrane preparation. We propose the use of these enzymes as markers for the protoplast membrane. Furthermore, the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoretograms of these two fractions are strikingly different. These data suggest that mesosomal and protoplast membranes are not identical and may have different functions."

https://openalex.org/W1535570273,"In addition to a high degree of specificity toward its amino acid and keto acid substrates, saccharopine dehydrogenase (e-N-( l -glutaryl-2)- l -lysine: NAD oxidoreductase (lysine-forming)) showed a strict coenzyme specificity. NADP+ did not support the reaction in the direction of oxidative cleavage of saccharopine, and NADPH was a poor coenzyme in the reverse direction. NADPH was bound by the enzyme with much less affinity than NADH, and its binding resulted in a large increase in Michaelis constants for substrates which add subsequently. Examination with the compounds that are fragments of the coenzyme (NAD+ or NADH) molecule revealed that adenosine was the smallest fragment that inhibited the reaction. The presence of a phosphate or pyrophosphate group at the 5′ position of the adenosine moiety greatly increased, while the presence of phosphate at or deletion of the oxygen from the 2′ position decreased the inhibitory action. NMN+, NMNH, guanine and hypoxanthine nucleotides, and pyrimidine nucleotides were not inhibitory. Kinetic analyses of the inhibition by AMP, ADP, ADP ribose, and ATP showed that they were competitive with respect to the coenzyme, and noncompetitive with respect to the other substrates, and indicate that they are bound at the coenzyme-binding site. The apparent inhibition constants were not altered by the variation in the concentrations of the second substrates, suggesting that the binding of these nucleotides was not followed by the combination of substrates."

This inhibition is more marked with NH4+ than with K+. Potassium does not alter the S0.5 value for aspartate, suggesting that the cation effects are on catalysis rather than substrate binding. Both cations antagonize inhibition by lysine and leucine. The I0.5 value for lysine is about 0.17 mm at 0.66 m KCl and is decreased to about 0.05 mm at 0.022 m KCl. There is a slight but probably real decrease in cooperativity of lysine inhibition at the lower cation concentrations."

The results clarify inconsistencies raised in a recent report (Schwartz, R. J. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6426–6435). We show that (a) the extensive histological deterioration of retina cultures attributed to actinomycin D in the above report does not occur under our conditions and was presumably due to some suboptimal culture condition(s); (b) the kinetics of glutamine synthetase induction described in the above report are aberrant and therefore cannot be used as a basis for studies of regulatory processes; (c) contrary to the above report, glutamine synthetase in embryonic retina can be repeatedly induced and deinduced by consecutive application and withdrawal of the steroid inducer; (d) inadequate procedure may account for failures to obtain the characteristic effects of high and low concentrations of actinomycin D in this system. It appears that Schwartz's negative results reflected the pathology of deteriorating retina tissue cultures and therefore are not applicable to the analysis of normal regulatory mechanisms in the induction of glutamine synthetase. Our findings invalidate Schwartz's key arguments for criticizing previous studies on the induction of glutamine synthetase in the retina and on control mechanisms in other inducible enzyme systems."
