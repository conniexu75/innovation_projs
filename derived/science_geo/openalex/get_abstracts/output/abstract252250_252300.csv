The conserved fields—electric displacement field D , magnetic induction field B , and Poynting vector B —are all displaced in a consistent manner. A simple illustration is given of the cloaking of a proscribed volume of space to exclude completely all electromagnetic fields. Our work has relevance to exotic lens design and to the cloaking of objects from electromagnetic fields."
https://openalex.org/W2040301417,"A fundamental aspect of all biological systems is cooperation. Cooperative interactions are required for many levels of biological organization ranging from single cells to groups of animals. Human society is based to a large extent on mechanisms that promote cooperation. It is well known that in unstructured populations, natural selection favours defectors over cooperators. There is much current interest, however, in studying evolutionary games in structured populations and on graphs. These efforts recognize the fact that who-meets-whom is not random, but determined by spatial relationships or social networks. Here we describe a surprisingly simple rule that is a good approximation for all graphs that we have analysed, including cycles, spatial lattices, random regular graphs, random graphs and scale-free networks: natural selection favours cooperation, if the benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the average number of neighbours, k, which means b/c > k. In this case, cooperation can evolve as a consequence of 'social viscosity' even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity."

https://openalex.org/W2062515127,"The energy that sustains cancer cells is derived preferentially from glycolysis. This metabolic change, the Warburg effect, was one of the first alterations in cancer cells recognized as conferring a survival advantage. Here, we show that p53, one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancers, modulates the balance between the utilization of respiratory and glycolytic pathways. We identify Synthesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase 2 (SCO2) as the downstream mediator of this effect in mice and human cancer cell lines. SCO2 is critical for regulating the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex, the major site of oxygen utilization in the eukaryotic cell. Disruption of the SCO2 gene in human cancer cells with wild-type p53 recapitulated the metabolic switch toward glycolysis that is exhibited by p53-deficient cells. That SCO2 couples p53 to mitochondrial respiration provides a possible explanation for the Warburg effect and offers new clues as to how p53 might affect aging and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2035074912,"Paramutation is a heritable epigenetic modification induced in plants by cross-talk between allelic loci. Here we report a similar modification of the mouse Kit gene in the progeny of heterozygotes with the null mutant Kit(tm1Alf) (a lacZ insertion). In spite of a homozygous wild-type genotype, their offspring maintain, to a variable extent, the white spots characteristic of Kit mutant animals. Efficiently inherited from either male or female parents, the modified phenotype results from a decrease in Kit messenger RNA levels with the accumulation of non-polyadenylated RNA molecules of abnormal sizes. Sustained transcriptional activity at the postmeiotic stages--at which time the gene is normally silent--leads to the accumulation of RNA in spermatozoa. Microinjection into fertilized eggs either of total RNA from Kit(tm1Alf/+) heterozygotes or of Kit-specific microRNAs induced a heritable white tail phenotype. Our results identify an unexpected mode of epigenetic inheritance associated with the zygotic transfer of RNA molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2140665904,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the cause of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a zoonotic infection of staggering proportions and social impact. Yet uncertainty persists regarding its natural reservoir. The virus most closely related to HIV-1 is a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) thus far identified only in captive members of the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes . Here we report the detection of SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids in fecal samples from wild-living P. t. troglodytes apes in southern Cameroon, where prevalence rates in some communities reached 29 to 35%. By sequence analysis of endemic SIVcpz strains, we could trace the origins of pandemic (group M) and nonpandemic (group N) HIV-1 to distinct, geographically isolated chimpanzee communities. These findings establish P. t. troglodytes as a natural reservoir of HIV-1."

https://openalex.org/W2119924558,"For many years, discoveries about the genetic determinants of cancer appeared to be having only minor effects on efforts to control the disease in the clinic. Following advances made over the past decade, however, a description of cancer in molecular terms seems increasingly likely to improve the ways in which human cancers are detected, classified, monitored, and (especially) treated. Achieving the medical promise of this new era in cancer research will require a deeper understanding of the biology of cancer and imaginative application of new knowledge in the clinic, as well as political, social, and cultural changes."
https://openalex.org/W2082661202,"Transmissible pathogens are the bane of social animals, so they have evolved behaviours to decrease the probability of infection. There is no record, however, of social animals avoiding diseased individuals of their own species in the wild. Here we show how healthy, normally gregarious Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) avoid conspecifics that are infected with a lethal virus. Early detection and avoidance of infected, though not yet infectious, individuals by healthy lobsters confers a selective advantage and highlights the importance of host behaviour in disease transmission among natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2111368663,"Oxidative stress is generated by a multitude of environmental and endogenous challenges such as radiation, inflammation, or psychoemotional stress. It also speeds the aging process. Graying is a prominent but little understood feature of aging. Intriguingly, the continuous melanin synthesis in the growing (anagen) hair follicle generates high oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesize that hair bulb melanocytes are especially susceptible to free radical-induced aging. To test this hypothesis, we subjected human scalp skin anagen hair follicles from graying individuals to macroscopic and immunohistomorphometric analysis and organ culture. We found evidence of melanocyte apoptosis and increased oxidative stress in the pigmentary unit of graying hair follicles. The ""common"" deletion, a marker mitochondrial DNA-deletion for accumulating oxidative stress damage, occurred most prominently in graying hair follicles. Cultured unpigmented hair follicles grew better than pigmented follicles of the same donors. Finally, cultured pigmented hair follicles exposed to exogenous oxidative stress (hydroquinone) showed increased melanocyte apoptosis in the hair bulb. We conclude that oxidative stress is high in hair follicle melanocytes and leads to their selective premature aging and apoptosis. The graying hair follicle, therefore, offers a unique model system to study oxidative stress and aging and to test antiaging therapeutics in their ability to slow down or even stop this process."
https://openalex.org/W2115957483,"We have recently identified apelin as a novel adipokine up-regulated by insulin and obesity. Since obesity and insulin resistance are associated with chronically elevated levels of both insulin and TNFalpha, the present study was performed to investigate a putative regulation of apelin expression in adipocytes by TNFalpha. Herein, we report a tight correlation between apelin and TNFalpha expression in adipose tissue of lean and obese humans. Apelin regulation by TNFalpha was further studied in cultured explants of human adipose tissue. The endogenous expression of TNFalpha in adipocytes isolated from the explants was accompanied by a 6-9 h subsequent increase of apelin expression in adipocytes. This increase was reversed by inhibiting TNFalpha expression with 100 microM isobutylmethylxanthine. In different mouse models of obesity, expression of both TNFalpha and apelin was also significantly increased in adipocytes of obese mice. Furthermore, short-term exposure to an i.p. injection of TNFalpha in C57Bl6/J mice induced an increase of apelin expression in adipose tissue as well as apelin plasma levels. Finally, a direct positive effect of TNFalpha has been shown in differentiated 3T3F442A adipocytes on apelin expression and secretion. The signaling pathways of TNFalpha for the induction of apelin were dependent of PI3-kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and MAPK but not PKC activation. All together, these findings suggest that apelin might be a candidate to better understand potential links between obesity and associated disorders such as inflammation and insulin resistance."

However, productive implementation of cancer biomarkers into patient care will require fundamental changes in how we consider approvals for cancer indications and how we track patient responses. Here we briefly describe ongoing efforts to identify and to validate cancer biomarkers, discuss the technological hurdles that lie ahead, and then focus on the more pressing political and cultural issues that, if left unheeded, could derail many of the anticipated benefits of biomarker research."

https://openalex.org/W2122087230,"Skeletal muscle aging is characterized by atrophy, a deficit in specific force generation, increased susceptibility to injury, and incomplete recovery after severe injury. The ability of muscles of old mice to produce heat shock proteins (HSPs) in response to stress is severely diminished. Studies in our laboratory using HSP70 overexpressor mice demonstrated that lifelong overexpression of HSP70 in skeletal muscle provided protection against damage and facilitated successful recovery after damage in muscles of old mice. The mechanisms by which HSP70 provides this protection are unclear. Aging is associated with the accumulation of oxidation products, and it has been proposed that this may play a major role in age-related muscle dysfunction. Muscles of old wild-type (WT) mice demonstrated increased lipid peroxidation, decreased glutathione content, increased catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and an inability to activate nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB after contractions in comparison with adult WT mice. In contrast, levels of lipid peroxidation, glutathione content, and the activities of catalase and SOD in muscles of old HSP70 overexpressor mice were similar to adult mice and these muscles also maintained the ability to activate NF-kappaB after contractions. These data provide an explanation for the preservation of muscle function in old HSP70 overexpressor mice."
https://openalex.org/W1990761421,"Monoamine oxidase (MAO) A is a key enzyme for the degradation of neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. There are three consensus glucocorticoid/androgen response elements and four Sp1-binding sites in the human monoamine oxidase A 2-kb promoter. A novel transcription factor R1 (RAM2/CDCA7L) interacts with Sp1-binding sites and represses MAO A gene expression. Luciferase assays show that glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) and androgen (R1881) increase MAO A promoter and catalytic activities in human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells. Gel-shift analysis demonstrates that glucocorticoid/androgen receptors interact directly with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element. Glucocorticoid/androgen receptors also interact with Sp1-binding sites indirectly via transcription factor Sp1. In addition, dexamethasone induces R1 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner in both the neuroblastoma and wild-type UW228 cell lines but not in R1 knock-down UW228 cells. In summary, this study shows that glucocorticoid enhances monoamine oxidase A gene expression by 1) regulation of R1 translocation; 2) direct interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element; and 3) indirect interaction of glucocorticoid receptor with the Sp1 or R1 transcription factor on Sp1-binding sites of the MAO A promoter. Androgen also up-regulates MAO A gene expression by direct interaction of androgen receptor with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element.

It catalyzes the oxidative deamination of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and phenylethylamine (1Shih J.C. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1991; 4: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). MAO exists in two isoforms, MAO A and MAO B. MAO A preferentially oxidizes serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), norepinephrine, and dopamine and is irreversibly inhibited by low concentration of clorgyline (2Johnston J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 1285-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). MAO B preferentially oxidizes phenylethylamine and benzylamine and is irreversibly inactivated by low concentrations of pargyline and deprenyl (3Knoll J. Magyar K. Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol. 1972; 5: 393-408PubMed Google Scholar). MAO A and B are coded by different genes (4Bach A.W. Lan N.C. Johnson D.L. Abell C.W. Bembenek M.E. Kwan S.W. Seeburg P.H. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4934-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) closely linked on the X chromosome, Xp11.2-11.4 (5Lan N.C. Heinzmann C. Gal A. Klisak I. Orth U. Lai E. Grimsby J. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Shih J.C. Genomics. 1989; 4: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both genes consist of 15 exons with identical exonintron organization (6Grimsby J. Chen K. Wang L.J. Lan N.C. Shih J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and both are regulated by Sp1 factors; however, there are some differences in their cis-elements (7Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen K. Ou X.M. Chen G. Choi S.H. Shih J.C. J. Biol.

The core promoter of MAO A consists of Sp1-binding sites that are activated by Sp1 (7Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and repressed by a novel repressor R1 (RAM2/CDCA7L) (8Chen K. Ou X.M. Chen G. Choi S.H. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11552-11559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This core promoter has bi-directional activity (7Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7393-7403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a functional polymorphism of a 30-bp repeat sequence has been identified and located ∼1.2 kb upstream of the MAO A translation start site (10Sabol S.Z. Hu S. Hamer D. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The human MAO B promoter contains two clusters of overlapping Sp1 sites separated by a CACCC element (11Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An Sp1-like transcription factor, transforming growth factor-β-inducible early gene, also activates the MAO B promoter via overlapping Sp1 sites (12Chen K. Holschneider D.P. Wu W. Rebrin I. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39645-39652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The expression of MAO B is regulated by protein kinase C and the MAPK signaling pathway (13Wong W.K. Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22222-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A mutation in the human MAO A gene, which results in no enzymatic activity, is associated with aggressive behavior in males in a Dutch family (14Brunner H.G. Nelen M. Breakefield X.O. Ropers H.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1993; 262: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). MAO A knock-out (KO) mice showed aggressive behavior in males (15Shih J.C. Chen K. Ridd M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 197-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), but MAO B KO mice did not show aggressive behavior (16Grimsby J. Toth M. Chen K. Kumazawa T. Klaidman L. Adams J.D. Karoum F. Gal J. Shih J.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a spontaneous mutation of the MAO A gene in MAO B KO mice resulted in MAO A/B double KO mice, which showed hyperreactivity and anxiety-like behavior (12Chen K. Holschneider D.P. Wu W. Rebrin I. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39645-39652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Steroid hormones are involved in the regulation of many functions in which MAO also plays an important roles such as response to stress, behavioral adaptation and mood (17de Kloet E.R. Reul J.M. Sutanto W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Significant hypersecretion of glucocorticoids has been shown to be associated with depression (18Lee A.L. Ogle W.O. Sapolsky R.M. Bipolar Disord. 2002; 4: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, increases MAO A activity in human fibroblasts (19Edelstein S.B. Breakefield X.O. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 1986; 6: 121-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and rat brain frontal cortex (20Slotkin T.A. Seidler F.J. Ritchie J.C. Brain Res. Bull. 1998; 47: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both anti-glucocorticoid agents (21Wolkowitz O.M. Reus V.I. Psychosom. Med. 1999; 61: 698-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and MAO A inhibitors (22Kato M. Katayama T. Iwata H. Yamamura M. Matsuoka Y. Narita H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 983-990PubMed Google Scholar, 23Volz H.P. Gleiter C.H. Drugs Aging. 1998; 13: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have been used in the treatment of depression. Androgens have also been shown to increase MAO activity in the rat brain (24Luine V.N. Khylchevskaya R.I. McEwen B.S. Brain Res. 1975; 86: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The biological action of glucocorticoids and androgens are mediated through their respective receptors, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR). GR and AR bind to derivatives of a common response element, i.e. the consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE), 5′-GGTACAnnnTGTTCT-3′, where n is any nucleotide (25Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Shukin R.J. Cheng H. Bruchovsky N. Koop B.F. Rennie P.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2090-2107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are three consensus glucocorticoid/androgen response elements (GRE/AREs) in the human MAO A promoter. However, how MAO A gene expression is regulated by glucocorticoid/androgen is unclear. In addition, R1 has recently been found to be a repressor for MAO A gene expression through Sp1-binding sites (8Chen K. Ou X.M. Chen G. Choi S.H. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11552-11559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This study describes the regulation of MAO A gene expression by GR, AR, R1, and Sp1. We show that R1 and Sp1 are glucocorticoid-responsive transcription factors and are involved in the regulation of glucocorticoid activation of MAO A, whereas R1 is not involved in androgen activation of MAO A. Cell Lines and Materials—The human cell line, neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)-C, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and glioblastoma 1242-MG was a gift obtained from Dr. B. Westermark (Dept. of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden). SK-N-BE(2)-C cells were grown in medium containing a 1:1 mixture of Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's balanced salt solution and Ham's F-12 media with 2.5 mml-glutamine, and 1242-MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 g/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Wild-type and siRNA-mediated R1 knockdown cell lines and the human medulloblastoma UW228 cells were gifts from Dr. Annie Huang (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada) (26Huang A. Ho C.S.

UW228 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Goat polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-GR or -AR antibody, and rabbit polyclonal anti-β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against R1 was made in-house by Anaseptic Co. (San Jose, CA) (8Chen K. Ou X.M. Chen G. Choi S.H. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11552-11559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) and clorgyline (MAO A inhibitor) were purchased from Sigma Co. R1881 (a synthetic androgen) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Human MAO A Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Gene Constructs—MAO A promoter fragments, -2072/-14 bp (2 kb), were cloned into the polylinker site (XhoI/HindIII) upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Serial deletion constructs were generated from MAO A 2-kb promoter by PCR, and the PCR products were subcloned into Zero Blunt TOPO vector (PCR cloning kit, Invitrogen) for verifying DNA sequence. The PCR products were subcloned into pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter vector by restriction enzyme digestion (XhoI/HindIII) and self-ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). For construction of GRE/ARE-luciferase plasmids (GRE/ARE/SV40), the 24-bp-containing GRE/ARE1, GRE/ARE2, and GRE/ARE3 plasmids were subcloned into the MluI/XhoI sites, respectively, of the pGL3 promoter (Promega). Their sense DNA sequences were (consensus GREs are bold): GRE/ARE1: 5′-gtaccgagaacagcctgaccgtgg-3′; GRE/ARE2: 5′-aatacaagaacctcctgcacccag-3′; and GRE/ARE3: 5′-gacacaaggacattctaaacctaa-3′. The plasmid DNA was extracted and purified by using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The identity and orientation of the subcloned fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Human MAO A Core Promoter—Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to mutate each of three GRE/AREs in the human MAO A 2-kb promoter and to mutate each of four Sp1-binding sites in MAO A 2-kb or core promoter (-270/-14). GRE/AREs mutations were made by sitespecific mutagenesis of the MAO A 2-kb promoter-luciferase reporter gene vector using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange XL, Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions (27Ou X.M. Jafar-Nejad H. Storring J.M. Meng J.H. Lemonde S. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8161-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Primers used for mutagenesis of three GRE sequences are indicated in the following (sense DNA sequence; GRE sequences are bold; the lowercase letters indicate base substitutions): GRE/ARE1: 5′-GAGTGGGTACCGtttccagccgttccgtggAGAAGGGCTGCG-3′; GRE/ARE2: 5′-GGGGTTCAATACAtttccctccgttacccagTAATCCTTTCC-3′; and GRE/ARE3: CCAGCTGCCGACACAtttccattcgttacctaaTAACTCTCGCC-3′. Mutants of the first, second, third, or fourth Sp1-binding sites were generated using the human MAO A 2-kb promoter or core promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct as a template. To generate the mutation of all four Sp1-binding sites, the first Sp1-binding site was mutated using the human MAO A promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct as a template. The second Sp1-binding site was mutated using the first Sp1-binding site mutated construct. The third Sp1-binding site was mutated using the first and the second Sp1-binding site-mutated construct as templates, which were then used as the template for mutating the fourth Sp1-binding site. Four primers used for mutagenesis of four Sp1 sites are the following (Sp1-binding sites are bold; the lowercase letters indicate base substitutions: CG is replaced by tt in all four Sp1 sites): the first Sp1-binding site: 5′-CAAGGGTCCGCCCttCTCTCAGTGCCCAGC-3′ (-249 to -220 bp); the second Sp1-binding site: 5′-GAAACATCAGCTCttCCCCTGGGCGCTCCC-3′ (-201 to -172 bp); the third Sp1-binding site: 5′-GCAAAAGGGTTCGCCCttCCCACAGTGCCC-3′ (-162 to -133 bp); and the forth Sp1-binding site: 5′-GAAGGATCGGCTCttCCCCCGGGCTCCCCG-3′ (-111 to -82 bp). The mutated nucleotide sequences of all mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfections in cells were performed using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with 2 ml of medium and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown until 50% confluency (24-36 h). Wild-type or deleted or mutated MAO A promoter-luciferase construct (0.5 μg for one well) was co-transfected into cells with 20 ng of plasmid pRL-TK (the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused upstream to the Renilla luciferase gene, which is used as an internal control, Promega) as described previously (28Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21021-21028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For co-transfection of the human GR or AR expression vectors (hGR-pcDNA3 or hAR-pcDNA3), the total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept at ∼1.0 μg. The plasmids were mixed with 100 μl of serum- and antibiotic-free medium and ∼7 μl of SuperFect reagent (for one well) for ∼40 min following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated with DNA precipitates for ∼2 h and then replaced with fresh medium. For co-transfection of human R1 or Sp1 expression vectors, the total amount of DNA for each control group was kept constant by the addition of an empty expression vector pCMV3.1. Following 12-h incubation, cells were supplemented with charcoal-stripped, steroid-free fetal calf serum for 8 h to remove endogenous hormones, then treated with 100 nm dexamethasone or 10 nm R1881 in the culture medium with charcoal-stripped serum for another 12 or 24 h. Controls were the same DNA constructs co-transfected with GR or AR but treated with vehicle (ethanol) without agonists. Cells were harvested with luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega Dual Luciferase Assay system (Promega). MAO A Catalytic Activity Assay—MAO A catalytic activity was determined to access effects of glucocorticoid and androgen in SK-N-BE(2)-C and MG-1242 cells. Cells were plated at a density of 106 cells in a 10-cm dish at 37 °C for 12 h, then supplemented with charcoal-stripped, steroid-free fetal calf serum for 8 h. Subsequently, cells were treated with 100 nm dexamethasone or 10 nm R1881 or vehicle (ethanol) for another 24 or 48 h and harvested. MAO A catalytic activity was determined. Approximately 100 μg of total proteins from cells were incubated with 100 μm [14C]5-hydroxytryptamine in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl6 n HCl. Reaction products were then extracted with benzene/ethyl acetate and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The organic phase containing the reaction product was extracted, and its radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (29Geha R.M. Rebrin I. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9877-9882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nuclear Extracts and Gel-Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending SK-N-BE(2)-C cells, which were treated with either 100 nm dexamethasone or 10 nm R1881 from a 10-cm dish in 20 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9 at 4 °C), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm DTT) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (freshly added), incubating 10 min on ice, mixing, and centrifuging at 6,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclear pellet was suspended in 15 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride (freshly added) and 0.5 mm DTT (freshly added)), incubated 15 min at 4 °C, mixed and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing nuclear proteins was diluted with 75 μl of buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride (freshly added), and 0.5 mm DTT (freshly added)) and stored at -70 °C (30Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). The following two DNA fragments: 1) the third GRE/ARE element (bold), sense 5′-cgacacaaggacattctaaacctagg-3′ (we added 2 gg to the 3′-end to disrupt the “TAATAA” box) or 2) Sp1-binding sites in MAO A core promoter (the four Sp1-binding sites are bold), sense 5′-cg ccccgctctc agtgcccagc tccccccggg tatcagctga aacatcagct ccgcccctgg gcgctcccgg agtatcagca aaagggttcg ccccgcccac agtgcccggc tccccccggg tatcaaaaga aggatcggct ccgcccccgg gctccccggg gg-3′ were radiolabeled by Klenow fill-in. 20-μg nuclear extracts were diluted in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)) (31Ou X.M. Lemonde S. Jafar-Nejad H. Bown C.D. Goto A. Rogaeva A. Albert P.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7415-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a total volume of 20 μl. Antibody against GR, AR, R1, or Sp1 was added when required, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Labeled probe (∼60,000 cpm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then run on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 250 mm Tris and 1.95 m glycine (pH 8.3) at 150 V for 3 h. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation—Nuclear proteins were extracted from SK-N-BE(2)-C or 1242-MG cells (1 × 107) and treated with 100 nm dexamethasone or 10 nm R1881 or vehicle for 24 h as described previously (32Ou X.M. Storring J.M. Kushwaha N. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14299-14307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Briefly, the nuclear proteins were extracted by adding the immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μm antipain, 1 g/ml aprotinin, 30 μm leupeptin, 30 μm chymostatin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride), and incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking. Soluble nuclear proteins were collected as supernatant by centrifuging at 1,200 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed for 4 h at 4°C against 1 liter of immunoprecipitation buffer with protease inhibitors. After dialysis, the nuclear proteins were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. The concentration of proteins in the supernatant fraction of the lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were adjusted to 4 mg/ml with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer. The nuclear protein was immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-GR or -AR antibody (4 μl of antibody in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer) with BioMag beads (Anti-Mouse, Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. As a negative control, BioMag beads without antibody were used. Beads and bound proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins were eluted from beads by boiling them in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mg/ml sucrose, 2% SDS, 0.05 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 100 mm DTT) for 5 min. Proteins co-immunoprecipitated with GR or AR were analyzed by Western blot with anti-R1 or anti-Sp1 antibodies. Western Blot Analysis of Proteins Co-immunoprecipitated with GR or AR—Twenty micrograms of total proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with anti-GR or -AR antibody were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the transfer, membranes were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated with anti-R1 antibody (1:500), with anti-Sp1 antibody (1:250), or with anti-β-actin antibody (negative control) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit antibody for R1 and β-actin, 1/10,000, or mouse anti-goat antibody for Sp1, 1/4000), and chemiluminescence procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). ∼0.5% of nuclear proteins of each sample (input) before co-immunoprecipitation experiments were loaded on gel and blotted by anti-R1 or -Sp1 antibody as positive controls. Immunofluorescence and Quantitative Image Analysis—SK-N-BE(2)-C and UW228 cells were plated on coverslips the day before experiment. After 16 h, cells were supplemented with charcoal-stripped, steroid-free fetal calf serum for 8 h, then treated with 100 nm dexamethasone for another 12, 24, or 48 h. Controls were treated with vehicle for the same time. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-R1-antibody (1/1000) at 4 °C, followed with fluorescein-conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody (1/1000, Vector Laboratories) for 2 h. Stained slides were mounted by Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) in the presence of 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, for nuclear staining) and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Quantitative analysis of R1 expression in both the nucleus and cytosol was carried out by calculating the ratios of green color (R1 signal) intensity (nucleus/cytosol) using image analysis software (ComPix, Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Images were acquired using a Q-Imaging Retiga EXI Cooled-CCD digital camera at 1392 × 1040 pixel resolution and 12-bit/channel color depth. The acquired images were then analyzed using the Compix imaging software. The total area of green color in the nuclei in an image field was determined. To measure the R1 signal in cytosol, total R1 signal in both nuclei and cytosol was segmented and counted. The R1 signal in cytosol was obtained by subtracting the intensity value of cytosol from the total intensity of nuclei and cytosol. This result was used to calculate the R1 expression ratio of nucleus/cytosol. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance was evaluated using a Student's t test for two-group comparisons when needed. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Dexamethasone and R1881 Increased Human MAO A Promoter Activity—Three consensus glucocorticoid/androgen response elements (GRE/ARE1, -2, and -3, from 5′- to 3′-ends, Fig. 1A) and a core promoter that contains four Sp1-binding sites (or R1-binding sites, -238 to -14 bp, Fig. 1A) have been identified within the human MAO A 2-kb promoter region (Fig. 1A). Sp1-binding sites (-239 to -93) are located 36-bp downstream of the third GRE/ARE (GRE/ARE3, -289 to -275 bp, Fig. 1B). To study effects of dexamethasone (glucocorticoid) and R1881 (androgen) on MAO A gene expression, an MAO A 2-kb luciferase construct was co-transfected with or without a GR-expression vector (Fig. 2, A and B) or an AR-expression vector (Fig. 2, C and D) into SK-N-BE(2)-C (Fig. 2, A and C) or MG-1242 (Fig. 2, B and D). Cells were then treated with synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (100 nm), or synthetic androgen, R1881 (10 nm) for 24 h.FIGURE 2The effect of dexamethasone or R1881 on MAO A promoter activity in SK-N-BE(2)-C and 1242-MG cell lines. A, MAO A 2-kb-luciferase construct alone (lanes 3 and 4) and with GR expression vector (lanes 5 and 6) were co-transfected into SK-N-BE(2)-C cells for 16 h. The culture medium was then changed to charcoal-treated serum to remove endogenous hormones. 8 h later, a charcoal-treated serum containing a synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (100 nm), was added. After another 24 h, cells were collected and luciferase activity was determined. The pGL2-basic without MAO A promoter is the negative control (lanes 1 and 2). The same experiments were performed in B with 1242-MG cells. The effect of a synthetic androgen, R1881 (10 nm), was also studied in a similar way in SK-N-BE(2)-C (C) and 1242-MG cell lines (D). Controls were respective luciferase constructs with vehicle (ethanol) treatment (without agonists), which were taken as 1. Data are the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments with triplicates for each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), the MAO A promoter activity was 2.6-fold increased upon treatment with dexamethasone in both cell lines compared with their respective controls (treatment with vehicle, column 4 versus 3). When co-transfecting glucocorticoid receptor, MAO A promoter activity was further increased to 5.3-fold upon treatment with dexamethasone in both cell lines compared with their respective controls (column 6 versus 5). Similarly, R1881 increased the MAO A promoter activities to 1.8-fold in both SK-N-BE(2)-C and MG-1242 cell lines as shown in Fig. 2 (C and D, column 4 versus 3). When co-transfecting with androgen receptor, MAO A promoter activity was further increased to 3-fold upon treatment with R1881in both cell lines compared with controls (Fig. 2, C and D, column 6 versus 5). However, dexamethasone or R1881 alone did not increase the pGL2 basic luciferase reporter gene activity (Fig. 2, A-D, column 2 versus 1). We have also examined the effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the human MAO A 2-kb promoter activity. DHT increases MAO A promoter activity similarly to R1881 (data not"
https://openalex.org/W2105083825,"Control of specificity in cAMP signaling is achieved by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which assemble cAMP effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA) into multiprotein signaling complexes in the cell. AKAPs tether the PKA holoenzymes at subcellular locations to favor the phosphorylation of selected substrates. PKA anchoring is mediated by an amphipathic helix of 14-18 residues on each AKAP that binds to the R subunit dimer of the PKA holoenzymes. Using a combination of bioinformatics and peptide array screening, we have developed a high affinity-binding peptide called RIAD (RIanchoring disruptor) with >1000-fold selectivity for type I PKA over type II PKA. Cell-soluble RIAD selectively uncouples cAMP-mediated inhibition of T cell function and inhibits progesterone synthesis at the mitochondria in steroid-producing cells. This study suggests that these processes are controlled by the type I PKA holoenzyme and that RIAD can be used as a tool to define anchored type I PKA signaling events.

The cAMP signaling pathway synchronizes a variety of physiological responses including cell proliferation and differentiation, microtubule dynamics, reproductive function, modulation of immune responses, and steroidogenesis (1Carnegie G.K.

Upon activation with cAMP, the C subunits are released from their interaction with the R subunit dimer and are free to phosphorylate a plethora of target substrates. Individual cells express a range of PKA isozymes differing in R (RIα,RIβ, RIIα, RIIβ) and C(Cα,Cβ,Cγ) subunit composition. The type I and type II PKA isozymes, which are classified on the basis of their R subunit dimer, possess slightly different physical and biological properties including a differential sensitivity to cAMP. Spatiotemporal regulation of PKA phosphorylation events is facilitated by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). This family of structurally diverse but functionally related proteins act as molecular scaffolds to cluster PKA with specific substrates and signal termination enzymes such as phosphatases (4Alto N.

The molecular basis for PKA anchoring is the interaction of an amphipathic helical motif of 14-18 residues on the AKAP with a hydrophobic groove in the N-terminal dimerization domain of the R subunit. High affinity peptides mimicking the amphipathic helix bind to the R dimer and can serve as competitive inhibitors of the PKA-AKAP interaction and inhibit signaling by delocalization of PKA. The prototypic inhibitor that has been used to disrupt PKA localization is the peptide known as Ht31 (19Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D.C. Stofkohahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which encompasses the RII binding domain of human thyroid AKAP (AKAP-Lbc) (20Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

Recently, the dual specificity anchoring protein D-AKAP2 has been used as a template to design peptides that preferentially interact with RIα in vitro (21Burns-Hamuro L.L. Ma Y.L. Kammerer S.

Here, we have conducted a bioinformatics analysis on a set of dual-affinity AKAP binding sequences to develop a peptide that binds RIα with higher affinity and specificity than any naturally occurring AKAP or other RIα-binding peptide reported. When introduced into cells, this peptide specifically disrupts anchoring of type I PKA from intracellular locations and inhibits type I PKA regulation of T cell effector function and steroid biosynthesis. Autospot Peptide Array—Peptide arrays were synthesized on cellulose paper using an Autospot Robot ASP222 or a Multipep automated peptide synthesizer (INTAVIS Bioanalytical Instruments AG) as described (22Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar). MEME Software—MEME software was used for consensus sequence generation (23Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). MEME setting included one motif per sequence, and a motif length of 24 amino acids was specified. Helical Wheel Model Prediction and Alignments—Protean and MegAlign were used (DNASTAR Inc.). Densitometric Analysis—The densitometric analysis was performed using Scion Image (Scion Corp.) or Quantity One Version 4.5.0 (Bio-Rad). R-overlay—R-overlays were conducted as described using 32P-labeled recombinant murine RIIα (24Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar) or bovine or human RIα (A98S) or by cold RIα-overlay. Cold RIα-overlay was performed by incubating the membrane with 250 nm RIα overnight at 4 °C and then washing the membrane five times in cold Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 for 5 min at 4 °C. RIα was detected by immunoblotting with an RIα antibody. Constructs and Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotides with the following sequences were cloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1, vector (Clontech): RIAD(+), 5′-GTCGACCTGGAGCAGTACGCCAACCAGCTGGCCGACCAGATCATCAAGGAGGCCACCGAGGGATCC-3′; RIAD(-), 5′-GGATCCCTCGGTGGCCTCCTTGATGATCTGGTCGGCCAGCTGGTTGGCGTACTGCTCCAGGTCGAC-3′; scRIAD(+), 5′-GTCGACATCGAGAAGGAGCTGGCCCAGCAGTACCAGAACGCCGACGCCATCACCCTGGAGGGATCC-3′; scRIAD(-), 5′-GGATCCCTCCAGGGTGATGGCGTCGGCGTTCTGGTACTGCTGGGCCAGCTCCTTCCGATGTCGAC-3′ (the SalI and BamHI sites are underlined). The sitespecific substitution, A98S, was made in bovine or human RIα wild type cloned into pRSET-B (Invitrogen) using a site specific-mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Bovine RIα (Δ1-11)(A98S), RIα (Δ1-15)(A98S), and RIα (Δ1-24)(A98S) mutants were made by PCR and re-cloned into pRSET-B. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Fluorescence Polarization—0.5-1 nm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled RIAD (LEQYANQLADQIIKEATEK (5-carboxyfluorescein)-CONH2) and scRIAD (IEKELAQQYQNADAITLEK (5-carboxyl fluorescein)-CONH2) peptides (SynPep) were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant bovine RIα wt or murine RIIα for 2.5 h in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, supplemented with 5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Fluorescence polarization was measured on a Beacon 2000 fluorimeter (Panvera). Saturation binding curves were generated with PRISM graphing software (GraphPad). Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated from the nonlinear regression curve from averages of minimum three individual experiments. Cell Cultures—Human peripheral blood T cells were purified by negative selection as described (25Aandahl E.M. Aukrust P. Skalhegg B.S. Muller F. Froland S.S. Hansson V. Tasken K.

Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) and mouse adrenocortical Y1 cells (ATCC, CCL-79) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or DMEM/HAM'S F-12 respectively, supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and split by trypsin at less than 80% confluence. Immunoprecipitation and PKA Activity Assay—HEK293 cells at 50-80% confluency were transfected with 5-10 μg of plasmid DNA (green fluorescent protein (GFP), GFP-RIAD, GFP-scRIAD, GFP-RIAD-V5His, and GFP-scRIAD-V5His) per 56.7-cm2 culture dishes using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free tablets; Roche Diagnostics). Immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer before SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting. PKA kinase assays were performed by the filter paper assay (26Corbin J.D. Reimann E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 38: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) residues 5-24 peptide was used as a specific inhibitor of the kinase (27Scott J.D.

Antibodies—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were carried out with antibodies against PKA RIα, RIIα, and C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology or BD Transduction Laboratories), GFP (Clontech), α-tubulin (Molecular Probes), StAR (Affinity BioReagents), Lck phospho-Tyr-505 (Cell Signaling Technology), Lck (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), LAT (Linker for activation of T cells; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and V5 (Invitrogen). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs was used as a secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). For immunofluorescence, antibodies against RIα (Biogenesis Ltd.), RIIα (BD Transduction Laboratories), and AKAP450 (A24 (9Tasken K.A. Collas P. Kemmners W.A. Witczak O. Conti M. Tasken K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21999-22002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar)) plus Alexa-488- or Alexa-555-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) were used. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed on T cells or Y1 adrenocortical cells attached to poly-lysine or collagen/fibronectin-coated coverslips. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes), which was diluted in fresh medium and incubated on cells at 37 °C for 30 min before cell fixation. All cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20 before antibody labeling. Primary and secondary antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution in bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20 and incubated for 30 min. DNA was counterstained using TO-PRO3 (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 1 μm. Cells were examined using a Leica TCS SP1 confocal fluorescence microscope (63× magnification) (Leica, Germany). Protein Expression and Purification—Bovine RIα or murine RIIα was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified with cAMP beads (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (28Herberg F.W. Maleszka A. Eide T. Vossebein L. Tasken K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Murine RIIα was purified by the His tag using fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide Synthesis and Loading—RIAD and scRIAD (scrambled RIAD) were synthesized untagged or with 11 arginine residues at the C termini and purified to >80% purity (SynPep or in house). The arginine-coupled peptides were added directly to the cell culture (0-30 μm) at different time intervals. The peptide concentrations used were re-calculated after exact determination by Applied Biosystems Analyzer 421 (Applied Biosystems). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Japan) as described (29Birkemo G.A. Mantzilas D. Luders T. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Progesterone Production—Y1 adrenocortical cells were cultured overnight in 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per well. To increase the basal level of StAR, the cells were prestimulated with 10 μm forskolin for 1 h before peptide loading. The cells were loaded with the arginine-coupled peptide for 5 h, then treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) for 30 min and finally stimulated with 10 μm forskolin (Calbiochem) or 10 IU/ml ACTH (Sigma) for 12 h. Media from cultures were collected, and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Spectra, Orion Diagnostica) or fluorometric assay (Delfia, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturers' instructions. Solid Phase Assay—Lysates prepared from 5 × 106 Y1 adrenocortical cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight with RIAD and scRIAD peptides synthesized on membranes. The membranes were washed twice for 10 min in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) and thereafter in high salt lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl before boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Lipid Raft Purification—Isolation of lipid rafts was performed as described (30Lygren B. Tasken K. Carlson C.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 305: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Whole-cell recordings were made with an Axopatch200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Patch pipettes (2-4 megaohms) contained 140 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 5 mm adenosine triphosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate) and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Extracellular solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1 mm cyclothiazide, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Solution exchanges were accomplished through a two-barrel pipe controlled by a solution stimulus delivery device, SF-77B (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The GluR1 (AMPA channel subunit) receptor currents were evoked by a 500-ms application of 1 mm glutamate at 30-s intervals. Data were acquired and analyzed by using PCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). Currents were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Statistics—One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 (GraphPad). Development of an Optimal RIα Binding Consensus Sequence—In an attempt to define an optimal and specific peptide disruptor for type I PKA, we used the MEME algorithm to analyze the R binding domains from several anchoring proteins that interact with RIα (23Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). This program looks for sites of amino acid similarity and predicts the side chain most likely to occupy a particular site on the basis of comparison to corresponding sites in the sample proteins in a nonredundant data base. The linear R binding sequences from D-AKAP1 (11Huang L.J.S. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), AKAP149 (31Trendelenburg G. Hummel M. Riecken E.O. Hanski C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were aligned (Fig. 1A, upper panel) and analyzed by this approach. A position-dependent scoring matrix (PDSM) consensus sequence of 20 amino acids was identified (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Further characterization of this sequence was performed using peptide arrays (Figs. 1, B and C). Direct binding of RIα to the immobilized peptides was made possible using RIα (A98S), a mutant R subunit form that can be phosphorylated by the C subunit of PKA in vitro (32Durgerian S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9807-9813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of phosphorylated RIα (A98S) binding with the PDSM sequence and other immobilized AKAP-derived peptides was assessed by autoradiography (Fig. 1B). A series of peptide truncations from both the N and C termini was screened to narrow down the RIα binding site to an 18-amino acid peptide (Fig. 1B). This 18-residue PDSM sequence bound RIα (A98S) more tightly than the native AKAP peptide sequences (data not shown). Although we were able to generate an RIα selective binding peptide, the 18-residue PDSM sequence retained the ability to bind RIIα as assessed by the solid phase binding assay (Fig. 1C). Optimization of the RIα Binding Consensus Sequence and Development of RIAD—Optimization of the 18-residue PDSM sequence to enhance its preference for RI was performed by screening a two-dimensional peptide array using radiolabeled RIα as a probe (Fig. 2). 360 PDSM sequence peptide derivatives were arrayed with single side chain substitutions at each position. [32P]RIα and -RIIα binding were assessed by autoradiography (Figs. 2, A and B). The binding of each modified peptide was compared with that of internal control peptides of the original sequence (white circles). As with previous studies, we discovered that introduction of helix-breaking side-chains or removal of hydrophobic side-chains diminished RIα and RIIα binding. However, introduction of acidic amino acids (aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E)) at strategic positions within the sequence retained RIα binding and yielded peptides that bound poorly to RIIα (dotted columns in Figs. 2A and 2B). Nineteen single amino acid substitutions increased the relative RIα binding of the PDSM sequence over RIIα (red circles in Figs. 2, A and B). This finding was exploited in a second round of peptide arrays where single-, double-, and triple-substituted peptides were screened for preferential interaction with RIα (Fig. 2C). Densitometry of autoradiographs was used to quantitate the relative RIα and RIIα binding of each peptide. We were able to identify a triple-substituted peptide LEQYANQLADQIIKEATE that retained a high affinity for RIα but did not appreciably bind to RIIα (Fig. 2C). This peptide exhibited a 3.7-fold increase in RIα binding affinity over the original PDSM and exhibited an apparent 50-fold selectivity for RIα over RIIα. We named this RIα-binding peptide RI anchoring disruptor (abbreviated as RIAD). Characterization of RIAD in Vitro—The helicity of RIAD and scRIAD measured by circular dichroism (CD) was 9 and 16% in water, respectively. In the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol, which induces and stabilizes α-helical structures, RIAD and scRIAD yielded CD spectra typical for α-helical peptides (data not shown), with calculated helical contents of 79 and 61%, respectively. RIAD fused to 11 arginine residues (RIAD-Arg11), which was used in functional studies described below, displayed a helicity of 65% in 50% trifluoroethanol (data not shown). Modeling the RIAD sequence on a helical wheel (DNASTAR) suggested that it consists of one clearly defined hydrophobic face and a negatively charged polar face (Fig. 2D). When this model is reconciled with our two-dimensional peptide array analysis, it suggests that changes in the hydrophobic face are not well tolerated for R subunit interaction, whereas amino acid substitutions in “non-contacting face” are important to enhance high affinity interaction with RIα. RIAD and a control peptide with a scrambled sequence (scRIAD: IEKELAQQYQNADAITLE) were synthesized with fluorescein isothiocyanate and used in fluorescence polarization assays to measure the dissociation constants of RIAD for both R subunits. Dissociation constant (Kd) for RIAD interaction with RIα was calculated to be 1.0 ± 0.2 nm (n = 3) (Fig. 2E). In contrast, RIIα bound poorly to RIAD with a dissociation constant of 1760 ± 290 nm (n = 3) (Fig. 2E). Control experiments showed that the scRIAD peptide exhibited no affinity for RI or RII (data not shown). Thus, RIAD exhibits a 1760-fold preference for RIα over RIIα. This suggests that RIAD is 20-fold more selective for RIα than PV-38, a peptide derived from the dual specificity anchoring protein D-AKAP1 (21Burns-Hamuro L.L. Ma Y.L. Kammerer S. Reineke U. Self C. Cook C. Olson G.L. Cantor C.R. Braun A. Taylor S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4072-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). RIAD bound with similar affinity to human and bovine RIα as assessed by the solid phase overlay assay (data not shown). Cellular Characterization of RIAD—A variety of approaches was used to characterize the interaction of RIAD with the type I PKA in HEK293 cells. Chimeric constructs encoding RIAD or scRIAD fused to the GFP were transfected into HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). Lysates from transfected cells were prepared, subjected to SDSPAGE, and used for an RIα overlay assay. The chimeric RIAD bound with high affinity to RIα (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Interestingly, the N-terminal-truncated RIα (Δ1-15) bound RIAD with a higher affinity, suggesting that the RIα mutant has a more accessible AKAP binding surface. Control experiments confirmed that [32P]RIα did not bind to scRIAD-GFP chimeric protein (negative control) (Fig. 3B, lane 3). To determine whether endogenous PKA binds to RIAD, co-immunoprecipitations with an RIα antibody were performed from transfected HEK293 cells. GFP-RIAD co-purified with endogenous RIα (Fig. 3C, lane 2), whereas GFP-scRIAD did not (Fig. 3C, lanes 3). Control immunoprecipitation experiments using an RII antibody were negative (data not shown). Roughly equivalent amounts of fusion proteins were present in the immune complexes as assessed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP (lower panel). In reciprocal experiments, PKA activity co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-RIAD but not with GFP-scRIAD, as measured in an in vitro kinase assay using Kemptide as substrate (Fig. 3D). PKA activity was 170-fold higher in the GFP-RIAD fraction than in the fraction with only IgG. Kinase activity did not co-purify with the GFP-scRIAD, which is unable to bind PKA. Control experiments confirmed that most of the kinase activity was blocked by the PKI (5Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D.

https://openalex.org/W1992950566,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA I and II) and the cAMP-stimulated GDP exchange factors (Epac1 and -2) are major cAMP effectors. The cAMP affinity of the PKA holoenzyme has not been determined previously. We found that cAMP bound to PKA I with a <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> value (2.9 μm) similar to that of Epac1. In contrast, the free regulatory subunit of PKA type I (RI) had <i>K<sub>d</sub></i> values in the low nanomolar range. The cAMP sites of RI therefore appear engineered to respond to physiological cAMP concentrations only when in the holoenzyme form, whereas Epac can respond in its free form. Epac is phylogenetically younger than PKA, and its functional cAMP site has presumably evolved from site B of PKA. A striking feature is the replacement of a conserved Glu in PKA by Gln (Epac1) or Lys (Epac2). We found that such a switch (E326Q) in site B of human RIα led to a 280-fold decreased cAMP affinity. A similar single switch early in Epac evolution could therefore have decreased the high cAMP affinity of the free regulatory subunit sufficiently to allow Epac to respond to physiologically relevant cAMP levels. Molecular dynamics simulations and cAMP analog mapping indicated that the E326Q switch led to flipping of Tyr-373, which normally stacks with the adenine ring of cAMP. Combined molecular dynamics simulation, GRID analysis, and cAMP analog mapping of wild-type and mutated BI and Epac1 revealed additional differences, independent of the Glu/Gln switch, between the binding sites, regarding space (roominess), hydrophobicity/polarity, and side chain flexibility. This helped explain the specificity of current cAMP analogs and, more importantly, lays a foundation for the generation of even more discriminative analogs."
https://openalex.org/W1980299884,"Mitochondria-mediated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in apoptosis. Mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin molecules are likely the main target of ROS because they are particularly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. They are also located in the inner mitochondrial membrane near the ROS-producing sites. Under physiological conditions mitochondria can repair peroxidative damage in part through a remodeling mechanism via the deacylation-reacylation cycle mediated by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and acyl-coenzyme A-dependent monolysocardiolipin acyltransferase. Here we investigate whether group VIA Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) plays a role in the protection of mitochondrial function from damage caused by mitochondrially generated ROS during apoptotic induction by staurosporine (STS). We show that iPLA2-expressing cells were relatively resistant to STS-induced apoptosis. iPLA2 localized to mitochondria even before apoptotic induction, and most iPLA2-associated mitochondria were intact in apoptotic resistant cells. Expression of iPLA2 in INS-1 cells prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, attenuated the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria, and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Inhibition of caspase 8 has little effect on STS-induced apoptosis in INS-1 cells. Finally, we found that STS down-regulated endogenous iPLA2 transcription in both INS-1 and iPLA2-expressing INS-1 cells without affecting the expression of group IV Ca2+-dependent PLA2. Together, our data indicate that iPLA2 is important for the protection of mitochondrial function from oxidative damage during apoptotic induction.

Apoptotic induction triggers the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of cytochrome c, which interacts with and causes the oligomerization of monomeric apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and the subsequent recruitment of caspase-9 to form the apoptosome (3Acehan D.

Some ROS, such as superoxide (O2.¯ ) or hydroxyl radicals (·OH), are extremely unstable, whereas others, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are freely diffusible and relatively long-lived. If not adequately neutralized, ROS can damage cells by promoting DNA fragmentation, sulfhydryl-mediated protein cross-linking, and peroxidation of membrane phospholipids. Peroxidation of membrane phospholipids is a major mechanism of ROS attack. Phospholipids, the major building blocks of membranes, are essential for cell life. They are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and vulnerable to attack by ROS (6Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nigam S.

It is well known that peroxidation of membrane phospholipids alters membrane fluidity, ion permeability, surface charge, passive electric properties, membranous enzyme activity, and cell signaling (6Girotti A.W.

Therefore, STS-induced apoptosis is a useful model for the study of the effects of mitochondrially generated ROS on membrane phospholipid peroxidation. In the present study we use this model to investigate the role of iPLA2-mediated phospholipid repair of oxidatively damaged mitochondrial membranes during apoptosis in rat insulinoma INS-1. Cells and Transfection—Rat insulinoma INS-1 cells or CHO cells were cultured as described previously (31Ma Z. Bohrer A. Wohltmann M. Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Lipids. 2001; 36: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Stable expression of iPLA2 in an INS-1 cell line (iPLA2-INS) was previously established using the retroviral vector pMSCVneo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) containing iPLA2 cDNA downstream of a 5′ long terminal repeat from the PCMV virus as described (31Ma Z. Bohrer A. Wohltmann M. Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Lipids. 2001; 36: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Wohltmann M. Bohrer A. Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Biol.

Metab. 2002; 282: 820-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For expression of iPLA2, we used the expression vector pcDNA3-iPLA2 to transfect the cells with a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described (34Zhang X.H. Zhao C. Seleznev K. Song K. Manfredi J.J. Ma Z.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For expression of iPLA2-GFP fusion protein, the expression vector pEGFP-N2-iPLA2 was constructed by subcloning fulllength rat iPLA2 cDNA in-frame upstream of the GFP cassette in the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech). Transfected cells stably expressing iPLA2-GFP were selected with G418 (active concentration, 400 μg/ml). Detection of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was induced by treating the cells with STS (Sigma), actinomycin D, etoposide, camptothecin (CHEMICON International, Inc.), or H2O2 (Promega). Multiple methods were used to detect apoptosis. For detection of phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization by flow cytometry, an annexin V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to stain cells with fluorescent isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, ∼106 cells were harvested, washed with PBS by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin V-FLUOS labeling solution containing annexin V and PI. Cells were incubated for 10-15 min at 15-25 °C and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur (34Zhang X.H. Zhao C. Seleznev K. Song K. Manfredi J.J. Ma Z.A. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PS externalization is a unique marker for apoptosis. Combined staining with annexin V and PI can be used to determine the early and late apoptosis. Cells were considered early apoptotic when they were annexin V-positive and PI-negative and late-apoptotic when they were both annexin V- and PI-positive. For detection of DNA fragmentation, fragmentized DNA was purified using the apoptotic DNA ladder kit (Roche Applied Science) and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. Measurement of Caspase Activity—For determination of caspase 3 activity, cells were pretreated with or without 20 μm Z-DEVD-FMK (BD Biosciences), a caspase 3 specific inhibitor, or 20 μm Z-IETD-FMK (BD Biosciences), a caspase 8 specific inhibitor, and followed by apoptotic induction. Then the cells were counted with hemacytometer. 106 cells were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed with the CaspACE Assay System Colorimetric (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot Analysis—The cytosol and mitochondrial fractions of cells were obtained with mitochondria/cytosol fractionation kit following the manufacturer's protocol (BioVIsion, Mountain View, CA). The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Aliquots (containing 60 μg for cytoplasmic fraction or 15 μg for mitochondrial fraction) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blotted with corresponding antibodies, and detected by ECL WESTERN blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-iPLA2, anti-cPLA2, anti-cytochrome c, anti-Smac/DIABLO, anti-AIF, anti-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz), and anti-histone H4 (Upstate, Waltham, MA) antibodies were used. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc. Thornwood, NY). INS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N2-iPLA2 construct and grown on cover slides. After induction of apoptosis, the cells were incubated in 50 nm Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 15 min, washed with PBS, fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde (Fisher), and stained with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). The samples were embedded in Vectashield Mounting Medium H-1000 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser-scanning microscope. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Mitochondrial membrane potentials were determined by the JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine) mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Technology, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, after induction of apoptosis, cells were washed with PBS and labeled with the JC-1 reagent for 15 min. After washing, the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Mitochondria containing red JC-1 aggregates in healthy cells were detectable in the FL2 channel, and green JC-1 monomers in apoptotic cells were detectable in the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was calculated as the percentage of green cells versus total cells. Measurement of Mitochondrial Generation of ROS—Intramitochondrial generation of superoxide (O2.) was determined by the superoxide-induced conversion of the superoxide-sensitive dye, dihydroethidium (HE) to the highly fluorescent ethidium (37Bucana C. Saiki I. Nayar R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the treatment of STS, cells were stained with 2 μm HE (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 15 min. The cells were collected by trypsinization, washed once with PBS, and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. Data were visualized using Windows Multiple Document Interface (WinMDI) (Joseph Trotter, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA) or FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) flow-cytometry software. Values were expressed as a percentage of total cell counts. Measurement of Lipid Peroxidation—The Oxltek TBARS assay kit (ZeptoMetrix) was used to assess lipid peroxidation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, samples of cell suspension were separated into aliquots, and 2.5 ml of trichloroacetic acid/TBARS reagent was added. Each sample was incubated at 95 °C for 60 min. Supernatants were analyzed by a spectrophotometer at 532 nm, and values were expressed as a percentage of values in controls. iPLA2 Activity Assay—iPLA2 activity was determined using a modified kit originally designed for cytosolic Ca2+-dependent PLA2 (cPLA2) (cPLA2 assay kit, Cayman Chemicals) as described (33Song K. Zhang X. Zhao C. Ang N.T. Ma Z.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 504-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, after specific treatments, cultured cells were collected and homogenized in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the protein concentration was determined. iPLA2 activity was assayed by incubating the samples with arachidonoyl thio-PC for 1 h at 25°C in Ca2+-free buffer (4 mm EGTA, 160 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 8 mm Triton X-100, 60% glycerol, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) for 5 min, and absorbance was determined at 414 nm using a μQuant microplate reader (BIO-TEK Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). The specific activity of iPLA2 was calculated and expressed in nmol/min/mg of total proteins. The background basal lipase activity, which was determined by inhibiting all specific iPLA2 activity in control samples with bromoenol lactone (BEL), was subtracted from all readings as described (33Song K. Zhang X. Zhao C. Ang N.T. Ma Z.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 504-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Smani T. Zakharov S.I. Csutora P. Leno E. Trepakova E.S. Bolotina V.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from INS-1 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCRs were performed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen), and the RT-PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. Primers for amplification of a fragment (505 bp) of rat iPLA2 were sense (5′-ATGCAGTTCTTTGGACGC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCAGAATCTCACTGTCAC-3′) and for amplification of rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were sense (5′-TGTCAGCAATGCATCCTG-3′) and antisense (5′-AACACGGAAGGCCATGCC-3′). Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. The statistical significance of differences was analyzed using Student's t test, where p < 0.05 was considered significant. iPLA2 Protects Cells from Mitochondrial Stress-induced Apoptosis—STS has previously been shown to induce apoptosis (24Yang J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar), mitochondrial superoxide (O2.) generation (25Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and membrane phospholipid peroxidation (26Kruman I. Guo Q. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci.

To verify these findings in rat insulinoma INS-1 cells, we treated INS-1 cells with 1 μm STS and analyzed for apoptosis by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V-FLUOS (Fig. 1A). We also used HE staining to assess mitochondrial superoxide generation (Fig. 1B) and the TBARS assay to measure lipid peroxidation levels (Fig. 1C) in these cells. As in other cells, STS induced both early (annexin V-positive and PI-negative cells) and late apoptosis (annexin V- and PI-positive cells) in INS-1 cells as well as mitochondrial ROS production and membrane lipid peroxidation. To investigate the role of iPLA2 in apoptosis induced by mitochondrially generated ROS, we compared the effect of STS on INS-1 cells with its effect on INS-1 cells stably expressing iPLA2 (iPLA2-INS) (31Ma Z. Bohrer A. Wohltmann M. Ramanadham S. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Lipids. 2001; 36: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Wohltmann M. Bohrer A. Hsu F.F. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13198-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We first rigorously analyzed the time course of STS-induced apoptosis in each cell line using annexin V labeling followed by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, iPLA2-INS cells were relatively resistant to STS-induced apoptosis compared with parental INS-1 cells. We found that the peak of early apoptosis (annexin V-positive and PI-negative) occurred between 8 to 12 h in both cell lines, and many of these cells progressed into late apoptosis (annexin V- and PI-positive) (Fig. 2A). However, in contrast to the INS-1 cells, which were nearly all dead 36 h after STS treatment, about 40% of iPLA2-INS cells remained alive (Fig. 2B), and many cells were still in early apoptosis after the same amount of time (Fig. 2A). These results clearly show that although STS induces a considerable amount of cell death in iPLA2-INS cells, their apoptotic progression is significantly delayed in comparison to INS-1 cells. To evaluate whether the degree of apoptotic resistance correlates with the level of iPLA2 expression, we first analyzed the effect of iPLA2 on apoptosis in a population of cells. INS-1 cells were transfected with iPLA2-GFP, and apoptosis was induced with STS. After PI staining, cells were sorted via FACS using two gates, one for PI and one for GFP. After sorting, cells were divided into groups according to their levels of GFP expression (inset in Fig. 2C), and the extent of cell death within each group (PI-positive cells) was determined. As shown in Fig. 2C, groups with no or low levels of GFP expression exhibited the highest proportions of dead cells. As iPLA2-GFP fusion protein expression increased, the proportion of PI-positive cells in each group fell. These results suggest that resistance to STS-induced apoptosis is positively correlated with higher iPLA2 levels. To confirm this finding, we selected and expanded individual colonies expressing variable levels of iPLA2. Once again, as shown in Fig. 2D, as iPLA2 expression increased, the proportion of dead cells decreased. To determine the extent of resistance of iPLA2-INS cells to apoptotic induction by STS, we treated both cell lines with increasing concentrations of STS for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 2E, when STS concentration was increased to 5 μm, we saw no significant difference in cell death levels between INS-1 cells and those expressing iPLA2, indicating that the stronger apoptotic induction overcame the protective function of iPLA2. To confirm that iPLA2-INS cells were relatively resistant to STS-induced apoptosis, we also looked for the appearance of DNA ladders. DNA fragmentation was apparent in INS-1 within4hofSTS treatment and intensified with time. However, DNA fragmentation was significantly attenuated in iPLA2-INS cells (Fig. 3A). We also compared STS-induced caspase-3 activation between the two cell lines (Fig. 3B). A difference in the degree of caspase 3 activation could be detected within2hofSTS treatment and became significant after 4 h. Although the activity increased prominently in a time-dependent manner in INS-1 cells, there was no significant increase in iPLA2-INS cells after 4 h, indicating that elevated levels of iPLA2 prevent the activation of caspase 3 in STS-induced apoptosis. It has been reported that STS causes the release of histones into the cytoplasm during apoptosis (40Wu D. Ingram A. Lahti J.H. Mazza B. Grenet J. Kapoor A. Liu L. Kidd V.J. Tang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, this release of histones from nucleosomes to cytoplasm was very prominent in INS-1 cells; they were evident on the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE and reacted strongly with anti-histone H4 antibodies on the Western blot (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the timing of histone release correlated well with the progression of apoptosis in the INS-1 cells. In contrast, many fewer histones were released in the iPLA2-INS cells in response to STS treatment. Taken together, our results unambiguously demonstrate that iPLA2 protects β-cells from apoptosis induced by mitochondrial stress. To determine whether iPLA2 can also protect other types of cells from apoptosis, we transfected CHO cells with a pDNA3-iPLA2 construct. As a control, a separate group of CHO cells were mock-transfected. Both groups of cells were then treated with 1 μm STS. Similar to our results in INS-cells, DNA fragmentation in iPLA2-expressing CHO cells was also dramatically less tha"

The binding of fAβ to this receptor complex has been shown to drive a tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascade leading to production of reactive oxygen species and stimulation of phagocytic activity; however, little is known about the intracellular signaling cascades governing the microglial response to fAβ. This study reports a direct mechanistic link between the fAβ cell surface receptor complex and downstream signaling events responsible for NADPH oxidase activation and phagosome formation. The Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to fAβ peptides as a result of the engagement of the microglia fAβ cell surface receptor complex. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate an Aβ-dependent association between Vav and both Lyn and Syk kinases. The downstream target of Vav, the small GTPase Rac1, is GTP-loaded in an Aβ-dependent manner. Rac1 is both an essential component of the NADPH oxidase and a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis. The direct role of Vav in fAβ-stimulated intracellular signaling cascades was established using primary microglia obtained from Vav–/– mice. Stimulation of Vav–/– microglia with fAβ failed to generate NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species and displayed a dramatically attenuated phagocytic response. These findings directly link Vav phosphorylation to the Aβ-receptor complex and demonstrate that Vav activity is required for fAβ-stimulated intracellular signaling events upstream of reactive oxygen species production and phagosome formation.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4183-4187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The initiating events leading to Alzheimer disease remain unknown; however, these findings suggest that oxidative damage plays an early critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Microglia have been postulated to be a potential source of oxidative stress in response to Aβ peptides (2Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R. McGeer P.L. O'Banion M.K. Pachter J. Pasinetti G. Plata-Salaman C. Rogers J.

Microglia are phagocytes of myeloid origin and represent the principal immune effector cells in the brain. It has recently been appreciated that “resting” or “quiescent” microglia are highly dynamic and constantly extend their processes to survey their microenvironment presumably allowing them to react quickly to local injury or invading pathogens (13Davalos D.

Science. 2005; 308: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (3867) Google Scholar). Phenotypically activated microglia are found clustered adjacent to Aβ plaques (15Perlmutter L.S. Barron E. Chui H.C.

Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R.

Tech. 2001; 54: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the sustained microglial proinflammatory response results in the production of ROS that are ultimately responsible for the oxidative damage observed in both the AD brain and animal models of the disease. We have described previously a multireceptor cell surface complex for fAβ on microglia consisting of CD36, α6β1 integrin, CD47, and the class A scavenger receptor (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Engagement of this receptor complex initiates tyrosine kinase-based signaling cascades (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J.

Furthermore, our recent findings provided evidence that in vitro microglia are capable of mounting a phagocytic response to fAβ through engagement of the aforementioned ensemble of cell surface receptors (25Koenigsknecht J. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9838-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Although recent findings have provided valuable insights into the role microglia play in the proinflammatory events observed in AD, the intracellular signaling molecules responsible for the initiation of these responses remain to be elucidated. Specifically, it is unknown how the fAβ receptor complex is linked to the small GTPase Rac1, which is a critical element in signaling to both the NADPH oxidase (26Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar, 27Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the phagocytic machinery (28Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). One candidate molecule that could potentially link the fAβ cell surface receptor complex to downstream signaling events is the proto-oncogene Vav. Vav is one of the most well characterized guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rac1. We report that Vav phosphorylation is mediated through the fAβ cell surface receptor complex, and our studies further demonstrate that Vav is an essential component of the fAβ-stimulated intracellular signaling pathway that leads to NADPH oxidase activation and ROS production. We also report a critical role for Vav in the initiation of a phagocytic response to Aβ peptides. Materials—Aβ peptides corresponding to the human Aβ amino acids 25–35 and 1–42 were purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). The method used to fibrillarize Aβ peptides has been well characterized (30Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 31Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ peptides were fibrillized by reconstitution in sterile distilled water followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 week. The initial peptide concentration reflects that of the monomeric peptides comprising the Aβ fibrils. The composition of the fibrillar solutions may include Aβ oligomers as well as fibrils. The 4N1K and RHD peptides were purchased from Bachem (Philadelphia) and reconstituted in sterile distilled water. Fucoidan was purchased from Sigma and reconstituted in sterile distilled water. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-CD36 peptide was a gift from Dr. Maria Febbraio (The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). Invasin 195 was a gift from Dr. Ingo Autenrieth (University of Tubingen, Germany). PAK-PBD beads were purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). The anti-Rac and the anti-phospho-Tyr antibody 4G10 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Waltham, MA). The anti-Vav, -Syk, and -Lyn antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Piceatannol was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Nile red fluorospheres (1 μm microspheres) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Tissue Culture—Human THP-1 monocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 5 × 10–5m 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm HEPES, and 15 μg/ml gentamycin in 5% CO2. THP-1 monocytes are used in these assays as they grow in suspension and do not attach to the tissue culture substrate through integrin-based adhesive mechanisms, allowing dissection of Aβ fibril-dependent signaling mechanisms in the absence of high basal levels of tyrosine kinase-based integrin signaling. Responses of THP-1 monocytes to fAβ faithfully replicate the responses of primary microglia (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J.

Primary microglia were derived from postnatal day 1–3 mouse brains as described previously (18Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Combs C.K. Karlo J.C. Kao S.C. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Combs C.K. Johnson D.E.

Cell Stimulation and Immunoprecipitations—THP-1 monocytes were collected and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated with fAβ-(25–35) or fAβ-(1–42) peptides for 3 min at 37 °C. For analysis of the elements of the fAβ receptor, cells were incubated with fucoidan, 4N1K, GST-CD36, invasin 195, or RHD peptide for 30 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with Aβ peptides. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the cellular lysates (500 μg/ml) were added to protein A-agarose (30 μl) with the anti-Vav, -Lyn, or -Syk primary antibodies (2 μg of primary antibody/mg of lysate) and incubated with rocking for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times in Triton buffer; sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved on 9 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and Western-blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with either anti-phospho-Tyr (1:1000), -Vav (1:1000), -Syk (1:1000), or -Lyn (1:1000) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Blots were stripped and reprobed with the appropriate primary antibody as a loading control. Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software (Bethesda, MD). All experiments were performed a minimum of three times. Values statistically different from controls were calculated using a one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was used to determine p values. Rac Activation Assay—THP-1 cell lysates were subjected to affinity precipitation using the specific interaction of the Rac GTPase with its downstream effector, the PBD of PAK (36Li S. Yamauchi A. Marchal C.C. Molitoris J.K. Quilliam L.A. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5043-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The PBD-PAK is bound to glutathione-agarose beads and was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Following stimulation with fAβ-(25–35) (60 μm/63.6 μg/ml), cells were collected and lysed with Mg2+ lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Igepal (Nonidet P-40), 5% sucrose). PBD-PAK beads were added to 1 mg/ml cell lysate and incubated with rocking for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis using an anti-Rac antibody (1:1000). Aliquots of the cell lysates (40 μg/lane) were run as protein loading controls. The protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, and band intensities were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 software (Bethesda, MD). Values statistically different from controls were calculated using a one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was used to determine p values. Cellular Fractionation—For these experiments we utilized a cell fractionation protocol described previously (37Cordle A. Koenigsknecht-Talboo J. Wilkinson B. Limpert A. Landreth G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34202-34209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells (6 × 106 cells) were collected and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then stimulated for 0 or 10 min with fAβ-(25–35) (60 μm) and lysed by incubation in relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3) on ice for 15 min followed by 10 s of sonication. Cells were cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 1 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter SW50.1 rotor. The resulting supernatant was removed and saved as the “cytosolic” fraction, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in relaxation buffer. Lysates were then subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE immunoblot analysis using an anti-Rac antibody (1:1000) to determine the relative amount of Rac in each fraction. The membrane marker flotillin (1:1000) was used to assess the efficacy of the fractionation procedure. These experiments were performed four times (n = 4), and the data were analyzed by Student's t test with a confidence interval of 99%. Measurement of Superoxide Production—Intracellular superoxide radical generation was assayed by analyzing nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction (19McDonald D.R. Brunden K.R. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pick E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Superoxide generation is determined at the microscopic level by the presence of an insoluble formazan precipitant, which appear as dark purple/black granules within the cell (39Qin B. Cartier L. Dubois-Dauphin M. Li B. Serrander L. Krause K.H. Neurobiol. Aging,. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). For these experiments primary microglial cells from either Vav–/– mice or Vav+/+ mice (SV129) were harvested as described previously. The Vav–/– mice (40Turner M. Mee P.J. Walters A.E. Quinn M.E. Mellor A.L. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. Juan Rivera (NIAMS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda) and Dr. Victor Tybulewicz (National Institute for Medical Research, London, UK). Microglia were plated in 24-well plates overnight in DMEM/F-12 without serum. The following day, the media were removed and replaced with NBT (1 mg/ml) in DMEM/F-12 with or without fAβ-(25–35) (60 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 390 nm)) was used as a positive control for the stimulation of ROS production (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19McDonald D.R. Brunden K.R. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bianca V.D. Dusi S. Bianchini E. Dal Pra I. Rossi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15493-15499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. Three random fields of cells (>100 cells) were counted by a blind observer on an inverted microscope. The assay was performed in triplicate. Values statistically different from controls were calculated using a one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was used to determine p values. Phagocytosis Assay—The phagocytosis assay was performed as described previously (25Koenigsknecht J. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9838-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 41Koenigsknecht-Talboo J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8240-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary murine microglia cells were collected and plated into 24-well plates overnight in DMEM/F-12 without serum. The cells were then stimulated by the addition of 60 μm fAβ-(25–35) for 30 min. Nile red fluorospheres (1 μm microspheres) were added to the cells for 30 min. The uptake of fluorescent microspheres was used as a marker of fluid phase phagocytosis. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and three random fields of cells (>100 cells) were counted on an inverted microscope. The assay was performed in triplicate. Values statistically different from controls were calculated using a one-way ANOVA, and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was used to determine p values. Stimulation of Vav-Tyr Phosphorylation in THP-1 Monocytes by Fibrillar Aβ Peptides—Vav can act as a Rac-specific GEF upon its phosphorylation by Src family tyrosine kinases. We tested whether fAβ engagement of the microglia led to Vav tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we report the Tyr phosphorylation of the Vav protein following fAβ stimulation with either fibrillar Aβ-(1–42) or Aβ-(25–35) peptides (Fig. 1A). fAβ treatment resulted in the transient phosphorylation of Vav, which was maximal after 5 min (Fig. 1, B and C). These findings are consistent with our previous findings that demonstrated that fAβ peptides, Aβ-(1–40), Aβ-(1–42), and Aβ-(25–35), stimulate tyrosine kinase-based signaling in both THP-1 monocytes and microglia (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Combs C.K. Johnson D.E. Cannady S.B. Lehman T.M. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 928-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19McDonald D.R. Brunden K.R. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2284-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McDonald D.R. Bamberger M.E. Combs C.K. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings confirmed that the magnitude of stimulation between these different Aβ peptides was qualitatively similar, and at this concentration (60 μm) the fibrillar Aβ-(25–35) peptide most effectively drives intracellular signaling (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21McDonald D.R. Bamberger M.E. Combs C.K. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4451-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as it contains the biologically active C-terminal β-pleated sheet domain that is necessary for fibril formation (42Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7434-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Engagement of the Microglial Fibrillar Aβ Cell Surface Receptor Complex Is Required for Vav Phosphorylation—We have recently shown that microglia employ a multireceptor cell surface complex to detect and respond to Aβ fibrils. These receptor elements act in concert to stimulate intracellular signaling cascades as well as initiate a novel type of phagocytosis in microglia (17Bamberger M.E. Harris M.E. McDonald D.R. Husemann J. Landreth G.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Koenigsknecht J. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9838-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have shown that perturbation of the interaction of fAβ with individual subunits abrogates the signaling and phagocytic response from the complex as a whole. To determine whether fAβ engagement of this receptor ensemble was responsible for the observed Vav tyrosine phosphorylation, we tested the effect of antagonists to each of the individual receptor subunits. The participation of the class A and B scavenger receptors was assessed using fucoidan, which is an antagonist of these receptors (43Husemann J. Loike J.D. Anankov R. Febbraio M. Silverstein S.C. Glia. 2002; 40: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The role of the class B scavenger CD36 was directly assessed using GST-CD36, which is composed of the 93–120-amino acid extracellular binding domain of CD36 coupled with a GST tag. This fusion protein is designed to competitively inhibit the binding of ligands to cell surface CD36 (44Frieda S. Pearce A. Wu J. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2981-2986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We found that fucoidan and GST-CD36 both inhibited Vav phosphorylation in response to fAβ stimulation in THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 2, A and B). To evaluate the contribution of the α6β1 integrin, we employed two different antagonists specifically directed toward the β1 integrin. First, the RHD peptide, which contains an epitope that binds to β1 integrins (45Ghiso J. Rostagno A. Gardella J.E. Liem L. Gorevic P.D. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), dramatically reduced Vav phosphorylation in response to fAβ (Fig. 2C). The second β1 integrin antagonist was derived from invasin protein (invasin 195), which is encoded by the enteropathogenic Yersinia (46Isberg R.R. Hamburger Z. Dersch P. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and acts to functionally block β1 integrin activation (47McGee K. Holmfeldt P. Fallman M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We demonstrate th"
https://openalex.org/W2087149948,"Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) is involved in the transformation of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine in benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis of plants. In this report, we describe the high level expression of BBE encoded by the gene from Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris employing the secretory pathway of the host organism. Using a two-step chromatographic purification protocol, 120 mg of BBE could be obtained from 1 liter of fermentation culture. The purified protein exhibits a turnover number for substrate conversion of 8.2 s-1. The recombinant enzyme is glycosylated and carries a covalently attached FAD cofactor. In addition to the previously known covalent attachment of the 8α-position of the flavin ring system to a histidine (His-104), we could also demonstrate that a covalent linkage between the 6-position and a thiol group of a cysteine residue (Cys-166) is present in BBE. The major evidence for the occurrence of a bi-covalently attached FAD cofactor is provided by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis of the isolated flavin-containing peptide. Furthermore, it could be shown that anaerobic photoirradiation leads to cleavage of the linkage between the 6-cysteinyl group yielding 6-mercaptoflavin and a peptide with the cysteine residue replaced by alanine due to breakage of the C-S bond. Overall, BBE is shown to exhibit typical flavoprotein oxidase properties as exemplified by the occurrence of an anionic flavin semiquinone species and formation of a flavin N(5)-sulfite adduct. Berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) is involved in the transformation of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine in benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis of plants. In this report, we describe the high level expression of BBE encoded by the gene from Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris employing the secretory pathway of the host organism. Using a two-step chromatographic purification protocol, 120 mg of BBE could be obtained from 1 liter of fermentation culture. The purified protein exhibits a turnover number for substrate conversion of 8.2 s-1. The recombinant enzyme is glycosylated and carries a covalently attached FAD cofactor.

Overall, BBE is shown to exhibit typical flavoprotein oxidase properties as exemplified by the occurrence of an anionic flavin semiquinone species and formation of a flavin N(5)-sulfite adduct. Many alkaloids possess potentially useful pharmaceutical properties, which have been exploited in traditional medicine for centuries. Among these, benzophenanthridines have an antimicrobial activity that prompted the elucidation of its biosynthesis in plants, most notably the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), a plant used by American Indians as a traditional medicine (1Cheney R.H. Q. J. Crude Drug Res. 1964; 3: 413-416Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of these alkaloids leads from the aromatic amino acid l-tyrosine to a central metabolite, (S)-reticuline, a compound that yields isoquinolines of diverse structure, such as protopine, sanguinarine, and berberine, in a series of enzyme-catalyzed transformations (2). Initially, (S)-reticuline is converted to (S)-scoulerine by berberine bridge enzyme (BBE). 2The abbreviations used are: BBE, berberine bridge enzyme ((S)-reticuline: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.21.3.3); ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; GOOX, glucooligosaccharide oxidase; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; CAPS, 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Endo Hf, endoglycosidase Hf. This FAD-dependent oxidase affords the transformation of the N-methyl group of (S)-reticuline into the berberine bridge carbon (C-8) of (S)-scoulerine, shown in Scheme 1. The transformation involves the oxidation of the N-methyl group to the methylene iminium ion with subsequent cyclization to the protoberberine carbon skeleton (3Barton D.H.R. Hesse R.H. Kirby G.W. Proc. Chem. Soc. (London). 1963; 1: 267-268Google Scholar, 4Battersby A.R. Francis R.J. Hirst M. Staunton J. Proc. Chem. Soc. (London). 1963; 268Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the substrate-derived electrons are passed on to the covalently attached FAD cofactor either in two one-electron steps or in a single two-electron reduction step, e.g. via transfer of a hydride (5Kutchan T.M. Dittrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24475-24481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reduced cofactor is then regenerated by oxidation with dioxygen to yield oxidized FAD and hydrogen peroxide (see reaction scheme (Scheme 1)). The structural requirements for formation of the berberine bridge are (i) (S)-configuration at C-1 in the N-methyltetrahydrobenzylisoquinoline ring system and (ii) hydroxylation of the carbon ortho- to the 2′-carbon of the benzyl moiety (5). This latter requirement was interpreted as evidence for the involvement of an active site base, which deprotonates the hydroxyl group to facilitate nucleophilic attack of the C-2′ on the methylene iminium ion to generate the carbon-carbon bond (5). BBE was first isolated by Zenk and collaborators (6Steffens P. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 2577-2583Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) from plant cell cultures producing only minute amounts of a homogenous protein with a molecular mass of 52 ± 4 kDa in a tedious eight-step purification procedure. The cloning of the gene encoding BBE from the California poppy (E. californica) paved the way for the heterologous expression of the enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Spodoptera frugiperda (7Dittrich H. Kutchan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9969-9973Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Kutchan T.M. Dittrich H. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The latter expression system produced ∼4 mg of active enzyme per liter of insect cell culture, allowing some basic characterization of its substrate specificity and spectroscopic properties (5Kutchan T.M. Dittrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24475-24481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the level of protein expression achieved in this system is clearly not sufficient to warrant a detailed investigation of the biochemical, kinetic, and structural properties of the enzyme. The difficulties of achieving high expression of BBE are highlighted by the fact that the gene possesses an N-terminal signal peptide as well as a vacuolar sorting determinant (7Dittrich H. Kutchan T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9969-9973Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 9Bird D.A. Facchini P.J. Planta. 2001; 213: 888-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, active enzyme requires covalently bound FAD and is N-glycosylated. Here, we report the construction of a new expression system for BBE in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris by using the secretory pathway of this organism. This approach yields large amounts of highly active BBE enabling us to study some basic properties of the enzyme. In the course of this characterization, we could demonstrate that the enzyme contains an FAD cofactor, which is covalently linked to a histidine (His-104) and a cysteine (Cys-166) residue, as recently reported for glucooligosaccharide oxidase from Acremonium strictum (10Lee M.-H.

Tsai Y.-C. Liaw S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38831-38838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reagents—All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available and purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka, or Merck. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Fermentas, Endo Hf from New England Biolabs, and phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF (high substitution) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. (S)-Reticuline and (S)-scoulerine were from the natural product collection of the Department of Natural Product Biotechnology of the Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Halle/Saale, Germany. Cloning of E. californica BBE—The coding sequence of BBE from E. californica cloned into pUC18 was used for PCR reactions (7). Two different constructs were generated using PCR with especially designed forward primers in combination with a common reverse primer and pUC18 BBE as template. BBE (forward (5′), AAAGTCGACAAAATGGAAAACAAAACT) and BBE-ER (5′, ACCTCGAGAAAAGAGAGGCTGAAGCTGGTAATGATCTCCTTTCTTGTTTG; shared reverse (3′), CATGCGGCCGCCTATATTACAACTTCTCCACCATC) represent a construct with the native BBE coding sequence and one where the native endoplasmic reticulum-targeting signal sequence was deleted. Both constructs were cloned into pCR® 4Blunt-TOPO® vectors (Invitrogen), and amplification of the correct variant was verified by sequence analysis. For expression analysis in P. pastoris the constructs were cloned into the expression vectors pPICZ B and pPICZα B using EcoRI (present on the vector)/NotI and XhoI/NotI for BBE and BBE-ER, respectively. Transformation into P. pastoris KM71H was carried out as outlined in the EasySelect™ Pichia Expression Kit (Invitrogen) following the protocol for lithium chloride transformation with 5 μg of SacI-linearized DNA. The presence of the expression cassette in the genome of P. pastoris was verified by colony PCR as described in a previous study (12Weis R. Luiten R. Skranc W. Schwab H. Wubbolts M. Glieder A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 5: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of BBE—For comparison of expression by the two constructs, single transformants with an integrated BBE coding sequence were used to inoculate 25 ml of buffered minimal dextrose medium in 100-ml shake flasks. Generation of biomass and induction with methanol was carried out essentially as described previously (12Weis R. Luiten R. Skranc W. Schwab H. Wubbolts M. Glieder A. FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 5: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After a 100-h induction period, the fermentation supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and activity assays for expression of BBE were carried out. Large scale expression of BBE for protein purification was carried out in a BBI CT5-2 fermenter (Sartorius) with a digital control unit using the MFCSwin process control system. Cultivation was conducted with a glycerol batch phase followed by a glycerol-fed batch and after generation of enough biomass protein production was initiated by addition of methanol. The different stages followed the basic outline presented in Pichia Fermentation Process Guidelines (Invitrogen). After 90-h methanol induction, the fermentation was stopped and the cells were separated from the medium by centrifugation. For purification of BBE, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5. After an additional centrifugation step, the resulting solution was then loaded onto a XK50/20 phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF (high substitution) column with a 200-ml bed volume equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m ammonium sulfate (buffer A). After complete loading and washing with buffer A, BBE was step-eluted by a 80%/20% mixture of 20% ethanol/buffer A. BBE-containing fractions (as determined by activity assays) were pooled and concentrated up to 30 mg/ml using the Centriprep system from Amicon (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa). Aliquots of 2 ml from the resulting deeply yellow solution were then loaded onto a HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ 75 prep grade (Amersham Biosciences) gel-filtration column equilibrated with the storage buffer of BBE (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of sufficient purity and BBE concentration (analyzed by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and again concentrated by ultrafiltration as described above. Aliquots of ∼40 μl were stored at -80 °C. Activity Assay—Expression of BBE during fermentation and fractions containing the enzyme during purification were followed by conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine. Reaction mixtures consisted of 1 μl of sample, 1 μl of 10 mm (S)-reticuline in methanol and 3 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 9.0) and were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. For visualization of conversion the reaction mixtures were separated on tlc using CH2Cl2/MeOH/25% NH4OH (90/9/1) as the mobile phase and authentic standards for substrate and product as reference. BBE turnover rates were determined by following conversion of (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine by HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture. A 100-μl assay consisted of 98.5 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 9.0), 1 μl of 10 mm (S)-reticuline in methanol, and 0.5 μl of BBE (200 nm) resulting in a final substrate concentration of 100 μm, which is ∼30 times the reported Km value for (S)-reticuline (7). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots of 1 μl were removed at various time points and loaded onto an Atlantis® dC18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Waters). Substrate and product were separated during an isocratic elution at 67% MeOH/33% 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 8 min. SDS-PAGE—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) under reducing conditions as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue R or PAS stain to visualize N-glycosylation. PAS Staining—After fixing the SDS gel in 50% MeOH for half an hour, it was washed with ddH2O twice. Oxidation was carried out by immersing the gel in 1% w/v periodic acid in 3% v/v acetic acid for 30 min. After two washing steps with ddH2O, it was stained using Schiff's reagent (Sigma) for 1 h followed by reduction with 0.5% w/v sodium metabisulfite for 1 h. After additional washing steps with water the gel was stored in 5% acetic acid. Deglycosylation—20 μl of BBE (1 mg/ml) was denatured by addition of 2.2 μl of 10× denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and heating to 95 °C for 10 min. After cooling to 37 °C 2.5 μl of 10× reaction buffer (500 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5) was added, and deglycosylation was initiated by adding 1 μl of Endo Hf (1000 New England Biolabs units). After overnight incubation in the dark at 37 °C the reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R or PAS stain. Coomassie-stained bands were excised and used for in-gel digestion and subsequent MALDI-TOF MS analysis to identify N-glycosylated residues of BBE. Protease Digestion of BBE and Isolation of the Flavin-linked Peptide by HPLC— 0.5 mg of purified BBE was denatured in the presence of 4 m urea, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 75 mm NaCl, pH 8.5, for 45 min at 65 °C. The denatured sample was then diluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, to 2 m urea and cooled to 37 °C prior to addition of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at a protease:protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The digest was then performed at 37 °C for 4 h in the dark. 100 μg of the digested sample was applied to an analytical C18 column (BioSuite™ C18 PA-B, 300 Å, 3.5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Waters) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a gradient from 100% A (water 0.1% v/v formic acid)/0% B (acetonitrile 0.1% formic acid) to 30% A/70% B in 1 min, then kept constant for 5 min, followed by an increase to 45% A/55% B over 30 min and finally to 100% B in 4 min. The flavin-containing peptide was detected by its characteristic absorption at 440 nm, and the corresponding peak was collected, vacuum-dried, and redissolved in 50 μl of 50% A/50% B for subsequent N-terminal sequencing and MS analysis. UV-visible Spectroscopy and Fluorescence—Absorption spectra were recorded with a Specord 205 spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena) at 25 °C using 1-cm quartz cuvettes. Fluorescence measurements with suitable quartz cuvettes were carried out with a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC using excitation and emission slits of 20 nm and an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. MALDI-TOF MS—A MALDI Micro MX (Waters) time-of-flight instrument was used in reflectron mode with 2.3-m effective flight path for analysis of the proteolytic fragments generated from BBE. In-gel digestion with trypsin was carried out as described previously (14Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), including the prewashing steps for Coomassie-stained gels using sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) for overnight digestion. The peptide extracts were then dissolved in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and prior to analysis 1 μl of the sample was mixed with an equivalent amount of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (10 mg in 495 μl of ethanol, 495 μl of acetonitrile, and 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). 1 μl of this mixture was deposited on the stainless steel target plate, and the sample mix was allowed to air dry at ambient temperature. Samples were finally rinsed with 4 μl of ice-cold 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid by pipetting up and down after the analyte solution had dried completely. Anaerobic Photoreduction—Photoreduction of BBE was carried out according to the procedure reported in a previous study (15Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, special quartz cuvettes were rendered anaerobic by alternating cycles of evacuation and flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. EDTA and 5-deazariboflavin were stored in the side arm during this process and illuminated for 5 min prior to mixing with the enzyme solution (final concentrations of 1 mm and 1 μm, respectively). Photoirradiation was then carried out with a conventional slide projector and cooling of the cuvette at 15 °C. Spectra monitoring the progress of reduction were recorded at the same temperature. Protein Quantification and Calculation of the Extinction Coefficient—Protein concentration of purified BBE was determined by the characteristic absorption of bound FAD. The extinction coefficient was calculated using the value of 6-S-cysteinyl FMN for denatured BBE (16Kasprzak A. Papas E.J. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This leads to an ϵ445 of 11,600 m-1 cm-1 for native heterologously expressed BBE. Comparative Modeling—The amino acid sequence of BBE was submitted to the Robetta server (17Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Bradley P. Robertson T. Murphy P. Strauss C.E. Bonneau R. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Proteins Suppl. 2003; 6: 524-533Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and a model was generated using glucooligosaccharide oxidase from A. strictum as a template (pdb code: 2AXR). The two proteins share a sequence identity of 21%. The FAD cofactor of the oxidase was combined with the newly generated model of BBE, and the supposed covalent linkages with the protein backbone were introduced using the program SYBYL v7.1 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). A rough geometry optimization to remove unfavorable contacts between the cofactor and the surrounding amino acids was performed with the same program. N-terminal Sequencing Analysis—Purified BBE was electrophoresed using SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11, 10% methanol) in a tank transfer system. The transfer was performed at a constant current of 150 mA for 1 h with ice cooling. After transfer, protein was stained with Ponceau-S (0.5% Ponceau-S red, 1% acetic acid) for 1 min, and the band corresponding to BBE was excised. After destaining with ddH2O, the membrane was air-dried and subsequently analyzed by N-terminal sequencing on a 494-HT Procise Edman sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). The same facility was used to sequence the flavin-containing peptide by direct injection of the solution obtained after HPLC purification. ESI Mass Spectrometry—High resolution MS spectra of the HPLC-purified peptide were recorded on a Finnigan LTQ FT instrument (Thermo Electron) in positive-ion ESI mode. Cultures of P. pastoris cells carrying the BBE gene from the California poppy E. californica express and secrete large quantities of the protein upon induction with methanol (Fig. 1A). BBE is the dominant protein in the growth medium with expression reaching a maximum after ∼85 h (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Activity of the expressed protein could be demonstrated by incubation of the substrate (S)-reticuline with growth medium and detection of product ((S)-scoulerine) by tlc as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Semiquantitative analysis of activity indicated a higher expression level of BBE from the construct with the α-factor replacing the native endoplasmic reticulum secretion signal sequence. Therefore, this system was used for the large scale expression of BBE, and all further experiments were carried out with this enzyme. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that P. pastoris also recognizes the native secretion signal of BBE from E. californica and secretes active enzyme into the fermentation broth (results not shown). BBE can be purified in a convenient and rapid two-step purification procedure leading to a homogenous, and intensely yellow, protein preparation with an estimated molecular mass of ∼62 kDa (Fig. 1B). Without any optimization, the P. pastoris expression system produces ∼120 mg of purified BBE per liter of culture medium and hence ∼30-fold as much as previously achieved in insect cell culture (8). Activity of BBE was monitored by incubation of the enzyme with (S)-reticuline and time-dependent HPLC analysis of the conversion of the substrate to (S)-scoulerine, as shown in Fig. 2. The initial velocity of the reaction allowed estimating a turnover rate of 8.2 s-1, which is in the same range as determined for the enzyme expressed in insect cell culture (=6.8 s-1 (8Kutchan T.M. Dittrich H. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). To ensure secretion of the protein, BBE is initially expressed as an N-terminal fusion protein with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor prepro signal sequence, including an EAEA spacer (Ste13 cleavage site), which can help to recognize the Kex2 site at the end of the signal sequence efficiently during processing in the secretory pathway of the host cells (18Zsebo K.M. Lu H.S. Fieschko J.C. Goldstein L. Davis J. Duker K. Suggs S.V. Lai P.H. Bitter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5858-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of purified protein showed that the Kex2 cleavage site was recognized and cleaved efficiently but not the Ste13 site, resulting in isolated BBE having four additional amino acids at the N-terminal end and starting with the sequence EAEAGNDLL. Based on the integrated full-length cDNA of BBE, the total length of the protein comprises 519 (including the 4 extra amino acids EAEA) amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 58,599 Da (including the covalently attached FAD cofactor). This expected mass is clearly lower than the estimated mass suggested by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A and B). The higher than expected molecular mass of expressed BBE can be explained by assuming a post-translational modification of the protein such as glycosylation. The amino acid sequence of BBE possesses three potential N-glycosylation sites, one at the N terminus (N38) and two at the C terminus (Asn-423 and Asn-471) (7). As shown in Fig. 3, treatment of BBE with Endo Hf leads to cleavage of glycosylation leaving only an N-acetylglucosamine attached to the asparagine residues and reducing the molecular mass of the protein by ∼4 kDa (as visualized by SDS-PAGE). To identify the sites of glycosylation, both recombinantly expressed and Endo Hf-treated BBE were subjected to trypsinolysis and subsequent peptide mapping by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A compilation of resulting peptide masses is shown in Table 1. The peptides identified by their expected masses gave rise to a sequence coverage of 78.4%, clearly identifying the expressed and purified protein as BBE. Fragments containing Asn-423 and Asn-471 could be identified without any modification after in-gel digestion of untreated BBE, thus indicating that these consensus sequences are not used for N-glycosylation. The peptide fragment containing Asn-38 was found in the tryptic digest of endoglycosidase-treated BBE with an additional 203.1 Da resulting from the remaining N-acetylglucosamine attached to the asparagine. Interestingly, the fragment harboring Asn-471 could also be identified with the same modification after Endo Hf treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded that N-glycosylation occurs at Asn-38, partially at Asn-471 but not at Asn-423.TABLE 1MALDI-TOF MS analysis of fragments obtained from trypsin digestion of BBE and Endo Hf-treated BBEExperimental mi massCalculated mi massStartEndSequence% of total sequenceDa%1965.901965.93(-4)37EAEAaNew N terminus due to incomplete processing of the α-factor signal peptide (EAEA) followed by the native sequence of the processed protein (GNDLL...).

https://openalex.org/W2041071598,"A multichaperone nucleosome-remodeling complex that contains the H1 linker histone chaperone nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP) has recently been described. Linker histones (H1) are required for the proper completion of normal development, and NASP transports H1 histones into nuclei and exchanges H1 histones with DNA. Consequently, we investigated whether NASP is required for normal cell cycle progression and development. We now report that without sufficient NASP, HeLa cells and U2OS cells are unable to replicate their DNA and progress through the cell cycle and that the NASP-/- null mutation causes embryonic lethality. Although the null mutation NASP-/- caused embryonic lethality, null embryos survive until the blastocyst stage, which may be explained by the presence of stored NASP protein in the cytoplasm of oocytes. We conclude from this study that NASP and therefore the linker histones are key players in the assembly of chromatin after DNA replication.

We conclude from this study that NASP and therefore the linker histones are key players in the assembly of chromatin after DNA replication. Chromatin is a nucleoprotein complex containing repeating nucleosome units that allow the chromatin to be folded into higher-ordered structures and orchestrate numerous interactions through their histone tails. Nucleosomes typically are separated by short pieces of DNA that link the nucleosomes to one another, bind H1 linker histones, and maintain nucleosome spacing that is critical for normal development (1Becker P.B.

DNA-binding proteins that regulate replication and repair of the genome must successfully interact with chromatin during each cell cycle. Consequently, the nucleosome-remodeling protein machinery and the DNA replication machinery coordinate their activities to ensure a faithful transition of chromatin from one cell cycle to the next (4Sancar A.

This complex is thought to coordinate the deposition of H3.1-H4 histones into new nucleosomes and signal the replication complex via phosphorylation events through various checkpoints that DNA replication (S phase) can proceed.

NASP has also been found to be a binding partner of Ku70/Ku80 and DNA-PK in HeLa cells (13Alekseev O.M. Richardson R.T. Pope M. O'Rand M.G. Proteins. 2005; 61: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), indicating that NASP may play an additional role in DNA repair events. Previous studies demonstrated that NASP expression is regulated during the cell cycle (14Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.-X. Whitfield M Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol.

To address the role of NASP in cell proliferation and normal development, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of NASP in HeLa and U2OS cells and inactivated the NASP gene by homologous recombination (NASP-/-) in mice. We now report that without sufficient NASP, HeLa cells and U2OS cells are unable to replicate their DNA and progress through the cell cycle and that the NASP-/- null mutation causes embryonic lethality. Interestingly, because NASP is expressed in the oocyte and NASP protein is present in the cytoplasm of the one-cell embryo, the embryos survive until the depletion of the maternally derived NASP protein. Our results imply that NASP orchestrates the supply of linker histones that are necessary for nucleosome remodeling during DNA replication or repair and support the conclusion that H1 linker histones are necessary for normal development (2Fan Y.

Materials—Miscellaneous chemicals were the highest possible molecular biology grade (Sigma). Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA sequencing was performed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill automated sequencing facility using an ABI PRISM model 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequence data were analyzed using DNAsis (Hitachi Corp., South San Francisco, CA) and Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) software. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Nucleic Acids Core Facility. Purification of plasmid and PCR DNAs was performed using their respective kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Anti-symplekin antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. Targeting Vector—The mouse NASP arms of homology inserted into the pOSdupdel targeting vector were generated by PCR using mouse genomic DNA (strain 129 Sv/Ev) as template. PCRs were performed with Takara LA TaqDNA polymerase (Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cycle conditions were as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 cycle; 20 s at 98 °C followed by 4.5 min at 68 °C, 30 cycles; 10 min at 72 °C, 1 cycle. The 7508-bp long arm was generated with NotI and PacI restriction sites (5′ and 3′, respectively), and the 1805-bp short arm had BbsI and PmlI restriction sites (5′ and 3′, respectively). Both the vector and inserts were sequentially digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and purified, and the inserts were ligated into the vector overnight at 4 °C using T-4 DNA ligase. A clone of the correct size was picked, tested by various restriction digests, and sequenced to confirm its validity. The DNA sequences of the PCR primers used to generate the NASP arms of homology are as follows: 1) long arm upstream primer, 5′-AGAGCGGCCGCGGCTATTCCTCAGTTGACACTCAG-3′; 2) long arm downstream primer, 5′-GCGTTAATTAAATACCTGGCTAACTCCAGAAGTGAC-3′;3) short arm upstream primer, 5′-GCGCACGTGATGTTAACTTCTGTCGCTGTGGAGG-3′; and 4) long arm downstream primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCTAAGAATCCTCCAGCTTTCCAAACAGCCAC-3′. Homologous recombination with this targeting construct deletes 9682 bp from the NASP gene, which includes exons 6-11 (see Fig. 4). This deletion includes exon 7, which is expressed only in the adult testis and in all embryonic tissues during development (14Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.-X.

O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 1238-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Targeting—The targeting plasmid was linearized with NotI, and mouse ES cells (2 × 107 embryonic stem cells, strain 129 Sv/Ev) were electroporated with 25 μg of vector. After positive-negative selection with ganciclovir and G418 (17Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Deng C.X. Capecchi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 87: 7688-7692Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), surviving colonies were picked and screened using PCR with one primer from the neo gene and the other from the region just 3′ to the 3′ arm of homology. Several clones were identified, and the correctness of the targeting was verified by Southern blots. ES cells from a positive clone were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6 mice, which were implanted into pseudopregnant CD1 females. Male chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females, and the agouti coat color was used as an indicator of transmission of the 129 genome. Transmitting agouti-coated progeny were back-crossed to C57BL/6 animals to obtain progeny that were interbred to produce the experimental animals used in this study. Genotypic Analysis—Genomic DNA for PCRs was extracted from 2-mm mouse tail clips by incubation in 100 μl of 25 mm NaOH/0.2 mm EDTA for 1 h at 95°C followed by addition of 100 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl. After a brief vortexing, the samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant removed. Genomic DNA for Southern blots was isolated from 6-mm mouse tail clips by overnight incubation at 55 °C in 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS and 20 μl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml). After incubation, 200 μl of saturated NaCl was added and the mixture vortexed for 30 s followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Five hundred μl of supernatant was removed and precipitated with 100% ethanol and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min; the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged. The final air-dried DNA pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). Genotyping PCRs were performed using Takara LA Taq as described above except that 2 μl of genomic DNA (described above as DNA for PCR) was used as template, and the primers were as follows: for the wild-type allele sense and antisense, 5′-GAAGCAAGGGAAGAGTTGAGAG-3′ and 5′-TTCACTCTCAGAGGTAGC-3′, respectively; and for the targeted allele sense and antisense, 5′-GTTTCCACCCAATGTCGAGCAAAC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCAC-3′, respectively. Southern blots were performed on 10 μg of SacI- and PstI-digested DNA (described above as DNA for Southern blots) as described previously (15Richardson R.T. Bencic D.C. O'Rand M.G. Gene. 2001; 274: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) except that restriction digests contained 3 mm spermidine, and the 20 μl samples were incubated in 1 μl of 1 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 37 °C before loading onto the gel. The blots were probed with a 32P-labeled, random-primed PCR-generated cDNA that represents NASP exon 12 (see Fig. 3) and visualized using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Embryo Isolation, Blastocyst Culture, and Genotyping—NASP+/- females were superovulated by injection with 5 units of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Sigma) followed 48 h later by 5 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) and mated with NASP+/- males. Successful matings were detected by the presence of a vaginal plug. Embryos at various stages in either the uterus or oviducts were collected for histological examination or flushed as blastocysts from the uterus. Flushed blastocysts were washed two times in medium M16 (Sigma) and then cultured in 96-well plates precoated with 1% gelatin in Glasgow's minimal essential medium (Fisher) with 15% fetal bovine serum and leukemia inhibiting factor (0.2 units/ml) for up to 10 days. To isolate DNA for PCR template, individual blastocyst cultures were suspended by pipetting and incubating them in 20 μl of 25 mm NaOH/0.2 mm EDTA for 1 h at 95 °C followed by addition of 100 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl. After a brief vortexing, the samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. Immunohistochemistry—Embryos were fixed in situ in excised oviduct and uterine tissue by immersion in Bouin's fixative for 1-4 days, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned (8μm). Every fifth section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin to locate the embryos, and adjacent serial sections were stained with anti-NASP antibody (14Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) or with a NASP probe for in situ hybridization. In Situ Hybridization—A high affinity NASP antisense hybridization probe was designed using Oligo Analysis software, version 6.65 (Cascade, CO). The 5′-digoxigenen-labeled probe, 5′-CGGCGATGGCAGCAG-3′ (where boldface and underlined letters indicate locked nucleic acids), was prepared by Proligo Primers & Probes (Boulder, CO), and an identical unlabeled probe was prepared as a control to demonstrate the specificity of the probe when used in 100× excess. In situ hybridization was performed in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Laboratories for Reproductive Biology Immunohistochemistry Core Facility based on methods described by Schwarzacher and Heslop-Harrison (18Schwarzacher T. Heslop-Harrison P. Practical in situ Hybridization, Springer-Verlag, New York2000: 126-145Google Scholar). Analysis of the NASP Transcript—Testes were collected from NASP+/+ and NASP+/- mice, and after disruption in a Dounce homogenizer, total and poly(A)+ RNA were prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit and an Oligotex mRNA Kit, respectively (Qiagen). Equal quantities of mRNA were electrophoresed and Northern blotted as described previously (14Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.-X. Whitfield M Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After hybridization with a 32P-labeled, randomprimed NASP exon 12 probe, the blots were visualized as above with the PhosphorImager. siRNA Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained as described (12Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8846-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A series of siRNAs targeting the human NASP open reading frame were designed (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), and one (GCACAGUUCAGCAAAUCUAdTdT) was found to effectively deplete NASP from HeLa cells. Transfection with C2 siRNA, which had no cellular target, served as a negative control (19Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (8.5-10 × 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate) were transfected with NASP and C2 siRNAs using a two-hit siRNA transfection method with Lipofectamine™ 2000 for 18 h as described (19Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after the first transfection, cells were trypsinized and split into 6-well plates. Forty-eight h after the first transfection, cells were retransfected. Ninety h after the initial transfection, cells were harvested for Western blot analysis. For rescue experiments, cells were transfected with tNASP as described previously (12Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8846-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) 72 h after siRNA transfection. Control cells were transfected with the transfection reagent (Effectene transfection reagent, Qiagen). siRNA transfection of U2OS cells was performed identically to that described above for HeLa cells. Anti-SLBP antibodies were used as described previously (20Wagner E.J. Berkow A. Marzluff W.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BrdUrd Cell Proliferation Assay—The BrdUrd Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Calbiochem) was used to measure BrdUrd incorporation. HeLa cells were trypsinized 90 h after the first transfection. Equal numbers of cells were placed in a propylene round-bottom tube and suspended in growth medium with 10 μm BrdUrd (37 °C, 5% CO2, 2 h) with regular shaking to prevent cells from anchoring. BrdUrd-containing medium was then removed by centrifugation, and the cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in growth medium, and plated in a 96-well plate for overnight attachment. Plates were processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. An average reading was determined by measuring five independent wells. Significance was determined by the Student's t test. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Control and transfected cells were collected 90 h after the first transfection. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol for ≥2 h on ice. Cells were washed in PBS and stained overnight (4 °C) with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS (containing 200 μg/ml RNase A and 0.1% Triton X-100). Samples were analyzed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Flow Cytometry Facility. For each sample, at least 10,000 cells were counted. After gating out doublets and debris, cell cycle distribution was analyzed using Summit version 3.1 software (Cytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunostaining, cells were trypsinized and split into a cell culture slide (Falcon, Bedford, MA) at 24 h posttransfection and retransfected at 48 h (as above). Following6hin growth media, cells were incubated for 18hin20 μm BrdUrd (staining 90 h after transfection). After exposure to BrdUrd (final concentration 20 μm) slides were briefly washed in PBS and fixed in 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, rinsed twice in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum for 5 min. Cells were washed and incubated with anti-NASP antibody for 1 h, washed in PBS, and incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After a wash in PBS, cells were fixed a second time in 3% formaldehyde, incubated for 1 h with 4 m HCl (7Hoek M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12183-12188Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and incubated in Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated anti-BrdUrd (1:50) antibody (Molecular Probes). NASP Is Required for Cell Proliferation—HeLa cells were transfected with NASP siRNA or a control (C2), nonspecific siRNA (20Wagner E.J. Berkow A. Marzluff W.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at 0 and 48 h. Forty-two h later (90 h after initial siRNA transfection), HeLa cells were examined for NASP protein by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, tNASP and sNASP proteins were depleted from siRNA-transfected cells, whereas control (C2)-transfected cells contained both tNASP and sNASP. To determine the effect on DNA replication, cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h with BrdUrd 90 h after initial siRNA transfection. BrdUrd incorporation into DNA in NASP siRNA-transfected cells significantly decreased (p < 0.017), whereas incorporation into control (C2)-transfected cells was not significantly different (p > 0.8) from untreated cells (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that concomitant with the loss of NASP protein 90 h after initial siRNA transfection, there is a decrease in DNA replication. With the loss of NASP protein, there was also a noticeable effect on cell proliferation, which was determined by directly counting cells. The total number of control (C2)-transfected cells increased significantly during the 90 h following initial transfection (∼6-fold; Fig. 1C), whereas the total number of NASP siRNA-transfected cells increased during the first 66 h after transfection (4-fold) and did not significantly increase thereafter from 66 to 90 h (Fig. 1C). The number of NASP siRNA-transfected cells was significantly less than the number of control (C2)-transfected cells (p < 0.01) at 90 h (Fig. 1C). Examination of the live/dead cell ratio at 24 h posttransfection indicated that <1% of the cells were dead (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the NASP siRNA treatment did not eliminate cells from the culture dish but rather held them in a nonproliferation state. The effect of a loss of NASP protein on the cell cycle was determined by FACS analysis of control (C2)- and NASP siRNA-transfected cells at 90 h following initial transfection. As shown in Fig. 1D, the number of cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle increased after NASP siRNA transfection concomitant with a decrease in the number of cells in S and G2 phases. These results indicate that a loss of NASP protein causes a delay in cell cycle progression; cells in G1 cannot progress past the G1/S border. Previously, when NASP was overexpressed in HeLa cells, a similar delay in cell cycle progression was observed (12Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8846-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Consequently, attempts to rescue the siRNA treated cells by transfecting with tNASP cDNA resulted in a large increase in tNASP protein as shown by Western blots and a modest increase in BrdUrd incorporation, but the overall effect was a continued delay in cell cycle progression and increased numbers of cells in G1 as reported previously (Ref. 12Alekseev O.M. Bencic D.C. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8846-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and data not shown). Immunolocalization of BrdUrd and NASP in the nuclei of control cells after incubation with BrdUrd for 18 h, demonstrated that all cells contained both NASP and BrdUrd in their nuclei (Fig. 2, A and B); however, 90 h after NASP siRNA transfection, immunostaining for NASP protein had decreased in many cells (Fig. 2C, arrows), and BrdUrd staining was absent in these cells (Fig. 2D). We conclude from these experiments that the loss of NASP from the nucleus coincided with the loss of BrdUrd incorporation into DNA and the completion of S phase in HeLa cells. However, because of a reservoir of NASP protein, it takes at least 3-4 days before the lack of NASP protein affects cell proliferation. Comparison of NASP and SLBP Knockdown in U2OS Cells—SLBP binds histone mRNA stem loops and is required for histone message synthesis and translation (21Marzluff W.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells synthesize SLBP just prior to entering S phase (22Whitfield M.L. Zheng L.X. Baldwin A. Ohta T. Hurt M.M. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4188-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and require SLBP for proper DNA replication (20Wagner E.J. Berkow A. Marzluff W.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When treated with SLBP, siRNA cells accumulate in S phase (20Wagner E.J. Berkow A. Marzluff W.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); thus a comparison, of NASP and SLBP siRNA treatments in the same cell type allows a clear distinction between cell cycle phases. U2OS cells were transfected with NASP siRNA, control (C2) nonspecific siRNA, or SLBP siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3A, when tNASP and sNASP proteins were depleted from siRNA-transfected U2OS cells, SLBP was not depleted. When SLBP protein was depleted from siRNA-transfected U2OS cells, tNASP and sNASP proteins were not depleted (Fig. 3A). The difference between the loss of NASP protein and the loss of SLBP protein on cell cycle progression is shown by FACS analysis in Fig. 3B. Loss of SLBP clearly causes cells to accumulate in S phase, as previously reported (20Wagner E.J. Berkow A. Marzluff W.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Zhao X. McKillop-Smith S. Muller B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6043-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas loss of NASP protein clearly causes cells to accumulate at the G1/S border. Cells without NASP accumulate SLBP (Fig. 3A); therefore, it is most likely that cells lacking NASP enter S phase but then immediately arrest. We conclude from these experiments that in both HeLa and U2OS cells, NASP is required for cell proliferation. These results are similar to the results seen when G1 cells are treated with aphidicolin or hydroxyurea; cells reach the G1/S border, and SLBP reaches maximal levels (24Whitfield M.L. Kaygun H. Erkmann J.A. Townley-Tilson W.H.D. Dominski Z. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4833-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NASP Is Required for Normal Development—If NASP (GenBank™ accession number AF349432) is required for the normal completion of the cell cycle, then it should be required for normal development. To test this possibility, the NASP gene was inactivated by homologous recombination (Fig. 4). The targeted disruption of NASP was achieved by deletion of six exons encoding amino acid residues 100-605 in the tNASP sequence and amino acid residues 74-253 in the sNASP sequence (15Richardson R.T. Bencic D.C. O'Rand M.G. Gene. 2001; 274: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), knocking out all of the histone-binding sites. Homologous recombination of the targeting vector into the NASP gene introduces a neomycin resistance cassette containing a PstI site and eliminates a SacI site (Fig. 4A). These sites were subsequently used for screening ES cell colonies and mouse tail DNA by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4B), and their genotypes were confirmed by PCR (Fig. 4C). Among 333 F2 progeny, no mice with the null mutation NASP-/- were born. NASP+/- mice appeared normal in development, gross anatomy, fertilization, and behavior and lived normally for at least 1 year. Although quantitation of NASP mRNA in homozygous NASP-/--disrupted cells was not possible because of early embryonic lethality, NASP mRNA isolated from the testes of NASP+/- mice was reduced to approximately half of the levels expressed by NASP+/+ littermates (Fig. 5). There were no truncated mRNA species expressed in the NASP+/- mice. Despite the fact that NASP mRNA"

The present study investigated whether MG, a highly reactive metabolite of glucose, induced structural and functional changes of insulin. Incubation of human insulin with MG in vitro yielded MG-insulin adducts, as evidenced by additional peaks observed on mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of the incubates. Tandem MS analysis of insulin B-chain adducts confirmed attachment of MG at an arginine residue. [3H]-2-deoxyglucose uptake by 3T3-L1 adipocytes was significantly and concentration-dependently decreased after the treatment with MG-insulin adducts, in comparison with the effect of native insulin at the same concentrations. A significant decrease of glucose uptake induced by MG-insulin adducts was also observed in L8 skeletal muscle cells. MG alone had no effect on glucose uptake or the transcriptional expression of insulin receptor. Unlike native insulin, MG-insulin adducts did not inhibit insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells. The degradation of MG-insulin through liver cells was also decreased. In conclusion, MG modifies insulin by attaching to internal arginine residue in beta-chain of insulin. The formation of this MG-insulin adduct decreases insulin-mediated glucose uptake, impairs autocrine control of insulin secretion, and decreases insulin clearance. These structural and functional abnormalities of insulin molecule may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance."

These alterations were coupled to increased Fak-Tyr397 autophosphorylation and to inhibition of Fak-Tyr925, p130CAS, and paxillin phosphorylation. An increased association of total Src with Fak and a decreased interaction of p130CAS and p85-PI3K with Fak were also observed. SrcDN inhibited cell attachment, spreading, and migration. Serum and EGF-induced stimulation of cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation were also significantly reduced by SrcDN, whereas p27Kip1 expression was increased. Consistently, silencing c-Src expression by siRNA in MCF7 cells significantly reduced cell migration, attachment, spreading and proliferation. Inoculation of MCF7 cells carrying inducible SrcDN to nude mice generated tumors. However, doxycycline administration to mice significantly reduced tumorigenesis, and when doxycycline treatment was installed after tumor development, a significant tumor regression was observed. In both situations, inhibition of tumorigenesis was associated with decreased Ki67 staining and increased apoptosis in tumors. These data undoubtedly demonstrate the relevance of the Src/Fak complex in breast cancer tumorigenesis.

These data undoubtedly demonstrate the relevance of the Src/Fak complex in breast cancer tumorigenesis. The Src family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases plays critical roles in a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways that are involved in cell division, motility, adhesion, angiogenesis, and survival (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). Studies, mostly performed in colon cancer cells and fibroblasts, revealed that the oncogenic potential of increased Src activity in tumor cells is pleiotropic involving control of cell proliferation and the regulation of cytoskeletal-linked events, such as ECM-adhesion, migration, spreading, and invasion (2Rahimi N.

Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7928-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, in breast cancer cells, the relevance and dispensability of each member of this complex is not fully understood, and it is still intriguing the importance of their kinase activity and their role as adaptor proteins to control the signaling pathways they trigger. A recent work in mouse embryo fibroblasts showed that Fak is dispensable for v-Src-induced transformation but would exert either positive or negative effects on signaling or motility depending on the pathways activated (6Moissoglu K. Sachdev S. Gelman I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Src family of tyrosine kinases has a modular prototypic structure with a membrane-targeting signal, which is always myristoylated and sometimes palmitoylated, and Src homology domains SH2 and SH3, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. The kinase domain contains the ATP binding site Lys295 (chicken nomenclature) and an autophosphorylation tyrosine residue (Tyr416). The carboxyl tail contains Tyr527, which regulates Src kinase activity. Phosphorylation of Tyr527 by CSK, favors intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain, inducing an inactive conformation of the Src kinases (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar, 7Boggon T.J. Eck M.J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7918-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). There are data in vivo and in tissue culture supporting the fact that Src kinases exert their biological actions not only through their enzymatic activity but also through their capacity to interact with other proteins via the SH2 and SH3 domains, generating complexes of signaling molecules involved in diverse signal transduction pathways (4Brunton V.G. Avizienyte E. Fincham V.J. Serrels B. Metcalf 3rd, C.A. Sawyer T.K. Frame M.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Fresno Vara J.A.

The combined mutations in the ATP binding site (K295M) and the regulatory C-terminal tyrosine residue (Y527F) generate a c-SrcDN mutant (K295M/Y527F) with an open conformation in which SH2 and SH3 domains may interact with other proteins but devoid of enzymatic activity; therefore, SrcDN is considered a dominant negative mutant of c-Src. Its expression was more efficient than c-SrcK-(K295M) in inhibiting prolactin-mediated proliferation of W53 lymphoid cells, by competing with endogenous activated Fyn and Lyn Src kinases (8Fresno Vara J.A. Dominguez Caceres M.A. Silva A. Martín-Pérez J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2171-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). c-Src is frequently overexpressed and/or aberrantly activated in a variety of epithelial cancers, including breast cancer (11Frame M.C.

Also, c-Src tyrosine kinase activity appears to be required for PyV middle T antigen-induced mammary tumorigenesis (23Guy C.T. Muthuswamy S.K. Cardiff R.D. Soriano P. Muller W.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although these data support the importance of c-Src in breast cancer, the direct effect of c-Src functional inactivation on the transforming phenotype and tumorigenic potential of breast cancer cells has not been yet directly examined. Therefore, we generated MCF7 human breast cancer cells expressing SrcDN under the control of tetracycline (Tet-On system) in order to discriminate the specific role of the Fak and c-Src kinases, and to overcoming the drawback of Src inhibitors that could affect other signaling molecules (24Liu Y. Bishop A. Witucki L. Kraybill B. Shimizu E. Tsien J. Ubersax J. Blethrow J. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 25Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In MCF7 breast cancer cells, we observed that induction of SrcDN expression altered cell morphology, and caused a significant impairment of cell migration, adhesion, and spreading. These effects were associated with the delocalization and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of critical proteins involved in integrin signaling and adhesion dynamics, such as Fak (Tyr925), p130CAS and paxillin. Expression of SrcDN also, significantly reduced cell proliferation in vitro, and led to a clear decrease in Akt phosphorylation and to a higher expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1. Depletion of endogenous c-Src levels by means of siRNA had similar effects, showing the relevance of c-Src in breast cancer cells migration, adhesion, spreading and proliferation. Finally, expression of c-SrcDN reduced tumor growth in nude mice and more importantly, it was able to induce tumor regression. The antitumorigenic ability of induced SrcDN was associated with decreased proliferation, induction of apoptosis and reduction of angiogenic potential. Together these results provide insight on the mechanisms of the Src·Fak complex in the control of breast cancer cells proliferation, migration, spreading and survival, and the relevance of c-Src for the correct performance of this complex, pointing to this signaling protein as a potential target for therapeutic agents.

Generation of MCF7 Human Breast Cancer Cells Bearing a Doxycycline-inducible SrcDN—Clone 89rtTA expressing the rtTA (the reverse tetracycline transactivator) was obtained by transfection of MCF7 cells with pUHD17–1neo as previously described (26Venditti M. Iwasiow B. Orr F.W. Shiu R.P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Clone 89rTA cultured in complete medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% Tet-free FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 international units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), was maintained with 0.2 mg/ml G418. Cells were then cotransfected with SrcDN (avian c-Src K295M/Y527F) (8Fresno Vara J.A. Dominguez Caceres M.A. Silva A. Martín-Pérez J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2171-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) cloned into pTET-Splice (Invitrogen) and pBABE-Puromycin by calcium phosphate method. Control cells were cotransfected with pTET-Splice (Invitrogen) and pBABE-Puromycin. Transfected cells were then selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. The resistant clones were expanded and tested for the induction of SrcDN expression upon addition of 2 μg/ml Doxy by Western blotting with mAb EC10 to detect avian SrcDN. Four clones with very low basal SrcDN expression in the absence of Doxy, and high induction levels with Doxy were selected (1, 2, 29, and 30). For further experiments these clones were maintained in complete medium containing 0.2 mg/ml of G418 and 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Generation of MCF7 Cells Expressing c-Src-siRNA—Duplexes for hairpin siRNA expression contained the unique 19-nucleotide sequence (AAACTCCCCTTGCTCATGTAC) that specifically targets the kinase domain of human c-Src (BLAST, NCBI Genome), in both sense and antisense orientation, separated by a 9-nucleotide (TTCAAGAGA) spacer sequence. The 5′-end corresponds to the BglII site, while the 3′-end contains the T5 sequence and HindIII corresponding nucleotides. The bacterial EGFP sequence was used as control (27Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse oligonucleotides were annealed to produce the dsRNA, digested with BglII and HindIII and cloned into pSUPERIOR.puro (OligoEngine Inc., Seattle, WA), and correct insertion and insert sequence checked by sequencing. Stable transfection of MCF7 cells with the plasmids containing the siRNA for human c-Src or EGFP was carried out using jet-PEY™ (Polyplus Transfection, Ilkirch, France), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml) and tested for c-Src expression by Western blotting using 327 mAb. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was determined by staining the cells with crystal violet. Cells were plated at a density of 105 cells per well (24-well-plates) with complete medium in the presence or absence of Doxy. The next day medium was replaced for phenol red-free and serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10% serum or with EGF (100 ng/ml), in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml Doxy; 72 h later the number of cells per well was determined by crystal violet assay. Briefly, following cell fixation with glutaraldehyde 1%, cells were stained with crystal violet 1% and adhesion was quantified by washing the cells, eluting the dye with 1 ml/well of 10% acetic acid and measuring the absorbance at 600 nm. Cell proliferation was also determined by counting viable cells with trypan blue exclusion dye, as follows: cells were seeded (5 × 105/60-mm plate) in complete medium in the presence or absence of Doxy. After 16 h (t = 0), the culture medium was changed for phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% serum or with EGF (100 ng/ml), in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml Doxy, and 72 h later adherent cells were detached mixed with a 0.4% trypan blue solution (1:1) and loaded on a hemocytometer. The percentage of viable cells was calculated to determine cell growth. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) Pulse-label Experiments and Flow Cytometry Analysis—Cell cycle was analyzed by the BrdU/anti-BrdU method. Briefly, cells were plated (1.5 × 106/90-mm plate) in serum-supplemented medium in the presence or absence of Doxy (2 μg/ml) and incubated for 48 h. Afterward, cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 10 μm of BrdU, washed twice with culture medium and incubated in fresh serum supplemented medium in the presence or absence of Doxy for different time periods. At given times, cells were detached labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated-anti-BrdU (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and propidium iodide, and analyzed as previously described (8Fresno Vara J.A. Dominguez Caceres M.A. Silva A. Martín-Pérez J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2171-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell Migration Assay—Cells were seeded at 5 × 105/60 mm, and grown in complete medium for 16 h. Then cells were incubated in the presence or absence of Doxy (2 μg/ml) for 24 h to allow expression of SrcDN mutant. Subsequently, the cell monolayers were scarred with a sterile micropipette tip and incubated for another 24 h with or without Doxy. For each sample three defined areas were monitored during this period. The photographs were taken at the beginning of the assay (t = 0 h) and 24 h later (t = 24 h). Magnification, ×100. Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assays—Cell adhesion and spreading assays were essentially performed as described previously (28Arroyo A.G. Sanchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martin-Padura I. Dejana E. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells, pretreated with or without Doxy for 48 h, were seeded in 96-well plates precoated with fibronectin (1 mg/ml) in serum-free DMEM in presence or absence of Doxy. Control cells were seeded in bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) precoated wells. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C cells were photographed (magnification, ×400) to determine cell spreading. Cell adhesion was quantified by washing twice with PBS to remove non-adherent cells, fixing the adhered cells and staining with crystal violet 1% and quantifying, as described previously (see cell proliferation assays). Spreading and adhesion were also determined in plastic wells. A similar method was used but with 2 × 105 cells, pretreated with or without Doxy for 48 h. Cell spreading was quantified by counting round and spread cells in at least six fields (∼200 cells per field) per sample. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells (1 × 106 cells/dish) were washed twice in ice-cold TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl) with 0.1 mm Na3VO4 and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm ortho-phenanthroline). Cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blot, as previously described (8Fresno Vara J.A. Dominguez Caceres M.A. Silva A. Martín-Pérez J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2171-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Confocal Analysis—Cells were plated at 1 × 104 per chamber slide well, fixed, and permeabilized in 100% methanol for 10 min at –20 °C (anti-Src 327, anti-Fak, anti-paxillin), or fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100) at room temperature (phalloidin). Subsequently, cells were washed three times with PBS-T and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1:50 anti-Src 327, 1:50 anti-Fak (A17), 1:100 anti-paxillin, and 1:50 phalloidin. Coverslips were washed twice for 5 min with PBS-T, and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, washed again, and mounted in Mowiol medium. Cells were examined using an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) equipped with a color digital camera (Spot RT Slider) (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) with a 63/1.40 oil Plan-Apochromat objective. Confocal analysis was performed with a Leica TCS SPII Spectral microscope and 63X/1.3 NA oil objective. Immunocytochemistry—Exponentially growing cells in complete medium in the presence or absence of Doxy during 48 h detached with trypsin, washed twice with complete medium to neutralize the protease, then washed twice with PBS to remove serum, and the final pellet of cells was fixed in formol. The fixed pellet was included in paraffin and 5-μm sections were prepared. The paraffin sections were treated accordingly (29Munoz-Guerra M.F. Marazuela E.G. Fernandez-Contreras M.E. Gamallo C. Cancer. 2005; 103: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for immunostaining with mAb 327 to detect total c-Src or with mAb EC10 to detect chicken c-SrcDN. Evaluation of the Anti-tumorigenic Activity of the Src Double Mutant—Female athymic nude-Foxn1nu mice 6–8 weeks old, purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, ID), were used. Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions in a temperature-controlled room on 12/12 h light/dark schedule with food and water ad libitum. All procedures involving animals and their care were in accordance with national and international regulations. Each nude mice was implanted each with a 1.7 mg of 17β-estradiol pellet (90 days release, Innovative Research of America) to supplement the estrogens requirement for MCF-7 proliferation. A week after implantation of 17β-estradiol pellet, 5 × 106 viable cells were subcutaneously injected in both back flanks to obtain solid tumors. Mice were divided into three experimental groups of 8–9 animals. Group 1 (control) never received Doxy with the drinking water, group 2 received Doxy with the drinking water (2 mg/ml) from the first day after injection of MCF-7 Tet-on SrcDN cells, and group 3 received Doxy with the drinking water (2 mg/ml) 6 weeks after the injection of tumor cells. The bottles of water were changed every 3 days. The tumors were measured by vernier caliper, weekly, and their volumes were calculated using the formula LxWxHx0.52. Immunohistochemistry of Xenografts—Tumors from untreated and Doxy-treated mice were removed after cervical dislocation twelve weeks after tumor cell implantation. Tumor specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen and/or fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution immediately after surgical resection. Fixed samples were paraffin embedded (29Munoz-Guerra M.F. Marazuela E.G. Fernandez-Contreras M.E. Gamallo C. Cancer. 2005; 103: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and 5-μm sections were analyzed by hematoxylin/eosin staining, as described (29Munoz-Guerra M.F. Marazuela E.G. Fernandez-Contreras M.E. Gamallo C. Cancer. 2005; 103: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67, c-Src, and avian c-Src was also performed. The number of Ki67 and total c-Src positive cells was estimated in six high-power fields containing 60–80 cells/field (×200). Results were classified as follows: 4 (≥75%); 3 (50–75%); 2 (25–50%); 1 (≤25%); and 0 (no or weak staining in a few cells). Frozen samples were processed for Western blot analysis of PARP, total c-Src and avian Src expression. Statistical Analyses—Analyses were performed with the SPSS/PC version 12.0X statistical package (SPSS, 2005, Chicago, IL). Comparisons between groups were performed by the Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Anova and chi2 tests. When the expected frequency of any group was lower than 5, the Fisher exact test was used. All the tests applied were two-tailed and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Inducible Doxycycline Expression of SrcDN in MCF7 Cells Results in Phenotypic Changes—Clone 89rtTA of MCF7 cells expressing the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) maintained in the presence of G418 (0.2 mg/ml) (26Venditti M. Iwasiow B. Orr F.W. Shiu R.P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with pTET-Splice-SrcDN and pBABE-puromycin. Cells maintained in complete medium were selected in the presence of G418 (0.2 mg/ml) with 2 μg/ml of puromycin. Resistant clones were expanded and tested by Western blotting for inducible expression of avian c-Src dominant negative mutant (SrcDN) upon addition of Doxy (0.2 and 2 μg/ml) to cultures for 48 h. Using the mAb EC10, which only recognizes the avian c-Src mutant, but not the endogenous human c-Src expressed by MCF7 cells, four MCF7-Tet-On-SrcDN clones were selected for the following studies (Fig. 1A). Total Src expression was also analyzed by Western blot using mAb 327 (Fig. 1A). Cells maintained in complete medium were treated with increasing concentrations of Doxy for 48 h to determine the dose-dependent induction of SrcDN. The concentration of Doxy chosen to perform the following assays was 2 μg/ml as the results showed an appropriate induction of SrcDN in all selected clones; higher concentrations of Doxy did not increase SrcDN expression (data not shown). We also determined the kinetics of SrcDN expression by collecting cells after incubation with Doxy (2 μg/ml) for different periods of time, and observed maximal SrcDN expression between 48 and 72 h (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the expression of SrcDN in cells by immunocytochemistry (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with results obtained by Western blot (Fig. 1A), expression of SrcDN was induced only by the addition of Doxy (Fig. 1B, SrcDN (EC10)). In the presence of Doxy, staining of Total Src increased as a consequence of additional expression of SrcDN (Fig. 1B, Total-Src (327)). It is worth mentioning that SrcDN was mainly found at the plasma membrane where it is biologically functional (Fig. 1B). We observed that SrcDN expression caused cells to become refractive and rounded as compared with cells grown in the absence of Doxy (Fig. 1C), and control cells (MCF7-Tet-On: Clone 89rtTA of MCF7 cotransfected with empty pTET-Splice and pBABE-puromycin; supplemental Fig. S1A). These results suggest that expression of SrcDN interferes with cell adhesion and with the correct assembly and dynamics of the cytoskeleton. The following experiments were carried out with all four clones obtaining similar results. The data presented here are referred to clone 2. SrcDN Alters Cell Migration, Adhesion, and Spreading—To further evaluate the biological effects of SrcDN expression on MCF7-Tet-On-SrcDN cells, we next examined whether the expression of the c-Src mutant impaired cellular functions requiring intact integrin signaling and cytoskeleton machinery. For this purpose, we determined whether SrcDN expression altered cell migration, adhesion, and spreading. Wound repair assays were performed to evaluate migration, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cultures were pretreated with or without Doxy (2 μg/ml) for 24 h and after wounding, cells were incubated in complete medium in the presence or absence of Doxy for another 24 h.

In this study, we focused on the direct effects of interferon-γ (IFNG) on highly purified rat oligodendroglial cultures at different developmental stages. Among the three stages tested, IFNG had direct cytotoxic effects on actively proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitors but much less on immature oligodendrocytes and none on mature oligodendrocytes. This stage-specific susceptibility of progenitors to IFNG-induced cytotoxicity consisted of two components, delay in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and increased cell death at least partly mediated by apoptosis, suggesting that progression of the cell cycle was tightly linked to this toxic mechanism. There was no functional difference in the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways between progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes as determined by induction of IRF1 mRNA in response to IFNG. We found that partial inhibition of the MEK-ERK pathway, one of the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorelay modules, by U0126 partially reversed the IFNG-induced cytotoxicity in progenitors. In addition, ERK activity was quickly down-regulated after in vitro differentiation of progenitors to immature oligodendrocytes. Therefore, we concluded that simultaneous activation of the STAT pathway by IFNG and of the ERK pathway by exogenous trophic factors played a role in the stage-specific IFNG-induced cytotoxicity in oligodendroglial progenitors.

Once inflammatory chain reactions are activated, oligodendrocytes are exposed to complex cytokine networks produced by immune cells in the central nervous system or entering via an impaired blood-brain barrier. As a result, oligodendroglial survival, proliferation, and differentiation are substantially affected. The pathophysiological significance of interferon-γ (IFNG), a pleiotrophic cytokine produced by a variety of immune cells including T helper 1 (TH1) cells and natural killer cells, in the development of MS and PVL has been intensively investigated. One group of in vivo studies supports a deleterious role of IFNG on myelin synthesis, maintenance, and repair. Most notably, treatment of MS patients with IFNG caused significant exacerbations of their diseases (6.Panitch H.S. Hirsch R.L. Haley A.S. Johnson K.P. Lancet. 1987; 329: 893-895Abstract Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Also, transgenic overexpression of IFNG in the central nervous system caused defective myelination and demyelination in mice (7.Corbin J.G. Kelly D. Rath E.M. Baerwald K.D. Suzuki K. Popko B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 354-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8.Horwitz M.S. Evans C.F. McGavern D.B. Rodriguez M. Old-stone M.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, a second group of studies indicates protective roles of IFNG. Neutralizing antibodies for IFNG enhanced development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS (9.Billiau A. Heremans H. Vandekerckhove F. Dijkmans R. Sobis H.

Autoimmunity. 1993; 16: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), while intrathecal delivery of IFNG protected mice from chronic progressive EAE (11.Furlan R. Brambilla E. Ruffini F. Poliani P.L. Bergami A. Marconi P.C. Franciotta D.M. Penna G. Comi G. Adorini L. Martino G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mice lacking IFNG or its receptor showed more severe symptoms of EAE than did wild-type mice (12.Ferber I.A. Brocke S. Taylor-Edwards C. Ridgway W. Dinisco C. Steinman L. Dalton D. Fathman C.G. J.

Cowden W.B. Ramshaw I.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3223-3227PubMed Google Scholar). In accord with these results, inhibition of IFNG signaling enhances development of interleukin-17 producing T helper cells, a newly identified subset of T helper cells that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of antoimmunity (15.Lock C. Hermans G. Pedotti R. Brendolan A. Schadt E. Garren H. Langer-Gould A. Strober S. Cannella B. Allard J. Klonowski P. Austin A. Lad N. Kaminski N. Galli S.J. Oksenberg J.R. Raine C.S. Heller R.

These conflicting in vivo observations prompted us to discriminate direct effects of IFNG on oligodendrocytes from its immunomodulatory roles in immune cells. Most prior in vitro studies using isolated oligodendroglial lineage cells (OLC) have provided evidence for deleterious effects of IFNG on OLC, including induction of apoptosis or necrosis, growth inhibition, and inhibition of differentiation (17.Vartanian T. Li Y. Zhao M. Stefasson K. Mol. Med. 1995; 1: 732-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Agresti C. D'Urso D. Levi G. Eur. J.

Glia. 2005; 52: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Some of these studies also pointed out that these effects of IFNG substantially depend on developmental stages of the oligodendroglial lineage. One mechanism of the cytotoxic effects of IFNG is attributable to its synergism with other proinflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor super family member 2/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFSF2/TNFα) and lipopolysaccharides (23.Agresti C.

Neurosci. 2001; 13: 493-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxic effects of IFNG itself in OLC have still remained unclear, particularly in relation to developmental stages of OLC. In this study, we have focused on direct effects of IFNG on viability of OLC using highly purified primary rat oligodendroglial cultures at different developmental stages and demonstrated that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, one of four well characterized mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorelay modules (26.Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), is involved in stage-specific vulnerability of oligodendroglial progenitors to IFNG. Reagents and Chemicals—All reagents and culture media used in the present study were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively, except for the following products. Rat recombinant IFNG, human recombinant fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and human recombinant platelet-derived growth factor A homodimer (PDGFAA) were from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN); U0126 and SB203580 were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA); SP600125 was from Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland); fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V solution and FITC-conjugated mouse anti-5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) monoclonal antibody were from Pharmingen; Flow-Count™ fluorospheres was from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA); rabbit anti-c-Myc and rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biothechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-Waf-1 (p21Cip1/CDKN1A) antibody was from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); mouse anti-p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) antibody was from Medical & Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan); rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); TRIzol-Reagent was from Invitrogen; RNeasy RNA extraction kit was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA); TaqMan® Assay-on-Demand™ assay kits and TaqMan Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Cell Culture—Purified primary cultures of rat OLC at different developmental stages were prepared as reported previously (27.Itoh T. Beesley J. Itoh A. Cohen A.S. Kavanaugh B. Coulter D.A. Grinspan J.B. Pleasure D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole brains were dissected from three 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats and submerged in ice-cold Leibovitz's L-15 medium. Under a dissecting microscope, olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortexes, and hindbrains were removed. After cleaning off meninges and vessels including choroidal plexus, the remaining brain tissues were cut into small chunks with a 21-gauge needle and digested by 0.0625% (w/v) trypsin in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 20 min. Dissociated cells were obtained by passing the softened chunks through a 1-ml hand pipette tip several times and collected by centrifugation at 365 × g for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in minimum essential medium α medium (Invitrogen, catalog number 12571) containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 5% (v/v) calf serum and plated onto a 10-cm culture dish. At 1 day after plating, attached cells (designated as passage 0) were washed with HBSS to remove serum and thereafter maintained in GM medium, a 3:7 mixture (v/v) of B104 neuroblastoma-conditioned medium and the N1 medium (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6 mm l-glutamine, 10 ng/ml biotin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml transferrin, 30 nm sodium selenite, 20 nm progesterone, and 100 μm putrescine as final concentrations). Cultures were fed with fresh GM medium every other day for ∼5 days, at which time the proliferating glial cells were almost confluent. Then, these mixed glial cells were washed with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS, suspended in the N1 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) fraction V bovine serum albumin (BSA), and plated on negative immunopanning plates coated with RAN-2 antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. This negative selection was repeated twice, and the nonadherent cells were then transferred to A2B5 positive panning dishes. After the serial immunopanning, purified cultures (designated as passage 1) contained more than 95% of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OP), which were A2B5-positive, O4-negative, and glial fibrillary acidic protein-negative. In this study, OP were expanded by up to passage 4 in GM medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml human recombinant FGF2, 1 ng/ml human recombinant PDGFAA, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. OP were fed with fresh GM medium every other day. To induce in vitro differentiation of OP, the culture medium was switched from the GM medium to differentiation medium (DM), a 1:1 mixture (v/v) of high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 4.5 mm l-glutamine, 10 ng/ml biotin, 12.5 μg/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml transferrin, 24 nm sodium selenite, 10 nm progesterone, 67 μm putrescine, 0.4 μg/ml 3,5,3′5′-tetraiodothyronine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as final concentrations. We employed these OLC cultures at 2 and 4 days in the DM as cultures of immature oligodendrocytes (IM) and mature oligodendrocytes (MO), respectively. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that more than 80% of the cells expressed O4 antigen and galactocerebroside but were negative for myelin basic protein at 2 day in DM and that more than 80% of the cells were positive for myelin basic protein at 4 days in DM. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cell viability was estimated by the enzymatic conversion of MTT to formazan crystals in live cells. Produced formazan was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 90 min after addition of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) to the culture medium and quantified by a spectrophotometer or a microplate reader at 560 nm. Cell Counting—OP (passages 2–4) were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well culture plates at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/well. Fine grids were marked on the bottom surface of the culture plates by scratching with a 30-gauge needle to identify the exact same image fields. In each experimental condition, phase contrast images of four different fields were obtained by an IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 10× objective and a 3 CCD digital camera (C5810, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan), and exactly the same image fields were followed up at regular intervals. Live cells, easily identified as phase bright cells and clearly distinguished from attached or floated dead cells, were counted in each image in off-line analysis. One image field (0.192 mm2) contained 54 ± 9 cells (n = 64) at 0 time point of experiments. Flow Cytometry—The OP cultures in 60-mm dishes were treated in various experimental conditions. At 0, 24, and 48 h after treatments, the culture medium containing detached dead cells was collected, and the attached cells were washed once with 2 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS. The attached cells were removed from the plate by 0.5 ml of 0.05% (w/v) trypsin at 37 °C for 2 min, suspended in 2 ml of GM with 625 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and collected into a 15-ml tube together with the saved medium and the Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS used for wash. After centrifuge at 520 × g for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended into 0.4 ml of binding buffer (0.1 m HEPES), pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.45% (w/v) d-glucose). For annexin V and propidium iodide binding assay, 5 μl of FITC-conjugated annexin V solution and propidium iodide (PI; 8 μg/ml at final concentration) were added into 0.1 ml of the cell suspension. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min in the dark, 0.3 ml of the binding buffer was added to the cell suspension. To determine the absolute number of cells in each preparation, Flow-Count™ fluorospheres were added at a concentration of 19 beads/μl just before flow cytometry by CyAn-ADP (Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Fluorescence of annexin V-FITC and PI were detected in FL-1 and FL-4 channels, respectively. Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using Summit software (Dako Cytometion). In each experiments, all counted events plotted along forward and side scattering gathered mainly on the three centers (see a, b, and c in Fig. 4A). As a major proportion of the cluster on center c consisted of fragmented cell debris, not single cells, the primary gating (R1) was set to exclude the cluster on center c and include the clusters on centers a and b, which represented alive and dead single cells, respectively, as confirmed under “Results.” For BrdUrd incorporation assay, OP cultured in 60-mm dishes were incubated with a single pulse of 10 μm BrdUrd for 4 h just prior to the assay. The trypsinized cells were collected in GM and resuspended into 1.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After fixation by 70% (v/v) ethanol at –20 °C for over night, 5 × 104 cells were washed with 1 ml of the washing buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) and denatured by 2 n HCl at room temperature for 20 min. After washing once with the washing buffer, the cells were incubated in 0.1 m sodium borate at room temperature for 2 min to neutralize any residual acid. BrdUrd-incorporated cells were labeled with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody at room temperature for 20 min in the dilution buffer (0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) followed by wash with the washing buffer. The labeled cells were detected with FL-1 channel of CyAn-ADP. FITC-conjugated mouse monoclonal IgG1 was used as isotype control. Immunocytochemical BrdUrd Incorporation Assay of IM—For IM, BrdUrd incorporation assays were performed immunocytochemically, because these cells were firmly attached to the culture dishes and thus were not suitable for flow cytometric analysis. IM cultured on coverslips were incubated with a single pulse of 10 μm BrdUrd for 4 h just prior to the assay. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilization by methanol at –20 °C for 10 min, cells were denatured and renaturated by the same methods as used in our flow cytometric analysis. The BrdUrd-incorporated cells were also labeled with the same antibody as employed for flow cytometric analysis, except that all nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidio-2-phenylindole (0.5 μg/ml). We tested BrdUrd incorporation into OP both on coverslips, as described for IM, and by flow cytometry, and obtained similar results with the two procedures. Immunoblots—Protein lysates were prepared in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Twenty μg of protein from each sample was size-fractioned by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schnell), and probed with primary antibodies for c-Myc (1:200), p21Cip1/CDKN1A (1:190), p27Kip1/CDKN1B (1:1000), or phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000) for 1 h. Full range recombinant Rainbow Molecular Weight Markers (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a reference for molecular sizes. Immunoreactive signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Whole ERK1/2 was detected with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) in the same membrane used for anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody after deprobing. Equal protein loading was confirmed by subsequent probing with the mouse monoclonal antibody against GAPDH in each experiment. Caspase Activity Assay—As described in our previous report (28.Moran J. Itoh T. Reddy U.R. Chen M. Alnemri E.S. Pleasure D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), cells were homogenized in the lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The protein lysates were stored at –80 °C until use as a 1:1 (v/v) mixture with glycerol. Caspase activity was measured by the fluorometric method (29.Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); clevage of the fluorogenic substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-α-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) (Ac-DEVD-AMC, Peptides International, Luoisville, KY) with the protein samples in the lysis buffer was monitored by a multiplate spectrofluoromater, Gemini EM (Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA) for 60 min at 25 °C. The DEVD cleavage activity was expressed as ΔRFU (relative fluorescence unit)/μg protein/h. Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol-Reagent or RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or a combination of the both. RT reaction and semiquantitative PCR were performed as reported (30.Itoh T. Itoh A. Pleasure D. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1500-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All sets of primers used in this study are listed in Table 1. Small variability among RT products was verified by semiquantitative PCR for GAPDH. To confirm reproducibility of the results, each RT-PCR was repeated twice using total RNA samples from independent experiments.TABLE 1Sequences of primers for semi quantitative RT-PCRGeneForward primerReverse primerIFNGR1CCTGTCTAGGGTGTCCTTTGCTCACGAGAACAAAGCAGGAAAIFNGR2CCGCTGCGGTTTCAGTCTAGTGAAGCCGAGGAACCAGTCJAK1TGGGCTTTGGAAGGTAAAGAAGCTTGGGAGAGAAGGACTTGAJAK2TGTTCTGAAAAAGGCTGTGGATCTTGAGCAGACAGCATCACASTAT1TCTCAGCTCTTACCGGCTTTCTTCACCTTCAGTGAGCTGCATSTAT2TCCTTGAGCCACTTGAAGGATGCCTATGCTAACCCTGCTCACSTAT3CTTCAGCCCCAGAGACAGTGCTCTGCTTTCACAGCCATCACSTAT4GAGCTGCAGGACTGGAAGAAGTGGCACCAAGTGAGAAGAGAGSTAT5AGACCCAAGGATGAGGTCTTTGTCAAACTTCCAAGCAATGGTGSTAT5BGATCGGCCAAAGGATGAAGTATAATTCCGTCCTGGCAGATTCSTAT6AGACCCATGGGCTTGGTAGTCTGTCTCTGGGCTTCTCCAGTTNFSF2/TNFαGGAAAGGACACCATGAGCACGAGTAATGGGGGTCAGAGTCGBCL2GCGAAGTGCTATTGGTACCTGATATTTGTTTGGGGCAGGTCTBCLXGACTGGTTGAGCCCATCTCTAGTGAGTGGACGGTCAGTGTCTBAXAGAGGCAGCGGCAGTGATAGACACAGTCCAAGGCAGCAGBAKGTCAGGCAGGTGACAAGTGAGTTAGTCCAGGCAGTCATGTGGNOXAGGATCTAAGTCCCCTGTACGCTTTCCCTCTCATCACAGTCCAPUMAGCCCAGCAGCACCTAGAGTCGGTCACCATGAGTCCTTCAGCBIDGGTTCCCTGGACTCTGAGCAGCTTCACAATTCTTGCCGTABNIP3AAGCTGCCCTGCTACCTCTCCACAGAATTCCTTTGGGGAAAGAPDHATTGTCAGCAATGCATCCTGCAAGACAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTA Open table in a new tab Real-time PCR analyses were performed by MX3005P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using TaqMan® Assay-on-Demand™ assay kits (assay numbers: Rn00589996_m1, Rn00582195_m1, Rn00561507_m1, Rn00591646_m1, Rn00597992_m1, Rn01494552_m1, and Rn00561424_m1 for detection of CDKN1A, CDKN1B, MYC, NOS2, PUMA/BBC3/JFY1, NOXA/PMAIP1/ARP, and IRF1 cDNA, respectively) or the primer and probe sets described previously (30.Itoh T. Itoh A. Pleasure D. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1500-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For standardization, GAPDH cDNA levels were quantified with TaqMan Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents according to manufacturer's instruction, and the absolute cDNA amounts were expressed as ratios to GAPDH cDNA. We repeated the analysis of each gene at least twice using total RNA samples from independent experiments and confirmed that changes in cDNA levels among experimental groups were reproducible. Representative data from at least two independent analyses of each gene were shown under “Results.” Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance was determined by two-tail analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. OP Are the Most Susceptible Stage in the Oligodendroglial Lineage to IFNG by Distinct Mechanism(s) from Excitotoxicity—Several prior studies have shown that IFNG has more toxic effects on progenitor cells than on mature oligodendrocytes (19.Baerwald K.D. Popko B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24.Andrews T. Zhang P. Bhat N.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25.Molina-Holgado E. Vela J.M. Arévalo-Martín A. Guaza C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 493-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, we confirmed this developmental stage-specific vulnerability of the oligodendroglial lineage to IFNG in our culture system and further examined whether α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-receptor (AMPA-R)-mediated excitotoxic mechanism is involved in cytotoxicity of IFNG. The three developmental stages of OLC cultures, OP in the GM medium, IM and MO at 2 and 4 days in the DM, respectively, were exposed to IFNG (100 ng/ml) and/or kainic acid (1 mm) for 48 h, and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Reduction of viability by IFNG was the highest in OP, and MO was completely resistant to IFNG. In contrast, as we reported previously (31.Kavanaugh B. Beesley J. Itoh T. Itoh A. Grinspan J. Pleasure D. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), AMPA-R-mediated excitotoxicity by kainic acid was the highest in IM, and cytotoxic effects of IFNG and KA were additive, indicating that both OP and IM were much more vulnerable to a combined effect of IFNG and excitotoxicity than MO (Fig. 1A). Only a minimum contribution of AMPA-R-mediated excitotoxicity to the cytotoxic effect of IFNG on OP was suggested by addition of the specific antagonist of AMPA-R, CNQX (Fig. 1B). Additionally, it has been well established that TNFSF2/TNFα synergistically potentiates IFNG-induced cytotoxicity in oligodendrocytes (18.Agresti C. D'Urso D. Levi G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1106-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24.Andrews T. Zhang P. Bhat N.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 574-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32.Buntinx M.

Although the DM was chemically defined, we also ruled out concomitant presence of TNFSF2/TNFα in the B104 conditioned medium, because no mRNA of TNFSF2/TNFα was detected by RT-PCR in the cultures of B104 neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1C). It confirmed that the reduction of viability was not enhanced by TNFSF2/TNFα in our culture conditions. Janus Kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) Pathway during OLC Development—IFNG signaling is principally mediated by STAT1 (33.Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). STAT3 is also activated weakly by IFNG, and this alternative activation is extremely augmented when STAT1 is absent (34.Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In AMPA-R-mediated excitotoxicity of OLC, abundance of calcium-permeable AMPA-R is likely to determine their"
https://openalex.org/W1995294870,"The heme cofactor in soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is a selective receptor for NO, an important signaling molecule in eukaryotes. The sGC heme domain has been localized to the N-terminal 194 amino acids of the β1 subunit of sGC and is a member of a family of conserved hemoproteins, called the H-NOX family (Heme-Nitric Oxide and/or OXygen-binding domain). Three new members of this family have now been cloned and characterized, two proteins from Legionella pneumophila (L1 H-NOX and L2 H-NOX) and one from Nostoc punctiforme (Np H-NOX). Like sGC, L1 H-NOX forms a 5-coordinate FeII-NO complex. However, both L2 H-NOX and Np H-NOX form temperature-dependent mixtures of 5- and 6-coordinate FeII-NO complexes; at low temperature, they are primarily 6-coordinate, and at high temperature, the equilibrium is shifted toward a 5-coordinate geometry. This equilibrium is fully reversible with temperature in the absence of free NO. This process is analyzed in terms of a thermally labile proximal FeII-His bond and suggests that in both the 5- and 6-coordinate FeII-NO complexes of L2 H-NOX and Np H-NOX, NO is bound in the distal heme pocket of the H-NOX fold. NO dissociation kinetics for L1 H-NOX and L2 H-NOX have been determined and support a model in which NO dissociates from the distal side of the heme in both 5- and 6-coordinate complexes.

The H-NOX (Heme-Nitric Oxide and/or OXygen-binding domain) family of heme proteins has been identified recently, first through sequence analysis (1Iyer L.M. Anantharaman V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and then through biochemical characterization (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This family was identified based on homology to the heme domain from soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), 3The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; CO, carbon monoxide; NO, nitric oxide; O2, oxygen; ORF, open reading frame; Na2S2O4, dithionite; Mb, myoglobin; Ax cyt c′, cytochrome c′ from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans; Rm FixLN, heme domain of FixL from Rhizogium meliloti; CN, coordination state; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tt H-NOX, T. tengcongensis H-NOX.3The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; CO, carbon monoxide; NO, nitric oxide; O2, oxygen; ORF, open reading frame; Na2S2O4, dithionite; Mb, myoglobin; Ax cyt c′, cytochrome c′ from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans; Rm FixLN, heme domain of FixL from Rhizogium meliloti; CN, coordination state; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tt H-NOX, T. tengcongensis H-NOX. the well characterized and conserved eukaryotic nitric oxide receptor (3Denninger J.W.

Biochem. 2005; 99: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). H-NOX proteins have now been identified in many prokaryotes in addition to the well known eukaryotic sGCs. Several of these prokaryotic H-NOX proteins have now been cloned, expressed, and spectroscopically characterized (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Karow D.S. Davis J.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16266-16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Nioche P. Berka V. Vipond J. Minton N. Tsai A.L. Raman C.S. Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of the H-NOX domain from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Tt H-NOX) has been solved to 1.77 Å resolution (8Pellicena P. Karow D.S. Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), providing the first structural data for the H-NOX family and, by homology, for the heme domain in the β-subunit of sGC. Taken together, these structural and biochemical results have suggested that some members of this family are able to use a homologous protein fold and an identical heme cofactor to discriminate between NO and O2 binding.Although a great deal of information pertaining to the entire H-NOX family has been determined from studying the structure of Tt H-NOX (5Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 8Pellicena P. Karow D.S. Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), specific structural data for an NO complex to any of the H-NOX proteins are still lacking. This is particularly relevant as NO is an important signaling molecule in eukaryotes, and sGC is the only firmly established NO receptor (3Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Acta Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c′ is a protein that shares ligand binding properties but not sequence or structural homology with sGC. A crystal structure of the FeII-NO cytochrome c′ complex shows NO bound to the proximal side of the heme (9Lawson D.M. Stevenson C.E. Andrew C.R. George S.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 553-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has led to speculation that the same is true for sGC. Physical studies of NO binding to sGC have been hindered by poor expression systems for this large protein. Thus considerable effort has been spent on shorter constructs of sGC containing its heme-binding domain, such as β1-(1-385) (10Zhao Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and β1-(1-194) (6Karow D.S. Davis J.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16266-16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Most of the prokaryotic members of the H-NOX family, however, are stand-alone ∼200 amino acid proteins that overexpress well in Escherichia coli. These close homologs of the sGC heme domain have proven generally useful in understanding ligand binding in the family.In this study, we examine three additional prokaryotic H-NOX proteins from Legionella pneumophila (ORF1 and ORF2) and Nostoc punctiforme (Np H-NOX). Unlike all other prokaryotes with predicted H-NOX proteins identified to date, L. pneumophila has two predicted ORFs for H-NOX proteins (L1 H-NOX and L2 H-NOX). Np H-NOX is 39% identical to the H-NOX domain from sGC, and the H-NOX domains L1 H-NOX and L2 H-NOX share 19 and 16% identity with sGC, respectively. The NO binding characteristics of these proteins will be important in determining function in these bacteria. In addition, given the high homology these proteins share with sGC, these results should have implications for the NO-heme complex of sGC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and General Methods—Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were purchased in their highest available purity and used as received.Protein Expression and Purification—PCR was used to amplify ZP_421786 from N. punctiforme genomic DNA (ATCC, Manassas, VA) using Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Upstream and downstream primers contained NdeI and NotI restriction sites, respectively. PCR was used to amplify YP_095089 (L1 H-NOX) and AAU28519 (L2 H-NOX) from L. pneumophila genomic DNA (ATCC) using Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Upstream and downstream primers contained NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. All amplified PCR products were cloned into pET-20b (Novagen) and sequenced (sequencing core; University of California, Berkeley). Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange® protocol from Stratagene. Cell culture procedures and purification of Np H-NOX were carried out as described previously for the H-NOX protein from Vibrio cholerae (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cell culture procedures of both Legionella H-NOX proteins were carried out as described previously (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Purification of the Legionella H-NOX proteins took advantage of the C-terminal His6 tag; proteins were purified by metal affinity (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) followed by gel filtration (Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60).Sample Preparation—Preparation of the various protein complexes was carried out as published previously (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with one minor exception, as follows. Rather than generate the FeII-NO complex with NO gas generated from the head space of a concentrated diethylamine NONOate (Cayman) solution, diethylamine NONOate was added directly to the protein solution, and then excess NO, diethylamine, and diethylamine NONOate were removed from the sample by using a PD10 desalting column. This was to ensure no free NO was in solution, and thus the only NO present in the sample was that bound to the heme in the protein.Spectroscopy—All electronic spectra were recorded on a Cary 3E spectrophotometer equipped with a Neslab RTE-100 constant temperature bath. For temperatures at 0 °C or lower, ethylene glycol (50%) was added to the constant temperature bath and 5% glycerol to the protein sample. Resonance Raman spectra were collected using 406.7 nm excitation from a Kr+ laser (Spectra-Physics model 2025). Raman scattering was detected with a cooled, back-illuminated CCD (LN/CCD-1100/PB; Roper Scientific) controlled by an ST-133 controller coupled to a subtractive dispersive double spectrograph. The laser power at the sample was ∼2 milliwatts. A microspinning sample cell was used to minimize photo-induced degradation. For the temperature dependence studies, the sample temperature was controlled by flowing either cooled (∼10 °C) or heated (∼40 °C) N2 gas over the Raman cell. Samples were equilibrated at the respective temperatures for 30 - 60 min prior to data acquisition. Typical data acquisition times ranged from 30 to 60 min, except for the L1 H-NOX NO-complex, which was signal-averaged for 3 h because of a high fluorescence background. Electronic absorption spectra were obtained both before and after the Raman experiments to ensure that sample integrity was maintained. Raman spectra were corrected for wavelength dependence of the spectrometer efficiency, and cyclohexane was used for instrument calibration. The reported frequencies are accurate to ±2 cm−1, and the resolution of the spectra is 8 cm−1. For each Raman spectrum, the raw data were base-line-corrected, and the buffer background signal was subtracted.Extinction Coefficient Determination—The extinction coefficients were determined similarly to the methods described previously for Tt H-NOX and Vc H-NOX (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10203-10211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Specifically, for the 6-coordinate FeII-NO complex of L2 H-NOX, the electronic spectra of various dilutions of a sample of the aerobic FeII-NO complex (prepared as described above) at 0 °C were recorded. The electronic spectra of dilutions of a sample of horse heart metmyoglobin (ϵ409 nm = 181 cm−1 mm−1) were also recorded and used as a standard for heme concentration. The heme content of each sample was determined by HPLC (Hewlett Packard Series II 1090 HPLC with a diode array detector). Each sample (75 μl) was applied to a C4 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Vydac) that had been equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0-75% acetonitrile over 25 min followed by a linear gradient of 75-100% acetonitrile over 5 min. The column was washed and re-equilibrated between runs with a gradient of 100-0% acetonitrile over 3 min followed by 5 min of 100% aqueous phase (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The flow rate was 1 ml/min.NO Dissociation Rate—NO dissociation rates were measured as described previously (5Boon E.M. Huang S.H. Marletta M.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, FeII-NO complexes of protein (5 μm heme final concentration) diluted in anaerobic 50 mm triethanolamine, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, buffer were rapidly mixed with a saturated carbon monoxide and 30 mm (final concentration) dithionite trap (Na2S2O4) in the same buffer (anaerobic) (11Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been established previously that CO binding is not rate-limiting in these experiments (11Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); this was confirmed in experiments using only 30 mm Na2S2O4 without CO as a trap. Data were acquired by scanning periodically on a Cary 3E spectrophotometer equipped with a Neslab RTE-100 constant temperature bath set to varying temperatures (0-70 °C). The dissociation of NO from the heme was monitored as the formation of the FeII-CO complex at 423 nm. Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the first scan from each subsequent scan. The NO dissociation rate was determined from the increase in absorbance at 423 nm versus time and fit with a single or two parallel exponentials of the form f(x) = A × (1 - e−kx). Each experiment was performed a minimum of six times, and the resulting rates were averaged. The dissociation rates measured are independent of CO and dithionite concentration (3, 30, and 300 mm dithionite were tested).RESULTSElectronic Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra of L2 H-NOX, L1 H-NOX, and Np H-NOX proteins as the FeII-unligated, FeII-CO, and FeII-NO complexes at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1 and compared with sGC, Tt H-NOX, and other histidyl-ligated heme proteins in Table 1. Interestingly, although the FeII-unligated and CO complexes of each of these proteins are similar to sGC and all other H-NOX proteins characterized to date (Table 1), there are some significant differences in the FeII-NO complexes. Specifically, L1 H-NOX forms a 5-coordinate NO complex with a characteristic Soret absorbance maximum at 398 nm (Fig. 1B) like sGC, but L2 H-NOX (Fig. 1C) and Np H-NOX (Fig. 1A) appear to be composed of a mixture of 5- and 6-coordinate FeII-NO complexes at 20 °C (399 and 416 nm, respectively). L2 H-NOX is a relatively evenly distributed mixture, whereas Np H-NOX appears to be primarily a 6-coordinate complex with a small shoulder corresponding to the 5-coordinate complex.

Table 2 details the assignment of the major heme skeletal modes and compares them to sGC, Tt H-NOX, and other histidyl-ligated heme proteins. The Raman spectra confirm observations made in the electronic absorption spectra that L1 H-NOX forms a 5-coordinate NO complex, whereas L2 H-NOX and Np H-NOX have mixed coordination states, the specifics of which are discussed below. The π-electron density marker, ν4, is used to determine the oxidation state of the heme. The spin and coordination state markers, ν3, ν2, and ν10, are sensitive to the core size of the heme macrocycle (13Spiro T.G. Li X.-Y. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Typical frequency shifts of 3-15 cm−1 are often observed upon switching from 5- to 6-coordinate complexes for some of these skeletal markers.FIGURE 2Resonance Raman spectra of H-NOX domains as the FeII-NO complex at 20 °C.

In the high frequency region of L2 H-NOX (Fig. 2D), ν3, ν2, and ν10 are primarily positioned at 1502, 1583, and 1633 cm−1, respectively, and are characteristic of histidyl-ligated, 6-coordinate, low spin, FeII-NO heme complexes such as myoglobin and Tt H-NOX (Table 2). However, there are also shoulders that appear at 1508 and 1646 cm−1, which correspond well to the marker values typically observed for the 5-coordinate nitrosyl heme complexes, such as sGC (Table 2). Together, these spectra strongly suggest that L2 H-NOX is a mixture of 5- and 6-coordinate complexes under room temperature conditions (∼20 °C).Although the signal-to-noise ratio is lower for L1 H-NOX because of a high fluorescence background (Fig. 2, B and E), the main skeletal modes are still discernible. Fig. 2B shows a band at 522 cm−1 assigned to the Fe-N stretching mode based on similarity to the 5-coordinate ferrous nitrosyl complexes in sGC (525 cm−1) and V. cholerae H-NOX (Vc H-NOX; 523 cm−1). The high frequency region of L1 H-NOX shows ν3, ν2, and ν10 at 1507, 1581, and 1643 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 2E). These observed vibrational frequencies for L1 H-NOX are consistent with other 5-coordinate FeII-NO heme complexes (2Karow D.S. Pan D. Tran R. Pellicena P. Presley A. Mathies R.A.

Our results indicate that the nitrosyl complex for Np H-NOX is primarily 6-coordinate, with νFe-N assigned at 559 cm−1 based on previous work (6Karow D.S. Davis J.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16266-16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Tsubaki M. Yu N.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (isotope data not shown); the spin and coordination state markers were observed at 1499, 1580, and 1632 cm−1 for ν3, ν2, and ν10, respectively. Closer inspection of the high frequency spectra show small, broad shoulder bands for both ν3 and ν10 at 1506 and 1645 cm−1, supporting the appearance of a mixture of 5- and 6-coordinate complexes in the electronic absorption spectra at ∼20 °C.Temperature Dependence of the 5- and 6-Coordinate NO Complexes—To investigate the mixture of 5- and 6-coordinate complexes, temperature-dependent studies of the FeII-NO complex of Np H-NOX and L2 H-NOX were carried out. Electronic absorption spectra indicate that both Np H-NOX and L2 H-NOX are in equilibrium between 5- and 6-coordinate complexes at physiologically relevant temperatures, as indicated by the Soret λmax shift with temperature (Fig. 3). The temperature was varied between 1 and 45 °C in the same sample several times showing that this 5- to 6-coordination behavior was fully reversible. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent coordination states are independent of NO concentration for both H-NOX proteins; no excess NO was added to any of the samples; the only NO in solution was that bound to the heme at the beginning of the experiment. The same results are obtained when the experiment is carried out anaerobically, indicating that O2 has no effect on this process.FIGURE 3Temperature-dependent electronic absorption spectra of the FeII-NO complexes of H-NOX domains. Np H-NOX (12 μm) (A) and L2 H-NOX (7 μm) (B). Heme concentration is indicated in parentheses. Temperatures for Np H-NOX are 4 °C (—), 10 °C (···), 20 °C (- - -), and 37 °C (- - -). The corresponding temperatures for L2 H-NOX are those shown with the same dash and color patterns using thick lines. In addition, 1, 15, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C are illustrated using thin lines. The 6-coordinate complex at 416 nm decreases simultaneously with increasing 5-coordinate complex at 399 nm as the temperature increases from 1 to 45 °C. This temperature dependence implicates Fe-His bond formation as an exothermic reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantification of the amount of 5- and 6-coordinate complexes present at each temperature requires measurement of the extinction coefficient; however, the only complex that can be isolated to accurately measure the extinction coefficient was L2 H-NOX at 0 °C. Thus the extinction coefficient of the 6-coordinate NO complex of L2 H-NOX was determined to be 139 mm−1 cm−1, which was then used to estimate the mixture of each complex at a given temperature. At 40 °C, there is approximately a 50% mixture of each coordination state in the FeII-NO complex of L2 H-NOX. Even at −12 °C, L1 H-NOX shows no evidence of a 6-coordinate NO complex, although it is expected that at a sufficiently low temperature, the NO complex of L1 H-NOX would also convert to the 6-coordinate species.The temperature-dependent behavior was further investigated for L2 H-NOX between ∼10 and ∼40 °C by using resonance Raman spectroscopy. The high frequency spectra obtained at ∼10 °C for L2 H-NOX show ν3, ν2, and ν10 at 1500, 1586, and 1633 cm−1, respectively. In corroboration with the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 3B), these observed vibrational frequencies show a shift in the equilibrium population toward a 6-coordinate complex with decreasing temperature. The spin state marker, ν3, is clearly split with overlapped bands at 1502 and 1508 cm−1 upon increasing the temperature to ∼20 °C (Fig. 4, B and E). The vibrational frequency for ν3 increases to 1510 cm−1 when the temperature is raised to ∼40 °C, supporting an equilibrium shift toward the 5-coordinate complex (Fig. 4, C and F). A temperature-dependent shoulder is also observed for ν10 at 1646 cm−1 with increasing temperature (Fig. 4, D-F). This shift in the vibrational frequency for ν10 has similarly been observed for 5- and 6-coordinate heme-NO complexes in cytochrome c′ (16Andrew C.R. George S.J. Lawson D.M. Eady R.R.

Tissues use specific sets of collagens, often synthesized simultaneously, to achieve and maintain particular functional properties. Most collagens are secreted and assembled within the extracellular environment; however, a growing subclass of collagens are transmembranous and inserted into the plasma membrane in a type II orientation to extend their extracellular collagenous domains from the cell surface. The subclass of transmembranous collagens currently includes types XIII, XVII, XXIII, and XXV, summarized in a recent review (1Franzke C.W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol.

Gerecke D.R. Hahn R.A. Bhatt P. Goyal M. Koch M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: S752Google Scholar). We also cloned the full-length mouse collagen XXIII cDNA sequence and deposited it into GenBank™ (accession number AF410792). Cloning and expression of the rat and human α1(XXIII) cDNAs revealed evidence that (i) the molecule is shed from the cell surface by selective proteolysis suggesting an involvement of furin and (ii) that the expression is up-regulated with metastatic potential in prostate cancer cell lines (16Banyard J. Bao L. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20989-20994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For collagen XXV, the newest member of the group, mRNA could be specifically detected in neurons and has been identified as a component of the senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer disease (17Hashimoto T. Wakabayashi T. Watanabe A. Kowa H. Hosoda R. Nakamura A. Kanazawa I. Arai T. Takio K. Mann D.M. Iwatsubo T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here we present the strategies for obtaining mouse, chicken, and human α1(XXIII) collagen cDNAs. The sequences and domain structures of the orthologs were compared as were the distribution and abundance of the mRNA in mature and developing tissues. The protein was examined in tissues using polyclonal antibodies generated in guinea pig and rabbit against the ectodomain of mouse collagen XXIII. The antibodies revealed that some tissues contain mostly the full-length transmembranous form, whereas in other tissues the shed ectodomain is the major form of collagen XXIII. Identification and Cloning of α1(XXIII) Collagen cDNAs—Stretches of amino acid sequences, derived from specific domains in the FACIT collagen types, were used as queries to perform BLAST searches (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) to pick up related, but unique, collagen cDNAs in the human dbEST (19Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). A unique clone (GenBank™ accession number W22262) was identified that encodes a portion of a triple helical domain and 18 amino acid residues of a non-collagenous domain with strong resemblance to type XIII collagen. The clone was obtained, completely sequenced, and assigned the next available number in the collagen family, α1(XXIII) (see supplemental material). In total, the composite full-length human α1(XXIII) collagen cDNA is 3,060 nucleotides and was assigned GenBank™ accession number AY898961. The human sequence was used to search mouse ESTs, and clone AW323570 was identified. After extending the cDNA sequence by 5′-RACE using mouse lung cDNA, an overlap was found with a 5′-end EST (GenBank™ accession number AW494383). The primary structure of the entire mouse α1(XXIII) collagen mRNA was verified by PCR and sequence analysis and was submitted to GenBank™ under accession number AF410792. To obtain the initial chick cDNA, primers derived from nearly identical regions in the human and mouse sequences were used to amplify 13-day chick embryo corneal cDNA. A small chick α1(XXIII) collagen cDNA of ∼100 bp was obtained and reported in the 2000 ARVO meeting abstracts issue of the journal Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (15Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Hahn R.A. Bhatt P. Goyal M. Koch M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: S752Google Scholar). The complete chick α1(XXIII) collagen cDNA was deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY876377 (for cloning see supplemental material). The ExPASy Sim program from the Search Launcher at the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center website (found at searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/) was used to align polypeptide chains. For the comparison of the longest version of the human α1(XXIII) collagen polypeptide (accession number AY158895), human type XIII collagen (accession number AJ293624), and human type XXV collagen (accession number NM_198721), placement of amino acid residues was biased to align conserved exons in each collagen type in an effort to reflect areas of conserved gene structure (see supplemental material). To accomplish this, the exon/intron structure of each gene was determined using GenBank™ tools. Tissues—Human placenta, lung, and kidney total RNA were purchased from Clontech. Human cornea was from Lions Eye Bank of Oregon (Portland, OR), and human amnion was from Marie France Champliaud-Steiner (formerly of Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital). All tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until RNA isolation, which was accomplished using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. On-column DNase digestion was performed on the RNA as outlined in appendix D instructions in the RNeasy™ minikit handbook from Qiagen. Human donor corneal epithelial, stromal, and endothelial cDNAs were kindly provided by Mitch Watsky, Sally Twining, and Kim Vaughn. Human immortalized corneal epithelial cells (20Araki-Sasaki K. Ohashi Y. Sasabe T. Hayashi K. Watanabe H. Tano Y. Handa H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 614-621PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Fu-Shin Yu with permission of Dr. K. Araki-Sasaki), lung and esophageal cell lines A549 and HET-1A (a gift from Drs. C. S. Yang and L. Chen), esophageal cell line SEG-1 (from Drs. C. S. Yang and L. Chen with permission of Dr. David Beer), and the SKGT4 cell line (also from Drs. C. S. Yang, Luke Chen, and Xiaochun Xu with permission of Dr. David Schrump) were grown in culture, then scraped from plates, and used for RNA isolation. Mouse cornea, lung, skin, and sterna were dissected for RNA isolation; bone and tendon were purchased from Pel-Freeze Biologicals. RNA from human cell lines and all mouse tissues was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kits. For chick tissue, corneas were dissected from 7-, 9-, 11-, 13-, and 15-day embryos. With the exception of the 7-day corneas, epithelia were removed from the stromal/endothelial layer with EDTA and dispase, and RNA was isolated as described previously (21Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Lisenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For all tissues collected, RNA was quantified by absorbance measured at 260 nm. PCR, RT-PCR, and Relative RT-PCR—Routine 30-cycle amplifications were as described previously (21Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Lisenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RACE reactions were as performed previously (22Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) with modifications as described by Koch et al. (23Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P. Hahn R.A. Tanaka S.

With the exception of the human corneal epithelial, stromal, and endothelial mRNA, all other human relative RT-PCRs were performed in the linear range using the non-radioactive method described by Koch et al. (23Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P. Hahn R.A. Tanaka S. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Ramirez F. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43236-43244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The human primers were AACATTCAAGAGTATGCCCACC and CACACAGTGATCTCCATCTACACGG (944-bp product). Products were run on ethidium-containing agarose gels and photographed with an Eagle Eye II digital camera. Relative RT-PCR to quantitate mRNA abundance in mouse and chick tissues as well as in human corneal epithelium, stroma, and endothelium was done incorporating radioactive nucleotide into the product as described previously (23Koch M. Laub F. Zhou P. Hahn R.A. Tanaka S. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Ramirez F. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43236-43244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Koch M. Foley J.E. Hahn R. Zhou P. Burgeson R.E. Gerecke D.R. Gordon M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human collagen XXIII primers were TAACATTCAAGAGTATGCCCACC and AGGTTCTTACAGGGCAGTA (240-bp product). Mouse collagen XXIII primers were GACCTGGAGAACCAGGACTCGATG and CATCCAAACGGATCTGTACAGGTC (247-bp product). Chick collagen XXIII primers were GGAGAAATGGGCTTATCGGGT and CGGGTAAGCCAATGAGCCCT (215-bp product). PCR was performed for 29 cycles in the linear amplification range for fragments. Bands were cut from gels, and radioactivity was counted. The collagen XXIII signal was normalized by dividing it by radioactivity counts of the attenuated 18 S product (Ambion primer to Competimer ratio, 1:20) or, for chick, by the radioactivity counts of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase product. The resulting normalizations are called “adjusted cpm.” Because all primers were tested for optimal amplification capability and samples for each species were amplified using one master mixture and run on the same gel, the histograms show the relative differences between the amplified products. Whole Mount and Tissue Section in Situ Hybridization—Two probes were generated by RT-PCR (Clontech) using the following primer pairs: forward CCCAAGTTCAGCACGCTTC and reverse T7-CCATGAATGGAGCAGGAGCTAG and forward TCCAAGGTCCCAAGGGCCTG and reverse T7CTGTCCAGCCTCACCTGAGCC. The whole mount in situ hybridizations was done as described previously (25Schwabe G.C. Trepczik B. Suring K. Brieske N. Tucker A.S. Sharpe P.T. Minami Y. Mundlos S. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and section in situ hybridizations were performed with digoxigeninlabeled riboprobes using a semiautomated TECAN Genesis robot platform applying the Genepaint system (26Visel A. Thaller C. Eichele G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D552-D556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both probes stained equivalent structures. Recombinant Expression of α1(XXIII) Collagen in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293-EBNA Cells—The full-length α1(XXIII) collagen cDNA could not be amplified in one piece so an AvrII site was incorporated without altering the amino acid sequence at positions 45-49. The 5′-fragment was amplified using a KpnI sequence linked to CTGAGTCTGAGCGGGCGGCTAGG as the sense primer and an AvrII sequence linked to GGTCCCGGGTAGCC as the antisense primer. The 3′-fragment was amplified with forward primer GGGACC linked to TCTGGACGGC through an AvrII sequence and, as reverse primer, an XhoI sequence linked to CTTATGCCAGCAACCAGGCACAGG. PCRs were done on mouse lung cDNA in 6% Me2SO using Long Expand DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). The products were ligated (Rapid DNA ligation kit, Roche Diagnostics) into a modified pCEP-Pu vector carrying a 3′ FLAG and His6 tag. The ectodomain expression plasmid was generated by inserting the SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) signal peptide coding sequence (27Mason I.J. Taylor A. Williams J.G. Sage H. Hogan B.L. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) between the HindIII and NheI sites in pCEP-4 (provided by Ernst Poeschl) and then inserting the collagen XXIII ectodomain amplified from mouse lung cDNA. The sense primer was an NheI sequence linked to ACAGGCGGCCGCCCTGCATGGCC, and the antisense primer was an XhoI sequence linked to CTTATGCCAGCAACCAGGCACAGG. Cloned and expanded products were sequenced to verify their identities. Transfection experiments and protein purification were done as described previously (22Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The vectors containing the collagen XXIII cDNAs were introduced into HEK 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) by transfection with the reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were selected with puromycin (1.25 μg/ml), stably transfected HEK 293-EBNA cells were pseudo-subcloned, and the highest protein-producing clones were expanded. Use of Collagen XXIII Ectodomain for Antibody Production—Antibodies against mouse collagen XXIII were produced as described previously (28Veit G. Kobbe B. Keene D.R. Paulsson M. Koch M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3494-3504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly for large scale protein production, the ectodomain-transfected cells were transferred to serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with Glutamax™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with 250 μml-ascorbic acid and 450 μml-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. The collected cell culture supernatant was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and, after filtration, was passed over a gelatin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) before being applied to a TALON metal affinity resin column (BD Biosciences). The recombinant protein was eluted stepwise with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 40-250 mm imidazole. After dialysis against TBS the protein was used for immunization of two rabbits and two guinea pigs following standard procedures. The antisera collected from animals weeks later were purified by affinity chromatography on a column with antigen coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The specific antibodies were eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 11.5, and the eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Solid Phase Assay—The specificity of the antibodies against collagen XXIII was confirmed in solid phase assays. The ectodomains of collagens XIII and XXV and the unrelated His-tagged protein unc5h2 were expressed and purified using the same method as used for collagen XXIII ectodomain production described above. The purified proteins were diluted in TBS, pH 7.4, and 10 μg/ml (500 ng/well) were coated overnight at 4 °C onto 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorb). After washing with TBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% skim milk powder in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of the affinity-purified anti-collagen XXIII antibodies in blocking buffer (1:300-1:100,000) were added to wells and incubated for 1.5 h. Bound primary antibodies were detected with secondary antibody that was either swine antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (DakoCytomation) or rabbit anti-guinea pig horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (Sigma). For enzymatic reaction, 50 μl/well 0.25 mm tetramethylbenzidine and 0.005% (v/v) H2O2 in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0 were incubated for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl/well 2.5 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Labsystems Multiscan MS). For analysis, comparably treated wells, but without addition of primary antibody, were used to tare measurements from antibody-treated wells. Protein Isolation from Tissues and Western Blot Analyses—Tissues were dissected from adult C57BL/6J mice and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For extraction the tissues (200 mg/experiment) were thawed on ice and weighed, and 5 volumes (ml/g of wet tissue) of chilled extraction buffer (TBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science)) were added before homogenization using a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Kinematica). Insoluble material was subsequently removed by centrifugation. Western blots of tissue extracts gave high background; therefore, immunoprecipitation was done with antibody generated in one species (e.g. guinea pig) followed by Western blotting the immunoprecipitate and detecting it with antibody generated in the other species (e.g. rabbit). For immunoprecipitation, clarified tissue extracts were preincubated with 50 μl/ml gelatin-Sepharose resin for 1 h at 4°C to remove proteins that nonspecifically bind to Sepharose. The tissue extracts were then incubated overnight with 5 μg/ml polyclonal guinea pig anti-collagen XXIII ectodomain antibody covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose. Following the removal of unbound material, the immobilized antibody-antigen complexes were split, and one part was subjected to collagenase digestion (see below) whereas the other part was treated identically but without the addition of collagenase. Antibody-bound collagen XXIII was eluted from the Sepharose using the high pH elution method described above, and the eluates were concentrated in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant). After reduction the immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted on nitrocellulose membranes using standard procedures. The concentrated collagen XXIII was detected using the rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen XXIII ectodomain antibody followed by incubation with an horseradish peroxidase-coupled swine anti-rabbit IgG (DakoCytomation). Luminescence was visualized using the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Collagenase Digestion—To confirm the specific detection of collagen XXIII in extracts from tissue homogenates, the antibody-precipitated protein was subjected to collagenase digestion as described previously (29Koch M. Schulze J. Hansen U. Ashwodt T. Keene D.R. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22514-22521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The incubation with 100 units/ml highly purified bacterial collagenase (CLSPA, Worthington Biochemicals) was carried out in 250 μl of TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen OCT-embedded sections of embryonic mouse tissues preincubated in ice-cold methanol for 2 min, blocked for 1 h with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, and incubated with the guinea pig collagen XXIII primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by Cy™3-conjugated goat antiguinea pig IgG (DakoCytomation). Alexa 488-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as secondary antibody for costaining rabbit collagen XXIII polyclonal antibody or detecting laminin 5 polyclonal antibody. Stained sections were analyzed, and pictures were taken with a confocal laserscanning microscope (Leica TCS SL) using two lasers in parallel with the excitation wavelengths 488 nm for Alexa488 and 543 nm for Cy3. α1(XXIII) Collagen cDNAs—A BLAST search (18Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar) of the dbEST (19Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M. Tolstoshev C.M. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 332-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar) with triple helical sequences of FACIT collagens yielded a novel human EST clone (GenBank™ accession number W22262), which was purchased and sequenced. 5′-RACE extended the clone, and further data base searching revealed the 5′-end. The composite full-length human cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AY898961) encodes a unique collagen of 503 amino acid residues that strongly resembled type XIII collagen. It was assigned the next available number in the collagen family at the time, α1(XXIII). A BLAST search with the human sequence identified a mouse IMAGE clone (accession number AW323570), which was sequenced and extended by RACE. The mouse α1(XXIII) cDNA sequence encodes 533 amino acid residues and was deposited in GenBank™ under the accession number AF410792. Degenerate nucleotide primer pairs, designed from stretches of identical amino acids in mouse and human, were used to amplify a chick corneal cDNA, yielding an ∼100-bp product (15Gordon M.K. Gerecke D.R. Hahn R.A. Bhatt P. Goyal M. Koch M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: S752Google Scholar). BLAST searching of chicken ESTs yielded a partial Gallus cDNA (BU270831) (30Boardman P.E. Sanz-Ezquerro J. Overton I.M. Burt D.W. Bosch E. Fong W.T. Tickle C. Brown W.R. Wilson S.A. Hubbard S.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1965-1969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which was used to identify overlapping chicken genomic clones in the data base. The composite in silico derived cDNA was then amplified and sequenced from chick corneal mRNA, and the sequence was deposited in GenBank™ under accession number AY876377. The polypeptides encoded by the mouse, chick, and human cDNAs are shown in Fig. 1 along with the sequence of the rat (16Banyard J. Bao L. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20989-20994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cDNAs define three triple helical collagenous (Col) domains and four non-collagenous (NC) domains within the polypeptide numbered from the amino to the carboxyl end to make the designations consistent with the closest relatives in the collagen family (types XIII and XXV). The mouse and chick α1(XXIII) collagen NC1 domains are slightly shorter than the human 120-residue NC1 domain (Fig. 1). In all species, the amino termini do not have characteristics of signal peptides but instead have stretches of hydrophobic residues typical for membrane-spanning regions (31Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). The short amino-terminal cytoplasmic stretches of the orthologous molecules are quite different in length and amino acid composition. The Col 1 domain of mouse, rat, and the previously reported human (16Banyard J. Bao L. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20989-20994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) α1(XXIII) collagen is 189 amino acid residues in length. In all the mammalian cDNAs, the Col 1 domain contains one Gly-X-Y triplet in which the glycine is exchanged by a serine or asparagine. The chicken collagen XXIII lacks this triplet and thus has a perfect Gly-X-Y triplet structure in Col 1 domain. The newly obtained human cDNA encodes a 150-instead of a 189-amino acid residue Col 1 domain. This difference may reflect alternative splicing of collagen XXIII mRNA, a feature prevalent in the related collagen XIII mRNA (32Peltonen S. Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T.

https://openalex.org/W2072300370,"Gain-of-function mutants of Ras and Rho family small GTPases have proven to be important tools in analyzing signaling downstream of these small GTPases. The Ras-related GTPase Rheb has emerged as a key player downstream of TSC1–2 in activating signaling to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effectors of cell growth such as S6K and 4E-BP1. The TSC1–2 tumor suppressor complex has been shown to act as a RhebGAP, converting Rheb from a GTP-bound to a GDP-bound form. Here we report the identification of a mutant Rheb (S16HRheb) that exhibits gain-of-function properties. At endogenous levels of expression S16HRheb exhibits increased GTP loading in vivo and is resistant to TSC1–2 GAP in vitro. Compared with wild-type Rheb, S16HRheb is more active at promoting the phosphorylation of the mTOR effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Thus S16HRheb will help to identify proximal signaling events downstream of Rheb and allow potential Rheb-independent functions downstream of TSC1–2 to be investigated.

Harrington L.S. Lamb R.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Genetic screens in Drosophila have identified Rheb as a critical regulator of growth, and both genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that TSC1–2 inhibits Rheb and suppresses growth by acting as a RhebGAP (2.Patel P.H.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) and a so-called “asparagine thumb” involving Asn1643 of the TSC2 GAP domain, has been suggested to participate in GTP hydrolysis (6.Li Y. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7965-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), analogous to the regulation of Rap1 by RapGAP (7.Daumke O. Weyand M. Chakrabarti P.P. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 2004; 429: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, this residue is mutated in tuberous sclerosis complex (8.Maheshwar M.M. Cheadle J.P. Jones A.C. Myring J. Fryer A.E. Harris P.C. Sampson J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1991-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and renders TSC1–2 unable to regulate mTOR signaling to S6K1 (9.Jaeschke A. Hartkamp J. Saitoh M. Roworth W. Nobukuni T. Hodges A. Sampson J. Thomas G. Lamb R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although loss of function of Rheb is epistatic to TSC1–2 loss of function in Drosophila in regulation of growth (4.Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat P. Daram P. Breuer S. Thomas G. Hafen E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), it is unclear why loss of function of TSC1–2 promotes increased cell number in Drosophila (10.Tapon N. Ito N. Dickson B.J. Treisman J.E. Hariharan I.K. Cell. 2001; 105: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), while gain-of-function of Rheb by overexpression does not (4.Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat P. Daram P. Breuer S. Thomas G. Hafen E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). A possible explanation is that TSC1–2 has targets in addition to Rheb involved in regulating cell number. To help clarify this issue it will be necessary to compare phenotypes of TSC1–2 deficiency with that of Rheb rendered insensitive to TSC1–2 GAP. In K-Ras, gain-of-function mutations in codon 12 have been generated at endogenous levels in conditional mouse models resulting in tumor phenotypes analogous to human cancers in which mutation of these residues are found (11.Johnson L.

However, the functional consequences of similar mutations in Rheb are not known. Here we report the analysis of a Rheb mutant (S16HRheb) that exhibits gain-of-function properties similar to that of V12Ras in the activation of mTOR signaling to S6K and 4E-BP1. Plasmid Constructs—pRK5myc-Rheb and pGEX-4T2-Rheb constructs were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using Rheb-specific primers to clone Rheb from human brain cDNA (Clontech). Mutant Rhebs in pRK5myc or pGEX-4T2 were obtained using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pEGFPN1TSC1 has been described (13.Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); pCMV-FLAG-TSC1 and pCMV-TSC2, pCDNA3HA-4E-BP1, and pRK5S6K-GST were provided, respectively, by Dr. Julian Sampson, Dr. Nahum Sonenberg, and Dr. George Thomas. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoblotting—HEK293T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with S6K or 4E-BP1 reporter plasmids cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaOV, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.27 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For 4E-BP1 experiments blots were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde after transfer. Commercial antibodies were as follows: anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-phospho-Thr389-S6K, anti-HA, and anti-phospho-Ser65 4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-S6K1 monoclonal (Transduction Laboratories). Rabbit anti-human Rheb was generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-Rheb and affinity purified with GST-Rheb chemically cross-linked to glutathione-agarose. In Vivo Rheb Guanine Nucleotide Binding—HEK293T in 10-cm2 plates were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. Forty hours after transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h, and labeled with 0.1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences)/ml for 4 h. Cells harvested as described (14.Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C and lysates adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl prior to immunoprecipitation with 5 μg 9E10 anti-myc antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads for 2 h. Beads were washed and nucleotides eluted and resolved by TLC as described (14.Wolthuis R.M. de Ruiter N.D. Cool R.H. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). [32P]GTP and [32P]GDP levels were imaged and quantified on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro GAP Assays—5 × 106 HEK 293T cells were transfected with 20 μg each of pEGFPN1TSC1 and pCMV FLAG TSC2 or with empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were incubated for 44 h, the last 24 h being in serum-free medium and lysis and assays performed as described (5.Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotides were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). We reasoned that in organisms such as budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans lacking TSC1–2, but encoding orthologues of Rheb, there would be no selective pressure to maintain sensitivity to TSC1–2 GAP activity. Thus residues that are conserved in Rheb from species containing TSC1–2, but divergent in both S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, could potentially render Rheb sensitive to TSC1–2 action. By aligning protein sequences in ClustalW, we identified three residues (serines 16 and 89 and threonine 42 in human Rheb) that are conserved in organisms that contain TSC1–2 but have diverged in both S. cerevisiae and C. elegans (Fig. 1A). Our attention was drawn to one of these positions, Ser16, for two reasons. First, in Ras this position is equivalent to glycine at codon 13, a residue that is subject to oncogenic mutations that are thought to render Ras resistant to GAP-stimulated hydrolysis (15.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3748) Google Scholar). Second, this residue is immediately adjacent to arginine 15 (Arg15), a residue that, when mutated to glycine (R15G), has been reported to render Rheb more highly GTP loaded and partially resistant to TSC1–2 GAP activity in vivo (6.Li Y. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7965-7975Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A recent report using PCR-based mutagenesis and genetic screening has also identified three mutations in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rheb (equivalent to V17G, K120R, and N153S in human Rheb) that potentially exhibit gain-of-function properties (16.Urano J. Comiso M.J. Guo L. Aspuria P.J. Deniskin R. Tabancay Jr., A.P. Kato-Stankiewicz J. Tamanoi F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1074-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, whether analogous mutations increase the ability of mammalian Rheb to activate mTOR signaling is not known. As an initial screen for function and sensitivity to TSC1–2 action therefore we expressed wild-type or Rheb mutated at Arg15 (R15G), Ser16 (S16H and S16N), and Ser89 (S89D, S89N) as well as the equivalent mutations identified in S. pombe (N153S, V17G, K120R) as myc-tagged proteins alone or together with TSC1–2 along with an S6K-GST reporter in HEK293T cells. Overexpression of wild-type Rheb strongly stimulates the phosphorylation of S6K1 at T389, a residue required for S6 kinase activity (Fig. 1b). In the absence of overexpressed TSC1–2, S16H, S16N, and N153S activate S6K more potently than the other mutants or wild-type Rheb. When TSC1–2 is overexpressed we obtain similar results: S16H, S16N, and N153S all remain able to strongly activate S6K activation (S16H > S16N > N153S, see supplemental Fig. S1). However, both R15G and V17G are suppressed by TSC1–2 as strongly as wild-type Rheb, while K120R and both S89D and S89N show partial resistance to overexpressed TSC1–2. To confirm that the increased ability of S16HRheb to activate S6K1 T389 phosphorylation in the presence of TSC1–2 is due to the inability of TSC1–2 to stimulate GTP hydrolysis of this mutant, we examined the in vivo guanine nucleotide loading of wild-type and Rheb mutant proteins. Constructs encoding myc-tagged wild-type Rheb, R15G, S16H, and N153S were transfected alone or together with FLAG-tagged TSC1 and TSC2 into HEK293T cells, which were labeled with 32P, and Rheb proteins immunoprecipitated and bound guanine nucleotides analyzed. The results show that of the three mutants analyzed in the absence of overexpressed TSC1–2 S16HRheb exhibits the highest GTP loading (83% ± 4 for S16H compared with 64% ± 6 for wild-type Rheb, p < 0.02, n = 3). In the presence of TSC1–2 both R15GRheb and N153SRheb exhibit slightly reduced sensitivity to TSC1–2 compared with wild-type Rheb, while S16HRheb exhibits the least sensitivity to TSC1–2 (remaining 55 ± 3% GTP bound compared with 27 ± 5% for wild-type Rheb, Fig. 2, A and B, p < 0.005, n = 3). Consistent with failure of S16HRheb to be regulated by TSC1–2, when expressed at endogenous levels in serum-starved HEK293T cells, FLAG epitope-tagged S16HRheb exhibits a 2-fold increase in GTP loading compared with wild-type Rheb (see supplemental Fig. S2). At this level of expression it was not possible to analyze the bound guanine nucleotides of the N153S and R15G mutants as they immunoprecipitated poorly. To characterize further the S16H mutation we examined both binding and dissociation of guanine nucleotides. Surprisingly, although more highly GTP loaded in vivo than wild type, S16HRheb exhibits slightly reduced binding to both GDP and GTP and a slightly increased rate of dissociation of both nucleotides (see supplemental Fig. S3). To explore whether instead the mutation affects GTP hydrolysis, we performed in vitro GAP assays with recombinant GST-Rheb and GST-S16HRheb (Fig. 2C). Significantly, the hydrolysis of wild-type GST-Rheb, but not S16HRheb, is strongly stimulated by TSC1–2 GAP activity (wild-type Rheb remaining 2.2 ± 0.2% GTP bound; S16H Rheb 88.8 ± 0.8% GTP bound, Fig. 2, C–E). In addition, S16HRheb exhibits a small reduction in intrinsic GTP hydrolysis compared with wild-type Rheb (89.4 ± 0.4% GTP bound versus 79.8 ± 1.8%, p < 0.002, n = 3). Identical results are obtained using a charcoal-release assay in which the release of [32P]Pi is measured (see supplemental Fig. S4). Thus the S16H mutation confers resistance to TSC1–2 GAP activity in vitro. These results suggest that at endogenous levels S16HRheb may be insensitive to TSC1–2 and therefore behave as a gain-of-function mutant in activating mTOR signaling. To explore this possibility, we performed a titration experiment expressing myc-tagged wild-type or S16HRheb at different levels along with reporter plasmids for S6K1 (S6K1-GST) and 4E-BP1 (HA-4E-BP1) and determined the phosphorylations of S6K1-T389 and 4E-BP1 S65, both of which have been shown to be stimulated by TSC1–2 deficiency and Rheb overexpression (17.Garami A. Zwartkruis F.J. Nobukuni T. Joaquin M. Roccio M. Stocker H. Kozma S.C. Hafen E. Bos J.L. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1457-1466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 18.Tee A.R. Blenis J. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4763-4768Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results show that, when expressed at levels close to endogenous Rheb (around 8 ng of transfected plasmid), wild-type Rheb does not promote S6K1 reporter T389 phosphorylation in serum-starved HEK293T cells, while S16HRheb remains able to stimulate T389 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). For the 4E-BP1 reporter, wild-type Rheb poorly stimulates phosphorylation at Ser65 at the expression levels used (up to 250 ng of plasmid) compared with the S6K1 reporter. However, S16HRheb is still able to strongly promote phosphorylation at this level of expression and at an increased level compared with wild-type Rheb down to as low as 8 ng of plasmid of transfected plasmid (Fig. 3B). Thus when expressed at endogenous levels S16HRheb exhibits gain-of-function properties in promoting the phosphorylation of two downstream effectors of mTOR. The structures of Rheb complexed to GTP and GDP have recently been determined indicating a structural alteration of the switch 1 effector loop upon GTP binding (19.Yu Y. Li S. Xu X. Li Y. Guan K. Arnold E. Ding J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17093-17100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the structure of Rheb in the transition state of GTP hydrolysis when complexed to TSC1–2 is not known. Thus it is difficult to assess how the Ser16 → His substitution inhibits TSC1–2 action. However, in the structure of H-Ras complexed to GDP, AlF3 and GAP-334, a mimic of the transition state of Ras during GTP hydrolysis, it is clear that weak interactions occur between the Cα atom of Gly12 of Ras and the main chain CO of Arg789 of GAP. Thus it has been proposed that this mode of interaction renders most mutations at Gly12 resistant to GAP and therefore oncogenic (20.Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). It is plausible therefore that in the transition state of GTP hydrolysis interactions involving Ser16 of Rheb and N1643 of the TSC2 GAP limit the substitutions at Ser16 that permit efficient hydrolysis of GTP. Interestingly, substitution of Ser16 by glycine has reported not to affect Rheb GTP loading (21.Im E. von Lintig F.C. Chen J. Zhuang S. Qui W. Chowdhury S. Worley P.F. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6356-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that the bulky imidazole ring of histidine in this position may be critical in preventing TSC1–2 GAP action. Since S16HRheb activates mTOR signaling to S6K and 4E-BP1 when expressed at low levels, it may prove to be a useful tool in identifying effector mechanisms coupling Rheb.GTP to mTOR signaling and help to identify potential Rheb-independent functions of TSC1–2.

However, only limited information is available concerning tissue distribution and the biological role of FGF-4 in the brain. In situ hybridization analysis revealed localization of mouse Fgf-4 mRNA in the normal postnatal mouse hippocampus, subventricular zone (SVZ), and the rostral migratory stream where new neurons generate, migrate, and become incorporated into the functional circuitry of the brain. We also investigated whether FGF-4 could promote both proliferation and differentiation of the neural progenitor cells by using an in vitro neurosphere assay. The addition of recombinant FGF-4 generated large proliferative spheres that have a multipotent differentiation ability. Furthermore, recombinant FGF-4 significantly promotes neuronal differentiation in attached clonal neurosphere culture. These findings suggest that FGF-4 has an ability to promote neural stem cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the postnatal brain."
https://openalex.org/W1992061582,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors of the integrin family initiate changes in cell shape and motility by recruiting signaling components that coordinate these events. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is one such partner of beta1 integrins that participates in dynamic rearrangement of cell-matrix adhesions and cell spreading by mechanisms that are not well understood. To further elucidate the role of ILK in these events, we engineered a chimeric molecule comprising ILK fused to a membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (ILK-GFP-F). ILK-GFP-F is highly enriched in cell-matrix adhesions, and its expression in fibroblasts leads to an accumulation of focal adhesions (2-5 microm) and elongated adhesions (>5 microm). ILK-GFP-F enhances cell spreading on fibronectin and induces a constitutive increase in the levels of GTP-bound Rac-1. Conversely, ILK knock-down by siRNA transfection decreases active Rac-1. Endogenous ILK was found to associate with PKL (paxillin kinase linker) and the Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor betaPIX. Further, expression of a dominant negative betaPIX mutant reversed the increase in active Rac-1 levels of ILK-GFP-F-expressing cells, thus placing betaPIX in the pathway leading from ILK to Rac-1 activation. However, expression of constitutively active Rac only partially restores the spreading defects of ILK-depleted cells, suggesting that an additional ILK-dependent signal is required for cell spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2141301124,"Platelets release several mediators that modify vascular integrity and hemostasis. In the present study, we developed a technique for efficient transgene expression in platelets in vivo and examined whether this targeted-gene-product delivery system using a platelet release reaction could be exploited for clinical applications. Analysis of luciferase reporter gene constructs driven by platelet-specific promoters (the GPIIb, GPIbalpha, and GPVI) revealed that the GPIbalpha promoter was the most potent in the megakaryoblastic cell line UT-7/TPO and human CD34+-derived megakaryocytes. Transduction of UT-7/TPO; CD34+-derived megakaryocytes; and c-Kit+, ScaI+, and Lineage- (KSL) murine hematopoietic stem cells with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based lentiviral vector carrying eGFP resulted in efficient, dose-dependent expression of eGFP, and the GPIbalpha promoter seemed to bestow megakaryocytic-specific expression. Transplantation of KSL cells transduced with SIV vector containing eGFP into mice showed that there was preferable expression of eGFP in platelets driven by the GPIbalpha promoter [7-11% for the cytomeglovirus (CMV) promoter, 16-27% for the GPIbalpha promoter]. Furthermore, transplantation of ex vivo-transduced KSL cells by SIV vector carrying human factorVIII (hFVIII) driven by the GPIbalpha promoter induced the production of detectable transcripts of the hFVIII gene and the hFVIII antigen in bone marrow and spleen for at least 90 days and partially corrected the hemophilia A phenotype. Platelet-targeting gene therapy using SIV vectors appears to be promising for gene therapy approaches toward not only inherited platelet diseases but also other hemorrhagic disorders such as hemophilia A."

Mechanisms for control of the early period of differentiation, involving exit from the pluripotent state and lineage commitment, are not well understood. An emerging concept is that epigenetic histone modifications may play a role during this early period. We have found that upon differentiation of mouse ES cells by removal of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor, there is a global increase in coupled histone H3 phosphorylation (Ser-10)-acetylation (Lys-14) (H3 phosphoacetylation).

This ability to form different cell types under appropriate conditions makes them a powerful tool in the study of biological mechanisms and treatment of disease. Mouse ES cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the developing blastocyst (1Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4355) Google Scholar). In vivo, the inner cell mass becomes organized into a pluripotent epithelial layer, the epiblast, from which embryonic tissues are derived (2Gardner R.L. Beddington R.S. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1988; 10: 11-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, mouse ES cells can be maintained in an undifferentiated state with the addition of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to culture media. LIF primarily acts via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to maintain pluripotency (3Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Self-renewal also is enhanced by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (4Burdon T. Smith A. Savatier P. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 432-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of LIF results in spontaneous differentiation of the ES cells into all three lineages, which is marked by changes in gene expression and cell morphology (see Fig. 1A). Although much focus has been placed on factors involved in self-renewal, the mechanisms regulating exit from the pluripotent state followed by commitment to specific lineages remain largely unknown. An emerging concept is that alterations in epigenetic histone modifications may be important during this timeframe (5Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). The nucleosome, with DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), forms the basic building blocks of chromatin. Histone tails are subject to numerous covalent modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (6Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). The various modifications of specific residues of the histone tail have led to the hypothesis of a histone code that functions to regulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcriptional machinery. The different modifications may either permit or repress transcription by serving as recruitment marks for transcription complexes. Epigenetic modifications usually associated with transcriptional competence include acetylation at lysines 9 and 14 on histone H3. These acetylated residues can occur in conjunction with phosphorylation of serine 10 on histone H3, producing H3 phosphoacetylation (7Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Histone H3 is found to be rapidly and transiently phosphorylated upon stimulation with various growth factors or protein synthesis inhibitors. This effect has been termed the nucleosomal response (8Mahadevan L.C. Willis A.C. Barratt M.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This response is frequently limited to localized nucleosomes and does not necessarily spread widely over an active gene, although only limited loci have been examined to date. A common thread among the diverse stimulators of the nucleosomal response is the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 or p38 branches of the MAPK pathway (9Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A point of convergence between ERK1/2 and p38 is the activation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 and 2 (MSK1/2), which have been found to be the primary histone kinases for the nucleosomal response (10Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This contrasts with genome-wide H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10 that occurs during mitosis and is carried out by the Aurora kinase family (11Crosio C. Fimia G.M. Loury R. Kimura M. Okano Y. Zhou H. Sen S. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). We study global histone modifications in early ES cell differentiation to understand how chromatin may be regulating differentiation. We report here that there is an increase in H3 phosphoacetylation during early ES cell differentiation induced by withdrawal of LIF for 3 days. We have defined the time period needed for exit from the undifferentiated state and commitment to a new differentiation status to occur as 24-36 h after LIF withdrawal. 3E. R. Lee, K. W. McCool, F. E. Murdoch, and M. K. Fritsch, unpublished results. This differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation gradually increases during this important period of pluripotent exit from the undifferentiated state and beginning lineage commitment. This increase in H3 phosphoacetylation also serves as a link to upstream signaling activity in the cells. The ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are activated during this early differentiation time period and are responsible for the increased H3 phosphoacetylation. We show that these pathways converge to activate MSK1, which serves as the critical mediator of differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation. Inhibition of these processes alters ES cell differentiation as assayed by changes in the pattern of gene expression, showing that dynamic changes in epigenetic histone modifications and cell signaling pathways are an important regulatory mechanism in early ES cell differentiation. Cell Culture—CCE mES cells were used for all studies and were obtained from Dr. John Gearhart (Johns Hopkins University) with permission from Dr. Gordon Keller (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Plastic tissue culture dishes were pretreated with 0.1% porcine gelatin Type A (Sigma) in water for 30 min at 37 °C. Undifferentiated mES cells were grown at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing high glucose, phenol red, and glutamine and supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (mES qualified from Invitrogen), 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (pH to 7.4), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.15 mm monothioglycerol (ICN Biomedicals Inc.), and 1800 units/ml LIF (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Cells were passaged every 3 days at 1:100 and maintained at low cell density. Cells were induced to differentiate by removal of LIF from the media (all other components were unchanged). Addition of chemical inhibitors in the appropriate experiment took place when LIF was first withdrawn from media. H89 (suspended in 1:1 H2O:EtOH) was from Sigma. PD98059 (suspended in Me2SO) and SB203580 (suspended in H2O) were from Calbiochem.

Briefly, cells were scraped from plates and centrifuged at 220 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCL, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF). Sulfuric acid was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m, and the mixture was placed on ice for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the acid-soluble supernatant was kept. Trichloroacetic acid was added to the acid-soluble supernatant to a final concentration of 20%. The mixture was slowly rotated at 4 °C for 30 min to precipitate samples. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min 4 °C, and pellets were washed once with acidic acetone (containing 0.1% HCl) and once with pure acetone. Pellets were dissolved in H2O.

Membranes were washed and appropriate horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)-conjugated secondary antibody was added for 45 min at room temperature. ECL developing reagent mix (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and blots were exposed to film. Image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain Image program (developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Flow cytometry protocols were adapted from Hasegawa et al. (13Hasegawa Y. Tomita K. Watanabe M. Yamasaki A. Sano H. Hitsuda Y. Shimizu E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cells were washed in wash solution (containing 1× PBS with 50 mm NaF and 100 nm okadaic acid). Cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 100 × g. Cells were resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, and 2 ml of 2% paraformaldehyde was slowly added dropwise. Cells were placed on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, then resuspended in 1× PBS, and methanol was added to 90% final concentration dropwise at 4 °C while gently vortexing. Cells were stored on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. One milliliter of incubation buffer (containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS) was added, and cells were incubated on ice for 10 min. 1:100 pS10-aK14 H3 antibody was added, and cells were kept at room temperature for 60 min. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g and washed three times in incubation buffer. Alexa 488 fluorescein isothiocyanate chicken anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) antibody was diluted 1:100 in incubation buffer and added to samples for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g and washed three times in incubation buffer. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS with 33 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) and 20 μg/ml RNase (molecular biology grade, Sigma) and stored at 4 °C overnight. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) cytometer. Data were analyzed using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Modfit (Verity Software House) software.

Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on coverslips (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and washed with 1× PBS. Cells were fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde dissolved in H2O at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were washed with 1× PBS then twice with wash solution I (1× PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 4 min each. Incubation solution (3% goat serum in 1× PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) was added for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody (1:100) in incubation solution was added for 120 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with wash solution I for 3 min each. 1:1000 Alexa 488 fluorescein isothiocyanate chicken anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody in incubation solution was added for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in 1× PBS and stained with 1:50,000 DAPI for 3 min. Coverslips were mounted (Fluoromount G SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) on a glass slide and examined under a microscope with a 400× objective. Cell Staining—Cells were stained with HEMA 3 hematological staining solution (Fisher Scientific). The product protocol was followed, and cells were examined under a microscope with a 400× objective. RNA Preparation—Lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added to cells and sheared using Qiagen Qiashredder columns. Samples were then purified using a Qiagen RNeasy mini-kit, following the manufacturer's instructions, including a DNase digestion step. RNA was dissolved in RNase free water and stored at -80 °C. Quantitative RT-PCR—cDNA was synthesized using 1.25 μg of RNA with avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT) enzyme and random hexamers (Promega). An iCycler system (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitative analysis. Real-time PCR was performed using a SYBR Green supermix kit (Bio-Rad). The level of each gene transcript was normalized to β-actin expression levels. All primers showed 90-100% efficiency. Expression was calculated as 2[Ct(gene of interest control treatment - gene of interest experimental treatment)]/2[Ct(β-actin control treatment - β-actin experimental treatment)] (14Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). Primers used included (from 5′ to 3′): nestin F: GCAGGGTCTACAGAGTCAG, R: GCAAGCGAGAGTTCTCAG; oct4 F: CCACCATCTGTCGCTTCG, R: GCTTCCTCCACCCACTTCTC; hoxb1 F: CTATGGAGCGGGTGGAGTC, R: CAGAGAGGAGGTCGTAGG; progesterone receptor F: CTACCCGCCATACCTTAAC, R: CGCCATAGTGACAGCCAGATG; brachyury F: CACACCACTGACGCACACG, R: ACGAGGCTATGAGGAGGCTTTG; FGF5 F: ACAAGAGAGGGAAAGCCAAGAG, R: GAACAGTGACGGTGAAGGAAAG; BMP4 F: GGTGTGGATGCCGCTGAG, R: GTATGTGTAGGTGGTTGAATGG; and β-actin F: GCCAACCGTGAAAAGATGACC, R: GCGTGAGGGAGAGCATAGC. Small Interfering RNAs and Transfection—MSK1 small interfering (si)RNAs (SMARTpool) were obtained from Dharmacon Research, Inc Lafayette, CO. The SMARTpool was prepared as recommended by the manufacturer at 20 μm. Transfection complexes were prepared in Opti-Mem (Invitrogen). ES cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 nm of the siRNA mix with Lipofectamine 2000 at a ratio of 2:1 in a protocol adapted from Hay et al. (15Hay D.C. Sutherland L. Clark J. Burdon T. Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in +LIF media 24 h prior to transfection. The first transfection was for 16 h in -LIF media. Fresh -LIF media was then added. The second transfection was for 12 h at time 64 h of culture. Cells were harvested at 96 h of culture time (total 72 h in -LIF media). Mock treatments contained either BLOCK-iT fluorescent oligonucleotide (Invitrogen) or no siRNA with no differences noted between the two mock treatments. H3 Phosphoacetylation Increases during Early ES Cell Differentiation—We analyzed global changes in H3 phosphoacetylation during early ES cell differentiation to determine if this epigenetic mark may be playing a role during this early period. This early differentiation period was assessed with plated ES cells. ES cells are maintained in a pluripotent state by including LIF in the culture media. Withdrawal of LIF produces characteristic changes in gene expression and morphology (Fig. 1A) (16Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L. Weinberg A.L. Greco T.L. Xu X. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 311: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Gene expression of the differentiation markers hoxb1 (patterning), FGF5 (primitive ectoderm), and progesterone receptor increases early during this time period (16Sauter C.N. McDermid R.L.

Biol. 1990; 138: 454-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Lineage-specific markers such as brachyury (mesoderm) and nestin (neuroectoderm) begin to be expressed at about 3 days following LIF withdrawal (19Smith J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 154-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20Dahlstrand J. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D. Lendahl U. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 589-597PubMed Google Scholar). The pluripotent marker oct4 and the differentiation inducer BMP4 show decreased expression levels during this time, although oct4 levels drop very slowly during the first 3 days following LIF withdrawal (21Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 22Varga A.C. Wrana J.L. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5713-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cells in the pluripotent state form tight spherical clusters, whereas differentiating cells begin to spread out and have distinct cell borders. Analysis of H3 phosphoacetylation was performed by immunoblotting analysis of acid-extracted histones with an antibody against histone H3 dually phosphorylated at serine 10 and acetylated at lysine 14 (pS10-aK14) (7Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). An antibody to total histone H3 was used as a loading control. This shows that global H3 phosphoacetylation gradually increased during this early differentiation period peaking with a 3-fold increase after 3 days of LIF withdrawal (Fig. 1B). This increase in H3 phosphoacetylation occurs over a period of days, and we have termed this “differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation.” A possible mechanism for this increase in H3 phosphoacetylation is through activation of MSK1. MSK1 phosphorylates chromatin proteins histone H3 and HMGN1, as well as transcription factors such as CREB (9Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific for the active phosphorylated forms of these proteins showed that HMGN1 and CREB also are gradually phosphorylated during early ES cell differentiation (Fig. 1C). Non-phospho-HMGN1 and actin were used as loading controls for p-HMGN1 and p-CREB, respectively. Phosphorylation of these three separate targets points to activation of MSK1 during early ES cell differentiation. Differentiation-induced H3 Phosphoacetylation Is Not Associated with Cell-Cycle Changes—To distinguish between mitosis-induced phosphorylation of Ser-10 on histone H3 and differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation, we have used fluorescence-activated cell staining analysis. Studies of stimulus-induced H3 phosphoacetylation, mediated by MSK1/2, normally occur in cells that have been serum-starved to enter the quiescent G0 phase of the cell cycle. This allows separation from mitotic H3 phosphorylation, usually mediated by the Aurora kinases. However, ES cells lack the normal cell-cycle checkpoint control of other cells and do not enter G0 (23Schratt G. Weinhold B. Lundberg A.S. Schuck S. Berger J. Schwarz H. Weinberg R.A. Ruther U. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Attempts at serum starvation also perturb the delicate balance of factors needed to maintain pluripotency. The ES cells used in this study are rapidly dividing, doubling roughly every 12 h. Previous studies (24Zandstra P.W. Le H.V. Daley G.Q. Griffith L.G. Lauffenburger D.A. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2000; 69: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)3 have indicated that withdrawal of LIF does not alter the cell cycle or cell proliferation. To confirm this in our model system we used a propidium iodide DNA stain and analyzed cell-cycle distribution. This shows that there is no difference in the cell cycle between +LIF ES cells and ES cells withdrawn from LIF for 3 days (Fig. 2A). Around 60% of the cells grown in either + or - LIF media are in the S phase of the cell cycle. To further examine distribution of H3 phosphoacetylation during the cell cycle, we stained cells with both the anti-pS10-aK14 antibody and propidium iodide. This allows examination of H3 phosphoacetylation by phase of the cell cycle, by gating different H3 phosphoacetylation populations. Consistent gates were drawn around G1/S and G2/M phase populations. There is a strong increase in H3 phosphoacetylation in G1/S phase (Fig. 2B) indicating that the increase in H3 phosphoacetylation is a stimulus-induced response. Smaller increases are also observed in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, LIF-withdrawn cells (-LIF 3 days) also exhibit an increase in a punctate H3 phosphoacetylation nuclear staining pattern using immunofluorescent staining with the anti-pS10-aK14 antibody and the nuclear stain DAPI (Fig. 2C, bottom panel) compared with +LIF cells (Fig. 2C, top panel). This pattern is consistent with localized changes in H3 phosphoacetylation during differentiation and is in contrast to extensive H3 phosphoacetylation observed in mitotic figures approximately in equal numbers for + and - LIF-treated cells (data not shown). These results indicate that localized H3 phosphoacetylation increases in both G1/S and G2/M phase ES cells during early differentiation but with a much larger increase seen in the G1/S phase. MAPK Pathways Are Activated during Early ES Cell Differentiation—We next analyzed the activation of upstream cell signaling pathways to determine how differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation occurs. We focused on activation of the ERK and p38 branches of the MAPK pathways. Each pathway has been shown to be responsible for mitogen-induced H3 phosphoacetylation, depending on the stimulus. Activation of these pathways was assayed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies to the active form of either ERK1/2 or p38. Antibodies against total ERK1/2 or p38 antibodies were used as loading controls for total kinase present (Fig. 3A). This analysis showed that active ERK1/2 is gradually increased during early ES cell differentiation, peaking at 3 days of LIF withdrawal in a pattern similar to H3 phosphoacetylation. Activated p38 also increased during early differentiation, but showed a sudden increase at 3 days of LIF withdrawal. Activation of these kinases was also observed in immunofluorescent staining of +/- LIF-treated ES cells with phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 3B). Nuclear staining was performed using DAPI. This showed that there was an increase in phospho-ERK nuclear distribution in LIF withdrawal-induced differentiation (Fig. 3B, lower left panels). Phospho-p38 also increased following LIF withdrawal, but had a more diffuse increase, including both nuclear and cytoplasmic distributions (Fig. 3B, lower right panels). These results show activation of upstream MAPK signaling pathways during early ES cell differentiation. Chemical Inhibition of MAPK Pathways Blocks H3 Phosphoacetylation and Inhibits Early ES Cell Differentiation during LIF Withdrawal—We used MAPK chemical inhibitors to block ERK1/2 and p38 pathways and determine if these signaling pathways are responsible for differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation. H3 phosphoacetylation was again observed using immunoblotting of acid-extracted histones with the pS10-aK14 antibody. Our results indicated differentiation-induced H3 phosphoacetylation was significantly decreased in the presence of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) in ES cells withdrawn from LIF for 3 days (Fig. 4A, +PD) (25Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). Any remaining H3 phosphoacetylation was completely abolished when the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) was added in conjunction with PD98059 in LIF withdrawn cells (Fig. 4A, +PD+SB) (26Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). SB203580 alone causes only a small decrease in phosphoacetylation (Fig. 4A, +SB). These kinase inhibitors also had effects on cell morphology during differentiation (Fig. 4B). Using PD98059 alone or in combination with SB203580 produced ball-like clusters of cells even after 3 days of LIF withdrawal (Fig. 4B, -LIF 3d +PD98059 and -LIF 3d +PD+SB), consistent with the morphology of the undifferentiated state (Fig. 4B, +LIF). This appearance contrasted sharply with the branched cell pattern normally observed in ES cells after 3 days of LIF withdrawal alone (Fig. 4B, -LIF 3d). Treatment with SB alone during 3 days of LIF withdrawal (Fig. 4B, -LIF 3d +SB203580) did not alter morphology significantly compared with LIF withdrawal alone. Neither compound had an effect on morphology when treatment occurred in the presence of LIF for 3 days (Fig. 4B, top panels). We used quantitative RT-PCR to analyze expression of differentiation markers in LIF withdrawn cells with and without kinase inhibitors present. Expression of the early differentiation marker hoxb1 was reduced when the ERK or p38 pathways were inhibited ("
https://openalex.org/W2017070690,"Previously we reported that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonist thrombin potentiated the mitogenic effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on human airway smooth muscle (ASM) by promoting sustained late-phase activation of PI3K and p70S6K via a pathway dependent on Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Here, we provide additional mechanistic insight and reveal the robustness of this phenomenon by demonstrating that H1 histamine and thromboxane receptors utilize the same mechanism to augment ASM growth via specific activation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq/11.

The most effective systemic treatment for advanced prostate carcinoma is androgen ablation, which eliminates androgen-dependent prostate epithelial cells by inducing apoptosis (1Denis L. Murphy G.P.

However, this treatment rarely cures patients because prostate cancer cells can engage antiapoptotic mechanisms that allow them to survive without androgen. Therefore, resistance to apoptosis has been connected to prostate cancer progression (3Tang D.G. Porter A.T. Prostate. 1997; 32: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Denmeade S.R.

Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The constitutive activation of PI3K signaling due to the loss of the lipid phosphatase PTEN has been observed in various cancers, including advanced prostate cancer (10Majumder P.K. Sellers W.R.

Akt1 has been identified as the most prominent kinase downstream of PI3K. It inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD; transcription factors of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, YAP, and FOXO families; and by affecting glucose metabolism (12Thompson J.E.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2713-2719PubMed Google Scholar). For example, EGF and heregulin protect prostate cancer cells from apoptosis in the presence of PI3K inhibitors that block Akt activity (21Carson J.P. Kulik G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1449-1453PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of receptor tyrosine kinases of HER family, HER1/EGFR and HER2/neu, has been documented in prostate epithelial cells and prostate tumors. Increased levels of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor-α has been observed in advanced prostate cancer (22Hernes E. Fossa S.D. Berner A. Otnes B. Nesland J.M. Br. J.

Another signaling mechanism that can regulate apoptosis is activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCR agonists, such as endothelin-1, bombesin, calcitonin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), have been shown to support androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells (26Nelson J.B.

Chiloeches A. Prieto J.C. Carmena M.J. Prostate. 2005; 63: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to examine antiapoptotic mechanisms activated by PI3K, EGF, and VIP and determine whether they utilize common or separate signaling pathways. In this paper, we report that VIP protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis by phosphorylating BAD via a PKA-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we found that PI3K, EGF, and VIP activate redundant, mutually independent signaling pathways that induce phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD. Knocking down BAD expression by shRNA substantially decreases sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis, whereas expression of BAD with mutations in phosphorylation sites induces apoptosis that cannot be inhibited by antiapoptotic signals. Taken together, these results identify BAD as a convergence point of several antiapoptotic signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells. Cell Lines—The prostate cancer LNCaP and C4-2 cells were a gift from Dr. Leland Chung (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). C4-2LN17Ras cells were obtained by transfecting C4-2 cells with pGL4 mixed with Tet-on and pTRE2hygN17Ras cDNA. To obtain control C4-2L cells, empty pTRE2hyg vector was used instead of pTRE2hygN17Ras. Cells were selected in G418 and hygromycin antibiotics. The clone used in this paper expresses a sufficient amount of N17Ras to inhibit ERK activation by EGF without doxycycline induction. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Antibodies were from the following sources. BAD, phospho-specific BAD (Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155), phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), and phospho-GSK3α (Ser21) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); phospho-MEK1 (Ser298) antibodies were a gift from Andrew Catling (Louisiana State University, New Orleans, LA); anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma; secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies used for Western blots were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein G-agarose beads, DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, VIP, and rapamycin were from Calbiochem. Recombinant EGF was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Scramble and Akt-siRNA were from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog numbers 6201 and 6211). All other chemicals and reagents (unless specified) were purchased from Sigma. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Gibco. Plasmid and DNA Constructs—pcDNA3-HA-BAD, pcDNA3-HA-BADS112A, and pcDNA3-HA-BADS112/136A constructs were from Michael Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA); pRK5-Myc-PAK1(K299R) and pCMV-HA-MEK1 were from Andrew Catling. EGFP was from Clontech. PKI-GFP was from Dr. Raymond Penn (Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC). Dominant negative Akt (AAA-Akt) and constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) were from Dr. Dario Alessi (University of Dundee, Scotland). The UBC-GFPluc construct that expresses luciferase fused to green fluorescent protein under the ubiquitin promoter was a gift form Dr. Purnima Dubey (Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC). Cell Culture and Transfection—LNCaP and C4-2 cells were plated in 10-cm plates and maintained in T-medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. All cells were kept in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed at 60–70% confluence using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The following amounts of DNA were used per 10-cm plate: 0.6 μg of EGFP, 0.5 μg of BAD, 1 μg of Bcl-XL, and 4 μg of DN-N17Ras, PKI-GFP, DN-PAK1, AAA-Akt, or Myr-Akt expression constructs. siRNA Experiments—For Akt-siRNA experiments, cells were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of HA-BAD, 0.4 μg of Bcl-XL, and 50 nm Akt-siRNA or scramble siRNA using Metafectene transfection reagent (Biontex, Germany). For the first 24 h after transfection, cells were maintained in serum-supplemented medium and under serum-starved conditions for the following 48 h. Then cells were lysed and probed for Akt and BAD phosphorylation. For shRNA BAD knockdown experiments, a lentiviral vector (pLL3.7) was used with an shRNA insert of annealed oligonucleotides. The BAD DNA target sequences used were 5′-TGAAGGGACTTCCTCGCCCGT-3′ and 5′-GGCTTGGTCCCATCGGAAG-3′. HEK 293 cells were transfected with pLL3.7 vector containing either of these sequences or a scrambled sequence 5′-GGTACGGTCAGGCAGCTTCT-3′ in combination with packaging vectors (VSVG, RSV-REV, and pMDL g/p RRE). After 48 h, supernatants were collected from these cells and used to infect LNCaP or C4-2 cells. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were plated for subsequent experiments. Immunoprecipitation—Twenty hours after transfection with BAD expression constructs, cells were deprived of serum for 3 h, and different treatments were given at this point as described in the figure legends. Cells were harvested in a cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were incubated with 6–8 μg of anti-HA antibodies (12CA5) overnight at 4 °C and protein G-agarose beads for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with an SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis was induced as follows. Cells were serum-starved overnight (16 h) and treated with 50 μm LY294002 and 1 μm thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase. Thapsigargin alone does not induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells within 24 h (39Wertz I.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11470-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Tombal B. Weeraratna A.T. Denmeade S.R. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 2000; 43: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but in the experimental conditions that we used it synchronized caspase activation in cells treated with LY294002. This protocol shortened the time and increased the reproducibility of caspase assays and also permitted analysis of apoptosis by time lapse video recording. Apoptosis in whole cell populations was quantified by measuring caspase-3 activity with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (Bachem) as specified by the manufacturer. For these experiments, attached and floating cells were collected and lysed in caspase lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Fluorescence was recorded each 15 min for 1 h, and caspase activity was expressed in arbitrary units. Apoptosis in a population of transiently transfected GFP-positive cells was measured by time lapse video recording followed by counting the percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology (assessed as cytoplasmic blebbing and fragmentation). Apoptosis was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence with antibodies that recognize active caspase 3. For these experiments, cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected by Lipofectamine with a mixture of cDNA that included GFP in a 1:9 ratio. At least four randomly chosen fields (containing on average 200–300 cells for each treatment) were recorded. Video recording was performed on an Axiovert100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a moving stage and climate control chamber (37 °C, 5% CO2) and controlled by Openlab software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). The results reported herein were confirmed by at least two independent experiments. Luciferase Assays—Cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg/ml HA-BADwt or HA-BADS112A or HA-BAD S112/136A (BAD2SA) and 0.1 μg/ml of luciferase expressing vector UBC-GFPluc. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and treated with 20 μm LY294002 and 3 μg/ml cycloheximide to prevent changes in expression of transfected proteins by growth factors. Ten minutes later, cells were treated with either 5 nm EGF or 100 nm VIP. Six hours later, cells were washed with PBS three times and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured on a microplate luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions using a kit from Promega (catalog number E1500). BAD Phosphorylation in Mouse Prostate—C57BL/6 male mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine mixture, the abdomen was opened, and both lobes of anterior prostates were injected in three locations with 10 μl of saline alone or with 10 nm EGF or with 100 nm VIP. The abdomen was then closed with a metal clip. Twenty minutes later, the anesthetized mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the anterior prostates were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Prostates were lysed, and phosphorylation of endogenous BAD was analyzed by immunoblotting. PI3K, EGF, and VIP Protect Cells from Apoptosis and Induce BAD Phosphorylation—PI3K signaling is constitutively up-regulated in LNCaP prostate cancer cells due to a frameshift mutation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN (41Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4285) Google Scholar). As a result, these cells can survive in serum-free medium in the absence of trophic factors. Recently, we have shown that inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 in LNCaP cells induces apoptosis, characterized by release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, activation of caspases 3 and 7, and fragmentation of the nucleus and cytoplasm. We also have demonstrated that treatment with EGF can protect LNCaP cells by inhibiting proapoptotic signaling upstream of mitochondria independent of PI3K activity and new protein synthesis (20Kulik G. Carson J.P. Vomastek T. Overman K. Gooch B.D. Srinivasula S. Alnemri E. Nunez G. Weber M.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2713-2719PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether PI3K-independent survival can be induced by other extracellular ligands, we examined the effects of VIP on apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Analysis of caspase activity showed that in the presence of LY294002, VIP provided protection from apoptosis comparable with that obtained with EGF (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when apoptosis was measured by time lapse video recording that permits dynamic documentation of apoptosis in individual cells (Fig. 1B). Previously, BAD, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, has been identified as a target of the PI3K/Akt antiapoptotic signaling pathway (42Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 43del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and Ser136 facilitates BAD association with 14-3-3 proteins and inhibits apoptosis (44Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). We examined the status of BAD phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells treated with LY294002 alone and in combination with EGF and VIP. In LNCaP cells maintained in serum-free medium, phosphorylation of endogenous BAD was recognized with phospho-Ser112-specific antibodies. Upon treatment with LY294002, BAD became dephosphorylated; however, treatment with either EGF or VIP restored BAD phosphorylation in the absence of Akt activation (Fig. 1C). Similar effects of EGF and VIP on BAD phosphorylation and protection from apoptosis were observed in C4-2 prostate cancer cells, which exhibit more aggressive tumor growth in vivo (not shown). Furthermore, BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 was observed in mouse prostate glands injected with EGF and VIP (Fig. 1D). The latter result demonstrates that the ability of EGF and VIP to induce phosphorylation of BAD was not limited to prostate cancer cell lines maintained in tissue culture but also occurred in the context of the intact prostate gland. In addition to Ser112, BAD can be phosphorylated at Ser136 and Ser155. Because phosphospecific antibodies against Ser136 and Ser155 are not sensitive enough to detect phosphorylation of endogenous BAD, analysis of BAD phosphorylation at these sites was performed on immunprecipitates of HA-BAD ectopically expressed in LNCaP cells. In cells growing in serum-free conditions, HA-BAD was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser112 and also at Ser136 and Ser155. Treatment with LY924002 resulted in dephosphorylation of Ser112 and Ser136 within 2 h but did not reduce Ser155 phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 1). VIP induced only Ser112 phosphorylation, whereas EGF restored BAD phosphorylation at both Ser112 and Ser136 (Fig. 1E). Thus, the antiapoptotic effects of PI3K, EGF, and VIP correlate with BAD phosphorylation status. BAD Phosphorylation Is Necessary for Cell Survival Mediated by PI3K, VIP, and EGF—To examine the role of BAD in apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, we engineered lentiviral vectors that express BAD-specific shRNA or scrambled shRNA. Infection with lentivirus that expresses BAD shRNA dramatically reduced expression of endogenous BAD (Fig. 2A). Time lapse video recording demonstrated reduced apoptosis in LNCaP and C4-2 cells where BAD expression is knocked down (Fig. 2B). Thus, BAD expression is required for apoptosis induction in prostate cancer cells. To address the role of BAD phosphorylation in antiapoptotic signaling, we tested the survival effects of EGF and VIP in cells that express BAD with mutated phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3A). LNCaP cells were transfected with either wild type BAD (BADwt), BADS112A (where serine 112 is replaced with alanine), or BAD2SA (where both Ser112 and Ser136 are mutated). Cell survival was judged by measuring luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with luciferase expression vector and BAD constructs. A similar method utilizing a β-galactosidase reporter construct has been previously used to examine survival in cells that transiently express BAD with mutations in phosphorylation sites (45Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Both EGF and VIP were able to restore survival in LY294002-treated cells that express BADwt. However, in cells that express BADS112A, the survival effect of VIP was diminished, whereas EGF still showed a strong survival effect. In cells transfected with BAD2SA, survival was lower even without LY294002 treatment than in LY294002-treated cells transfected with the other BAD constructs. Neither VIP nor EGF increased survival in cells transfected with BAD2SA. However, co-transfection of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL with BAD2SA restored survival, which is consistent with the idea that BAD2SA induces apoptosis (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 is necessary for VIP-mediated survival, whereas both Ser112 and Ser136 have to be mutated to inhibit the survival effects of PI3K and EGF. To further corroborate the results of this experiment, we measured apoptosis in cells co-transfected with BAD constructs and GFP by time lapse video microscopy. Expression of BADwt and BADS112A was achieved at similar levels and was well tolerated by LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 induced apoptosis in cells that expressed BAD constructs. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3A, VIP reduced apoptosis in cells that express BADwt but not in cells that express BADS112A, whereas EGF was able to decrease apoptosis in both BADwt and BADS112A-expressing cells (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 is important for the antiapoptotic effects of VIP, whereas it is less so for EGF- or PI3K-induced survival. Apparently, phosphorylation at Ser136 in cells with active PI3K signaling and in cells treated with EGF (Fig. 1E) can compensate for the lack of Ser112 phosphorylation. Indeed, mutant BADS112A was phosphorylated at Ser136 in intact cells with active PI3K signaling. Treatment with LY294002 reduced Ser136 phosphorylation, whereas EGF restored BAD phosphorylation to the level observed in untreated cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast to BADwt and BADS112A constructs, we were unable to express the BAD2SA construct even in cells treated with EGF or VIP. Apparently, even a small amount of BAD2SA expression was sufficient to trigger apoptosis in LNCaP cells that cannot be inhibited by PI3K, EGF, or VIP. In agreement with this idea, BAD2SA expression can be detected in cells co-transfected with antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL (Fig. 3E). Taken together, our experiments with BAD knock-out by shRNA and ectopic expression of phosphorylation-deficient BAD mutants indicate that BAD phosphorylation is critical for the antiapoptotic effects of EGF, VIP, and PI3K. Dominant Negative N17Ras Specifically Blocks EGF-induced Survival and BAD Phosphorylation—Our subsequent efforts were focused on the analysis of signaling pathways induced by PI3K, EGF, and VIP that lead to BAD phosphorylation and protection of cells from apoptosis. Ras plays an important role in signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases, GPCRs, and PI3K (46Downward J. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: e9-e10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ras activation can potentially contribute to the antiapoptotic effects of PI3K, EGF, and VIP. The role of Ras in BAD phosphorylation was assessed by co-transfecting dominant negative N17Ras mutant and HA-BAD in LNCaP cells. N17Ras inhibited EGF-induced BAD phosphorylation at both Ser112 and Ser136 (Fig. 4A) as well as MEK activation (Fig. 4C). However, there was no change in the status of BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and Ser136 induced by constitutive PI3K signaling (compare lanes 1 and 4 in Fig. 4A) or in BAD phosphorylation"

Pedrono F. Pasquier E. Marpeau A.M. Lipids. 2000; 35: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). High proportions of PUFA accumulation are found in many algae, mosses, and ferns (4Ackman R.G.

The function of these long-chain PUFAs in the membranes of lower plants is still unclear, whereas in humans they play a role in eicosanoid metabolism (7Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). The moss Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) B. S. G. (Funariales, Bryophyta) contains high proportions of arachidonic acid (ARA) (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and some eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) (8Grimsley N.H. Grimsley J.M. Hartmann E. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 1519-1524Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In mammals, ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) are precursors of the short-lived regulatory molecules, the eicosanoids, that comprise the prostaglandins, the leukotrienes, and the thromboxanes (9Horrobin D.F.

These compounds act locally through autocrine or paracrine process on G-protein-linked cell surface receptors. This leads to the activation of various signaling mechanisms that have effects on numerous cellular functions including chemotaxis, vascular permeability, inflammation, vasoconstriction, regulation of the immune system, blood clotting, neurotransmission, and cholesterol metabolism (12Jump D.B.

ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) are converted from linoleic acid (18:2 Δ9,12) and α-linolenic acid (18:3 Δ9,12,15), respectively, by the activities of Δ6-desaturase, Δ6-elongase, and Δ5-desaturase. This reaction series is designated the ω-6 pathway for ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) synthesis and the ω-3 pathway for EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) synthesis (see Fig. 1). The desaturases are thought to function like other microsomal desaturases from higher plants and yeast, catalyzing aerobic reactions requiring cytochrome b5 as a cofactor. Electrons are transferred from NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase via the heme-containing cytochrome b5 molecule to the fatty acid desaturase (15Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

However, biochemical characterization of membrane-bound desaturases has been limited because they are difficult to purify due to their membrane association. Analysis of the predicted protein sequences for the higher plant desaturases together with those from cyanobacteria, yeast, and mammals revealed the presence of eight highly conserved histidine residues (19Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox D.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Because the moss P. patens can produce high proportions of ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and some EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) (8Grimsley N.H. Grimsley J.M. Hartmann E. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 1519-1524Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it can serve as a model for studying the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of PUFAs. Only the genes encoding the Δ6-desaturase and Δ6-elongase have so far been cloned from this organism (20Girke T. Schmidt H. Zahringer U. Reski R. Heinz E.

Genet. 2005; 39: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which simplifies the phenotypic analysis after mutation or transformation (24Schaefer D. Zryd J.P. Knight C.D. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Genes can be specifically inactivated by targeted gene replacement, which occurs at high frequency in P. patens (23Cove D.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Kamisugi Y. Cuming A.C. Cove D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e173Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present study, a Δ5-desaturase associated with the biosynthesis of ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) in P. patens was functionally identified by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by targeted disruption of the corresponding gene, and by transient expression in the gene disrupted line. Materials—Restriction enzymes, polymerases, and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs unless indicated otherwise. All other chemicals used were reagent grade from Sigma. Fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Check-Prep (Elysian, MN). Plant Material and Growth Conditions—The Gransden strain of P. patens (22Ashton N.W. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 87-95Crossref Scopus (329) Google Scholar) was used throughout the studies. 7-day-old protonemata were grown on solid BCD medium to which di-ammonium tartrate was added to 5 mm and cultured at 25 °C under continuous light provided by fluorescent tubes (26Knight C.D. Cove D.J. Cuming A.C. Quatrano R.S. Gilmartin P.M. Bowter C. Molecular Plant Biology. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York2002: 285-301Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Manipulation—Total RNA was isolated from 50 mg of fresh weight of protonemal tissue using the RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen), and 5 μg was reversed transcribed with the Thermo-Script™ reverse transcription PCR system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification with primers. Genomic DNA Isolation—Approximately 1 g of fresh weight of protonemal tissue was ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA was extracted from the ground tissue using the Nucleon™ PhytoPure™ genomic DNA extraction kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). PCR-based Cloning—Primers were synthesized based on NCBI sequence data (27Zank T. Bauer J. Cirpus P. Abbadi A. Heinz E. Qiu X. Vrinten P. Sperling P. Domergue F. Meyer A. Kirsch J. PCT. 2005Google Scholar). The forward primer was PPFOR1, 5′-ATGGCGCCCCACTCTG-3′, and the reverse primer was PPREV1, 5′-TCAGCCATCGAGCCGAAACT-3′. The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl. 10 μm each of the primers were used for PCR amplification of cDNA reversed transcribed from total RNA. After initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, amplification was performed in 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 0.5 min at 54 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for another 10 min. Amplification products were fractionated on 1.0% agarose gels and directly ligated into pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) and the plasmids used were transformed into One Shot® Chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was purified and sequenced in both directions with an ABI BigDye V3.1 and an automated sequencer, yielding the plasmid PPDES5. Functional Analysis: Yeast Transformation—The open reading frame of the PPDES5 cDNA was cloned next to the GAL1 galactose-inducible promoter of the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen). For this purpose, PCR with the PPFOR1 and PPREV1 primers that add HindIII and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was used to amplify the plasmid PPDES5. The amplified PCR product was ligated into pCR®2.1-TOPO® (Invitrogen) and the plasmids used were transformed into One Shot® Chemically competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen) again. The entire open reading frame of the desaturase was digested with HindIII/XhoI and ligated into HindIII/XhoI sites of the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) to yield plasmid pYES2-DES5. Its sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pYES2-DES5 and pYES2 were transformed into the S. cerevisiae YPH499 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) by S.c. Easy-Comp™ transformation kit (Invitrogen). After uracil selection on minimal medium agar plates, cells containing the yeast plasmids were cultivated in complete supplement mixture dropout uracil medium (CSM-URA) (Krackeler Scientific) containing 1.0% (w/v) raffinose as the exclusive carbon source and 0.4% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) for the solubilization of fatty acids. For gene expression experiments, the cultures were grown to an optical density (600 nm) of ∼0.3 in CSM-URA medium (Krackeler Scientific). Expression of the PPDES5 coding region was induced by the addition of galactose to 2.0% (w/v). Fatty acids were added to 0.7 mm and cultures grown for 24 h at 28 °C. Targeted Gene Disruption of PPDES5 in P. patens—For disruption of PPDES5 by gene targeting, the coding sequence of a genomic clone of PPDES5 was replaced by a 35S-hph-nos terminator, hygromycin-resistance cassette (23Cove D.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), so that the selection cassette was flanked by 1536 and 1234 base pairs (bp) genomic locus homologous to 5′- and 3′-arms of PPDES5, respectively (see Fig. 2). Two specific primer pairs (Primer 1, 5′-TAGGGCCCCACCCTGTTGCTTCG-3′, and Primer 2, 5′-ATGGGCCCCCAGTTGCTTCGTCCCAG-3′; Primer 3, 5′-ATGTCGACCAGGCAAGTAAATAAGTGA-3′, and Primer 4, 5′-ATATGCATGAACGAAAGTAGTCCTGTC-3′) were synthesized based on the corresponding P. patens genome sequence from the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute data base (see Fig. 2). After PCR amplification with these primers from a wild-type genomic DNA template, the PCR fragments of the expected length (1536 and 1234 bp) were separately cloned into pGEM®-TEasy vector (Promega), released by digestion with ApaI and SalI/NsiI, respectively and then ligated into rr1 vector containing hygromycin-resistance cassette. Subsequently, the disruption construct was digested with XhoI/HindIII, resulting in a linear fragment with the cassette in its center flanked by genomic sequences of 1252 and 554 bp. This linear DNA was precipitated and used for the transformation without separation from the vector. Polyethylene lycol-mediated direct DNA transfer into protoplasts was performed as described by Schaefer et al. (24Schaefer D. Zryd J.P. Knight C.D. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with modifications. The protonemata were regenerated for 7 days on solid medium containing hygromycin (25 μg/ml), transferred to medium without antibiotic for 7 days, and retransferred to selective medium for a further 7 days. Strongly growing plants that survived this selection regimen were defined as stable transformants. Molecular Analysis—Targeting events were analyzed by PCR and Southern blotting. For this purpose, genomic DNA of wild-type and transgenic plants was extracted and the 5′-integration event was confirmed by PCR experiments with primer A (5′-GACCTACCGAACTTTCGA-3′) corresponding to genomic sequence of P. patens but 164 bp upstream of the 5′-end of replacement vector and primer B (5′-ACCATCTGTGGGTTAGCGTCC-3′) derived from the 35S promoter region of the selection cassette. The 3′-integration event was also confirmed by PCR with primer C (5′-ATGAAAAAGCCTGAACTACCG-3′) derived from the 5′-end of the hph coding region and primer D (5′-GAACACTCAACTGTAGTAGC-3′) corresponding to genomic sequence of P. patens but 99 bp downstream of the 3′-end of the selection cassette (see Fig. 2 for location of primers). PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl. Each reaction contained 0.2 μm each of the primers, 200 μm each of the dNTPs, PCR buffer, and 2 ml of Elongase® enzyme mix (Invitrogen). The thermocycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 0.5 min at 50 °C, 5 min at 72 °C, and terminated by a 10-min final extension at 72 °C. For Southern blot analysis, 1-μg aliquots of genomic DNA from wild-type and transgenic plants were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and separated on a 0.6% agarose gel electrophoresis. The final washing steps were performed in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Detection was accomplished with a chemiluminescent substrate (CSPD; Roche Applied Science). Transient Gene Expression of PPDES5—The primers with PPFOR2, 5′-CACCATGGCGCCCCACTCTG-3′, and PPREV2, 5′-TCAAGACCAGCCGCTCGCATCTTTCCAAGAGCCATCGAGCCGAAACT-3′, were used for PCR amplification of pYES2-DES5 with KlentaqLA. 5Patented by W. Barnes. PCRs were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl. Each reaction contains 0.4 μm each of primers, 100 μm each of dNTPs, PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μlof KlentaqLA.5 The thermocycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C followed by 28 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 0.5 min at 54 °C, 2.5 min at 72 °C, and terminated by a 10-min final extension at 72 °C. Amplification products were incorporated directly into pENTR™/D-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen). The resulting recombination plasmid has the PPDES5 sequence flanked by attL recombination sequences. It was then recombined with attR sites using the Gateway® LR Clonase™ II Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). This reaction transferred the PPDES5 sequence into a desired destination vector (tk1). Destination vector containing a gene, PPDES5, driven by the 35S promoter, was transformed into protoplasts of the targeted strain (24Schaefer D. Zryd J.P. Knight C.D. Cove D.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The regenerated protoplasts were cultured in liquid BCD medium supplemented with 5 mm di-ammonium tartrate and 6% mannitol for 2 days before fatty acid analysis. Fatty Acid Analysis—Total fatty acids extracted from yeast and moss cultures were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) of methyl esters. Lipids from yeast and moss tissue were transmethylated with 1% sodium methoxide in methanol and 2.5% sulfuric acid in methanol, respectively, at 85 °C for 30 min. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were then extracted in heptane. GC analysis of FAMEs was conducted using an Agilent 6890N Series gas chromatograph equipped with a 0.25 mm × 30 m × 0.25 mm HP-INNOWax capillary column and a flame ionization detector. Fatty acids were identified by comparison with retention times of standards. Relative percentages of the fatty acids were estimated from peak areas. The corresponding fatty acids were further characterized on diethylamide derivative by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using the Agilent 6890N Series operating at an ionization voltage of 70 eV with a scan range of 50-500 Da. Cloning of a P. patens Membrane-bound Desaturase—The moss P. patens has received attention because of its ability to produce several PUFAs, including ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) (8Grimsley N.H. Grimsley J.M. Hartmann E. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 1519-1524Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We were therefore interested in the molecular information underlying the biosynthesis of these fatty acids. To identify a gene coding for the desaturase involved in the final step of ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17) biosynthesis, NCBI data base searches in P. patens were conducted and the sequence identified based on its limited identity with other Δ5-desaturases was used (27Zank T. Bauer J. Cirpus P. Abbadi A. Heinz E. Qiu X. Vrinten P. Sperling P. Domergue F. Meyer A. Kirsch J. PCT. 2005Google Scholar). cDNA from reverse-transcribed mRNA from 7-day-old protonemal tissue of P. patens was amplified by PCR. An amplification product containing the expected length was cloned and sequenced. The open reading frame of the PPDES5 cDNA is 1443 bp from an ATG start to a TGA stop codon and codes for 480 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54.3 kDa. Data bank searches and alignments with this sequence indicated similarity with acyl-lipid desaturases from residue 190-454, with a cytochrome b5-like domain in the N terminus from residue 36-107. Amino acid sequence comparison using the ClustalW program revealed the PPDES5 has the strongest homology to Δ5-desaturase from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (66% identity) (28Kajikawa M. Yamato K.T. Kohzu Y. Nojiri M. Sakuradani E. Shimizu S. Sakai Y. Fukuzawa H. Ohyama K. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 54: 335-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and also shares 36% identity with Δ5-desaturase from Dictyostelium discoideum (29Saito T. Morio T. Ochiai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Saito T. Ochiai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Mortierella alpina (31Michaelson L.V. Lazarus C.M. Griffiths G. Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19055-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which is required for the desaturation of PUFAs. Alignment with those sequences indicates that homology occurs mainly in the cytochrome b5-like domain that serves as an electron donor (boxed with broken lines in Fig. 3) and in the three conserved histidine-rich motif areas (boxed in Fig. 3). The cytochrome b5-related domain contained the eight invariant residues typical for the cytochrome b5 superfamily (marked with asterisks in Fig. 3) and the presence of a heme binding region characterized by the HPGG motif toward the N terminus (32Lederer F. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 674-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A heme-containing electron donor is required for fatty acid desaturation, and cytochrome b5 fulfills this function for the membrane-bound desaturase (16Smith M.A. Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Griffiths W.T. Stymne S. Stobart A.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 287: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, the whole sequence can be considered as coding for a fusion protein consisting of an N-terminal cytochrome b5 and a desaturase. The sequence motif QIEHH of the third histidine box starts with a glutamine instead of a histidine (marked with triangle in Fig. 3), which is the characteristic of the front-end desaturases but is not found in other desaturases such as Δ12- and Δ15-desaturases (35Sayanova O.

Functional Analysis of PPDES5 in Yeast—Fig. 4 shows the results of GC analysis of the fatty acid methyl esters of yeast strains, transformed with the PPDES5 expression construct as described under “Experimental Procedures”, to which fatty acid substrates had been supplied. An additional peak is apparent in the trace obtained from induced pYES2-DES5 grown in the presence of di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (DHGLA) (20:3 Δ8,11,14) compared with an empty vector control. The retention time of the additional peak was identical to that of the methyl ester of authentic ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14). This compound also displayed a molecular ion of 318 m/z (the expected molecular ion for methyl ARA) as well as a fragmentation pattern identical to that of the authentic ARA methyl ester. The identity of this compound was further verified by obtaining the diethylamide derivative in order to produce a structure-specific mass spectrum. As shown in Fig. 5, the mass spectrum of the derivatized compound contained a molecular ion of 359 m/z and a fragmentation profile consistent with the ARA diethylamide derivative. Yeast cells transformed with the plasmid pYES2-DES5 had therefore acquired functional specific Δ5-desaturase activity and were now capable of synthesizing ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) from the substrate DHGLA (20:3 Δ8,11,14). The specific Δ5-desaturase in the transformed yeast appeared to be an efficient catalyst, with 14.7% of the substrate converted to ARA under the conditions of the experiments.FIGURE 5GC mass spectrometry analysis of diethylamide derivative of the novel peak identified in yeast carrying pYES2-DES5 in the presence of DHGLA (20:3 Δ8,11,14). A comparison is shown of the mass spectra of the novel peak (A) and an authentic ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) standard (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the P. patens Δ5-desaturase was capable of desaturating other substrates, yeast cultures expressing PPDES5 were supplemented with several fatty acids (Table 1). We were unable to detect any novel peaks when C18 and C22 fatty acids were fed to yeast; however, when 20:2 Δ11,14 and 20:3 Δ11,14,17 were provided as substrates, we detected novel peaks with mass spectra consistent with those of methyl 20:3 Δ5,11,14 (13.5%) and 20:4 Δ5,11,14,17 (14.5%), respectively (data not shown). Therefore, P. patens Δ5-desaturase appears to be specific for C20 fatty acids. In addition, we could exclude Δ8-desaturase activity because we could not detect any 20:3 Δ8,11,14 or 20:4 Δ8,11,14,17 from 20:2 Δ11,14 and 20:3 Δ11,14,17 substrates, respectively.TABLE 1Fatty acid substrate specificity of P. patens Δ5-desaturase (PPDES5) Yeast cells transformed with pYES2-DES5 were supplemented with different fatty acids. The FAMEs of total lipids under inducing conditions were analyzed by GC, using flame ionization detection. Conversion was calculated as (product × 100)/(substrate + product) using values corresponding to the peak areas of the corresponding signals.

The principle fatty acid detected was ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14), which is the Δ5-desaturation product from DHGLA (20:3 Δ8,11,14) in ω-6 pathway (see Fig. 1). However, from our experiments we could detect very little ω-3 eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA) (20:4 Δ8,11,14,17) despite the presence of its Δ5-desaturation product, EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17). Targeted Gene Replacement—For an alternative proof of the function of PPDES5, we analyzed the total fatty acids of wild type and the three stable transgenic lines (K1-3) having the PPDES5 coding sequence replaced by a selection cassette (Fig. 6). In contrast to the wild type, the transgenic lines lacked the unsaturated fatty acids ARA (20:4 Δ5,8,11,14) and EPA (20:5 Δ5,8,11,14,17), products of the Δ5-desaturation step, and a clear increase in the level of its substrate DHGLA (20:3 Δ8,11,14) and ETA (20:4 Δ8,11,14,17), respectively. Molecular Analysis of the Transgenic Lines—The specific integration of the transformed DNA into the PPDES5 gene was analyzed by PCR using genomic DNA from the three transgenic lines (K1-3) and the wild type. The locations of the different primers are presented in Fig. 2. The 5′-end of primer A and 3′-end of primer D bind 164 bp upstream and 99 bp downstream of the 5′- and 3′-genomic sequences flanking the selection cassette, thus excluding PCR signals resulting from contamination by DNA used for transformation.

https://openalex.org/W1971217676,"The insulins of eutherian mammals contain histidines at positions B5 and B10. The role of HisB10 is well defined: although not required in the mature hormone for receptor binding, in the islet β cell this side chain functions in targeting proinsulin to glucose-regulated secretory granules and provides axial zincbinding sites in storage hexamers. In contrast, the role of HisB5 is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that its substitution with Ala markedly impairs insulin chain combination in vitro and blocks the folding and secretion of human proinsulin in a transfected mammalian cell line. The structure and stability of an AlaB5-insulin analog were investigated in an engineered monomer (DKP-insulin). Despite its impaired foldability, the structure of the AlaB5 analog retains a native-like T-state conformation. At the site of substitution, interchain nuclear Overhauser effects are observed between the methyl resonance of AlaB5 and side chains in the A chain; these nuclear Overhauser effects resemble those characteristic of HisB5 in native insulin. Substantial receptor binding activity is retained (80 ± 10% relative to the parent monomer). Although the thermodynamic stability of the AlaB5 analog is decreased (ΔΔGu = 1.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol), consistent with loss of HisB5-related interchain packing and hydrogen bonds, control studies suggest that this decrement cannot account for its impaired foldability. We propose that nascent long-range interactions by HisB5 facilitate alignment of CysA7 and CysB7 in protein-folding intermediates; its conservation thus reflects mechanisms of oxidative folding rather than structure-function relationships in the native state.

Insulin is a small globular protein containing two chains, A (21 residues) and B (30 residues). The mature hormone is the post-translational product of a single-chain precursor, proinsulin (1Steiner D.F. Trans. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1967; 30: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), in which a connecting domain extends from the C-terminal residue of the B domain (ThrB30) to the N terminus of the A chain (GlyA1) (Fig. 1A).

Although the three-dimensional structure of proinsulin has not been determined, a variety of evidence indicates that it consists of a folded insulin moiety (Fig. 1B, red and blue ribbons) and a disordered connecting region (dashed black line). Upon transit through the Golgi apparatus and entry into immature secretory granules (2Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20838-20844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the C-peptide (Fig. 1A, black open circles) is excised by a specific set of prohormone convertases (3Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The mature hormone is stored as Zn2+-stabilized hexamers within specialized secretory granules (4Huang G.S. Oas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Insulin hexamers dissociate upon secretion into the portal circulation, enabling the circulating hormone to function as a Zn2+-free monomer.

Likewise conserved are side chains integral to the structure of the hydrophobic core: LeuA16, TyrA19, LeuB11, and LeuB15 (11Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J.

Alanine scanning mutagenesis of such core side chains is associated with inefficient biosynthetic expression of a single-chain precursor polypeptide in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(24Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol.

Xu B. Hua Q.-x. Chu Y.-C. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The complex pathway of insulin biosynthesis, trafficking, assembly, and secretion may impose additional evolutionary constraints unrelated to the structure and function of the insulin monomer. Such hidden constraints may be revealed by analysis of conserved residues at sites tolerant of substitutions in vitro. An elegant example is provided by HisB10, which mediates axial zinc binding within the insulin hexamer (27Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.C. Mercola D.A. Vijayan M. Nature. 1971; 231: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Whereas substitution of HisB10 by Asp enhances the stability and activity of the insulin monomer (28Schwartz G.P.

In the β cell, AspB10-proinsulin exhibits impaired trafficking, leading to inefficient excision of the connecting peptide and failure to be efficiently stored within glucose-regulated secretory granules. HisB10 may thus contribute to subcellular targeting in the ER and Golgi apparatus. A recent study suggests that the mutation may also impair the fidelity of disulfide pairing in the ER (31Liu M. Ramos-Castaneda J. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the function of HisB5, the other histidine residue in the B chain. In the crystallographic T-state (the predominant conformation of the insulin monomer in solution) (5Hua Q.-x. Hu S.-Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.-C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8836-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the B5 imidazole ring packs near the A7-B7 disulfide bridge at the edge of a solvated crevice between the A and B chains (11Baker E.N. Blundell T.L. Cutfield J.F. Cutfield S.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Hodgkin D.M. Hubbard R.E. Isaacs N.W. Reynolds C.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. 1988; 319: 369-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Comparison of multiple independent T-state structures indicates consistent engagement of the B5 imidazole ring within a pocket lined by residues A6-A11 (Fig. 1C). Although the details of such packing differ among crystal structures, HisB5 appears to brace the A7-A11 disulfide bridge on the protein surface. The B5-related crevice is remote from the classical receptor-binding surface, and indeed, mutagenesis (34Marki F. de Gasparo M. Eisler K. Kamber B. Riniker B. Rittel W. Sieber P. Hoppe-Seyler's Z.

HisB5 is nonetheless broadly conserved among eutherian mammals. 5Hystricomorph mammals exhibit divergent insulin sequences, including at residue B5. Such insulins exhibit low affinity and do not form zinc hexamers (70Bajaj M. Blundell T.L. Horuk R. Pitts J.E. Wood S.P. Gowan L.K. Schwabe C. Wollmer A. Gliemann J. Gammeltoft S. Biochem.

Our results are presented in two parts. We first describe the chemical synthesis and characterization of a monomeric AlaB5 analog. Because the complex self-association properties of insulin ordinarily confound biophysical studies, a well characterized monomeric template is provided by DKP-insulin (39Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-x. Lynch C.S. Frank B.H. Shoelson S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7373-7389Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40Shoelson S.E. Lu Z.X. Parlautan L. Lynch C.S.

Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4984-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The three amino acid substitutions in the B chain of DKP-insulin (HisB10 → Asp (D), ProB28 → Lys (K), and LysB29 → Pro (P)) disallow formation of dimers and higher order oligomers without perturbing its biological activity. AlaB5-DKP-insulin retains substantial receptor binding activity, and its structure closely resembles that of native insulin (5Hua Q.-x. Hu S.-Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.-C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the pattern of long-range nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) indicates that the conformation of the B5-related crevice and neighboring disulfide bridges (cystines A7-B7 and A6-A11) is not significantly altered by the absence of the imidazole side chain. Because these initial studies were unrevealing in relation to evolutionary constraints, we next investigated fold-ability as probed by the efficiency of disulfide pairing in chain combination (25Weiss M.A. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Xu B. Hua Q.-x. Chu Y.-C. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Hua Q.-x. Chu Y.-C. Jia W. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43443-43453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Substitution of HisB5 with Ala markedly impairs insulin chain combination in vitro and the folding of proinsulin in the ER of a mammalian cell. Because the protocol of chain combination (42Katsoyannis P.G. Science. 1966; 154: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is generally robust (permitting the synthesis of hundreds of insulin analogs during the past 40 years), its exquisite sensitivity to a B5 substitution provides a striking contrast to the near-native structure and activity of the AlaB5 analog. The biological importance of this synthetic block is demonstrated by transient transfection analysis of proinsulin biosynthesis within the ER of living cells (43Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13209-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this assay, a variety of amino acid substitutions and deletions in proinsulin (in each case, expected not to perturb bioactivity) have been found to perturb folding (44Zhang B.Y. Liu M. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3687-3693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present study strongly suggests that HisB5 functions in the ER to direct disulfide pairing in a kinetic pathway of protein folding. We propose that nascent packing of HisB5 against the A domain in a protein-folding intermediate orients CysA7 and CysB7 for disulfide bond formation and that such conserved interactions are dispensable once native folding has been achieved. We thus envisage that the HisB5 → Ala substitution provides an example of a pathway mutation (45Betts S. King J. Struct. Folding Des. 1999; 7: R131-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar): its dramatic and unexpected effects on proinsulin biosynthesis illuminate the stringent structural requirements of native oxidative protein folding in the ER. Synthesis of Insulin Analogs—Human insulin was kindly provided by Lilly. The tetra-S-sulfonate derivative of the human A chain was obtained by oxidative sulfitolysis (20Hu S.-Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). B chain analogs were prepared by solid-phase chemical synthesis (20Hu S.-Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G.

Proinsulin Expression and Mutagenesis—A human proinsulin cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (43Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13209-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Variant proinsulin cDNAs encoding B5 mutations were created by three PCRs. Reaction 1 used forward and reverse primers to amplify a cDNA stretch encoding the signal peptide and the downstream site of the introduced mutation. Reaction 2 used another set of primers to amplify a cDNA encoding the mutation point as well as the remaining C-terminal region of proinsulin. The products from reactions 1 and 2 were designed to share a 20-bp overlap in the region of the introduced mutation. Finally, reaction 3 used the primers at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the proinsulin coding sequence along with both gel-purified products from the first two PCRs as template, thereby generating the full-length mutant proinsulin cDNAs. These were gel-purified and ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega Corp.). Mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing, and the mutants were subcloned into pcDNA3 using KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites (43Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13209-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA 1 day after seeding using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti MEM for 5 h at 37°C and then recovered overnight in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, with a change to normal growth medium at 24 h and assays of protein expression at 48 h. Metabolic Labeling—Cells were preincubated in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium for 30 min, metabolically labeled in the same medium containing 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine for 1 h, washed once with a large volume of complete chase medium, and chased further in complete medium for 1 h. At the end of the chase, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE—Cell lysates and chase media that had been treated with a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) were preincubated with Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 60 min at 4 °C and precleared by centrifugation. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with guinea pig anti-insulin antiserum (LINCO Diagnostics) plus fresh Zysorbin. Immunocomplexes were sedimented at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and pellets were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and once with high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4)). Samples were then analyzed by nonreducing Tris/Tricine/urea/SDS-PAGE (43Liu M. Li Y. Cavener D. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13209-13212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); samples were allowed to enter the gel at 50 V for 1 h and then run at 100 V overnight without cooling. Insulin gels were fixed initially in 20% trichloroacetic acid without alcohol and then in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid plus 50% methanol, incubated briefly with water, and finally either phosphorimaged or incubated with 1 m sodium salicylate for 20 min and exposed to Kodak XAR film at -70 °C. Receptor Binding Assays—Relative activity is defined as the ratio of analog to human wild-type insulin required to displace 50% of specifically bound 125I-labeled human insulin. A human placental membrane preparation containing the insulin receptor was employed as described (29Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-x. Jia W. Nakagawa S.H. Chu Y.-C. Hu S.-Q. Katsoyannis P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40018-40024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In all assays, the percentage of tracer bound in the absence of competing ligand was <15% to avoid ligand depletion artifacts. Circular Dichroism—Far-UV CD spectra were obtained as described (8Hua Q.-x. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Hu S.-Q. Chu Y.-C. Katsoyannis P.G.

Estimates of secondary structure were obtained by deconvolution (47Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in 10 mm phosphate and 100 mm KCl (pH 7.4) at a protein concentration of ∼25 μm. For equilibrium denaturation studies, samples were diluted to 5 μm; guanidine HCl was employed as denaturant (26Hua Q.-x. Chu Y.-C. Jia W. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Biol.

NMR Spectroscopy—Spectra were obtained at 700 MHz at a protein concentration of 600μm using a cryogenic 1H NMR probe.

(In this co-solvent, insulin retains a native-like monomeric fold (49Hua Q.-x. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5505-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).) Resonance assignment was based on homonuclear two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy (mixing times of 80 and 200 ms), total correlation spectroscopy (mixing time of 55 ms), and double-quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy. Helix-related hydrogen bonds were inferred from the pattern of protected amide resonances as observed in D2O solution containing 20% deuteroacetic acid (50Hua Q.-x. Jia W. Frank B.H. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Histidine pKa Measurement—The pKa of HisB5 in DKP-insulin was estimated based on the pH dependence of the chemical shift of its Hϵ imidazole resonance in D2O. The following pD values were employed: 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 6.3, 6.8, 7.2, 7.5, 8.0, 8.8, 9.3, and 9.8 (direct meter reading). Molecular Modeling—Structures were calculated by distance geometry/simulated annealing using the program DG-II (51Xu B. Hua Q.-x. Nakagawa S.H. Jia W. Chu Y.-C. Katsoyannis P.G.

https://openalex.org/W1980394389,"Liver wound healing is an integrated process in which hepatic stellate cells play a major role. We hypothesized that the cellextracellular signaling protein integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is important in transducing signals from the extracellular matrix to stellate cells and thus plays a critical role in stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis during liver injury. Liver injury and subsequent stellate cell activation led to a 3-fold increase in ILK expression and increased kinase activity. Overexpression of ILK in isolated stellate cells led to enhanced motility and adhesion as well as increases in smooth muscle α-actin and type I collagen mRNA expression. The effects of ILK on stellate cell phenotypes were phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent. Forced expression of ILK in vivo led to increases in type I collagen, smooth muscle α-actin, transforming growth factor-β, and extra domain A (EDA) fibronectin mRNAs (by 3.2-, 3.5-, 2.5-, and 2.2-fold, respectively; n = 8, p < 0.05 for each versus the control), whereas inhibition of ILK in vivo led to significant reductions in these mRNAs. Morphometric analysis revealed that ILK overexpression led to a 31.4% increase in liver collagen content (n = 8, p < 0.05 versus the control); in contrast ILK knockdown in vivo led to a significant reduction in fibrogenesis. We conclude that ILK plays an important pathophysiological role in vivo in liver wound healing. Liver wound healing is an integrated process in which hepatic stellate cells play a major role.

We conclude that ILK plays an important pathophysiological role in vivo in liver wound healing. The liver responds to injury by wound healing, leading to fibrosis. The multiple integrated systems leading to fibrosis are complex and are similar mechanistically to that in skin and other parenchymal organs. A remarkable increase in extracellular matrix production after wounding is characteristic and is typified by a 4-6-fold increase in collagens (i.e. types I, III, and IV, etc.) as well as an increase in many other extracellular matrix constituents (1Schuppan D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Investigation over the past two decades has helped to establish a cellular mechanism for the wound-healing response to liver injury (2Bataller R. Brenner D.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (4154) Google Scholar). A critical feature of this wounding response is the transformation of resident stellate cells (also known as lipocytes, Ito cells, or perisinusoidal cells) from the “quiescent” state in the normal liver to an “activated” state in the injured liver. This transition is characterized by both morphologic and functional changes, including loss of vitamin A, acquisition of stress bundles, development of prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum, and a striking increase in the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, as well as enhanced stellate cell contractility, motility, proliferation, adhesion, and responsiveness to various cytokines and peptides found in the wounding milieu (3Friedman S.L.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) 2The abbreviations used are: ILK, integrin-linked kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; TGF, transforming growth factor; BDK, bile duct ligation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ad-, adenovirus-. is a newly described signaling molecule important in transducing signals from the extracellular matrix to cellular machinery through the cytoplasmic portion of integrins and adaptor proteins to a variety of signaling cascades (4Sepulveda J.L.

For example, ILK interaction with integrins is important in cell growth, differentiation, cell motility, and cell attachment (4Sepulveda J.L. Gkretsi V. Wu C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 68: 183-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Wu C. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Brakebusch C.

ILK adaptor function seems to be especially important for cell spreading, F-actin organization, and formation of focal contacts, as demonstrated by reconstitution experiments with kinase-dead ILK in ILK-deficient fibroblasts (9Sakai T. Li S. Docheva D. Grashoff C. Sakai K. Kostka G. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Yurchenco P.D. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Interestingly, little is known about the regulation of ILK expression. However, ILK kinase activity is stimulated by growth factors and by attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix, (for example, to fibronectin) (10Barker T.H. Baneyx G. Cardo-Vila M. Workman G.A. Weaver M. Menon P.M. Dedhar S. Rempel S.A. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Vogel V. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36483-36493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Downstream of ILK, a number of effectors have been identified, including protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3-β, and appear to be targets of ILK (11Qian Y. Zhong X.

Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of ILK in mediating extracellular-intracellular signals and the exuberant extracellular matrix response typical of liver injury, we hypothesized that ILK is important in linking extracellular signals to stellate cells and therefore may mediate specific functional phenotypes in hepatic stellate cells, key effectors of the liver wounding response. Here, we have demonstrated, not only that ILK expression is up-regulated during liver injury but also that it has critical functional effects in isolated stellate cells as well as in vivo during wound healing. Materials—Mouse anti-ILK monoclonal antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin antagonists (BQ-123 and BQ-788) were from American Peptide Co. Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Recombinant TGF-β was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The AdEasy™ XL adenoviral vector system was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Culture media, fetal bovine serum, and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of analytic grade and obtained from Sigma. Cell Isolation and Culture—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (450-500 g) (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were maintained under temperature-controlled conditions (22 ± 2 °C) in 12-h light/dark cycles with food and water ad libitum. All animals received humane care in compliance with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Animal Care and Use Guidelines. Hepatic stellate cells were isolated by the combined digestion of the liver with Pronase (Roche Applied Science) followed by collagenase (Crescent Chemical, Hauppauge, NY). In brief, stellate cells were separated from other liver non-parenchymal cells by ultracentrifugation over gradients of 8.2 and 15.6% Accudenz (Accurate Chemical & Scientific, Westbury, NY). The resulting upper layer consisted of >95% stellate cells. Cells were plated on uncoated plastic and maintained in modified medium 199 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) with antibiotics (penicillin, 100 units/ml; streptomycin, 100 units/ml; gentamicin, 0.1 mg/ml; and amphotericin B, 2.5 μg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (containing 95% O2 and 2.5% CO2), and the medium was changed every 24 h. Cell viability was >90% in all cultures used. The cells were considered to be quiescent at day 1, 24 h after plating. Cells at day 7 were considered activated, with >95% staining positive for smooth muscle actin. For all experiments in which cells at different stages were compared, the cells were from the same isolation. All experiments were repeated with cells from different animals. Animal Models of Liver Injury—Liver injury was induced by the administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or by performing bile duct ligation (BDL) in 450-500-g male retired breeder Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (15Proctor E. Chatamra K. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 1183-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 16Kountouras J. Billing B.H. Scheuer P.J. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1984; 65: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar). BDL resulted in periportal expansion of the biliary duct cells with concomitant periductular and lobular extracellular matrix deposition. In sham-operated rats, an incision was made in the abdomen, which was then closed without any treatment. Carbon tetrachloride administration led to central-central and central-portal extracellular matrix deposition. Animal protocols used to induce injury and fibrogenesis were approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Animal Care and Use Guidelines Committee. Adenovirus—Specific adenoviral constructs were produced by double recombination between a co-transformed adenoviral backbone plasmid (pAdEasy-1) and a linearized shuttle vector (pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP-1) pursuant to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene). Clones of interest were amplified by transformation into X-10 gold cells according to the manufacturer's directions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Plasmid DNA was used to transfect human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and virus was harvested, amplified, and titered according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The infection efficiency of the adenovirus was monitored by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and typically reached 80-90% within 48 h. For in vivo animal experiments, adenovirus was injected into the inferior vena cava at the time of BDL surgery in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/kg. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dt) primer and Superscript RNase H-reverse transcriptase pursuant to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Amplification reactions were performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primer sequences were as follows: GAPDH (forward, 5′-ACC CAG AAG ACT GTG GAT GG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAT CGA AGG TGG AAG AGT GG-3′; collagen I α1 forward, 5′-TTC CCT GGA CCT AAG GGT ACT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTG AGC TCC AGC TTC GCC-3′; TGF-β1 forward, 5′-TTG CCC TCT ACA ACC AAC ACA A-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGC TTG CGA CCC ACG TAG TA-3′; smooth muscle α-actin forward, 5′-GTG GAT CAC CAA GCA GGA GT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAT AGC ACG ATG GTC GAT-3′; and extra domain A fibronectin forward, 5′-GTG GCT GCC TTC AAC TTC TC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTG GGT TGC AAA CCT TCA AT-3′. Five μl of diluted cDNA samples (1:5 dilution) were used for quantitative two-step PCR (a 10-min step at 95 °C followed by 50 cycles of 15 s of 95 °C and 1 at 65 °C) in the presence of 400 nm specific forward and reverse primers and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. As negative controls, water was used as a template for each reaction. RNA Interference—To silence the expression of ILK, specific small interfering short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were expressed by adenovirus using the pShuttle Ad-Track system (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The specific targeted sequences were as follows: shILK-1 forward, 5′-AGT AAC CAC GGA AGT ACA TCT TGT GGT GTG GAC AAG ATG TAC TTC CGT GGT TAA AAA AGG TTG AGC T-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGC GTC ATT GGT GCC TTC ATG TAG AAC ACC ACA CCT GTT CTA CAT GAA GGC ACC AAT TTT TTC CAA C-3′; shILK-2 forward, 5′-ACG CGT CAC CCC TTC CAG AAT GTG TCC TTC CAC ACC AAG GAC ACA TTC TGG AAG GGG TTTTTT CCA ACT CGA G-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGC GTC ATT GGT GCC TTC ATG TAG AAC ACC ACA CCT GTT CTA CAT GAA GGC ACC AAT TTT TTC CAA C-3′. Control sequences included the following: scrambled sequence forward, 5′-CGC GTC ACA CTA TCC TGT ATC GCG CTC TAG AGC GCG ATA CAG GAT AGT GTT TTT TCC AAC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGT GTG ATA GGA CAT AGC GCG ATA TCT CGC GCT ATG ACC TAT CAC AAA AAA GGT TGA GCT-3′; mismatch sequence forward, 5′-CGC GTC ACC CCT TAC AGA ATG AGT CCT TCC ACA CCA AGG ACT CAT TCT GTA AGG GGT TTT TTC CAA C-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGT GGG GAA TGT CTT ACT CAG GAA GGT GTG GTT CCT GAG TAA GAC ATT CCC CAA AAA AGG TTG AGC T-3′; and nonspecific sequence forward, 5′-CGC GTC AAA TTG ATG TGT TTA GTC GCT ACC ACA CCT AGC GAC TAA ACA CAT CAA TTT TTT TTC CAA C-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGT TTA ACT ACA CAA ATC AGC GAT GGT GTG GAT CGC TGA TTT GTG TAG TTA AAA AA A AGG TTG AGC T-3′. Transient transfection of LX2 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were also annealed and ligated to the MluI and XhoI sites of p-Shuttle Ad-Track, and the inserted sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium-2-glycerophosphate, 0.05 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/leupeptin, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples containing 50 μg of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, after which proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 2.5% dry milk) and then with primary antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed of excess primary antibody at room temperature in a phosphate-buffered saline Tween buffer (TBST: 10 mm 0.05%, Tris pH 8, 0.9% sodium chloride, Tween 20 0.05%) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibody. After washing, specific signals were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Specific bands were scanned and data collected over a narrow range of x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) linearity and quantitated by scanning densitometry. Kinase Activity—Kinase assays were carried out as previously described (17Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-ILK antibody. The solution was centrifuged, and immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of myelin-basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) for 30 min at 30 °C. The phosphorylated substrate was then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Hepatic stellate cells were isolated, placed on glass-bottomed plastic culture dishes and allowed to undergo activation as described above. For detection of ILK, the cells were fixed in 50% acetone/methanol, washed, and exposed to monoclonal anti-ILK antibody (1:1,000) in PBS. After washing, primary antibody was detected with Alexa Fluor® 488 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated anti-mouse and DRAQ5 (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) to identify the nuclei. After washing and mounting, signals were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. A solution of bovine serum albumin/PBS at 3% and a non-immune mouse IgG were employed as a negative control. For detection of actin, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by labeling with AL-488-Phalloidin (Molecular Probes). After washing and mounting, signals were visualized as described above. Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was assessed by measuring the repair of a linear wound generated in the confluent monolayer of cells. Hepatic stellate cells were isolated, plated at an equivalent density on chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Westmont, IL), and allowed to undergo culture-induced activation for 7 days. They were then infected with constructs (all at a multiplicity of infection of 100) or went untreated for 24 h. Some cells were exposed to wortmannin (200 nm) for 20 min prior to the application of a linear scratch in cell monolayers using a sterile plastic pipette tip. Cell migration was recorded for 24 h using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 multidimensional time lapse work station. Cell Adhesion Assay—Hepatic stellate cells were isolated, plated at an equivalent density, and allowed to undergo culture-induced activation for 7 days. They were then infected with specified adenoviruses (all at a multiplicity of infection of 100) or went untreated. Forty-eight hours after viral infection, the cells were detached from the culture dishes with trypsin. Some cells were exposed to wortmannin (200 nm). The detached cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% serum was added, and the cells were then replated on fresh tissue culture dishes. Two hours after replating, the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove unattached cells, trypsinized, and the adherent cells were counted. Morphometry—Livers were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 48 h at 4 °C, washed twice with water, stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for 24 h, and then embedded in paraffin. Five-micron sections were then dehydrated and stained with 0.1% sirius red F3B in saturated picric acid and counterstained with fast green (all from Sigma). The proportion of tissue stained with picrosirus red content was assessed by morphometric analysis using MetaView software (Universal Imaging Corp, Downtownington, PA); collagen stained with sirius red was quantitated in the sections that were randomly chosen (under 20× magnification, 10 fields each from sample). Hydroxyproline Assay—Liver tissue was weighed, hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, and incubated at 110 °C for 16 h, filtered, and then 25 μl of the samples were freeze-dried for 4 h. The sediment was redissolved in 50% isopropyl alcohol and then incubated with 0.5 ml of chloramine-T solution containing 1.41 g of chloramine-T, dissolved in 12% Ehrlich's reagent, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. To this were added 0.5 ml of 12% Ehrlich's solution, including 10 g of dimethylaminobenzaldehyde dissolved in 11 ml of 60% perchloric acid, and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 90 min. After cooling, the absorbance was read at 558 nm. Hydroxyproline concentration was calculated from a standard curve prepared with high purity hydroxyproline (Sigma) and expressed as mg of hydroxyproline/mg of liver. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significance was established using the Student's t test and analysis of variance when appropriate. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. In Vivo Up-regulation of ILK Expression after Injury and Wound Healing—To examine the expression of ILK in vivo during wound healing, liver injury created by BDL, or by exposure of rats to repetitive doses of CCl4, stellate cells were subsequently isolated and immediately subjected immunoblotting to detect ILK. Regardless of the type of liver injury, ILK expression was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 1a). We further examined ILK expression using immunohistochemistry; stellate cells isolated from normal rats expressed relatively small amounts of ILK (i.e. at day 1 after isolation, cells were small, and the ILK found within the cells remained disorganized), whereas cells isolated from injured rats, not only took on an activated appearance (activated cells spread over time becoming larger in size), but they also expressed larger quantities of ILK, which was identified in focal adhesions (Fig. 1b). Additionally, in a culture model that mimics stellate cell activation after liver injury, we found that ILK expression appeared to increase sequentially in proportion to the degree of stellate cell activation. In this model, stellate cell activation proceeds in early culture through day 14 in culture. ILK expression was detected early, increased markedly at day 4, and peaked after 14 days (Fig. 1c). Additionally, we found that ILK activation paralleled ILK expression (Fig. 2). In kinase assays shown in Fig. 2, kinase activity became increased as ILK was up-regulated.FIGURE 2ILK activity is enhanced after liver injury and stellate cell activation. Stellate cells isolated from normal rats were allowed to adhere to glasscoated culture dishes, were grown in serum-containing medium, and allowed to undergo activation for 1-14 days as in Fig. 1. Kinase activity was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures” (upper panel). Total ILK was detected by immunoblot of equivalent amounts of the same lysates that were used to perform the kinase assay (middle panel). Blots were stripped and probed for β-actin (shown in the lower panel). The positive control consisted of lysate from NIH3T3 cells. The negative control consisted of the same sample as the positive control, with the exception that myelin-basic protein (MBP) substrate was omitted. The images shown are representative of three others.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ILK Expression Is Regulated by Factors Found in the Wounding Environment—The wounding response is characterized by production of cytokines and a variety of peptides that help drive the wounding response. Therefore, we sought to determine whether two typical compounds found in the wounding environment, ET-1 and TGF-β, might regulate expression of ILK. In these experiments, hepatic stellate cells were specifically stimulated with ET-1 and TGF-β. We found that both compounds potently induced ILK expression (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we found that stimulation of either the ETA or ETB receptor mediated the up-regulation of ILK, and blockade of both receptors had a slightly additive effect (Fig. 3b), suggesting that each receptor is capable of signaling to ILK regulatory pathways. Interestingly, other compounds found in the wounding milieu, such as FGF, did not lead to up-regulation of ILK (data not shown). Modulation of ILK Expression—To better understand the functional role of ILK in stellate cells in liver wound healing, we developed constructs with which to reduce (an adenovirus expressing ILK small interfering short hairpin RNA, Ad-shILK) or to overexpress (an adenovirus expressing ILK, Ad-ILK) ILK selectively in infected cells. Constructs were found to both knock down (Fig. 4, a and b) and overexpress ILK (Fig. 4b). Constructs were not only active but also specific, because control sequences had no effect on ILK expression (Fig. 4a). Functional Effects of ILK—An important phenotype for mesenchymal cells, such as stellate cells, during wound healing is cell adhesion. To assess cell adhesion, activated stellate cells were infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-ILK, or Ad-shILK (or were not infected (control)). Forty-eight hours after infection, cell adhesion was assessed (Fig. 5a). We found that overexpression of ILK led to enhanced cell adhesion, whereas ILK knockdown inhibited cell adhesion (Fig. 5a). Importantly, exposure of cells to wortmannin abrogated the effect of overexpression of ILK, consistent with a downstream effect of ILK on the PI 3-kinase pathway. To verify the role of PI 3-kinase in this system, we verified that activation of PI 3-kinase led to Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). Another important phenotype for mesenchymal cells, such as stellate cells, during wound healing is cell migration. Indeed, migration of stellate cells appears to be one of their most prominent phenotypes (18Ikeda K. Wakahara T. Wang Y.Q. Kadoya H. Kawada N. Kaneda K. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether ILK could mediate stellate cell migration. In an assay system that allows assessment of cellular migration, we found that overexpression of ILK led to a marked increase in stellate cell migration, whereas inhibition of ILK led to reduced cell migration (Fig. 5b). Migration, as cell adhesion, appeared to be PI 3-kinase-dependent, because exposure of cells to wortmannin inhibited the effect of overexpression of ILK. We next examined the effect of ILK on the stellate cell cytoskeleton (Fig. 5, c-f). We found that serum induced prominent stress (Fig. 5c), whereas exposure of stellate cells to serum-free medium led to a slight disassembly of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 5d). Interestingly, overexpression of ILK led to an even greater prominence of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 5e), whereas inhibition of ILK led to a dramatic coalescence and disorganization of stress fibers (Fig. 5f). ILK Stimulates Stellate Cell Activation—Important features of stellate cell activation include enhanced fibrogenesis (expression of type I collagen and/or other matrix proteins) as well as expression of the cytoskeletal protein smooth muscle α-actin, a well accepted marker of stellate cell activation (19Rockey D.C. Housset C.N. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To test the functional effects of ILK in stellate cell possibility, we first overexpressed ILK in isolated quiescent stellate cells. When ILK was overexpressed, we saw remarkable stimulation of type I collagen mRNA production, whereas abrogation of ILK expression led to a reduction in collagen I mRNA expression (Fig. 5g). Consistent with the effects of ILK on PI 3-kinase, as above, wortmannin inhibited the fibrogenic effect of ILK in stellate cells (Fig. 5g). Additionally, ILK overexpression led to dramatic up-regulation of smooth muscle α-actin, and as above, is a well accepted marker of stellate cell activation (Fig. 5h). Blocking of the PI 3-kinase system inhibited the effect of ILK on smooth muscle α-actin (Fig. 5h). ILK Modifies the Wound-healing Response to Injury in Vivo—Given our ability to manipulate ILK levels with the constructs highlighted in Fig. 4, we set out to determine whether ILK might play a role in in vivo wound healing, using the liver as a model. We administered relevant constructs to control or injured (BDL) rats and assessed typical wound-healing phenotypes. We found that overexpression of ILK during the wounding response led to markedly enhanced fibrogenesis (Fig. 6). Notably, we were able to verify quantitatively significant increases in ILK expression in whole liver extracts from these specific livers (data not shown); additionally, livers from these rats were palpably more firm and rigid than the controls. In contrast, inhibition of ILK led to reduced fibrogenesis (Fig. 6). Morphometric analysis of large numbers of liver sections revealed that ILK overexpression during the wounding response led to a dramatic increase in collagen, whereas inhibition of ILK led to a reduction in collagen (Fig. 6e). Consistent with the morphometric data, the hydroxypro"

However, it is unclear whether the specific distribution of groups within oligosaccharides or random variations in charge density underlies the effects. Recently we showed that a mixture of undersulfated octasaccharides exhibiting 7 and 8 sulfates (7,8-S-OctaF7) generated from heparin had the highest affinity for FGF7 monitored by salt resistance (>0.60 m salt) of octasaccharide-FGF7 complexes. 7,8-S-OctaF7 also had the highest specific activity for formation of a complex with dimeric FGFR2IIIb competent to bind FGF7. Here we show that when endogenous HS was inhibited by chlorate treatment, 7,8-S-OctaF7 specifically supported FGF7-stimulated DNA synthesis and downstream signaling in FGFR2IIIb-expressing mouse keratinocytes. It failed to support FGF1 signaling in both HS-deficient mouse keratinocytes and 3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, abundant, more highly sulfated and heterogenous mixtures of octasaccharides with lower affinity (0.30-0.60 m salt) for FGF7 supported FGF1-induced signaling in both cell types. In contrast to the two-component 7,8-S-OctaF7 mixture from FGF7, the high affinity octasaccharide fraction from FGF1 was a heterogeneous mixture with components ranging from 8 to 12 sulfates with 11-S-octasaccharides the most abundant. The high affinity fraction exhibited similar properties to the lower affinity fractions from both FGF1 and FGF7. Octasaccharide mixtures eluting from FGF1 between 0.30 and 0.60 m and above 0.60 m salt were nearly equal in support of FGF1 signaling in fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Both were deficient in support of FGF7-induced signaling in keratinocytes. The results show that both variations in overall charge density and specific distribution of charged groups within HS motifs exhibit FGF-specific control over formation of FGF-HS-FGFR complexes and downstream signaling. Variation in length, disaccharide composition, and sulfation of heparan sulfate (HS) affects fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling.

Both FGF and the ectodomain of FGFR interact with pericellular matrix heparan sulfates (HS). HS chains are comprised of disaccharide repeats with variable modifications. These include sulfation on the 2-hydroxyl of hexuronate epimers glucuronate (GlcA) or iduronate (IdoA), and 2-amino, 3-hydroxyl, and 6-hydroxyl groups on glucosamine (GlcN) (9Lindahl U.

Chem. 2003; 46: 2551-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Modifications are incomplete and occur to different extents depending on the tissue source of HS. Specific HS-binding domains of FGFs and the FGFR ectodomain interact independently with HS oligosaccharide motifs within longer chains of HS (5Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 11Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). In the tissue environment, HS is estimated to be in 20-200-fold molar excess to both FGF and FGFR on the cell surface alone (12Powell A.K. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28554-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus in a physiological context both FGF and FGFR likely exist in a complex with HS. How complexes of FGF-HS and HS-FGFR organize to form activated oligomeric complexes of FGF-HS-FGFR is unclear. A large body of results from analysis of the interaction of diverse HS oligosaccharides with different FGF and FGFR isotypes is suggestive that specific motifs within HS control the assembly and activation of the FGF-HS-FGFR signaling complex (13Rusnati M.

However, no definitive evidence for distinct HS motifs beyond variations in random charge density and random distribution of charged groups has been forthcoming. Inability to demonstrate specificity have led some to conclude that it is unlikely that specific distribution of sulfate groups plays a role in FGF signaling similar to what has been demonstrated for anticoagulation (23Kreuger J. Jemth P. Sanders-Lindberg E. Eliahu L. Ron D. Basilico C. Salmivirta M. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently we exploited the scalability, stability, and selectivity in regard to heparin oligosaccharide motifs of bacterial-derived FGF7 fused at the N terminus with GST to fractionate and characterize heparin oligosaccharides that interact with its heparin-binding domain (18Ye S.

Only 0.7-3.7% of oligosaccharide mixtures from 8 to 14 monosaccharide units, respectively, bound FGF7 with high affinity based on salt resistance of oligosaccharide-FGF7 complexes. The same minority fractions bound independently to dimers of FGFR2IIIb to form HS-FGFR2IIIb complexes that then bind FGF7. The shortest high affinity oligosaccharide capable of supporting binding of FGF7 to FGFR2IIIb was an undersulfated octasaccharide exhibiting 7 and 8 sulfates (7,8-S-OctaF7). Based on disaccharide analysis and its anticoagulant activity, it was deduced that 7,8-S-OctaF7 contains the rare N-unsubstituted ΔHexA2SGlcN6S, a trisulfated disaccharide most likely exhibiting a 3-O-sulfate, and a variably unsulfated/monosulfated disaccharide. This was in contrast to more abundant and heterogeneous octasaccharides with lower affinity. They were more highly sulfated and exhibited predominantly 11 and 12 sulfates and the most common trisulfated disaccharide in heparin, ΔHexA2SGlcNS6S. Surprisingly, these results indicated that affinity for FGF7 based on salt resistance of binding does not increase proportionally to anionic density of heparin octasaccharides. Moreover the undersulfated 7,8-S-OctaF7 mixture with highest affinity for FGF7 exhibited the highest specific activity for binding to FGFR2IIIb. (7,8-S-OctaF7)-FGFR2IIIb complexes supported the binding of FGF7, whereas the more highly sulfated octasaccharides with lower affinity failed to support an FGF7-HS-FGFR2IIIb complex (24Luo Y. Cho H.-H. McKeehan W.L. J. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 92: 2117-2127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The above results demonstrated that specific distribution of sulfate groups within an undersulfated octasaccharide might play a role in formation of oligomeric FGF7-HS-FGFR2IIIb complexes involved in transmembrane signaling. To determine whether 7,8-S-OctaF7 also exhibits specificity for FGF7 signaling, we compared its ability to support FGF7 and FGF1 mitogenesis and downstream signaling in mouse keratinocytes that express FGFR2IIIb. Because native HS in keratinocytes is at levels sufficient to mask a response to external heparin, cells were made responsive by depression of HS sulfation by treatment with chlorate. 7,8-S-OctaF7 specifically supported FGF7-induced signaling, but failed to support signaling induced by FGF1. Moreover, 7,8-S-OctaF7 failed to support FGF1-induced signaling in mouse fibroblasts expressing predominantly FGFR1. In contrast, more highly sulfated octasaccharide mixtures with lower affinity for FGF7 supported FGF1 signaling in both cell types. Similar to octasaccharide mixtures with lower affinity for both FGF7 and FGF1, those with high affinity for FGF1 were also more highly sulfated than 7,8-S-OctaF7. They supported FGF1 signaling, but were deficient in support of FGF7-induced signaling in keratinocytes. The results show that both the degree of sulfation and distribution of sulfate groups in HS motifs control FGF-induced mitogenesis and downstream signaling in an FGF isotype-specific manner. Purification and Analysis of Heparin Oligosaccharide Mixtures—Size-defined heparin oligosaccharides were generated by controlled cleavage (10-30%) of crude porcine intestinal mucosal heparin (6,000-30,000 Da, 170 USP units/mg, Sigma) with a low concentration of GST-heparinase 1 (about 20 ng/ml) in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm Ca2+ (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Heparinase 1 with about 50 times specific activity of commercial preparations was cloned from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and expressed as a GST fusion in Escherichia coli and purified by GSH chromatography. 3Y. Luo, S. Ye, and W. L. McKeehan, manuscript in preparation. Upon reaching the desired degree of degradation, GST-heparinase 1 was removed by GSH-Sepharose. After a screen of common chemical and enzymatic depolymerization methods, heparinase 1 treatment was shown the best compromise between the yield of short oligosaccharides and preservation of activity of motifs for support of FGF7 binding to FGFR2IIIb and anticoagulant activity. The size-defined oligosaccharides were purified from the partially cleaved crude heparin mixture by gel filtration chromatography that was repeated until purity in respect to size was achieved. Purity of oligosaccharides was assessed by gradient PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Bruker Daltonics Inc., Billerica, MA) (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide mixtures were affinity fractionated by graded salt elution from columns of GST-FGF7 (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or GST-FGF1 immobilized on GSH-Sepharose that retain high affinity for heparin. Specific activity of FGF7 and FGF1 prior to and after use in affinity columns was assessed in heparin-dependent FGFR binding assays and mitogenic activity in mammalian cells to ensure use of the highest quality material in affinity separations (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purity of each oligosaccharide fraction in respect to size was again monitored prior to further structural and functional analysis. Affinity purification, activity assessment, and primary structural analysis including the disaccharide compositional analysis of active 7,8-S-OctaF7 has been described in detail (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Octasaccharide fractions from FGF1 bioaffinity were also analyzed by strong anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (SAX-HPLC), MALDI-TOF-MS, and disaccharide composition as described (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Anticoagulant activity of heparin oligosaccharide fractions was monitored by the antithrombin-mediated inhibition of Factor Xa activity as described (24Luo Y. Cho H.-H. McKeehan W.L. J. Pharm.

Here we further examine the activity of isolated oligosaccharide fractions for support of FGF-induced cellular proliferation. Endogenous cellular HS was depressed by chlorate treatment to induce maximum dependence of FGF-stimulated mitogenesis and signaling on external HS (27Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U.

Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 1 ng/ml FGF1, 1 μg/ml insulin, 10 μg/ml holotransferrin, 10-9m dexamethasone, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin/4 μg/ml oleic acid complex, 5 μg/ml ethanolamine, 0.4 ng/ml FeSO4, 0.1 μm l-ascorbic acid, 1 mm pyruvic acid, 60 μg/ml hypoxanthine, 30 nm sodium selenite, 1 mm glutamine, 15 μg/ml l-methionine, 30 μg/ml l-proline, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. Culture flasks were coated with Vitrogen 100 (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) prior to introduction of medium and cells. To maintain a maximum proliferative response with minimal terminal differentiation, MK cultures were maintained below 85% confluence. Stock cultures of mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum according to the standard 3T3 protocol (1:3 dilution after subculture every 3 days). MK and 3T3 cells were synchronized by withdrawal of FGF1 and fetal bovine serum, respectively, and followed by treatment with 30 and 1 mm sodium chlorate, respectively, for 24 h prior to harvest for use in assays. MK (2 × 104) and 3T3 (3 × 105) cells were placed in each well (about 60 mm2 surface) of 48-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) containing 0.3 ml of medium for 1 h. After cell attachment for1hat37 °C,the medium was replaced with fresh FGF1- or fetal bovine serum-free medium containing 30 and 1 mm sodium chlorate for MK and 3T3 cells, respectively. Test oligosaccharide fractions and then FGF were sequentially added. After 16 h, 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added and incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined after4has described (30Luo Y. Gabriel J.L. Wang F. Zhan X. Maciag T. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26876-26883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The activity of 300 nm oligosaccharide fractions was expressed as a percent of DNA synthesis supported by 0.4 and 4 μg/ml crude PIMH standard for MK and 3T3 cells, respectively. These were the minimal amounts of crude PIMH that promoted maximum mitogenic activity as determined in separate dose-response curves and the activity was designated as 100% output for the particular assay conditions. A concentration of single oligosaccharide addition at 300 nm was chosen for comparative studies because this concentration of 7,8-S-OctaF7 elicited peak mitogenic stimulation of FGF7 in mouse keratinocytes. Background DNA synthesis in the absence of oligosaccharide was subtracted. All mitogenic stimulation experiments were repeated at least three times with each sample from three independent preparations. HS-dependent FGF Induction of MAP Kinase Phosphorylation and Cyclin D1 Expression—MK (1 × 105) and 3T3 cells (3 × 105) in each well of 48-well plates prepared as described above for analysis of DNA synthesis were exposed to 5 ng/ml FGF in the presence or absence of 300 nm of the indicated FGF-affinity fractionated octasaccharides. Cells were harvested after 15 min and 16 h, respectively, for analysis of MAP kinase phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 60 μl of cold buffer comprised of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm Na3VO4,and1mm freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, then 30 μl of supernatant from each of the test samples was mixed with SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was assessed with mouse monoclonal antibody 12D4 (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) and expression of cyclin D1 was analyzed with rabbit polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) after treatment with secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Sample loading level was standardized by analysis with β-actin antibody. 7,8-S-OctaF7 Specifically Supports FGF7-induced Mitogenic Activity in FGFR2IIIb-expressing MK—In previous studies (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we isolated a unique and rare undersulfated 7,8-S-OctaF7 by FGF7 bioaffinity. By a combination of quantitative anticoagulant activity analysis and strong anionic exchange, ion-pair reverse phase HPLC and MALDI-TOF-MS applied to both the purified octasaccharide and its reduction to disaccharides, we deduced a composition of two rare ΔHexA2SGlcN6S units, one trisulfated disaccharide, and a third type of disaccharide that could be either unsulfated or monosulfated. The enrichment of anticoagulant activity indicated that the trisulfated disaccharide may bear 3-O-sulfate that is essential for the activity. In contrast, the much more highly sulfated octasaccharides with moderate affinity for FGF7 were comprised of predominantly trisulfated disaccharides (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). No acetyl groups were detected in either the high or moderate affinity fractions for FGF7 (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) despite the fact that heparin fractions that failed to bind or bind with low affinity to either factor were enriched in N-acetyl groups. 4Y.

FGF7 is expressed only in stromal cells that express no FGFR2IIIb and acts on FGFR2IIIb whose expression is restricted to epithelial cells that express no FGF7. 7,8-S-OctaF7 forms complexes with FGFR2IIIb that bind FGF7 to form FGF7-(7,8-S-OctaF7)-FGFR2IIIb complexes with high specificity and specific activity relative to octasaccharides with lower affinity for FGF7 (26Luo Y.

We sought to determine whether the FGF7-(7,8-S-OctaF7)-FGFR2IIIb complex represents a specific active signaling complex in epithelial cells expressing physiological levels of FGFR2IIIb.

MK cells exhibit FGFR2IIIb, and both FGF1 and FGF7 stimulate its DNA synthesis and downstream signaling (28Reich-Slotky R. Bonneh-Barkay D. Shaoul E. Bluma B. Svahn C.M. Ron D. J. Biol.

The stimulation by FGF1 is enhanced by exogenous heparin, whereas stimulation by FGF7 is unaffected and inhibited by increasing levels of external heparin that enhance FGF1 stimulation (28Reich-Slotky R.

This indicated that the endogenous repertoire of HS in MK cells was optimal for support of FGF7 signaling, but deficient for support of FGF1 signaling through FGFR2IIIb. To induce dependence of signaling on external heparin, MK cells were treated with the sulfation inhibitor sodium chlorate for 24 h prior to addition of FGF and heparin. This was followed by comparative assessment of DNA synthesis and activation of downstream signaling pathways induced by both FGF1 and FGF7. Fig. 1A indicates that in contrast to normal MK cells, 7,8-S-OctaF7 is strongly supportive for mitogenic activity induced by FGF7 in HS-deficient cells. Its specific activity is increased many times over crude octasaccharide and octasaccharide mixtures with lower affinity for FGF7. Stimulation was detectable at about 3 nm with half-maximum and maximum activity at 120 and 300 nm, respectively. At 300 nm, 7,8-S-OctaF7 elicited 90% of the maximal activity elicited by unfractionated PIMH at 0.4 μg/ml that was used as a 100% control. The same amount of crude octasaccharide elicited only 27% of maximum (Fig. 1B). The activity of 7,8-S-OctaF7 was 90% or greater than that of the high affinity fractions eluting at 1.0 m NaCl of longer oligosaccharides through a tetradecasaccharide (Fig. 1B, tetradecasaccharide not shown). Oligosaccharides of all lengths with lower affinity for FGF7 were deficient in support of FGF7-induced DNA synthesis. These results confirm that the high specific activity and specificity of 7,8-S-OctaF7 in support of formation of a FGF7-HS-FGFR2IIIb complex (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 1241-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is also reflected in support of the mitogenic activity of FGF7 in MK cells. One or more motifs comprised of the three types of disaccharides that comprise the undersulfated 7,8-S-OctaF7 is sufficient and optimal for eliciting FGF7-induced signaling (26Luo Y. Ye S. Kan M.

Treatment with GnRHs activated a progester-one response element (PRE)-luciferase reporter gene, and this was blocked by protein kinase C and protein kinase A inhibitors but not by RU486. Treatment with GnRHs phosphorylated the PR at Ser294 and increased PR translocation to the nucleus within 1 h. Interactions between the PR and several coactivators were examined, and treatment with GnRHs specifically induced PR-steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) interactions within 8 h. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, recruitment of PR and SRC-3 by the PREs of the luciferase reporter gene or the gonadotopin α-subunit gene promoter was also increased by GnRHs within 8 h, while progesterone-induced recruitment of PR to the PREs occurred in association with much less SRC-3. A small interfering RNA knockdown of type I GnRH receptor levels reduced PR activation by GnRHs, while progesterone-dependent PR activation was unaffected. Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of SRC-3 abolished PRE-luciferase trans-activation by the PR in response to GnRHs. Collectively, these data indicate that PR activation by GnRHs in αT3-1 cells is type I GnRH receptor-mediated and that trans-activation of PR-responsive genes requires SRC-3 in this context.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is regulated by a complex interplay between neuropeptides and steroid hormones. Ovarian steroids such as estradiol (E2) 4The abbreviations used are: E2, estradiol; P4, progesterone; PR, progesterone receptor; PRE, progesterone response element; PKA, protein kinase A; GnRH I, gonadotropin releasing hormone; GnRHR, GnRH receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; GnRH II, second form of GnRH; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. and progesterone (P4) exert positive and negative feedback controls at both hypothalamic and pituitary levels (1Shupnik M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The effects of P4 are mediated primarily through its binding to the progesterone receptor (PR), which belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (2Sartorius C.A.

Biol. 1994; 48: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although the PR is encoded by a single gene, it has two distinct isoforms (PR-A and PR-B), generated by alternative promoter usage (5Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). In general, PR-B is transcriptionally active on most progesterone-responsive promoters, whereas PR-A acts in a more context-restricted manner and can antagonize the effects of PR-B (6Vegeto E. Shahbaz M.M. Wen D.X. Goldman M.E. O'Malley B.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). After binding to a progesterone response element (PRE), the receptors modulate target gene transcription by recruiting components of the transcriptional machinery directly or indirectly by interactions with coregulatory proteins (7Wu R.-C. Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), including members of the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family: SRC-1, SRC-2 (GRIP1/TIF2), and SRC-3 (ACTR/pCIP/RAC3/AIB1/TRAM1) (8Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 45-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). These coactivators serve as adaptors that potentiate the transcriptional activity of different steroid receptors through conserved NR box motifs (9Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar), while their transcriptional activation domains mediate interactions with histone-modifying enzymes (10Alen P. Claessens F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Biochemical and protein-protein interaction studies suggest that SRCs function as components of large multiprotein complexes that integrate inputs from multiple signaling pathways (13Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The activation of PR and other nuclear hormone receptors was initially considered to be entirely steroid-dependent (14Matkovits T. Christakos S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, non-steroidal agents including dopamine, growth factors, and protein kinase A (PKA) activators also stimulate steroid receptor activities in a ligand-independent manner (15Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 16Mani S.K. Allen J.M. Clark J.H. Blaustein J.D. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1994; 265: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). While nuclear hormone receptor phosphorylation has been implicated in these ligand-independent events, they are not fully understood and may be effected at several levels (17Pierson-Mullany L.K. Lange C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10542-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, steroid receptors are phosphorylated on multiple sites in response to hormone or kinase-signaling pathways (17Pierson-Mullany L.K. Lange C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10542-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Clement IV J.P. Prendergast P. Yip T.-T. Hutchens T.W. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the PR is phosphorylated, primarily on serine residues (19Lange C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hypothalamic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH I) plays a pivotal role in pituitary gonadotropin secretion (20Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In pituitary gonadotrope cells, binding of GnRH I to its G protein-coupled receptor (GnRHR) initiates the protein kinase C (PKC)/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway to stimulate transcription of the gonadotropin α-subunit gene (22Weck J. Fallest P.C. Pitt L.K. Shupnik M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 451-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second form of GnRH (GnRH II) exists (23Millar R.P. Milton R.C. Follett B.K. King J.A. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which acts on reproductive tissues (24Cheng C.K. Leung P.C. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 283-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and promotes human chorionic gonadotropin secretion by cytotrophoblastic cells (25Islami D. Chardonnens D. Campana A. Bischof P. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, its mechanisms of action and physiological significance are poorly understood. The classical “type I” GnRHR mediates the actions of GnRH in the pituitary but is present in many other cell types throughout the body. Although a second “type II” GnRHR has also been identified in some primates (26Millar R. Lowe S. Conklin D. Pawson A. Maudsley S. Troskie B. Ott T. Millar M. Lincoln G. Sellar R. Faurholm B.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the gene encoding this receptor is inactivated or deleted from the genome of other mammals, including humans and mice (28Morgan K. Millar R.P. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 2004; 139: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between the PR and GnRH I has been implicated in a GnRH I self-priming mechanism in the pituitary (29Turgeon J.L. Waring D.W. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 2053-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Waring D.W. Turgeon J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3275-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is defined as an enhanced LH secretion by pituitary gonadotropes in response to a second stimulation by GnRH I (31Fink G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This response appears to depend upon the capacity of estrogens to induce PR expression in gonadotropes (31Fink G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 16: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but it is completely absent in PR knock-out mice (32Chappell P.E. Schneider J.S. Kim P. Xu M. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Levine J.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that activation of type I GnRHR in gonadotropes prompts a signaling pathway, which ultimately activates the PR in a ligand-independent manner (33Turgeon J.L. Waring D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for GnRH I self-priming and the ligand-independent activation of the PR by GnRHs in gonadotophs are still unclear. We have therefore explored the effects of GnRH I and GnRH II on ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of the PR in αT3-1 mouse pituitary cells, in which GnRH I and II act via a common type I GnRHR. Cells and Cell Culture—The gonadotrope-derived clonal αT3-1 cell line was provided by Dr. P. L. Mellon (Department of Reproductive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA). The αT3-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The cells were passaged when they reached about 90% confluence using a trypsin/EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA). Plasmids and siRNAs—A PRE-luciferase reporter plasmid, containing two copies of a consensus PRE upstream of the thy-midine kinase promoter, was provided by Dr. D. P. McDonnell (Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). Plasmid DNAs for transfection studies were prepared using Qiagen plasmid maxi kits (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) following the manufacturer's suggested procedure. The concentration and integrity of DNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The siRNA (5′-TGACGGTTGCATTTGCCACTTCAAGAGAGTGGCAAATGCAACCGTCA) for type I GnRHR was produced using pSuper.gfp/neo vector. Two siRNAs for SRC-3 (siSRC-3(a) (5′-UUACUGCUGCUUCUUGGCC) and siSRC-3(b) (30Waring D.W. Turgeon J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3275-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) were obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). PRE-luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Quebec, Canada) following the manufacturer's procedure. To correct for the transfection efficiencies of various luciferase constructs, the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-lacZ plasmid was co-transfected into cells. Briefly, 4 × 105 αT3-1 cells were seeded into six-well tissue culture plates 1 day before transfection in 2 ml phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% charcoal-dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.), which was used as standard culture medium in all experiments unless indicated. One microgram of the PRE-luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of RSV-lacZ were dissolved in 100 μl of standard culture medium containing 3 μl of FuGENE 6.0 without serum. The DNA mixture was incubated for 45 min at room temperature and then applied to the cells. Incubation of the cells with transfection medium continued for 24 h at 37 C in 5% CO2 and a further 48 h in culture medium with E2 (2 × 10–10m) prior to treatments with GnRHs (I or II) or P4. The cellular lysates were collected with 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer and assayed for luciferase activity, and β-galactosidase activity to normalize transfection efficiencies, with commercially available reagents (Promega Corp., Nepean, Canada). Promoter activities were calculated as the luciferase activity/β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 30 min. Endogenous PRs were immunoprecipitated from transfected cell extracts with PR antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein A-magnetic beads (BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The PR-bound proteins were released by incubating the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing mercaptoethanol (5 min, 95 °C) and were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto Hybond-C (Amersham Biosciences, Morgan, Ontario, Canada). The resulting Western blots were blocked with Tris buffered saline (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk for 2 h before addition of antibodies. Antibodies were obtained from Upstate, Lake Placid, NY (SRC-1, catalogue number 05-522; GRIP-1, catalogue number 06–986; SRC-3, catalogue number 05–490), Neomarker, Fremont, CA (Ser294, catalogue number MS1332; type I GnRHR, catalogue number MS-1139), or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA (pCAF, catalogue number sc-13124; gonadotropin α, catalogue number sc-18224). The anti-PR (phosopho-Ser400) antibody was provided Dr. C. A. Lange (Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota). Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and washing of blots were performed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. The ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK) was used for detection, and signals were visualized by exposure to Kodak X-Omat film. Immunocytochemistry—Monolayer-cultured αT3-1 cells were grown in standard culture medium without serum for 16 h and subsequently incubated with serum or hormones (see figure legends for details). After stimulation, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.35% H2O2 for 10 min, and fixed cells were incubated with anti-PR antibody. For a negative control, the first antibody was replaced with the same concentration of rabbit IgG. Detection of the primary antibody was performed with an ABC peroxidase staining kit (DaKoCytomation, Corp., Carpinteria, CA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Unless otherwise stated, all reagents, buffers, and supplies were included in a ChIP-IT™ kit (Active Motif, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, the αT3-1 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing and treatment with glycine Stop-Fix solution, the cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were homogenized, and nuclei were re-suspended in shearing buffer and subjected to optimized ultrasonic disruption conditions to yield 100–400-bp DNA fragments. The chromatin was precleared with protein G beads and incubated (overnight at 4 °C) with 1 μg of the following antibodies: negative control mouse IgG, anti-PR, and anti-SRC-3. Protein G beads were then added to the antibody/chromatin incubation mixtures and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After extensive washings, immunoprecipitated DNA was removed from the beads in an elution buffer. To reverse cross-links and remove RNA, 5 m NaCl and RNase was added to the samples and incubated for 4 h at 65°C. The samples were then treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 42 °C, and the DNA was purified using gel exclusion columns. The purified DNA was subjected to PCR amplification (1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s; 64 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s) of the PRE-luciferase promoter using specific forward (5′-AGAACTCTTGCTTGCTTTGC) and reverse (5′-AATAGCAGACACTCTATGCC) primers and the PRE within the proximal promoter of the gonadotropin α-subunit gene (MGI: 88390) using forward (5′-ATGGGACTATATAGAACACA) and reverse (5′-CATTATTTCAACAGGAAACAG) primers. As an input control, 10% of each chromatin preparation was used. The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 2.5% acrylamide gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining. Data Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Transactivation of PR by GnRH I and GnRH II in αT3-1 Cells—The ability of GnRHs to activate PR-mediated transcription in αT3-1 cells was studied in the absence or presence of P4. In our initial experiments, αT3-1 cells were transfected with the PRE-luciferase reporter plasmid and then treated with either GnRH I or II (10–7m) alone or with P4 (10–7m) alone. Under these conditions, P4 increased the transcriptional activity of PR in a time-dependent manner with maximal activation at 24 h, while GnRH I and II showed maximal effects on PR activation at 8 h (Fig. 1A). When these effects of GnRH I and II were studied in the presence of 10–7m P4, this resulted in a synergistic increase in PR trans-activation of the reporter plasmid after an 8 h treatment (Fig. 1B). These initial experiments led us to suspect that the temporal difference in stimulation of PR by GnRHs and P4 could be attributed to PR acting through ligand-independent and ligand-dependent pathways, respectively. To explore this, cells were cotreated with PKA (H89), or PKC inhibitors (staurosporin and GF109203X), a PR antagonist (RU486), or a GnRH I receptor antagonist (Antide). This showed that cotreatments with staurosporin, GF109203X, H89, and Antide completely blocked the trans-activitation of the PR that was mediated by GnRHs, while RU486 did not (Fig. 2). By contrast, activation of the PR by P4 was blocked completely by RU486 under the same conditions (data not shown). Treatment with GnRHs Affects PR Phosphorylation and Subcellular Distribution—The majority of PR phosphorylation sites contain a Ser-Pro consensus sequence for proline-directed kinases (34Zhang Y. Beck C. Poletti A. Edwards D. Weigel N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since PKC and PKA inhibitors reduced the transcriptional activity of the PR, we investigated whether the PR is phosphorylated by GnRHs or P4. Ser294 and Ser400 of the human PR are conserved in the murine PR and are hyperphosphorylated in response to ligand and mitogens (18Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Clement IV J.P. Prendergast P. Yip T.-T. Hutchens T.W. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Beck C. Poletti A. Edwards D. Weigel N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Ser400 phosphorylation mediates ligand-independent transactivation of the CDK-2 gene by the human PR (17Pierson-Mullany L.K. Lange C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10542-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation of PR phosphorylation in αT3-1 cells, antibodies that recognize both isoforms of PR (PR-A and PR-B) as well as antibodies against phosporylated-PR at Ser294 or Ser400 were used in Western blotting experiments (Fig. 3). This demonstrated that both PR-A and PR-B isoforms are present in αT3-1 cells, but we were unable to detect PR phosphorylated at Ser400 in these cells. Low levels of Ser294-phosphorylated PR-B were detected, while phosphorylation of PR-A at this site was essentially undetectable. Although phosphorylation of mouse PR-B at Ser294 in αT3-1 cells tended to increase at 1–4 h following treatment with GnRH I or GnRH II (Fig. 3), the increases are not significant (p < 0.08). By contrast, there was no increase in PR-B phosphorylation at this site after P4 treatment within this time frame. Since phosphorylation has been reported to influence the cellular distribution of the PR (35Qiu M. Olsen A. Faivre E. Horwitz K.B. Lange C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of PR was examined after treatment with GnRHs over a period of 24 h (Fig. 4). When αT3-1 cells were cultured for 16 h in serum free medium, the PR was predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 4A), while immunoreactive PR is located predominantly in the nucleus of αT3-1 cells cultured in the presence of serum (Fig. 4B). Importantly, when the cells in serum free medium were treated with 10–7m GnRH I or GnRH II, the PR accumulated in the nucleus within 1 h (Fig. 4, C and D), and this persisted up to 24 h (data not shown). Treatment with GnRHs Promotes PR Interactions with SRC-3 and Their Corecruitment to PREs of Target Genes—To examine whether the PR associates with specific coactivators in αT3-1 cells after treatment with GnRHs, we immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-PR antibody and then immunoblotted the released proteins with antibodies to various coactivators. As shown in Fig. 5A, there was no increase in the co-immunopreciptation of pCAF, SRC-1, or SRC-2 with the PR after cells were stimulated with GnRH I or GnRH II. By contrast, both GnRHs increased interaction of the PR with SRC-3, and this again was most apparent at 4–8 h after treatment with GnRH I. Since P4 binding to the PR promotes its interaction with SRC-3 (11Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), we further compared a P4-dependent and ligand-independent (i.e. GnRH-mediated) recruitment of SRC-3 by PR in αT3-1 cells after 8 h of treatment. Under these conditions, none of the hormones influence the total level of either PR-A or PR-B. Although the amount of SRC-3 that immunoprecipitates with PR after GnRH I treatment increased to about the same extent as that observed after P4 treatment, there was a more modest increase in the ligand-independent interactions between SRC-3 and the PR after GnRH II treatment (Fig. 5B). Since SRC-3 possesses histone acetyltransferase activity, which effects chromatin remodeling and transcription (36Chen H. Lin R.J. Schiltz R.L. Chakravarti D. Nash A. Nagy L. Privalsky M.L. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that GnRH I or II treatments influence PR-mediated assembly of SRC-3 at PREs within target genes by ChIP assays. For this purpose, we first used the same synthetic PRE containing reporter gene construct that was introduced by transient transfection into αT3-1 cells. In this context, we found that GnRHs promote very similar levels of PR recruitment to the PRE as that observed after treatment with P4, and this occurred within 4 h of treatment (Fig. 6A). This also showed that treatment with GnRH I induced a robust recruitment of SRC-3 to the same site within the same time frame, which was much greater than the recruitment of SRC-3 to this site after an 8-h treatment with P4. Interestingly, although treatment with either GnRHs caused a similar level of PR recruitment to this PRE, the increase in SRC-3 recruitment to this site after GnRH II treatment was not as effective as after GnRH I treatment, but it was still greater that observed after P4 treatment (Fig. 6A). To determine whether GnRHs can regulate an endogenous target gene (21Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in this way, we used ChIP assays to evaluate the recruitment of the PR and SRC-3 to the PRE within the gonadotropin α-subunit gene promoter in αT3-1 cells (Fig. 6B). In this experiment, we observed a very rapid (within 1 h) recruitment of PR to this PRE after treatment with GnRH I or GnRH II, and this was more pronounced and longer lasting after GnRH I treatment. However, both GnRHs appear to recruit more PR to this site than after treatment with P4. Interestingly only GnRH I treatment resulted in a clear and consistent increase in recruitment of SRC-3 to the gonadotropin α-subunit gene PRE (Fig. 6B). To confirm that GnRH treatments influence gonadotropin α-subunit gene expression under these conditions, we performed a Western blot to measure gonadotropin α-subunit levels in the cells. This showed that GnRH I and GnRH II both increase the cellular gonadotropin α-subunit content within the same time frame, i.e. 8 h after treatment (Fig. 6C), while P4 does not (data not shown). These results are in line with the changes in recruitment of PR and SRC-3 to the PRE within the gonadotropin α-subunit gene promoter after treatment with GnRHs and P4 (Fig. 6B) and our observations that GnRH I consistently enhances transactivation of target genes by PR to a greater extent than GnRH II. Type I GnRH Receptor and SRC-3 Are Required for GnRH-mediated PR Activation—Since mouse αT3-1 cells only possess the type I GnRH receptor, we used siRNA to decrease its expression in order to determine if it mediates the ligand-independent transactivation of the PR by GnRH I or GnRH II in these cells (Fig. 7). A Western blot demonstrated that the siRNA treatment very effectively decreased type I GnRH receptor levels prior to the introduction of the PRE-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 7). When these cells were then treated with GnRH I or GnRH II, the PRE-reporter gene was reduced substantially over that observed in cells that contain normal levels of the type I GnRH receptor (Fig. 7). In this context, it should also be noted that the siRNA-induced loss of type I GnRH receptor had no influence on the ligand (P4)-dependent transactivation of the PRE-reporter gene (Fig. 7). These data confirm that the type I GnRH receptor mediates the ligand-independent activation of the PRE-reporter gene by GnRH I and GnRH II. We also used siRNAs to explore whether SRC-3 is essential for the GnRH-induced trans-activation of the PRE-luciferase reporter gene. Transfection of αT3-1 cells with two siRNAs resulted in substantial decreases in the cellular content of SRC-3, as shown by Western blotting, with a greater decrease being observed with the siSRC-3(b) treatment (Fig. 8A). The results of this experiment are particularly important because they demonstrate that loss of SRC-3 has a much greater impact on the rapid (within 8 h), ligand-independent effects of the GnRHs on PRE-luciferase reporter gene activation, as compared with the ligand (P4)-dependent transactivation of the PR within this same time frame. In fact treatment with siSRC-3(b) completely blocked the ligand-independent transactivation of the PRE-luciferase reporter by both GnRHs acting either alone (Fig. 8A) or in synergy with P4 (Fig. 8B). The main function of GnRH I in the pituitary is to promote gonadotropin secretion (20Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In female rats, sequential treatments of GnRH I enhance substantially the production of gonadotophins (33Turgeon J.L. Waring D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar), and this self-priming effect is thought to involve the PR because it is absent in PR knock-out mice (32Chappell P.E. Schneider J.S. Kim P. Xu M. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Levine J.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3653-3658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, this effect has been reported to be due to the ligand-independent activation of the PR by GnRH I in primary pituitary cell cultures (33Turgeon J.L. Waring D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 860-869PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed this latter observation by using an established mouse pituitary cell line (αT3-1 cells) and have also shown that GnRH II promotes the ligand-independent activation of the PR in these cells. Although both GnRHs function rapidly in this context, i.e. within 8 h, GnRH I consistently evoked a more robust response than GnRH II. However, our data indicate that the ligand-independent activation of the PR by both GnRHs is mediated via the type I GnRHR and involves the PKA and PKC pathways. Numerous studies have indicated that the ligand-independent activation of nuclear hormone receptors, including the PR, involve an alteration in the phosphorylation of the receptors themselves (17Pierson-Mullany L.K. Lange C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10542-10557Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Clement IV J.P. Prendergast P. Yip T.-T. Hutchens T.W. Edwards D.P.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8720-8730Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and these are likely to vary depending on the cell-type and hormone stimulus. Although treatment with GnRHs do not result in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of PR-B at Ser294 within 1–4 h in αT3-1 cells, this may still contribute (35Qiu M. Olsen A. Faivre E. Horwitz K.B. Lange C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 628-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) in part to the rapid (within 1 h) relocation of the PR from cytoplasm to the nucleus of serum-starved cells after treatment with either GnRH I or GnRH II. We have not explored the mechanisms responsible for the cellular redistribution of the PR, but receptor coactivators, such as SRC-3, also undergo rapid cytoplasmic to nuclear translocations under similar conditions (39Qutob M.S. Bhattacharjee R.N. Pollari E. Yee S.P. Torchia J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6611-6626Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to examine the interaction between PR and various coactivator proteins within αT3-1 cells after stimulation with GnRHs in the absence of P4. These studies showed that a substantial and specific increase in PR interaction with SRC-3 occurs 8 h after treatment with GnRHs, and this again was most evident after GnRH I treatment. Thus, PR phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus appear to occur prior to its increased association with SRC-3. To explore the relevance of GnRH-induced interactions between PR and SRC-3 in relation to the ligand-independent activation of PR responsive genes, we performed ChIP assays to examine the loading of PR and SRC-3 onto PREs within the promoters of a transiently transfected reporter gene, as well as the most relevant endogenous GnRH-responsive gene in the pituitary (i.e. the gonadotropin α-subunit gene). In these assays, a rapid and robust recruitment of both PR and SRC-3 to the multiple PREs within the PRE-luciferase reporter gene was observed after GnRH I treatment. Although GnRH II increased recruitment of PR to this PRE, it occurred in concert with much less SRC-3 than that observed after GnRH I treatment. However, in both cases, treatments with GnRHs elicited a more robust response than that observed after the ligand-dependent recruitment of PR to the PRE. In the context of the PRE within the gonadotropin α-subunit gene promoter, it appears that GnRH I and GnRH II treatments cause a very rapid (within 1 h) loading of the PR onto the PRE, which in the case of GnRH I treatment clearly occurs prior to the recruitment of SRC-3. However, again treatments with either GnRHs caused a much more robust recruitment of PR to the endogenous PRE within 8 h of treatment, as compared with P4 treatment. The relevance of these effects was confirmed by showing that GnRH treatments increased the expression of the gonadotropin α-subunit gene within the same time frame. In these ChiP assays, substantially more SRC-3 appeared to be recruited to PREs by GnRHs than that observed after P4 treatment, while the PR-SRC-3 interactions observed in co-immunoprecipitation assays showed a similar pattern after treatments with both GnRHs and P4. As suggested by recent studies (40Yi P. Wu R.C. Sandquist J. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Means A.R. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9687-9699Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41Wu R.C. Qin J. Yi P. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 937-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), multiple cellular signaling pathways phosphorylate SRC-3 and regulate the activities of steroid receptors. It is therefore possible that GnRHs increase phosphorylation of SRC-3, and this induces recruitment of SRC-3 to PREs in a ligand-independent manner. To demonstrate that SRC-3 plays a pivotal role in the GnRH-induced ligand-independent activation of the PR in αT3-1 cells, we substantially reduced their SRC-3 levels using an siRNA approach. These studies clearly indicated that loss of SRC-3 from the cells essentially eliminates the ability of GnRH I and GnRH II to activate the PRE-luciferase reporter gene in the absence or presence of P4. In this context, it also appears that loss of SRC-3 effects the ligand-independent activation of the reporter gene by GnRHs more effectively than that observed after P4 treatment. This suggests a qualitative difference in the transcriptional complexes that assemble at the PREs in response to the ligand-dependent versus ligand-independent activation of the PR. Taken together, our studies indicate that the self-priming of gonadotropin gene expression in pituitary cells by GnRH is mediated via the type I GnRHR. More importantly, we show that treatment of αT3-1 cells with GnRHs, and GnRH I in particular, results in rapid changes in PR phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with PREs followed by the recruitment of SRC-3. We also provide evidence that the interaction between the PR and SRC-3 is essential for the ligand-independent trans-activation of the PR in response to GnRH I and GnRH II treatment."

This compound and its derivatives can account for up to 10% of the total mass of the flagellar glycoproteins. Recent reports have begun to uncover the pathway for pseudaminic acid biosynthesis and several of the enzymes have now been identified and characterized. The pathway begins by the action of a dehydratase, PseB, on UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to generate a 6-deoxy-4-keto derivative, UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-4-hexulose (11Schoenhofen I.C.

Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unlike most known sugar nucleotide dehydratases, the reaction is accompanied by an inversion of configuration at C5 and the initially formed product is of the l-configuration (as is required for Pse biosynthesis). In the second step, an aminotransferase, PseC, installs an amino group at C4 to give UDP-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-β-l-AltNAc (12Schoenhofen I.C. Lunin V.V. Julien J.-P. Li Y. Ajamian E. Matte A.

It is then proposed that an as yet unidentified acetyltranferase acetylates the 4-amino group and generates UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-β-l-altrose (UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc). A subsequent hydrolase would cleave the UDP-linkage and generate the free sugar 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-l-altrose (6-deoxy-AltdiNAc). This compound has recently been shown to serve as a substrate for pseudaminic acid synthase, NeuB3, which condenses it with phosphoenolpyruvate to give Pse (13Chou W.K. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W.

Finally, the Pse is converted into its activated form, CMP-Pse, presumably by a CTP-dependent synthetase, and is thereby readied for use by the transferases involved in flagellar glycosylation. In this paper, the C. jejuni UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc hydrolase (PseG or Cj1312) responsible for the formation 6-deoxy-Altdi-NAc is identified for the first time. It is found to be a member of the GT-B superfamily of metal-independent glycosyltransferases and catalyzes the reaction via a C–O bond cleavage mechanism with inversion of stereochemistry at C-1. Materials and General Methods—UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, lactate dehydrogenase (Type II from rabbit muscle), and pyruvate kinase (Type II from rabbit muscle) were purchased from Sigma. 18O-Enriched H2O (95%) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). 1H and 31P NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker AV300/AV400 NMR spectrometers. Mass spectra were obtained on a Waters Micromass LCT mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS). Cloning of pseG—The pseG gene (Cj1312) was amplified from C. jejuni (strain NCTC 11168) genomic DNA by PCR. Oligonucleotide primers, including overhangs for ligation-independent cloning, were: 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCATGAAAGTGCTTTTTAGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTCAATACTTATACTCCA-3′(antisense). To a 200-μl tube were added: 5 μl of 10 × PCR reaction buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of dNTP mix (PCR grade, Invitrogen), 125 ng of each primer, 100 ng of template DNA, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and distilled H2O to make a total volume of 50 μl. PCR was conducted on an iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with the following cycles: 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 90 s at 72 °C, and one cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cloned into a pET-30 Xa/LIC vector (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting recombinant plasmid, which encodes a His6-tag on the N-terminal of the target pseG protein, was amplified in NovaBlue GigaSingles competent Escherichia coli cells (Novagen). Overexpression and Purification of His6-tagged pseG, pseB, and pseC—The recombinant pseG plasmi.d was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells which were incubated in 10 ml LB medium containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin at 37 °C/225 rpm for 10 h. The overnight culture was then poured into 500 ml of LB medium containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin and shaken at 37 °C/225 rpm until an A600 of 0.6 had been reached. The culture was allowed to continue to grow for 5 h after 70 mg/liter of isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Cells were harvested by centrifuging at 6000 × g for 30 min and then resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/liter of aprotinin, and 1 mg/liter pepstatin A. The cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 1 h and passed through a 0.22-μm filter. A column containing 10 ml of chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) was charged with 20 ml of 100 mm NiSO4, washed with 20 ml of distilled H2O and 30 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm of imidazole). The clarified lysate was loaded onto the column and eluted with the same buffer containing increasing amounts of imidazole in a stepwise fashion (5 mm, 125 mm, and 500 mm). Eluate fractions that were eluted with 500 mm imidazole and showed absorbance at 280 nm were collected. These fractions were concentrated using Amicon Ultra Centricons (Millipore) before flash freezing with liquid N2 in the presence of 10% glycerol and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The preparation of the plasmids used in the overexpression of His6-tagged PseB (Cj1293) and PseC (Cj1294) has been described previously (11Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D.

The conditions used for overexpression of these proteins were identical to those described above for PseG with the exception that the growth media used to prepare PseC contained 50 mg/liter ampicillin in place of kanamycin. The clarified lysates obtained following lysis and filtering were used directly without further purification. Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc—Samples of the crude lysates containing PseB and PseC (100 μl each) were added to 100 ml of triethanolamine HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 450 mg of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine disodium salt, 0.1 m monosodium glutamate, 0.25 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 0.25 mm NAD+. This solution was incubated for 4 h at 37°C and the reaction progress was monitored by negative ESI-MS. It was determined that >90% of the UDP-GlcNAc (m/z 606, M – H+) was converted to UDP-6-deoxy-4-amino-2-diacetamido-l-altrose (m/z 589, M – H+) during this time. Enzyme was then removed by centrifugation and centrifugal ultrafiltration. The resultant filtrate was loaded onto a 220-ml column of DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman Inc.) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer. The eluant was monitored at A254, and UV-active fractions were analyzed by ESI-MS. Those containing UDP-6-deoxy-4-amino-2-diacetamido-l-altrose were lyophilized to dryness. The lyophilized UDP-6-deoxy-4-amino-2-diacetamido-l-altrose (310 mg) was stirred with 0.5 g of silver acetate and 0.8 ml of acetic anhydride in 25 ml of methanol at room temperature for 12 h. Negative ESI-MS showed that the starting material was completely converted to UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (m/z 631, M – H+) during this time. After filtration and evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, the product was loaded onto a DE52 anion exchange column and subjected to linear gradient elution as described above. After lyophilization, the product was dissolved in 10 ml of H2O and passed through a 20-ml column of Amberlite IR120 resin (sodium form, Aldrich). The eluant was re-lyophilized to give 173 mg of the UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc disodium salt. 1H NMR(D2O) δ 1.29 (d, 3H, J5″,6″ 6.3 Hz, H-6″), 2.06 (s, 3H, CH3), 2.09 (s, 3H, CH3), 3.91 (dd, 1H, J3″,4″ 3.1 Hz, J4″,5″ 9.2 Hz, H-4″), 4.04 (dd, 1H, J2″,3″ 4.6 Hz, J3″,4″ 3.1 Hz, H-3″), 4.05 (dq, 1H, J4″,5″ 9.2 Hz, J5″,6″ 6.3 Hz, H-5″), 4.19 (dd, 1H, J1″,2″ 2.2 Hz, J2″,3″ 4.6 Hz, H-2″), 4.23 (m, 2H, H-5′), 4.30 (m, 1H, H-4′), 4.39 (m, 2H, H-2′ and H-3′), 5.66 (dd, 1H, J1″,2″ 2.2 Hz, JH,P 8.5 Hz, H-1″), 5.98 (m, 2H, H-1′, and H-5), 8.00 (d, 1H, J6′,7′ 8.14 Hz, H-6). 31P NMR(D2O) δ – 10.31 (d, JPα,Pβ 20.0 Hz, Pα), –12.40 (d, JPα,Pβ 20.0 Hz, Pβ). Chemical Hydrolysis and Characterization of the Product—To a 1-ml solution containing 6 mg of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc was added 50 μl of concentrated HCl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then loaded on a 10-ml column of DE52 anion exchange resin and eluted with distilled H2O. The flow-through was collected, lyophilized, and re-dissolved in D2O. 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that the mixture of 6-deoxy-2,4-diacetamido-l-altrose anomers produced was identical to that obtained from chemical synthesis (13Chou W.K.

Enzyme Kinetics Using a Continuous Coupled Assay—Enzyme kinetics were measured using a continuous coupled assay for UDP formation, under conditions slightly modified from those described by Chou et al. (19Chou W.K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. Tanner M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2455-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Each cuvette contained 50 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 20 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 18 units of pyruvate kinase, and the UDP-6-deoxy-Alt-diNAc concentration was varied from 25–2000 μm. The concentrations of stock UDP-sugar solutions were determined by measuring A262 (ϵ = 9 890 m–1 cm–1). Enzymatic reactions were initiated by addition of 20 μl of enzyme solution (final concentration 7.9 nm). Rates were measured by monitoring the decrease A340 at 37 °C. Kinetics parameters were determined by fitting initial velocities to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraFit 4.0. No detectable background release of UDP was observed in the absence of added PseG. Metal Dependence Experiment—Two aliquots of a solution containing UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc disodium salt (6 mg per aliquot) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) were prepared. To one aliquot was added MgCl2 and to the other was added EDTA tetrasodium salt (each at a 10 mm final concentration in a total volume of 990 μl). PseG (10 μl of a 33 μm stock solution) was added to each sample and the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The progress of the reactions was monitored using 31P NMR spectroscopy with integration of the diphosphate signals. Reaction Stereochemistry and Deuterium Incorporation—A glycerol stock solution of PseG (200 μl, 33 μm) was subjected to buffer exchange with a 20 mm Tris-DCl/D2O buffer (pD 7.4, 200 μl final volume) using centrifugal ultrafiltration. This was added to a solution of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc disodium salt (5 mg) dissolved in 800 μl of D2O (1 ml final volume), and 1H NMR spectra were acquired at timed intervals. To assign the signals of the anomeric products, a sample of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc disodium salt was dissolved in D2O and analyzed by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy with irradiation at 5.28 ppm (H1 of the major anomer at equilibrium). An nuclear Overhauser effect enhancement of the H5 signal confirmed that the β-anomer was the predominant species at equilibrium. Assignment of the H5 signal was achieved using COSY spectroscopy via an observed correlation with the H6 methyl signal (see supplemental Figs. 3 and 4 for spectral details on this section). 18O Incorporation Experiment—A solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 400 μl) was prepared using 50% H 162O/50%H 182O and was divided into two equal aliquots. To one aliquot was added UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (5.0 mg) and to the other was added 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (2.5 mg) and UDP (4.0 mg). PseG (10 μl of a 33 μm stock solution) was added to each sample, and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature. Isotope incorporation was monitored by both positive (sugar detection) and negative (UDP detection) ESI-MS as a function of time. The extent of incorporation into 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc was deduced from the ratio of peaks at m/z 269 (16O, M + Na+) and m/z 271 (18O, M + Na+ + 2). Preparation of the Hydrolase Substrate UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc—One of the main difficulties in identifying the enzymes involved in Pse biosynthesis is the difficulty in obtaining the substrates for the advanced steps of the pathway. In previous work (13Chou W.K. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Tanner M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35922-35928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Liav A. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 30: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), a chemical synthesis approach was used to obtain the 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc that serves as the substrate for pseudaminic acid synthase. The length of the synthesis and the number of low yielding steps, however, make this approach impractical for a synthesis of UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc. For this compound an enzymatic approach would be superior, however, it is complicated somewhat by the fact that the putative acetyltransferase has not yet been identified. In this work, the dehydratase and aminotransferase enzymes, PseB and PseC (Fig. 1A), from C. jejuni were used to prepare UDP-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-β-l-AltNAc in a multimilligram scale (11Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.-R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This compound was purified by ion exchange chromatography, and then the C-4 amino group was chemically acetylated by acetic anhydride/silver acetate to give the hydrolase substrate, UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (15Liav A. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 30: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After purification, this material gave a mass spectrum and 31P NMR/1H NMR spectra (see supplemental Fig. 1) that were consistent with the expected structure. To further confirm the structure of this compound, a small sample was subjected to a mild acidic hydrolysis that cleaved the glycoside from the UDP moiety. The 1H NMR spectrum of the resulting sugar proved to be identical to that of chemically synthesized 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (see supplemental Fig. 2) (13Chou W.K. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Tanner M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35922-35928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Liav A. Sharon N. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 30: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This confirms that the stereochemical assignments recently made on the product of the PseB/C pair were correct (11Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young N.M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.-R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Identification of the UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc Hydrolase from C. jejuni—The search for enzymes involved in pseudaminic acid biosynthesis has been strongly influenced by an understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of the related α-keto acid, sialic acid (or N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc) (16Tanner M.E. Bioorg. Chem. 2005; 33: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In bacteria, sialic acid biosynthesis also begins with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, and the first step is catalyzed by the hydrolyzing UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, NeuC (Fig. 1B) (17Murkin A.S. Chou W.K. Wakarchuk W.W. Tanner M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14290-14298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Vann W.F. Daines D.A. Murkin A.S. Tanner M.E. Chaffin D.O. Rubens C.E. Vionnet J. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes both an inversion of stereochemistry at C-2 and the hydrolysis of the glycosyl-UDP bond to give the free sugar, ManNAc. Mechanistic studies have shown that the reaction proceeds via an anti-elimination of UDP to give the enzyme-bound intermediate 2-acetamidoglucal, followed by the syn-addition of water to give ManNAc (17Murkin A.S. Chou W.K. Wakarchuk W.W. Tanner M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14290-14298Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Chou W.K. Hinderlich S. Reutter W. Tanner M.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 2455-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a subsequent step the ManNAc is condensed with phosphoenolpyruvate by sialic acid synthase, NeuB, which is homologous to pseudaminic acid synthase and employs a similar reaction mechanism (20Gunawan J. Simard D. Gilbert M. Lovering A.L. Wakarchuk W.W. Tanner M.E. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3555-3563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Sundaram A.K. Pitts L. Muhammad K. Wu J. Betenbaugh M. Woodard R.W. Vann W.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Finally, the sialic acid is activated as its CMP form by CMP-sialic acid synthetase, NeuA (22Munster-Kuhnel A.K. Tiralongo J. Krapp S. Weinhold B. Ritz-Sedlacek V. Jacob U. Gerardy-Schahn R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Mosimann S.C. Gilbert M. Dombrowski D. To R. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8190-8196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since the overall strategy employed in pseudaminic acid biosynthesis (the use of UDP-GlcNAc in ultimately forming a CMP-linked α-keto acid) is known to be the same as in sialic acid biosynthesis (24Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal Chem. 2004; 76: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and since the key synthases are closely related (13Chou W.K. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Tanner M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35922-35928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Gunawan J. Simard D. Gilbert M. Lovering A.L.

Betenbaugh M. Woodard R.W. Vann W.F. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that the hydrolases may also be homologous. Such an enzyme could catalyze the elimination of UDP from UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc to give a glycal intermediate and then hydrate the double bond of the glycal with overall retention of stereochemistry at C-2 to give the hydrolysis product, 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc. A C. jejuni gene, Cj1328 or NeuC2, was found to share 32.5% sequence identity with the Neisseria menigitidis NeuC and had been implicated in the biosynthesis of an acetamidino-containing derivative of pseudaminic acid, PseAm (25Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Thibault P. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NeuC2 was therefore overexpressed in E. coli both in a His-tagged form and as a fusion with the maltose-binding protein. In the former construct, the vast majority of the expressed protein was insoluble, and the small amounts of soluble protein that were retained on a metal affinity column showed no hydrolase activity with the substrate. The latter construct gave large quantities of soluble protein that could be purified on an amylose column; however, no hydrolase activity could be observed with the resulting protein either before or after cleavage of the maltose binding protein from NeuC2 using thrombin. It appears that NeuC2 is involved in the biosynthesis of PseAm, in a pathway that is distinct from Pse biosynthesis. A second target for the C. jejuni hydrolase gene of Pse biosynthesis was identified from a report on proteins that were required for flagellar glycosylation in H. pylori (26Josenhans C. Vossebein L. Friedrich S. Suerbaum S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 210: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two overlapping genes, neuA (HP0326a) and flmD (HP0326b), encoded for these proteins and mutations in these genes severely impaired the flagellar glycosylation process. The neuA gene product is homologous to the NeuA of sialic acid biosynthesis and likely encodes for a CMP-pseudaminic acid synthetase, although this has not yet been demonstrated. The flmD gene product was assigned as a putative glycosyltransferase and was thought to be involved in transfer of a carbohydrate onto the flagellin protein. It was also noted that the homologs of these two genes colocalized in several other strains of flagellated bacteria, including C. jejuni (Cj1311/Cj1312), although in this case they did not overlap. In our search for a sugar nucleotide hydrolase involved in Pse biosynthesis, a putative glycosyltransferase could represent a likely candidate since transfer of the glycoside to water as an acceptor would constitute a hydrolysis reaction. Further PSI-BLAST homology searching on the C. jejuni homolog, PseG or Cj1312, indicated that it most closely resembled N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in the metal-independent GT-B superfamily that includes the peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme MurG (27Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 28Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc.

PseG was therefore overexpressed in E. coli with an N-terminal His-tag. The soluble protein was purified by metal affinity chromatography and was found to be > 95% pure as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Fig. 5). Subsequent analysis revealed that this enzyme was indeed a UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc hydrolase. Analysis of the UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc Hydrolase Reaction—Incubation of the hydrolase with UDP-6-deoxy-AltdiNAc and monitoring the reaction by both 31P NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry showed that free UDP was being generated along with a sugar whose mass was consistent with that of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc. The sugar was isolated from all charged species by passage through an ion exchange column and its structure was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy with comparison to a synthetic standard of 6-deoxy-AltdiNAc (13Chou W.K.

https://openalex.org/W2109616052,"Skeletal muscle atrophy results from an imbalance in protein degradation and protein synthesis and occurs in response to injury, various disease states, disuse, and normal aging. Current treatments for this debilitating condition are inadequate. More information about mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of muscle atrophy is necessary for development of more effective therapies. Here we show that expression of the mouse ether-a-go-go related gene (Merg1a) K+ channel is up-regulated in skeletal muscle of mice experiencing atrophy as a result of both malignant tumor expression and disuse. Further, ectopic expression of Merg1a in vivo induces atrophy in healthy wt-bearing mice, while expression of a dysfunctional Merg1a mutant suppresses atrophy in hindlimb-suspended mice. Treatment of hindlimb-suspended mice with astemizole, a known Merg1a channel blocker, inhibits atrophy in these animals. Importantly, in vivo expression of Merg1a in mouse skeletal muscle activates the ubiquitin proteasome pathway that is responsible for the majority of protein degradation that causes muscle atrophy, yet expression of a dysfunctional Merg1a mutant decreases levels of ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis. Thus, expression of Merg1a likely initiates atrophy by activating ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis. This gene and its product are potential targets for prevention and treatment of muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2076999300,"We used a bacterial complementation screen with the LB2003 K+ uptake-deficient strain of Escherichia coli to analyze residues that are critical to Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum potassium channel (MthK) function. Channel expression and relative structural integrity of mutants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot, and mechanisms underlying altered mutant channel function were analyzed using single-channel recording. We observed that wild-type MthK expression complements K+ uptake deficiency. Although MthK function was previously thought to require Ca2+ in the millimolar range, we demonstrate that at elevated temperatures the requirement for Ca2+ becomes much lower. Mutations at the cytoplasmic mouth of the MthK pore can blunt complementation, indicating that those mutant channels cannot support K+ uptake. In contrast, substitutions at the Ca2+-binding site in the MthK RCK domain did not decrease complementation compared with wild-type MthK. We focused on mutations to residues Glu-92 and Glu-96, which may form the narrowest part of the pore in the channel's closed state. Mutations at these residues can yield slight changes in single-channel conductance that do not necessarily correlate with effects on bacterial complementation. However, mutations at Glu-92 could also change channel open probability, and these changes correlated with complementation effects. The most striking of these mutations was E92A, which nearly eliminated bacterial complementation by decreasing the open probability of MthK. Our results suggest that the small, hydrophobic alanine side chain at the K+ channel bundle crossing may generate an intrinsically stable structure, which in turn shifts the closed-to-open-state equilibrium toward the closed state.

MthK 2The abbreviations used are: MthK, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum potassium channel; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; RCK, regulator of conductance of potassium; TM2, transmembrane segment 2; DM, decyl maltoside; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WT, wild type. is a calcium-gated potassium channel for which the structure was solved to 3.3 Å resolution using x-ray methods (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed MthK in its apparent open conformation; the pore-lining segments of the channel are splayed and receptive to the flow of permeant ions instead of forming a bundle crossing, which would sterically hinder ion conduction, as seen in the structure of the KcsA potassium channel (Fig. 1) (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

The C-terminal end of TM2, in turn, is connected to a large cytoplasmic domain, called the RCK domain (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Each MthK RCK domain contains a Ca2+-binding site. By sequence comparison and alignment, at least one apparent RCK-like domain can be found within the large cytoplasmic tail region of the mammalian maxi-K channel, and consequently MthK has served as a model to provide insight toward maxi-K channel structure and gating mechanism (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Qian X. Magleby K.L. Neuron. 2004; 42: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the force that opens the TM2 “gate” comes from a Ca2+-dependent conformational change in the RCK domains, which in turn tugs on a linker segment that is directly connected to TM2 (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). To be consistent with the principle underlying allosteric modulation of the channel, one would predict that in the Ca2+-bound conformation, the “splaying apart” of the TM2 segments (which opens the channel) is clearly energetically favored. TM2 can also presumably bend to close the channel while Ca2+ is bound, just as the channel can open while the channel is not Ca2+-bound, although the closed state is favored. In principle, the intrinsic equilibrium between the two primary conformations of TM2 would not depend directly on Ca2+ and could be modulated by other interactions, such as interactions among side chains near the TM2 bundle crossing, as observed with mutants of the Shaker K+ channel (6Sukhareva M. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Kitaguchi T. Sukhareva M. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To look for potential interactions that may modulate the intrinsic MthK gating equilibrium, we used a bacterial complementation strategy. Using Escherichia coli strains that are deficient in K+ uptake, we identified a series of mutations that decreased complementation (and thus K+ uptake) in the strains. We then characterized the mutants using biochemical and electrophysiological assays. Our studies demonstrate that wild-type MthK is complementary in K+ uptake-deficient E. coli and thus supports K+ uptake via its open pore, whereas several mutations near the putative TM2 bundle crossing can reduce or eliminate complementation, primarily by reducing channel open probability. Because spontaneous channel opening is reduced in these mutants at very low Ca2+, as indicated by our complementation assay, and Ca2+-dependent opening is reduced at higher Ca2+, as shown in our electrophysiological recordings, our studies suggest that the negative charge at Glu-92 near the putative MthK bundle crossing may be critical in determining the relative stability of the open conformation of MthK. Plasmids and E. coli Strains—E. coli strain LB2003 (ΔtrkA kup1 (trkD1) ΔkdpABC5 rpsL metE thi rha gal) (8Stumpe S. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Evert Bakker (University of Osnabruck, Germany). MthK wild-type cDNA (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Christopher Miller (HHMI, Brandeis University), was obtained in the pQE-70 vector, subcloned into the pQE-82L vector (Qiagen) between the SphI and BglII restriction sites, and then modified by inserting a thrombin-cleavable His6 tag at the C-terminal end of the gene and deleting the N-terminal His6 tag from the pQE-82L vector. Site-specific mutants were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Complementation Assay—Complementation was assayed as described previously (9Parfenova L.V. Rothberg B.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar), except that the LB2003 strain was used in the present studies. Briefly, bacteria were transformed with plasmid DNA and grown overnight in high K+ medium (KLM) containing 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter KCl, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. From the overnight culture, 100 μl was diluted in 5 ml of KLM and grown to A600 = 0.5. Channel expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. After 2 h of induction, the cell density was measured, and the culture was diluted (normalized) to an A600 of 0.5. A 1-ml sample of this suspension was pelleted and stored at -20 °C to be used in SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. 3.5-μl drops of the diluted cell suspension were spotted on ampicillin plates containing 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter tryptone, and either 100 mm KCl with 15 mm NaCl or 1 mm KCl with 114 mm NaCl, with or without IPTG. Reproducibility of complementation results was confirmed in at least three different experiments for each mutant. To assay bacterial growth in liquid medium, the culture density of induced transformants was normalized as described above, centrifuged (10,000 × g for 2 min), washed once, and used as innoculum for growth in LB with 2 mm KCl, ampicillin, and IPTG. Western Blot—Pelleted samples of induced transformants (see above) were resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 4 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, pH 6.0. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and 10 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and loaded into a 10% polyacrylamide gel. After separation by SDS-PAGE, protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated in blocking buffer (TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for 60 min. Penta-His monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) was added followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the membrane was washed three times with TBS and incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry) in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times, and antibody was visualized using peroxidase-3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (DAB substrate kit, Vector Laboratories). Channel Purification and Reconstitution—MthK was expressed and purified essentially as described previously (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Briefly, MthK wild-type and mutants were expressed in E. coli XL-1 Blue cells on induction with 0.4 mm IPTG. Bacteria were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.6 (Buffer A), and lysed by sonication in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The protein was solubilized by 2 h of incubation in Buffer A with 50 mm decyl maltoside (DM) (Anatrace) followed by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Talon Co2+ affinity column (Clontech) and washed with 20 mm imidazole and 5 mm DM in Buffer A, and the channel protein was eluted using 400 mm imidazole and 5 mm DM in Buffer A. The His6 tag was cleaved immediately after elution by incubating with 2.0 units of thrombin/3.0 mg of eluted protein for 2 h at room temperature. Protein was concentrated to a volume of 1 ml using an Amicon Ultra filter (molecular weight cutoff 10,000), further purified on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column, and then concentrated again and reconstituted into liposomes composed of E. coli lipids (Avanti). Protein concentrations in liposomes ranged from 5 to 50 μg of protein/mg of lipid. Electrophysiology—Recordings were obtained using planar lipid bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (POPE:POPG, 3:1) in a horizontal bilayer chamber at 22-24 °C, except where indicated otherwise. Solutions in both chambers contained 200 mm KCl and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with added CaCl2 ranging from 0.5 to 25 mm to activate the channels. Ca2+ buffers were not used in our recording solutions. We estimated the concentration of contaminating Ca2+ in our solutions to be ∼10 μm, as measured with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Orion Research). Orientation of mutant channels in the bilayer membrane was typically identified using the intrinsic inward rectification properties of the channels (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological data (open probability and unitary conductance measurements) are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three different experiments for each data point. MthK Complements Growth in K+ Uptake-deficient Bacteria—Our strategy was to use a bacterial complementation assay as a rapid screen for mutants that alter MthK channel functionality. We used the LB2003 E. coli strain, which is deficient in K+ uptake. This E. coli strain will not survive in normal LB medium, but K+ uptake (and thus survival) can be complemented if the bacteria are made to express an open K+ channel (10Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Hellmer J. Zeilinger C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Ptak C.P. Cuello L.G. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We observed that the MthK channel complements bacterial survival in the K+ uptake-deficient LB2003 strain (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with our previous observation that MthK complements survival in the similarly K+ uptake-deficient TK2446 strain (9Parfenova L.V. Rothberg B.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 337: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that complementation by MthK requires expression of the pore-forming transmembrane region; expression of the cytoplasmic RCK domain alone does not support K+ uptake. This suggests that the K+ uptake pathway in the transformed bacteria is likely to be the open MthK pore. MthK Channel Opening Is Increased at Elevated Temperature—The complementation due to MthK wild-type (WT) channel expression (Fig. 2) suggests that the MthK channel opens in vivo, in the E. coli membrane. We were at first surprised by this result, because in lipid bilayer experiments it appears that MthK opening requires millimolar levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+, which is much higher than the levels of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ in E. coli (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 13Jones H.E. Holland I.B. Baker H.L. Campbell A.K. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, previous lipid bilayer recordings were performed at room temperature (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Thus we hypothesized that at 37 °C, the temperature of the complementation assay, MthK channels may open sufficiently to support K+ uptake and complementation. To determine whether elevated temperature could contribute to increased MthK opening, we obtained recordings of MthK WT channels at 37 °C as shown in Fig. 3. Our results illustrate that elevated temperature can increase MthK opening. In our experiments, MthK WT open probability at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm Ca2+ was 0.71 ± 0.08, whereas at 24 °C we observed no openings under the same conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). Because at 24 °C we typically observed WT open probabilities of ∼0.8 in [Ca2+] ranging from 5 to 25 mm (see below and Fig. 7), our results are consistent with two potential mechanisms for the activation of MthK at elevated temperature. Heat could activate the channels either by opening the channel gate directly or by increasing the effective Ca2+-binding affinity by at least 100-fold. Although our experiments did not distinguish between these mechanisms, either of them could lead to MthK opening in E. coli under our culture conditions. We went on to perform mutational screens directed at two regions: the Ca2+-binding site, located in the cytoplasmic RCK domain of the channel, and the TM2 segment, at the cytoplasmic mouth of the MthK pore.FIGURE 7Single-channel properties of MthK WT at three different Ca2+ concentrations.

Smooth curves in B are for visual display purposes only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutations at the K+-binding Site Do Not Decrease Complementation—If K+ uptake through open MthK channels was due to Ca2+ activation of the channels, then mutations at the Ca2+-binding sites that would be expected to reduce Ca2+ binding should, in turn, reduce channel opening and blunt complementation. The major Ca2+-coordinating side chains in MthK are Asp-184, Glu-210, and to a lesser extent Glu-212 (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 14Dong J. Shi N. Berke I. Chen L. Jiang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41716-41724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test the effect of knocking out the Ca2+-binding site, we made the isosteric charge-neutral mutations D184N and E210Q. These reduced complementation, as did the double mutation D184N/E210Q (Fig. 4B). However, complementation was not abolished by these mutations, as one might expect if K+ uptake through the channel strictly required Ca2+-dependent activation. Thus the complementation effect may be due in part to spontaneous (Ca2+-independent) opening of the MthK pore. Mutations at the Putative TM2 Bundle Crossing Can Decrease Complementation—K+ channel opening can be modulated by side chains at the putative gating region of the channel, which is the S6 segment of Kv channels and TM2 helix of KcsA (6Sukhareva M. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Kitaguchi T. Sukhareva M. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the closed gate of Shaker-type channels can be stabilized by hydrophobic interactions at the S6 bundle crossing (7Kitaguchi T. Sukhareva M. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, replacement of residues near the TM2 bundle crossing of KcsA (A108) with charged side chains results in increased channel opening (10Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The residue corresponding to KcsA Ala-108 in MthK is Glu-92, which is negatively charged at neutral pH. We focused on this residue and nearby residues in TM2 to determine their potential roles in stabilizing gate conformation. Fig. 4 shows the results of complementation analysis of several mutations of Glu-92. To determine the effect of the side chain at the equivalent position in KcsA, we constructed E92A; this resulted in the most striking decrease in complementation. To determine potential side-chain characteristics responsible for the complementation decrease, we made several other substitutions at Glu-92 (Asp, Gln, Val, Pro, and Lys). Although complementation in all cases was reduced in comparison with wild type, only E92P and E92K practically eliminated complementation (like E92A). In addition to the complementation assay that used survival on agar plates as a qualitative index, we assayed complementation quantitatively in a few mutants using growth in liquid medium. Fig. 4C shows that for the LB2003 cells grown in medium additionally containing 2 mm KCl, cells expressing MthK wild-type were able to grow to an A600 of 1.3 ± 0.02 by 24 h, whereas E92Q, which resulted in reduced complementation on low K+ agar plates, reached an A600 of 0.65 ± 0.05 by 24 h, and E92A reached 0.06 ± 0.01 (reduced by 95%). Because Glu-92 is adjacent to the positively charged residue Arg-93, we wondered whether altering the Glu-92 side chain would disrupt a key electrostatic interaction between the Glu-92 and Arg-93 side chains required for gating. To test this possibility, we assayed the mutant R93L. R93L yielded complementation that was indistinguishable from wild-type MthK (Fig. 4B), suggesting that a Glu-92—Arg-93 interaction is not critical for gating. The E92A Mutation Shows a Loss-of-function but Does Not Blunt Expression or Assembly—To test whether effects on complementation were due to altered mutant channel expression, we expressed mutants in LB2003 cells and quantified expression in Western blots of bacterial lysates. Because MthK shows bands corresponding to complete channel assemblies as well as monomeric channel subunits, we were also able to make a crude estimate of the stability of transmembrane channel assembly. We found that expression levels for most of the mutants mimicked MthK wild-type expression (Fig. 5). Fully assembled channels ran at an apparent molecular mass of ∼220 kDa (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), although other bands were sometimes observed at ∼190 and ∼166 kDa. The 190- and 166-kDa bands appear to represent partially degraded or denatured forms of the channel. We observed that the density of these bands increased with extended storage of the protein in buffers containing 4 m urea, independent of any mutations (data not shown). In addition, a light band was sometimes apparent at ∼78 kDa, which likely corresponds to a dimeric form of the protein; the presence of this band was also unrelated to any mutations. In contrast to the high expression levels observed with most of our mutants, E92P showed reduced expression and ran almost entirely in the band corresponding to the monomeric subunit (Fig. 5). If the proline interferes with channel assembly to produce fewer functional E92P channels in E. coli than wild-type MthK, this may account for the decreased complementation by E92P. Neither E92A nor E92K showed a decrease in tetrameric assembly on Western blot compared with the wild type, suggesting that these mutants are expressed and fully assembled in E. coli but cannot support K+ uptake at the same levels as wild-type MthK. Mutations at Glu-96, a Component of the “Ring of Charge,” Can Also Decrease Function—Previous work has suggested that a ring of glutamates lining the intracellular entrance to the mslo BK channel pore (at Glu-321 and Glu-324) contributes to the large unitary conductance of the channel (15Brelidze T.I. Niu X. Magleby K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9017-9022Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When Glu-321 and Glu-324 are substituted with neutral or basic side chains, the unitary conductance is decreased. Similarly, the KcsA mutant A108E, which increases the negative charge at the entrance to the pore, shows an increased unitary conductance compared with wild-type (Ref. 16Nimigean C.M. Chappie J.S. Miller C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9263-9268Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; Ala-108 aligns with MthK Glu-92 and mslo Glu-321). We wondered whether Glu-96, which is also located at the intracellular mouth of the MthK pore (analogous to mslo Glu-324), might also contribute to MthK function. We made a series of mutations at Glu-96 (Asp, Gln, Lys, Thr, and Ala) and tested their complementation of LB2003 growth in low K+. Of these, E96K showed reduced complementation that approached to the level of E92K and E92A, whereas E96A did not. Thus it seems that the reduced functionality of E96K and E92K is consistent with the net positive charge at the entrance to the pore, which may decrease the unitary conductance. The E92A/E96T Double Mutation Further Blunts Complementation—The reduced functionality of E92A continued to intrigue us for two reasons. Unlike E92K, E92A does not introduce a positive charge in the pore lining, so it would not necessarily be expected to slow potassium conduction via an electrostatic mechanism. Also, E96A did not reduce complementation, so the alanine substitution seems to be relatively sensitive to the Glu-92 position, unlike the lysine substitution, which reduced complementation at either Glu-92 or Glu-96. We went on to combine E92A with E96T, which substitutes both of these glutamates in MthK with the side chains present in KcsA at the analogous positions, to determine whether this combination further effected functionality. We found that LB2003 growth in low K+ liquid medium, which was already blunted by the E92A mutation, was nearly abolished in the E92A/E96T double mutant (Fig. 4C). The E92A/E96T double mutation reduced neither the apparent expression levels LB2003 cells nor tetrameric stability in SDS, as indicated by Western blot (Fig. 5) and in Coomassie-stained SDS gels of the purified E92A/E96T protein (Fig. 6). Also, DM-solubilized E92A/E96T eluted with the same elution time as wild-type MthK on gel filtration, further indicating the oligomeric integrity of the mutant (Fig. 6). Effects on Complementation Do Not Necessarily Correlate with Mutant Channel Conductance—If the blunted bacterial complementation observed with some of the Glu-92 and Glu-96 mutants was not due to a decrease in the number of functional channels, then it could be due to either a decrease in single-channel conductance, to decreased open probability (Po), or both. To test these possibilities, we purified wild-type MthK and several of the mutants assayed in complementation experiments, reconstituted the channels in liposomes, and assayed their gating properties by recording channel currents in planar lipid bilayers. We observed that wild-type MthK required millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ to achieve a near maximal Po, consistent with previous observations (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our experiments, which were performed at 22-24 °C, the channel reached 50% Po at 0.8 mm calcium (Po measured at -100 mV; Fig. 7). In addition, the unitary conductance decreased with increasing [Ca2+] in the millimolar range, such that the chord conductance at -200 mV was 240 ± 9.4 picosiemens at 1 mm Ca2+ and was decreased to 89 ± 3.4 picosiemens at 25 mm Ca2+. Also consistent with previous work, we observed inward rectification in wild-type MthK (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). In symmetrical 200 mm KCl, inward current increased nearly linearly over the 0 to -200 mV range; outward current was relatively small, and saturated at ∼5 pA at around +100 mV for the wild-type channel. Representative single-channel currents from wild-type and mutant MthK channels are shown in Fig. 8. As with MthK wild-type, all of the mutants that we studied displayed inward rectification (Fig. 9), which aided in determining the orientation of individual channels in the bilayer. Although some mutants also showed unitary conductances that were different from the wild type, these did not seem to correlate with the complementation results. In several of the mutants, the conductance was ∼12% lower than wild type (Table 1 and Fig. 9). This group included R93L, which showed robust complementation, and E92A, which resulted in almost no complementation. In addition, E96T and E96Q, which both resulted in similarly reduced complementation, showed different effects on unitary conductance, with E96Q nearly the same as wild type and E96T giving a 50% decrease.FIGURE 9Single-channel properties of MthK WT and mutant channels. A, single-channel current plotted as a function of voltage for MthK WT and mutants, recorded in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ at both sides of the membrane. All channels displayed inward rectification; most displayed conductance properties similar to MthK WT, except for the decreased conductance of E96T. B, comparison of Po (or NPo) measured in 5 mm Ca2+ and -100 mV for MthK WT and several mutants. MthK WT, E96T, and R93L data represent actual Po (per channel); E96Q, E92A, and E92Q data represent NPo data from an unknown number of channels in each bilayer (see “Results”). P concentrations for liposomes use in these bilayer experiments were (in μg of protein/mg of E. coli lipids) as follows: MthK WT, 5; E96T, 10; E96Q, 25; E92A, 50; E92Q, 25; R93L, 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Slope conductance of MthK wild-type and mutant channels estimated from inward current Ionic conditions were 200 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, for both the external and cytoplasmic sides of the channel.

In general, Po correlated well with the functional index of complementation. At -100 mV and in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, wild-type channels displayed a high Po of 0.80 ± 0.05. R93L, which gave complementation that was indistinguishable from wild type, displayed a Po of 0.33 ± 0.08. E96T, with reduced complementation (and reduced conductance), showed a Po of 0.42 ± 0.07. We obtained recordings from three of the mutants that displayed decreased complementation. To consistently observe channel activity in our bilayer recordings, both E92Q and E96Q required liposomes with 5-fold higher protein concentrations than MthK WT liposomes (25 μg of protein/mg of lipid for E92Q and E96Q, compared with 5 μg of protein/mg of lipid for MthK WT). Despite the higher protein concentrations, channel activity was relatively low. Because of the low channel activity (quantified as NPo, the open probability times the number of channels), it was difficult to estimate the numbers of channels in each bilayer with certainty (17Horn R. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus our estimates of channel activity (NPo = 0.14 ± 0.02 for E92Q and 0.16 ± 0.03 for E96Q) should be considered an upper limit, with the true Po for these channels likely being 3-6-fold lower. E92A, which showed the greatest reduction in complementation, also displayed a markedly reduced NPo (NPo = 0.12 ± 0.09) and required even higher protein concentrations in our liposome preparations (50 μg of protein/mg of lipid). Although the E92A/E96T double mutant retained biochemical properties that resembled MthK wild type (Figs. 4 and 5), we were unable to obtain recordings of channel activity from reconstituted E92A/E96T despite numerous attempts using liposome preparations containing up to 50 μg of protein/mg of lipid. We used bacterial complementation to identify loss-of-function mutations in the MthK potassium channel. Mutants that would be expected to alter MthK gating by decreasing Ca2+ binding (like D184N (1Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar)) did not decrease complementation compared with MthK WT. This allowed our complementation results to identify mutations that: 1) decreased channel expression or assembly (like E92P; Fig. 5); 2) disrupted K+ conduction through open channels; or 3) decreased the stability of the open state. From our limited complementation screen, we have identified at least three mutants (E92A, E92Q, and E96Q) that apparently shift the MthK gating equilibrium toward the closed state. These are located in the TM2 helix, at the intracellular entryway to the MthK pore. Previous experiments that searched for gain-of-function mutants in KcsA identified the region near the TM2 bundle crossing as important for modulation of channel opening (10Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations near the putative S6 bundle crossing in Shaker can render the channel either constitutively open (e.g. P475D) or nonconducting (e.g. V478W), and modification of cysteine mutants in this region can have profound effects on gating that are consistent with direct modification of the channel's mobile gate (6Sukhareva M. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Kitaguchi T. Sukhareva M. Swartz K.J. J. Gen.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 649-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although we do not presently know the structure of the closed MthK pore, sequence alignment with KcsA suggests that Glu-92 may form the narrowest point of the TM2 bundle crossing in the closed MthK channel, a point at which the Glu-92 residues from all four MthK pore-forming subunits may interact with one another directly (Fig. 1). If the Glu-92 side chains approach one another in the closed conformation, then they would be expected to repel one another electrostatically and thus destabilize the closed conformation of the putative TM2 gate. If this electrostatic mechanism were valid, then one would expect E92D and E92K also to undergo repulsion and function like the wild type. Although E92D functions like MthK wild type in the complementation assay, E92K shows a loss-of-function (Fig. 4B). This loss-of-function could be due to electrostatic repulsion of K+ by the positively charged lysine side chains at the pore entry, leading to reduced K+ conduction. In contrast to the electrostatic interactions that may destabilize the close conformation in wild-type MthK, the four side chains at the bundle crossing in the E92A mutant are hydrophobic and may thus interact with one another more favorably in the closed state. This is consistent with the loss-of-function in E92A and the E92A/E96T double mutant (Fig. 4A). Because spontaneous channel opening is reduced in E92A at very low Ca2+ (Fig. 4), and Ca2+-dependent opening is reduced at higher Ca2+ (Fig. 8 and 9), our studies suggest that the negative charge at Glu-92 near the putative MthK bundle crossing may be critical in determining the relative stability of the MthK open state. Our observation that the E92A mutation results in “mostly closed” channels suggests that this three-dimensional arrangement of side chains may intrinsically form a tight seal that hinders spontaneous opening. Likewise, the comparatively higher open probability with the charged Glu-92 side chain in wild-type MthK, consistent with an electrostatic destabilization of the closed conformation of the bundle crossing, is also observed with the KcsA mutants A108E and A108D (10Irizarry S.N.

It may thus be possible to understand gating in some K+ channels in terms of the allosteric modulation of this intrinsically stable or destabilized structure.
