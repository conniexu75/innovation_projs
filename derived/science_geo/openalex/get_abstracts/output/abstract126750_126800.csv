https://openalex.org/W2150656456,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a lifetime incidence of approximately 2 percent. A pattern of familial aggregation has been documented for the disorder, and it was recently reported that a PD susceptibility gene in a large Italian kindred is located on the long arm of human chromosome 4. A mutation was identified in the α-synuclein gene, which codes for a presynaptic protein thought to be involved in neuronal plasticity, in the Italian kindred and in three unrelated families of Greek origin with autosomal dominant inheritance for the PD phenotype. This finding of a specific molecular alteration associated with PD will facilitate the detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder."

These technologies are generally not sensitive enough to detect early-stage tissue abnormalities associated with diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis, which require micrometer-scale resolution. Here, optical coherence tomography was adapted to allow high-speed visualization of tissue in a living animal with a catheter-endoscope 1 millimeter in diameter. This method, referred to as ""optical biopsy,"" was used to obtain cross-sectional images of the rabbit gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts at 10-micrometer resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2033240573,"The binding of oxygen to heme irons in hemoglobin promotes the binding of nitric oxide (NO) to cysteineβ93, forming S -nitrosohemoglobin. Deoxygenation is accompanied by an allosteric transition in S -nitrosohemoglobin [from the R (oxygenated) to the T (deoxygenated) structure] that releases the NO group. S -nitrosohemoglobin contracts blood vessels and decreases cerebral perfusion in the R structure and relaxes vessels to improve blood flow in the T structure. By thus sensing the physiological oxygen gradient in tissues, hemoglobin exploits conformation-associated changes in the position of cysteineβ93 SNO to bring local blood flow into line with oxygen requirements."

To investigate the role of Flk1 during vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis, we examined the developmental potential of Flk1-/- embryonic stem cells in chimeras. We show that Flk1 is required cell autonomously for endothelial development. Furthermore, Flk1-/- cells do not contribute to primitive hematopoiesis in chimeric yolk sacs or definitive hematopoiesis in adult chimeras and chimeric fetal livers. We also demonstrate that cells lacking Flk1 are unable to reach the correct location to form blood islands, suggesting that Flk1 is involved in the movement of cells from the posterior primitive streak to the yolk sac and, possibly, to the intraembryonic sites of early hematopoiesis."

The cognate peptides produced by some strains inhibit the expression of agr in other strains, and the amino acid sequences of peptide and receptor are markedly different between such strains, suggesting a hypervariability-generating mechanism. Cross-inhibition of gene expression represents a type of bacterial interference that could be correlated with the ability of one strain to exclude others from infection or colonization sites, or both."
https://openalex.org/W2066018734,"The X-ray structure of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), bound to 7-methyl-GDP, has been determined at 2.2 Å resolution. eIF4E recognizes 5′ 7-methyl-G(5′)ppp(5′)N mRNA caps during the rate-limiting initiation step of translation. The protein resembles a cupped hand and consists of a curved, 8-stranded antiparallel β sheet, backed by three long α helices. 7-methyl-GDP binds in a narrow cap-binding slot on the molecule's concave surface, where 7-methyl-guanine recognition is mediated by base sandwiching between two conserved tryptophans, plus formation of three hydrogen bonds and a van der Waals contact between its N7-methyl group and a third conserved tryptophan. The convex dorsal surface of the molecule displays a phylogenetically conserved hydrophobic/acidic portion, which may interact with other translation initiation factors and regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2006313098,"Glutathione peroxidase, a selenium-containing enzyme, is believed to protect cells from the toxicity of hydroperoxides. The physiological role of this enzyme has previously been implicated mainly using animals fed with a selenium-deficient diet. Although selenium deficiency also affects the activity of several other cellular selenium-containing enzymes, a dramatic decrease of glutathione peroxidase activity has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, particularly those whose progression is associated with an overproduction of reactive oxygen species, found in selenium-deficient animals. To further clarify the physiological relevance of this enzyme, a model of mice deficient in cellular glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx-1), the major isoform of glutathione peroxidase ubiquitously expressed in all types of cells, was generated by gene-targeting technology. Mice deficient in this enzyme were apparently healthy and fertile and showed no increased sensitivity to hyperoxia. Their tissues exhibited neither a retarded rate in consuming extracellular hydrogen peroxide nor an increased content of protein carbonyl groups and lipid peroxidation compared with those of wild-type mice. However, platelets from GSHPx-1-deficient mice incubated with arachidonic acid generated less 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and more polar products relative to control platelets at a higher concentration of arachidonic acid, presumably reflecting a decreased ability to reduce the 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid intermediate. These results suggest that the contribution of GSHPx-1 to the cellular antioxidant mechanism under normal animal development and physiological conditions and to the pulmonary defense against hyperoxic insult is very limited. Nevertheless, the potential antioxidant role of this enzyme in protecting cells and animals against the pathogenic effect of reactive oxygen species in other disorders remains to be defined. The knockout mouse model described in this report will also provide a new tool for future study to distinguish the physiological role of this enzyme from other selenium-containing proteins in mammals under normal and disease states.

Glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) 1The abbreviations used are: GSHPx, glutathione peroxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HPETE, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid; HETE, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid; ES, embryonic stem; kb, kilobase pair(s). is believed to play an important role in cellular antioxidant defense by reducing hydrogen peroxide and various hydroperoxides using glutathione as a reducing agent to form water and corresponding alcohols, respectively (H2O2 + 2GSH → 2H2O + GSSG or ROOH + 2GSH → ROH + GSSG + H2O) (1Wendel A. Jakoby W. Enzymatic Basis of Detoxification. 1. Academic Press, New York1980: 333-353Google Scholar). GSHPx is a selenium-containing protein present in both cytosol and mitochondria of eukaryotic cells (2Zarowski J. Tappel A.L. Biochim. Biophys.

The selenocysteine at the active site of this protein is encoded by an opal nonsense codon in all species of mammals studied (6Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R.

Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This modified amino acid is incorporated co-translationally into the protein by a unique species of opal suppressor tRNA (14Lee B.J. Worland P.J. Davis J.N. Stadtman T.C. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9724-9727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least four GSHPx isozymes found in mammals. The major cellular GSHPx (GSHPx-1) is expressed in all tissues and contributes to most of the GSHPx activity present in erythrocytes, kidney, and liver (15Frampton J. Conkie D. Chambers I. McBain W. Dexter M. Harrison P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3671-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The plasma GSHPx is detected in milk, plasma, and lung alveolar fluid (16Maddipati K.R. Gasparski C. Marnett L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 254: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Takahashi K. Avissar N. Whitin J. Cohen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSHPx, which is capable of reducing hydroperoxides of phospholipids and cholesterol, is found mainly in the testis (18Ursini F. Maiorino M. Valente M. Ferri L. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 710: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 19Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys.

The recently reported GSHPx gastrointestinal tract is expressed predominantly in liver, intestine, and colon (21Chu F.-F. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2571-2576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chu F.-F. Esworthy R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although GSHPx is capable of reducing cellular hydroperoxides, which can otherwise serve as substrates for metal-mediated Fenton reaction to generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical (for review, see Ref. 23Borg D.C. Tarr M. Samson F. Oxygen Free Radicals in Tissue Damage. Birkhäuser, Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1993: 12-53Crossref Google Scholar), its function in lung antioxidant mechanism has never been directly evaluated. Exposure of mammals to hyperoxia can cause extensive lung injury. This type of pulmonary damage is due to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which overwhelms the cellular capacity of antioxidant defense in the lung (for review, see Ref. 24Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 412-426PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the physiological relevance of GSHPx has been implicated from studies on animals fed with a selenium-deficient diet. Selenium deficiency decreases the activity of rat lung GSHPx and exacerbates pulmonary injury following hyperoxic exposure (95% oxygen) compared with rats fed with a selenium-sufficient diet (25Hawker F.H. Ward H.E. Stewart P.M. Wynne L.A. Snitch P.J. Eur. Respir. J. 1993; 6: 1317-1323PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest the critical role of GSHPx in pulmonary antioxidant defense mechanisms. However, selenium deficiency also affects the activity of several other selenium-containing proteins in mammals including the type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase, the plasma selenoprotein P, and thioredoxin reductase (26Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 27Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.-G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Type I iodothyronine 5′-deiodinase catalyzes the 5′-deiodination of thyroxine to produce the more biologically active hormone 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine. Deficiency in selenium is known to affect thyroid hormone metabolism in experimental animals (29Arthur J.R. Nicol F. Beckett G.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1993; 57: 236S-239SCrossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The plasma selenoprotein P has been postulated to also contain antioxidant activity (for review, see Ref. 30Burk R.F. Hill K.E. J. Nutr. 1994; 124: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thioredoxin reductase functions to reduce oxidized thioredoxin, one of the major cellular proteins capable of reducing disulfide bonds present in oxidized proteins. Therefore, it is likely that the apparent pathophysiological changes found in the animals following dietary selenium depletion may not completely result from the decreased activity of GSHPx. To further understand the antioxidant role of GSHPx, a new animal model of GSHPx deficiency is needed. Toward this end, we describe the generation and characterization of knockout mice defective in the major cellular GSHPx (GSHPx-1) in this report. These mice are apparently healthy and show no increased oxidative stress or sensitivity to hyperoxia compared with that of wild-type mice. However, the profile of arachidonic acid metabolites is altered in GSHPx-1-deficient platelets relative to that of controls at a higher concentration of substrate. This mouse model will be valuable for understanding the pathogenesis of certain diseases in which the role of GSHPx insufficiency is implicated. Eight Gpx1 genomic clones were isolated from a bacteriophage FIX II genomic library constructed with DNA of 129/SVJ mouse (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by hybridization screening using a corresponding rat cDNA clone (12Ho Y.-S. Howard A.J. Crapo J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The genomic insert in clone 21 was released from the bacteriophage vector by SacI digestion and further characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing analysis. A 5.3-kb SacI genomic fragment was found to contain the entire mouse Gpx1 gene with sequence virtually identical to that published by Chambers et al. (6Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) except a few base substitutions in the region of intron 1 (data not shown). This fragment of DNA was then used in construction of the targeting vector (Fig. 1). The coding sequence was disrupted by insertion of a neomycin resistance gene cassette (neo) derived from plasmid pPNT (Ref. 31Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, generously provided by Dr. Richard Mulligan of Massachusetts Institute of Technology) into the EcoRI site located in exon 2 (6Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The herpes thymidine kinase gene cassette from plasmid pPNT was placed 3′ to the targeting sequence. The targeting vector linearized withHindIII was transfected into R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells obtained from Dr. Andras Nagy of Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada (32Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) and selected with 300 μg/ml G418 and 2 μmganciclovir (a gift from Syntex Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Resistant colonies were isolated and then screened by DNA blot analysis using a probe 3′ external to the targeting sequence as shown in Fig. 1. Three clones containing the targeted Gpx1 allele were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts according to the method described by Bradley (33Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Tetratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 113-151Google Scholar), and embryos were re-implanted into the uterine horns of foster mothers. A total of 23 chimeric mice were generated. Four male chimeric mice with more than 95% agouti coat color chimerism were chosen to breed with C57BL/6 female mice. One hundred percent of their F1 offspring showed the agouti coat color, indicating that the microinjected ES cells might reconstitute the entire reproductive organ in the chimeric mice. Germ line transmission of the targeted Gpx1 allele was evident by DNA blot analysis as shown in Fig. 2 b.Figure 2DNA blot analysis of the wild-type and targeted Gpx1 loci in ES cells and wild-type and knockout mice. +/+ represents cells or mice containing two wild-typeGpx1 alleles. +/− represents cells or mice containing one wild-type and one targeted allele. −/− represents homozygous mice carrying two targeted alleles.

(34Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and separated on an agarose gel in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0 (35McMaster G.K. Carmichael G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The RNA blot filter was initially hybridized with a rat Gpx1 cDNA probe (12Ho Y.-S. Howard A.J. Crapo J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and then re-hybridized with a rat cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36Fort Ph Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S.El. Dani Ch Jeanteur Ph Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) according to the procedures described by Thomas (37Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). Wild-type and knockout mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. After opening the abdomen and thorax, an incision was made on the left atrium, and the entire mouse was then perfused with approximately 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline through the left ventricle. The tissues were removed and stored at −70 °C. For enzyme activity assay, the tissues were homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 with a Polytron homogenizer, followed by sonication on ice for 30 s with a microprobe at maximum power. The tissue homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Protein content in each sample was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). The GSHPx activities in tissue homogenates were determined by the indirect, coupled test procedure (38Paglia D.E. Valentine W.N. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 70: 158-169PubMed Google Scholar, 39Flohé L. Günzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GSSG produced during GSHPx enzyme reaction was immediately reduced by NADPH and glutathione reductase. Therefore, the rate of NADPH consumption was monitored as a measurement for the rate of GSSG formation during GSHPx reaction. The enzyme reaction was conducted in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm NADPH, 4 units of glutathione reductase, 2 mm GSH, 1 mm sodium azide, and 0.1 mm H2O2 at 25 °C, and the rate of decrease in absorption of NADPH at 340 nm was followed. The GSHPx activity is defined as nmol of NADPH consumption per min per mg of tissue protein at 2 mm GSH. Consumption of NADPH was calculated using a mm extinction coefficient for NADPH of 6.22. The catalase activity was measured according to the method of Aebi (40Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18933) Google Scholar). The rate of H2O2decomposition was followed by monitoring absorption at 240 nm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mmH2O2 at 25 °C. The activity of catalase is defined as μmol of H2O2 consumption per min per mg of tissue protein. Calculation for H2O2concentration was made using a mm extinction coefficient for H2O2 of 0.0394. The activity of glutathione reductase was determined at 25 °C in 54 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm GSSG, and 0.1 mm NADPH by following the decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm (41Horn H.-D. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1965: 875-879Crossref Google Scholar). The glutathione reductase activity is defined as nmol of NADPH consumption/min/mg of tissue protein. The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was measured with a kit purchased from Sigma. Briefly, the rate of production of NADPH from NADP and glucose 6-phosphate was followed by monitoring the absorption of NADPH at 340 nm (42Lohr G.W. Waller H.D. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 636-643Crossref Google Scholar). The activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was inhibited by maleimide. The enzyme activity is defined as nmol of NADPH generation per min per mg of tissue protein. Activities of copper-zinc and manganese superoxide dismutases were determined by measuring the inhibition of xanthine plus xanthine oxidase-mediated cytochromec reduction at pH 7.8 (43Crapo J.D. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The measurement was performed in the presence of 10 μm KCN to eliminate the activity of tissue cytochrome c oxidase. To distinguish the contribution of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and manganese superoxide dismutase to the total superoxide dismutase activity, the same measurement was also repeated in the presence of 1 mm KCN to inhibit the activity of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase. One unit of superoxide dismutase activity is defined as the enzyme activity needed to inhibit 50% cytochrome c reduction. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture from four normal, heterozygous, and homozygous knockout mice and sent to Consolidated Veterinary Diagnostics, Inc., West Sacramento, CA, for hematological analysis. The slides were either stained with Wright's Giemsa or methylene blue for counting leukocyte differentials or reticulocytes, respectively. The total numbers of red cells, reticulocytes, platelets, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils were determined. Normal and age-matched homozygous knockout mice were fixed by systemic perfusion with Bouin's fixative through the left ventricle. The tissues were then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissues sections were examined under a light microscope. Tissues free of blood were initially sliced with a McIlwain tissue chopper (The Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co. Ltd., Goose Green, Gomshall, UK) and then gently homogenized in a glass homogenizer equipped with a Teflon probe for 30 s in 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g. A fraction of the tissue homogenate (0.125 ml) was added into 0.5 ml of 10 mm2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 m HCl and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. An equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid was then added to precipitate the total cellular protein. After three washes with ethanol/ethyl acetate (1:1), the pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of 6 m guanidine in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 2.3, for absorbance measurement at 366 nm. Calculation of the carbonyl content was done using a molar absorption coefficient of 22,000 m−1cm−1. The contents of malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxylalkenals in tissue homogenates used for carbonyl assay were determined by a colorimetric assay kit purchased from OXIS International, Inc., Portland, OR., following the manufacturer's instructions. Standard curve was generated using known quantities of 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane. The lungs were perfused free of blood through the pulmonary vasculature and then cut into 0.75-mm slices using a McIlwain tissue chopper. This thickness of tissue has been found to exhibit maximum rates of oxygen consumption (45Freeman B. O'Neil J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 56: 51-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide is capable of diffusing freely through the cells. Five milligrams of lung slices from wild-type or homozygous knockout mice were incubated at 37 °C in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline plus 55 mm glucose with constant shaking. Consumption of H2O2 by tissue slices was determined at initial concentrations of H2O2 at 10, 40, and 300 μm. The concentrations of hydrogen peroxide at different incubation times were determined by the quantitative fluorometric assay (46Hyslop P.A. Sklar L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 ml of supernatant was removed at the end of incubation and added into 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.076 mg of horseradish peroxidase/ml and 1.5 mm p-parahydroxyphenylacetic acid. The extent of fluorescence at 400 nm excited by 323 nm of light was measured. Following the measurement, a known quantity of H2O2 was added into the same tube to serve as an internal standard. Platelets were prepared by cardiac puncture and macrophages by lavage of the peritoneal cavity as described previously (47Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Washed platelets (4.5 × 108) in Tyrode's buffer or peritoneal macrophages (107 cells) in phosphate-buffered saline plus calcium were incubated with [14C]arachidonic acid (57 mCi/mmol) at various concentrations for 15 min at 37 °C. The macrophage incubations also included the calcium ionophore A23187 (2 μm). The reactions were stopped with acetonitrile/MeOH/HOAc (35:15:0.3), and the supernatant was directly analyzed by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (47Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) or by thin layer chromatography (TLC) with a solvent system CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/HOAc (92:8:0.8:1, v/v/v/v). Plates were scanned with a Bioscan System 200 imaging scanner. Wild-type and homozygous Gpx1 knockout mice of approximately 10 weeks of age were used for exposure to >99% oxygen. Hyperoxic exposure was conducted in several polystyrene chambers. The oxygen concentration varied less than 2%, and CO2concentration was maintained less than 0.5% by providing approximately 12 complete gas changes per h. During the exposure, food and waterad libitum were provided, and the animals were kept in a 12-h on, 12-h off light cycle at all times. The numbers of surviving animals were counted three times a day. One-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences in each measurement performed on wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous knockout mice. If a significant difference was observed (p < 0.05), then pairwise comparisons among mice were made using Duncan's test. Survival of wild-type and GSHPx-1-deficient mice exposed to >99% oxygen was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Fig. 1shows that the coding region of exon 2 of the mouse Gpx1gene was disrupted by insertion of a neomycin resistance cassette. The targeting vector also carried a herpes thymidine kinase gene for performing negative selection with ganciclovir. This sequence recombined homologously with the cognate endogenous gene at a very high frequency. Approximately 30% G418 and gancyclovir-resistant ES colonies were found to contain the desired mutated allele for GSHPx-1. We have isolated approximately 100 homologous recombinant clones from about 300 colonies screened. Fig. 2 a is an example of DNA blot analysis of DNA from representative ES clones. As shown in Fig. 2 a, the 3′ external probe (probe 1shown in Fig. 1) hybridized with a 5.3-kb SacI and an approximately 11-kb BamHI genomic fragment from the wild-type mouse Gpx1 allele. Insertion of the neomycin selective marker resulted in hybridizing SacI andBamHI fragments with sizes of 7.1 and 4.3 kb, respectively. However, due to unknown reason, this 3′ external probe tended to generate a high hybridization background on the blot filter carrying mouse tail DNA, contributing to difficulties in genotyping of mouse progeny. The DNA fragment containing exon 2 and the adjacent 3′ sequence (probe 2 shown in Fig. 1) was then used for identifying the targeted allele in knockout mice (Fig. 2 b). Heterozygous mice were used in breeding to generate homozygous Gpx1knockout (Gpx1 −/−) mice. We rationalized that mice homozygous for the disrupted Gpx1 allele might be viable, since there are three other GSHPx isozymes expressed to a lesser extent in various tissues (16Maddipati K.R.

In addition, the catalase should be capable of detoxifying hydrogen peroxide generated by dismutation of superoxide radical and by other cellular metabolism to some extent. This prediction turned out to be true. Approximately 25% of the offspring from heterozygous breeding were homozygous for the mutated Gpx1 allele. RNA blot analysis was performed to determine whether the targeted Gpx1 allele is not functional as expected. Fig.3 shows an approximately 40–60% reduction in amounts of the 0.9-kb Gpx1 mRNA in brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung of heterozygous knockout mouse compared with those of normal littermates. Furthermore, no Gpx1 mRNA was found in these tissues of homozygous knockout mice. After a longer exposure of the autoradiograph, two additional species of hybridizing RNA of 1.5 and 1.9 kb, as indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3, became apparent in liver and kidney samples of homo"

However, in transgenic plants in which the plastid stroma was labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP), thin tubular projections emanated from individual plastids and sometimes connected to other plastids. Flow of GFP between interconnected plastids could be observed when a single plastid or an interconnecting plastid tubule was photobleached and the loss of green fluorescence by both plastids was seen. These tubules allow the exchange of molecules within an interplastid communication system, which may facilitate the coordination of plastid activities."

This study sought to determine whether brain CRF systems also have a role in cannabinoid dependence. Rats were treated daily for 2 weeks with the potent synthetic cannabinoid HU-210. Withdrawal, induced by the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716A, was accompanied by a marked elevation in extracellular CRF concentration and a distinct pattern of Fos activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Maximal increases in CRF corresponded to the time when behavioral signs resulting from cannabinoid withdrawal were at a maximum. These data suggest that long-term cannabinoid administration alters CRF function in the limbic system of the brain, in a manner similar to that observed with other drugs of abuse, and also induces neuroadaptive processes that may result in future vulnerability to drug dependence."

We suggest that tea1 acts as an end marker, directing the growth machinery to the cell poles. tea1 is down-regulated in cells treated with pheromone that grow toward a mating partner and no longer maintain their ends exactly opposed. tea1 may also influence microtubular organization, affecting the maintenance of a single central axis."

The in vitro neutralization capacities and in vivo protective capacities of a panel of immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibodies to the glycoprotein of VSV were evaluated. In vitro, neutralizing activity correlated with avidity and with neutralization rate constant, a measure of on-rate. However, in vivo, protection was independent of immunoglobulin subclass, avidity, neutralization rate constant, and in vitro neutralizing activity; above a minimal avidity threshold, protection depended simply on a minimum serum concentration.

We constructed two genes that encode mature forms of two different signaling molecules, the PhrA peptide that stimulates sporulation, and CSF, the competence- and sporulation-stimulating factor. Both pentapeptides are normally produced by secretion and processing of precursor molecules. The mature pentapeptides were functional when expressed inside the cell, indicating that they normally need to be imported to function. Furthermore, at physiological concentrations (10 nM), CSF was transported into the cell by the oligopeptide permease encoded by spo0K (opp). CSF was shown to have at least three different targets corresponding to its three activities: stimulating competence gene expression at low concentrations, and inhibiting competence gene expression and stimulating sporulation at high concentrations."

Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx can be dissociated, as they possess differential sensitivities to InsP3: low concentrations induce substantial Ca2+ release without any activation of ICRAC, whereas micromolar concentrations of InsP3 are required to activate Ca2+ influx. This suggests functionally distinct stores controlling Ca2+ release and influx and enables cells to switch between sources of Ca2+ to fit best their current needs."

Increases in cytosolic calcium concentration reversibly fragmented ER tubules and prevented lumenal diffusion. However, the integrity of the NE was maintained, and a significant fraction of NE lumenal protein accumulated in an NE-associated vesicle.

The same activity also functions as a repressor, controlling stalk cell differentiation. We show that the TTGA-binding factor is a STAT protein. Like the metazoan STATs, it functions via the reciprocal interaction of a phosphotyrosine residue on one molecule with an SH2 domain on a dimerizing partner. Furthermore, it will bind specifically to a mammalian interferon-stimulated response element. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the entire genomic sequence is known, SH2 domains have not been identified. It would seem, therefore, that SH2 signaling pathways arose very early in the evolution of multicellular organisms, perhaps to facilitate intercellular comunication."
https://openalex.org/W2018513924,"Most cancer cells have increased levels of telomerase activity implicated in cell immortalization. Activation of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex, catalyzes the elongation of the ends of mammalian chromosomal DNA (telomeres), the length of which regulates cell proliferation. Currently, how telomerase is regulated in cancer is not yet established. The present study shows that telomerase activity is regulated by protein phosphorylation in human breast cancer cells. Incubation of cell nuclear telomerase extracts with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) abolished the telomerase activity; in contrast cytoplasmic telomerase activity was unaffected, and protein phosphatases 1 and 2B were ineffective. Inhibition of telomerase activity by PP2A was both concentration- and time-dependent and was prevented by the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. In addition, nuclear telomerase inhibited by PP2A was reactivated by endogenous protein kinase(s) in the presence of ATP, but not in the presence of ATPgammaS. Furthermore, telomerase activity in cultured human breast cancer PMC42 cells was stimulated by okadaic acid, consistent with a role for PP2A in the regulation of telomerase activity in intact cells. These findings suggest that protein phosphorylation reversibly regulates the function of telomerase and that PP2A is a telomerase inhibitory factor in the nucleus of human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2141854486,"The eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin, CCT, plays an essential role in mediating ATP-dependent folding of actin and tubulin. There is debate about whether it mediates folding through a single round of association followed by release of native forms, or through cycles of binding and full release in which only a fraction of released molecules reaches native form in any cycle. We examine the fate of newly synthesized substrate proteins bound to CCT in reticulocyte lysate or intact Xenopus oocytes. When a chaperonin “trap,” able to bind but not release substrate protein, is introduced, production of the native state is strongly inhibited, associated with transfer to trap. While predominantly nonnative forms of actin, tubulin, and a newly identified substrate, Gα-transducin, are released from CCT, a small fraction reaches native form with each round of release, inaccessible to trap. This overall mechanism resembles that of the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL."

Neurosci. 1994; 6: 137-147Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified that are thought to be involved in this process, including dynamin, which is similar to the product of the Drosophila shibire gene (2Chen M.S. Obar R.A.

Synaptojanin is enriched in brain and is concentrated in the nerve terminal, where it precisely co-localizes with dynamin (8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both dynamin and synaptojanin are associated with synaptophysin-positive membrane fractions on the endocytic limb of the synaptic vesicle cycle, and both proteins undergo dephosphorylation in response to synaptic vesicle mobilization (8McPherson P.S.

Cloning of synaptojanin revealed a domain homologous to a family of enzymes that dephosphorylate inositol phospholipids and inositol polyphosphates at the 5′-position of the inositol ring (5-phosphatases) as well as a proline-rich C terminus with consensus binding sites for SH3 domains (9McPherson P.S.

Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The Myc oncoprotein contains functionally critical N-terminal Myc box regions that have been implicated in cell growth, apoptosis, and malignancy (21Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jackobovits E.

Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Little information is available on SH3P9, which was discovered along with SH3P4 in a library screen isolating SH3 domain-containing proteins (11Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). BIN1 and SH3P9, which are very similar in sequence, are homologous to amphiphysin at their N termini as well as at their C-terminal SH3 domains but do not contain a large central domain found in amphiphysin. In this paper, we have characterized a third amphiphysin homologue, which appears to be an alternatively spliced product of the gene encoding BIN1 and SH3P9. This protein, which we refer to as amphiphysin II, contains a large central insert domain that is partially homologous to the central domain of amphiphysin (now referred to as amphiphysin I) but that is absent from BIN1 and SH3P9. We generated amphiphysin II-specific antibodies and determined that the protein is brain-specific and highly enriched in nerve terminals. Like amphiphysin I, amphiphysin II binds through its SH3 domain to dynamin and synaptojanin. Further, amphiphysin I and II both bind to clathrin through a region outside of their SH3 domains. Taken together, these data suggest that amphiphysin II may function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis in the nerve terminal. A search of the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) with the sequence of human amphiphysin I (13David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) revealed several homologous human brain cDNAs. An I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone (I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone I.D. number 183571, GenBankTM number R12992) overlapping with human amphiphysin I from amino acid 169 to 695 was purchased and sequenced. To obtain the amino terminus of amphiphysin II, we performed PCR on cDNA prepared from adult human cortex (23Bouchelet I. Cohen Z. Case B. Séguéla P. Hamel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 219-223PubMed Google Scholar). The forward primer (5′-GCGGGATCCATGGCAGAGATGGGCAGTAAAG) corresponded to nucleotides 1–22 of the coding sequence of BIN1 (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (from GenBankTMclone U68485), and the reverse primer (5′-GCGGAATTCGTCCAGCAGACTGGCCTGC) corresponded to nucleotides 1083–1065 of amphiphysin II in a region of the amphiphysin II-specific insert domain. A specific PCR product was subcloned, sequenced, and found to have a 100% overlap with 564 base pairs at the 5′-end of the I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone and to extend the clone by an additional 519 base pairs. Human genomic DNA (8 μg/sample) was digested with BamHI or EcoRI, and the fragments were separated on an agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.). A cDNA probe from nucleotides 1396–1671 of amphiphysin II was prepared by PCR, labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming, and hybridized to immobilized DNA under high stringency using standard protocols. To generate an amphiphysin II antibody, the I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone was used as a template in PCR reactions with Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the forward primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCAGTTTGAGGCCCCG (nucleotides 1035–1050 of amphiphysin II) and the reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCATGGGACCCTCTCATGT (nucleotides 1413–1396 of amphiphysin II). The PCR product was cloned in frame into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and a GST fusion protein (GST-amphiphysin II) was expressed and purified as described (7McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum 1874 was prepared by injecting a rabbit with 200 μg of GST-amphiphysin II using Titermax™ adjuvant (CytRx Corp) with standard protocols. Rabbit sera were tested by Western blot on crude brain homogenate. Antibodies specific to amphiphysin II were affinity-purified from the serum in a two-step procedure. First, 2 ml of 1874 serum were incubated overnight at 4 °C with approximately 2.0 mg of a GST fusion protein encoding a region of the amphiphysin II-specific insert domain immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The fusion protein was prepared by PCR as described above using the forward primer 5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCAGTTTGAGGCCCCG (nucleotides 1035–1050 of amphiphysin II) and the reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCACACAGCAAAGGTGCCCTCG (nucleotides 1240–1221 of amphiphysin II). The membrane was washed, and the bound antibodies were eluted by incubation for 5 min in 3 ml of 50 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The affinity-purified antibodies were subsequently neutralized by the addition of 150 μl of 2 m Tris, pH 8.0 (single affinity purification). In the second step of affinity purification, 0.5 ml of singly affinity-purified antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C with strips of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing approximately 2.0 mg of a GST-amphiphysin I fusion protein prepared by PCR as described above using the forward primer 5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCAGAATGAAGTCCCTG (nucleotides 1122–1140 of amphiphysin I) and the reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCCTAATCTAAGCGTCGGGTG (nucleotides 2198–2180 of amphiphysin I). The unbound antibodies (doubly affinity-purified) were collected and tested on Western blots. Various tissues were homogenized at 1:10 (w:v) in 20 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, containing 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 ×g max. Postnuclear supernatants were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for Western blot analysis. Subcellular fractionation of brain homogenates to generate synaptic fractions was performed as described (8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized and perfused through the ascending aorta with 50 ml of 0.1 mNaPO4, pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer) followed by 400 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. The brains were dissected out, postfixed, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and 15-μm sections were cut on a freezing microtome. Sections were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum. The sections were then incubated in primary antibodies for 2 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The immunolabeling was revealed with CY-3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS for 1.5 h. All steps were performed at room temperature with extensive washes in PBS. GST-amphiphysin II and GST alone were used for overlay of rat brain postnuclear supernatants as described (7McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For affinity bead assays, additional GST fusion proteins were generated by PCR with the following primer pairs: GST-amphiphysin II SH3 domain (forward primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCACCTTCCCAGCAACTGTG (nucleotides 1396–1413); reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCATGGGACCCTCTCATGT (nucleotides 1686–1671)), GSTamphiphysin II non-SH3 domain (forward primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCAGTTTGAGGCCCCG (nucleotides 1033–1050); reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCACACAGTTGCTGGGAAGGTC (nucleotides 1413– 1396)), GST-amphiphysin II insert domain (forward primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCCCCAAGTCCCCATCTC (nucleotides 892–907); reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCACACAGCAAAGGTGCCCTCG (nucleotides 1240–1221)), GST-amphiphysin I non-SH3 domain (forward primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCAGAATGAAGTCCCTG (nucleotides 1122– 1140); reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCAGGGCTCTGCACCTATAG (nucleotides 1805–1789)), and GST-amphiphysin I insert domain (forward primer, 5′-GCGGGATCCCCTCGGTCACCTTCACAG (nucleotides 981–998); reverse primer, 5′-GCGGAATTCTCATGTGACAGCAGCCAGAG (nucleotides 1445–1429)). In all cases, the forward primer encoded aBamHI site, and the reverse primer encoded anEcoRI site. The primer pairs were used in PCR reactions with Vent Polymerase using cDNA clones encoding amphiphysin I (13David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) or amphiphysin II as the templates. All PCR products were cloned in frame into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T, and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-amphiphysin I SH3 domain was prepared as described previously (13David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rat brain postnuclear supernatants, prepared as described above, were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 10 min. The soluble supernatant (1 mg of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with various GST fusion proteins (∼25 μg of each fusion protein) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were then washed extensively in 20 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, containing 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Clathrin-coated vesicles were purified from rat brain as described (24Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Clathrin was extracted by incubating the purified vesicles with 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C followed by removal of insoluble material by centrifugation in a Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor at 50,000 rpm. for 30 min (25Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The supernatant fraction was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with ∼25 μg each of various amphiphysin fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were washed in 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Other antibodies used in this study were raised against the following proteins as described: amphiphysin I (13David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), a gift of Drs. Carol David and Pietro De Camilli, Yale University; synaptophysin (26Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), a gift of Dr. Reinhard Jahn, Yale University; clathrin (27Simpson F. Bright N.A. West M.A. Newman L.S. Darnell R.B. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and α-adaptin (28Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), gifts of Dr. Margaret Robinson, Cambridge University; synaptojanin (8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and dynamin (8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial amino acid sequence for amphiphysin II was determined from an I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone identified through an amphiphysin I homology search of the dbEST. Analysis of the protein suggested that it was an alternatively spliced version of the amphiphysin homologue BIN1 (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To obtain the amino terminus of amphiphysin II, we performed PCR on cDNA prepared from adult human cortex (23Bouchelet I. Cohen Z. Case B. Séguéla P. Hamel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 219-223PubMed Google Scholar) using a forward primer encoding the N terminus of BIN1 (from GenBankTM cloneU68485) and a reverse primer in a region of the I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone unique to amphiphysin II. A specific PCR product was generated that overlapped the I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone by 188 amino acids and extended the amino terminus of amphiphysin II by 173 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of amphiphysin II is shown aligned to amphiphysin I, BIN1, and SH3P9 (Fig. 1 A). Amphiphysin II, BIN1, and SH3P9 are essentially identical at their N termini and their SH3 domain-containing C termini. Minor differences between SH3P9 and the other two sequences are due to interspecies variations (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (amphiphysin II and BIN1 are from humans, whereas SH3P9 is from mice). The central domain of amphiphysin II contains a 123-amino acid insert that is not found in SH3P9 or BIN1. The amphiphysin II insert domain is homologous to amphiphysin I through its N-terminal half, but the homology is decreased in the C terminus of the insert domain. A 15-amino acid insert, which is unique to the BIN1 sequence, encodes a nuclear localization signal (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A 31-amino acid insert specific to amphiphysin II is located between amino acids 174 and 204. The pattern of homology seen for amphiphysin II with BIN1 and SH3P9, in which regions of 100% identity are interrupted by regions unique to each protein, suggests that the three proteins arise from alternative splicing of the same gene. To confirm this, we performed Southern blot analysis with human genomic DNA digested withBamHI or EcoRI and hybridized at high stringency with a cDNA probe encoding a region of the amphiphysin II SH3 domain conserved in BIN1 and SH3P9. For both digests, a single hybridizing band was observed (Fig. 1 B), further suggesting that amphiphysin II, BIN1, and SH3P9 are encoded by the same gene. To begin to characterize the amphiphysin II protein, a polyclonal antiserum (antiserum 1874) was produced against a GST fusion protein encoding the C-terminal 217 amino acids of amphiphysin II. To generate an antibody reactive with amphiphysin II but not BIN1 or SH3P9, the serum was affinity-purified against a fusion protein encoding a region of the amphiphysin II-specific insert domain (amino acids 376–444). When tested against strips of crude rat brain homogenate, the affinity-purified antibody was found to react strongly with bands at 90 and 125 kDa (singly affinity-purified 1874; Fig. 2). The band at 125 kDa co-migrated with amphiphysin I (CD5; Fig. 2), suggesting that the antibody is cross-reacting with amphiphysin I. We therefore incubated the singly affinity-purified 1874 antibody with the amphiphysin I fusion protein immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the unbound material reacted specifically with the 90-kDa band (doubly affinity-purified 1874; Fig. 2). The predicted molecular weight for amphiphysin II is 64,703, suggesting that amphiphysin II runs aberrantly on SDS-PAGE, as is the case for amphiphysin I and BIN1, which have predicted molecular masses of approximately 76 and 50 kDa and run on SDS-PAGE at 128 and 70 kDa, respectively (13David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Expression of amphiphysin II constructs in bacteria confirm the aberrant migration of the amphiphysin II protein (data not shown). Western blot analysis of tissue extracts with the doubly affinity-purified amphiphysin II antibody revealed expression of amphiphysin II in brain only (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, amphiphysin I, although enriched in brain, was detected in testis extracts as well (Fig. 3 A). This is in contrast to BIN1, which is present in a wide variety of tissues and most highly expressed in skeletal muscle (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Upon subcellular fractionation of brain extracts, amphiphysin I and II demonstrate a similar distribution pattern, with both proteins present in soluble and membrane-associated fractions (Fig.3 B). The subcellular localization of amphiphysin II was then studied using immunofluorescence microscopy. In all brain regions examined, amphiphysin II immunoreactivity had a punctate appearance, suggesting a concentration of the antigen in synaptic terminals. Thus, a rim of bright puncta were seen surrounding cell bodies and primary dendrites, which themselves were not immunolabeled (Fig. 4, A and B). In the cerebellum, the molecular layer, which is abundant in synaptic terminals, was brightly stained, while the granule cell layer, which is densely packed with granule cell bodies, exhibited immunoreactivity only in discrete clusters corresponding to the mossy fiber terminals. Axons in the white matter were not immunolabeled. Similarly, in the spinal cord, immunonegative cell bodies and dendrites of motor neurons were surrounded by brightly stained puncta, while axonal bundles did not exhibit any immunoreactivity. We never observed labeling of nuclei that are enriched in BIN1 (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The staining pattern for amphiphysin II was practically identical with the immunolabeling observed with an antibody against synaptophysin, a synaptic terminal protein (Fig. 4,E and F). Amphiphysin I immunolabeling (Fig. 4,C and D) also demonstrated a similar punctate synaptic-like distribution (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) although labeling was also present at moderate levels in the cell body cytoplasm.Figure 4Immunofluorescent localization of amphiphysin II. A and B, micrographs from cerebellar (A) and spinal cord (B) sections stained with the doubly affinity-purified amphiphysin II antibody. Note the punctate appearance of the immunostaining, indicative of a synaptic localization of amphiphysin II. Thus, in the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer (P), immunonegative cell bodies are surrounded by a rim of brightly stained puncta. The molecular layer (M) and the mossy fiber terminals in the granule cell layer (G) are also brightly stained. In the spinal cord, there is also a rim of bright puncta surrounding the motor neuron cell bodies and primary dendrites, while the axonal bundles (asterisks) are immunonegative.C and D, amphiphysin I staining of cerebellar (C) and spinal cord sections (D).

To examine the binding properties of amphiphysin II, we used GST-amphiphysin II in overlay assays on rat brain postnuclear supernatant fractions (7McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The fusion protein binds specifically to bands of 145 and 100 kDa (Fig.5 A), a pattern identical to that seen for Grb2 binding (7McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the bands are synaptojanin and dynamin. To confirm the identity of these proteins and to determine if the interactions were SH3 domain-mediated, we performed affinity purifications from rat brain extracts using fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I and II. As a control, we also used fusion proteins encoding a non-SH3 domain region of amphiphysin I and II. The SH3 domain fusion proteins from both amphiphysin I and II strongly bind to dynamin and synaptojanin, whereas the non-SH3 domain amphiphysin I and II fusion proteins do not bind (Fig.5 B). While examining the binding of dynamin and synaptojanin to amphiphysin II, we noticed the presence of a 170-kDa protein that bound to the non-SH3 domain fusion protein. In Fig. 6 A, we demonstrate that the 170-kDa band is clathrin and that it binds to the non-SH3 domain fusion proteins of amphiphysin I and II but does not bind to the SH3 domain of either of these proteins. To further study the clathrin binding, we generated clathrin-coated vesicles from rat brain and extracted the clathrin using 0.5 m Tris (25Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Clathrin prepared in this manner bound to the non-SH3 domain fusion proteins from amphiphysin I and II but did not bind to the fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains (Fig. 6 B). It has previously been demonstrated that amphiphysin I binds to the α-subunit of AP2 (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 16Wang L-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the binding of AP2 to our amphiphysin fusion proteins. The two α-adaptin subunits (αa and αc) of AP2 bound weakly to the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II but did not bind to the SH3 domain of amphiphysin I or to the non-SH3 domain fusion proteins (Fig. 6 A). To further explore this issue, we generated a GST fusion protein against the insert domain of amphiphysin II and a corresponding fusion protein from amphiphysin I. Interestingly, the amphiphysin I but not the amphiphysin II fusion protein bound α-adaptin (Fig. 6 C). Amphiphysin I is a nerve terminal-enriched protein that is thought to function in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Here, we report the amino sequence of amphiphysin II, which we identified based on the sequence of a cDNA clone from the dbEST. Recently, the amino acid sequence of two other amphiphysin I homologues, BIN1 (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and SH3P9 (11Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), were reported. BIN1, SH3P9, and amphiphysin II align with long blocks of virtually identical amino acid sequence interrupted by stretches of sequence specific to the individual proteins. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggests that the three proteins are generated from a single gene. Thus, it seems likely that the three proteins are encoded by alternative splicing leading to the generation of unique sequences that impart distinct properties upon each protein. For example, the only apparent difference between BIN1 and SH3P9 is the presence of a small insert sequence (RKKSKLFSRLRRKKN) in BIN1, which encodes a nuclear localization signal. This is consistent with the function of BIN1 as a Myc-binding protein localized in the nucleus (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and would suggest that SH3P9 may share a common function with BIN1 but be localized outside of the nucleus. A striking feature of amphiphysin II is that it contains a large central domain of 123 amino acids that is not present in either of the other two molecules. This region is strongly homologous to amphiphysin I throughout its N-terminal half, including the presence of a highly conserved proline-rich sequence that forms a potential SH3 domain-binding site (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 29Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The insert domain also contains a binding site for clathrin as discussed below. To begin to characterize amphiphysin II, we generated a polyclonal antiserum against an amphiphysin II-GST fusion protein. To avoid reactivity against BIN1 and SH3P9, we affinity-purified the serum using a fusion protein encoding a region of amphiphysin II restricted to the insert domain. The affinity-purified antibodies reacted with both amphiphysin I and II. Therefore, antibodies against amphiphysin I were absorbed out using an immobilized amphiphysin I fusion protein generating an amphiphysin II-specific antibody. This antibody was used to determine that amphiphysin II is highly enriched in the brain and is concentrated in the presynaptic nerve terminal. This is in contrast to BIN1, which has its highest expression levels in skeletal muscle and is enriched in nuclei (20Sakamuro D. Elliot K.E. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution and subcellular localization of SH3P9 is unknown. A number of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle recycling have been shown to be concentrated in the nerve terminal including clathrin (5Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), AP2 (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), dynamin and synaptojanin (8McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and amphiphysin I (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Further, recent morphological data suggest that dynamin, synaptojanin, and amphiphysin I are present with AP2 at clathrin coats in the nerve terminal and in nonneuronal cells (5Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 30Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Haffner C. Takei K. Buttler M. David C. Hudson A. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 455Google Scholar). Synaptojanin and dynamin are the major brain proteins that interact with the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Based on the conservation of the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I and II, we decided to test the ability of amphiphysin II to interact with these proteins. By overlay and column chromatography assays, dynamin and synaptojanin appear to be the major brain proteins that interact with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II. As a control for the experiments, we used a fusion protein to a non-SH3 domain region of amphiphysin II that encoded a portion of the insert domain as well as the corresponding fusion protein from amphiphysin I. Interestingly, while these fusion proteins did not bind to synaptojanin or dynamin, they were both able to specifically precipitate clathrin from a crude Triton X-100 brain extract. To further study the interaction of clathrin with amphiphysin, we purified clathrin-coated vesicles from rat brain and extracted the clathrin with 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. This procedure releases clathrin as soluble triskelia and leads to an enrichment in clathrin relative to the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 (25Keen J.H. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Cell. 1979; 16: 303-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, clathrin retains its strong binding to the amphiphysin isoforms. Thus, both amphiphysin I and II bind to synaptojanin and dynamin through their SH3 domains and bind to clathrin in an SH3 domain-independent manner. It has previously been demonstrated that amphiphysin I can interact with AP2 (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 16Wang L-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of amphiphysin I and II with clathrin observed here could be indirect and mediated through AP2. However, as determined by immunoblot with an antibody against the α-adaptin subunit (28Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), AP2 was not present in the non-SH3 domain fusion protein precipitates in which clathrin was highly enriched. In contrast, AP2 did bind to an amphiphysin I fusion protein encoding a region of amphiphysin I from amino acids 291–445. The non-SH3 domain amphiphysin I fusion protein, which does not bind clathrin, encodes a region of amphiphysin I from amino acids 338–565, suggesting the presence of a binding site for α-adaptin between amino acids 291 and 338 of amphiphysin I. In addition, AP2 was found to bind to the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II but not amphiphysin I. It was previously demonstrated that AP2 could interact with the SH3 domains of Grb2 (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The interaction of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin II with the α-adaptin subunit of AP2 reported here could be direct, through proline-rich sequences in the α-adaptin subunit (32Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A model has been proposed (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) that suggests that amphiphysin I, which is concentrated on clathrin coats in the nerve terminal (31Haffner C. Takei K. Buttler M.

The SH3 domain of amphiphysin I then serves to target dynamin to the endocytic site (14David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigal O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A highly similar rhesus lymphocryptovirus naturally endemic in rhesus monkeys was used to orally infect naïve animals from a pathogen-free colony. This animal model reproduced key aspects of human EBV infection, including oral transmission, atypical lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, activation of CD23(+) peripheral blood B cells, sustained serologic responses to lytic and latent EBV antigens, latent infection in the peripheral blood, and virus persistence in oropharyngeal secretions.

Here we investigate the translocation and activation of JNK1 during ischemia and reperfusion in perfused rat heart. Ischemia induces the translocation of JNK1 from the cytosol fraction to the nuclear fraction in a time-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical observation also shows that JNK1 staining in the nucleus is enhanced after ischemia. During reperfusion after ischemia, further nuclear translocation of JNK1 is apparently inhibited. In contrast, JNK1 activity in the nuclear fraction does not increased during ischemia but increases significantly during reperfusion with a peak at 10 min of reperfusion. The activation of JNK1 is confirmed by the phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun (Ser-73) with similar kinetics. The level of c-jun mRNA also increases during reperfusion but not during ischemia. Based on fractionation and immunohistochemical analyses, an upstream kinase for JNK1, SAPK/ERK kinase 1 (SEK1), is constantly present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm throughout ischemia and reperfusion, whereas an upstream kinase for mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAPK/ERK kinase 1, remains in the cytosol. Furthermore, phosphorylation at Thr-223 of SEK1, necessary for its activation, rapidly increases in the nuclear fraction during postischemic reperfusion. These findings demonstrate that JNK1 translocates to the nucleus during ischemia without activation and is then activated during reperfusion, probably by SEK1 in the nucleus.

In response to ischemia and reperfusion, various pathways in mammalian cells are induced leading to cell death and organ dysfunction. In the heart, prolonged ischemia causes necrosis and contractile dysfunction, but the heart can recover from injury following brief ischemia. Many genes are expressed in the heart during recovery from ischemia (1Ouellette A.J. Malt R.A. Sukhatme V.P. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin.

Among transcription factors, the expression of c-jun is regulated by a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element in the c-jun promoter.

This activity is likely to be positively regulated by the phosphorylation of Ser-63 and Ser-73 in the NH2-terminal region of c-Jun (14Binétruy B. Smeal T. Karin M.

The induction of c-fos is regulated by a serum response element in the promoter. Transcription factors p67SRF and p62TCF bind to the serum response element, the activity of which is regulated by the phosphorylation of p62TCF by JNK1 (24Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M.

These transcription factors, substrates for JNK1, are constitutively localized in the nucleus throughout ischemia and reperfusion (26Webster K.A. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16852-16858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brand T. Sharma S. Fleischmann K.E. Duncker D.J. McFalls E.O. Verdouw P.D. Schaper W. Circ.

There have been several studies on the nuclear translocation of MAPK in response to stimulation. It is known that MAPK is first activated in the cytoplasm through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and then translocated to the nucleus (28Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 29Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). MEK is constitutively localized in the cytoplasm (30Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19947-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is one of the grounds for the nuclear translocation of MAPK after its activation in the cytoplasm. Recently, Fukuda et al. (31Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) found a nuclear export signal in the sequence of Xenopus MEK, by which MEK that enters into the nucleus through nuclear pores is exported to the cytosol. We have recently demonstrated that MEK2 is partially present in the nucleus, where it is activated during postischemic reperfusion, although MEK1 exists constitutively in the cytosol (32Mizukami Y. Yoshida K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MEK2 activation in the nucleus may be involved in MAPK activation during postischemic reperfusion. On the other hand, the mechanism of JNK activation during ischemia and reperfusion is poorly understood, although recent reports show that JNK1 is activated in rat heart and kidney during reperfusion but not during ischemia (33Pombo C.M.

Commun. 1996; 218: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). No nuclear export signal sequence has been identified in SEK1, an upstream kinase for JNK1, and its localization is presently unknown. The present study is concerned with the nuclear translocation and activation of JNK1 during ischemia and reperfusion. The localization and the activation of SEK1, an upstream kinase for JNK1, are also investigated in ischemic heart. Several lines of evidence obtained here demonstrate that JNK1 translocates to the nucleus during ischemia where it is then activated during reperfusion, probably by nuclear SEK1. Anti-JNK1 antibody (C-17), anti-SEK1 antibody, and protein A-agarose were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz., CA). Anti-histone H1 antibody was from Leinco Technologies Inc.

The biotin blocking system was from Dako (Carpentenia, CA). All other chemicals were commercially available. Male Wistar rats weighing about 200 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. The aortas were cannulated and attached to a Langendorff apparatus. The hearts were perfused and then subjected to global ischemia for 0–40 min and reperfusion for 0–30 min after ischemia for 20 min at 37 °C, as described previously (35Yoshida K. Yamazaki Y.

Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described previously (36Yoshida K. Inui M. Harada K. Saido T. Sorimachi Y. Ishihara T. Kawashima S. Sobue K. Circ.

The frozen hearts were minced and homogenized in 2 volumes of STE buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaN3, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.15 μm pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 nm microcystin) in a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates were mixed with 2 volumes of STE buffer and centrifuged (1,000 × g, 10 min) to obtain pellets. The pellet was washed once and suspended in STE buffer (nuclear fraction). The supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 60 min) to obtain the cytosol fraction and the pellet, which was then suspended in STE buffer (membrane fraction). The nuclear fraction was solubilized in Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm leupeptin A, 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 0.4 nm microcystin LR). The fraction was centrifuged (15,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was stored at −70 °C. The subcellular fractions and molecular mass standards were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with antibody. After washing, the antigens were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent detection reagents. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK1 monoclonal antibody (G151-333.8; Pharmingen). Immunocomplexes were subjected to kinase assays using 2 μg of GST-c-Jun (1–79) as a substrate. Total RNA was prepared and analyzed as described previously (38Yoshioka K. Honma H. Zushi M. Kondo S. Togashi S. Miyake T. Shiba T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Yoshioka K. Deng T. Cavigelli M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4972-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Rat hearts were immersed in OCT compound (Miles) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The specimens were fixed on glasses with PLP solution (0.02 mNaIO4, 0.075 m phosphate buffer, 2% paraformaldehyde) for 10 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. The specimens were blocked with 1.5% normal serum in phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and immunostained by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method using a Vectastatin kit. The peroxidase label was visualized by exposing the sections to diaminobenzidine. To investigate the subcellular localization of JNK1 during ischemia, we first performed the fractionation of the perfused rat hearts. Electron microscopic observation showed that the 1,000 × g pellet (nuclear fraction) contained the nuclei and myofibrils and that the 100,000 × g pellet (membrane fraction) included membrane vesicles and mitochondria (data not shown). Histone H1, a nuclear protein, was localized mainly in the nuclear fraction (80.1 ± 5.2%, n = 8, Fig.1 B), and the recovery remained almost constant throughout ischemia and reperfusion (data not shown). The fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody against JNK1. In untreated hearts, JNK1 predominated in the cytosol fraction (85 ± 2.7%, n = 3), whereas the nuclear fraction contained only 5.6 ± 1.9%. The amount of JNK1 in the cytosol fraction was decreased significantly after 20 min of ischemia (51.3 ± 14.9%) with a concomitant increase in the nuclear fraction (40.4 ± 13.3%). After ischemia for 40 min, the JNK1 level reached a maximum in the nuclear fraction and became undetectable in the cytosol fraction. JNK1 in the membrane fraction remained at control levels throughout ischemia (0–40 min) and reperfusion (0–30 min) (Fig. 1, A and B). The sum of JNK1 in the three fractions remained almost unchanged during ischemia (Fig.1 B). Immunohistochemical observation using anti-JNK1 antibody also showed that JNK1 was localized mainly in the cytosol under control conditions, and the nuclear staining was enhanced after 40 min of ischemia (see Fig. 3, A and B). The staining was inhibited by preincubating the antibody with the peptide or by only secondary antibody (data not shown). These observations, taken together with the immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses, show that ischemia induces the translocation of JNK1 from the cytosol to the nucleus. In contrast, MEK-1 remains strictly in the cytosol fraction during ischemia (0–40 min, Fig. 1 A) and reperfusion (see Fig. 7 B), indicating that the ischemia-induced translocation of JNK1 is not because of nonspecific translocation of protein kinases. Next, hearts were subjected to reperfusion for 0–30 min after global ischemia for 20 min; reperfusion following ischemia for 40 min could not restore myocardial contraction and relaxation. Fractionation and immunoblot analyses showed that the increase in nuclear JNK1 during ischemia was blocked by reperfusion and that the amount of JNK1 in the nuclear fraction remained almost constant during reperfusion (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemical observation also gave similar results (Fig.3).Figure 3Immunohistochemical localization of JNK1 in rat heart during ischemia and reperfusion. Hearts were subjected to ischemia for 0 min (panel A), 40 min (panel B), or reperfusion for 30 min after 20-min ischemia (panel C) and then cryosectioned, fixed with PLP solution, and stained with anti-JNK1 antibody (panels A–C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The figure shows representative photographs from three independent experiments.

In present study, we examined JNK1 activity in the nuclear fraction during postischemic reperfusion by immunoprecipitation-kinase assay using GST-c-Jun (1–79) as a substrate. JNK1 activity in the nuclear fraction remained unchanged during ischemia. Postischemic reperfusion induced the rapid activation of JNK1, with the activity level reaching a maximum after 10 min of reperfusion and remaining at the maximum level throughout 30 min of reperfusion (Fig. 4). To confirm JNK1 activation in the nucleus, we also examined the phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun localized in the nucleus by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (for Ser-73 of c-Jun). Consistent with JNK1 activation in the nuclear fraction, the phosphorylation of c-Jun, which is necessary for the transcriptional activity, was strongly increased in the nuclear fraction during reperfusion but not during ischemia (Fig.5). It is known that c-Jun is most likely phosphorylated at Ser-63 and Ser-73 by activated JNK1 and that it positively regulates the induction of the c-jun mRNA by binding to the c-jun promoter. As shown in Fig. 6, the level of c-jun mRNA did not increase during 40 min of ischemia but increased rapidly during reperfusion (Fig. 6 A). c-fos mRNA has also been reported to be induced through JNK1 activation in response to such stresses as UV irradiation. Northern blot analysis indicates that postischemic reperfusion induces c-fos expression as well as c-jun expression (Fig. 6 B). These observations indicate that activated JNK1 may participate in the induction of c-jun and c-fos in the nucleus during reperfusion but not during ischemia.Figure 5Phosphorylation of c-Jun in the nuclear fraction of rat heart during postischemic reperfusion. The nuclear fraction (70 μg of protein) was prepared from hearts undergoing reperfusion for 0–30 min after ischemia for 20 min and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody (for Ser-73 of c-Jun). Bacterially expressed c-Jun was used as the negative control, and phosphorylated c-Jun in JEG cell extracts was used as the positive control.

We used fractionation and immnoblotting techniques to examine the distribution of SEK1 during ischemia and reperfusion. As shown in Fig.7, anti-SEK1 antibody recognized only one band corresponding to SEK1 with a molecular mass of 45 kDa, and the antibody reaction is inhibited by preincubation with the immunizing peptide or only secondary antibody. Under control conditions, SEK1 is localized mainly in the cytosol fraction and partially in the nuclear fraction. During ischemia and reperfusion, SEK1 was constantly observed in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 7). Next, we examined the distribution of SEK1 under control conditions by immunohistochemistry using the anti-SEK1 antibody. Whereas MEK1 was essentially found in the cytoplasm, SEK1 was present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei in the heart (Fig.8). The staining was blocked by preincubation of the antibody with the immunizing peptide or by only secondary antibody as well as in immunoblotting analysis. SEK1 has been reported to be activated by MEK kinase 1 through phosphorylation at Thr-223 (40Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Fractionation and immunoblotting analyses using anti-phospho-SEK1 antibody revealed that the phosphorylation of SEK1 in the nuclear fraction increased rapidly during reperfusion (Fig. 9), suggesting that after translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus during ischemia, JNK1 may be activated by SEK1 in the nucleus during reperfusion.Figure 9Phosphorylation of SEK1 during postischemic reperfusion in rat heart. The nuclear fraction was prepared from hearts undergoing reperfusion for 0–30 min following ischemia for 20 min and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-SEK1 antibody (for Thr-223 of SEK1). Panel A shows a representative immunoblot from three independent experiments, and panel Bshows the amounts of SEK1 phosphorylation determined by densitometry from the immunoblot with anti-phospho-SEK1 antibody (control %, mean ± S.E., n = 3, *p < 0.05versus control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is generally thought that the nuclear translocation of MAPK family members is associated with their activation (42Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated that ischemia induces the translocation of JNK1 from the cytosol to the nucleus without its activation and that the translocated JNK1 is then activated during reperfusion, probably by nuclear SEK1, an upstream kinase for JNK1. The nuclear translocation of JNK1 appears to involve an active transport system rather than diffusion in the cell according to a concentration gradient, since the nuclear transport of JNK1 is stronger than those of MAPK and protein kinase C isoforms during ischemia as reported previously (32Mizukami Y. Yoshida K. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Yoshida K. Hirata T. Akita Y. Mizukami Y. Yamaguchi K. Sorimachi Y. Ishihara T. Kawashima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44Mizukami Y. Hirata T. Yoshida K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and cytosolic JNK1 becomes concentrated in the nucleus after 40 min of ischemia. Hypoxia and glucose depletion during ischemia should inhibit oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria and lead to a decrease in intracellular ATP. The decrease in ATP, in turn, will result in the inhibition of H+-ATPase activity in the cell, which rapidly lowers the intracellular pH (45Bak M.I. Ingwall J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The decrease in intracellular pH and ATP concentration may inhibit the enzyme activities of JNK1 and upstream kinases. Reperfusion will produce a rapid recovery in the intracellular pH to normal levels and increase the ATP level so that JNK1 could be activated during reperfusion. The idea that JNK1 is translocated to the nucleus during ischemia and activated in the nucleus during reperfusion is supported by the following observations. First, the activity of JNK1 increases in the nucleus during reperfusion, whereas the amount of JNK1 in the nucleus remains unchanged. Second, SEK1, an upstream kinase for JNK, is also present in the nucleus and is phosphorylated at Thr-223, which is required for its activation, in response to reperfusion. Third, the time course of SEK1 phosphorylation is almost identical to that of JNK1 activation. Finally, c-Jun is phosphorylated rapidly after reperfusion, and the mRNA for c-jun is also expressed early; there seems to be no time delay due to the nuclear translocation of JNK1 after reperfusion. This appears to be a common phenomenon in various tissues since the same translocation and activation of JNK1 are also observed in ischemic mouse liver. 2I. Onishi and K. Yoshioka, personal communication. However, we could not completely exclude the possibility that cytosolic JNK1 is also activated and then translocated to the nucleus since the activated form of SEK1 was detected in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus during reperfusion. In recent reports, UV irradiation and osmotic stress have been shown to initiate the clustering of cell surface receptors, and this subsequently induces the activation and nuclear entry of JNK (24Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 46Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). However, it is also reported that γ-radiation results in the activation of nuclear JNK1 without nuclear translocation (47Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Kharbanda et al. (48Kharbanda S. Ren R. Pandey P. Shafman T.D. Feller S.M. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) have shown that JNK1 is activated through nuclear c-Abl activation in response to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that a pathway for JNK1 activation may exist in the nucleus. Thus, there must be several pathways for JNK1 activation in the cell for various forms of stress as described previously by Adler et al. (49Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this report, SEK1, an upstream kinase for JNK1, was found to be partially present in the nucleus even in unstimulated cells. SEK1 does not possess the three leucine residues critical for nuclear export activity. In addition, SEK1, with a molecular mass of ∼45 kDa, is small enough to pass through nuclear pores. Thus, SEK1 could be localized in various cellular compartments that may participate in different JNK1 activation pathways induced by distinct forms of stress. It is well known that cytosolic Ca2+ levels increase during ischemia and reperfusion. Cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+concentrations equilibrate rapidly in the cell since the nuclear envelope is very permeable to Ca2+ (50Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 439-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The rise in cellular Ca2+ is known to trigger the cellular responses through the activation of various enzymes such as protein kinase C (51Nishizuka Y.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JNK1 activation is reported to be inhibited by reperfusion with low [Ca2+] buffer (34Knight R.J. Buxton D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that unknown Ca2+-dependent kinase(s) may be involved in the activation of JNK1 as an upstream kinase(s). There is much evidence that nuclear JNK1 is involved in transcriptional regulation. JNK1 can phosphorylate c-Jun and enhance its transcriptional activity. JNK1 in the nucleus can phosphorylate the transcription factor p62TCF at the c-fospromoter, leading to c-fos induction. As shown in this study, during postischemic reperfusion, JNK1 is activated, and the expression of mRNA for c-jun and c-fos is strongly enhanced. Therefore, we speculate that c-Jun and c-Fos synergistically activate the function of the AP-1 complex (57Halazonetis T.D. Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 55: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 58Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M.

Such gene expression may have relevance to tissue repair or disease development in the ischemic heart. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor activates sphingomyelinase, generating ceramide (61Kim M.-Y.

Since ischemia-reperfusion has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in the heart (66Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar), JNK1 activation might be involved in the signaling pathway leading to apoptosis in the ischemic heart. We thank Dr. M.

The resulting fusion protein has five extra amino acids at the N terminus compared with the native protein, resulting in a protein of 168 amino acids (18.5 kDa). The recombinant Hb is expressed constitutively. Extracts made from the bacteria containing the recombinant fusion construct contain a protein with a subunit molecular mass of approximately 18.5 kDa comprising approximately 5% total soluble protein. Recombinant Hb was purified to homogeneity according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by sequential polyethylene glycol precipitation and fast protein liquid chromatography. Its native molecular mass as assessed by fast protein liquid chromatography-size exclusion was 40 kDa suggesting that it is a dimer. Ligand binding experiments demonstrate that 1) barley Hb has a very slow oxygen dissociation rate constant (0.0272 s−1) relative to other Hbs, and 2) the heme of ferrous and ferric forms of the barley Hb is low spin six-coordinate. The subunit structure, optical spectrum, and oxygen dissociation rate of native barley hemoglobin are indistinguishable from those obtained for the recombinant protein. The implications of these kinetic data on the in vivo function of barley Hb are discussed. A cDNA encoding barley hemoglobin (Hb) has been cloned into pUC 19 and expressed in Escherichia coli.

The recently discovered nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins constitute a new class of protoheme proteins that are expressed at low concentrations, on the order of 1–20 μmol per kg wet weight tissue, in non-nodule, often rapidly growing or rapidly metabolizing tissues such as roots, stems, or germinating seeds of monocotyledonous (1Taylor E.R. Nie X.Z. MacGregor A.W. Hill R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and dicotyledonous plants (2Bogusz D. Llewellyn D.J. Craig S. Dennis E.S. Appleby C.A.

Nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobins are functionally and genetically distinct from the familiar symbiotic plant hemoglobins. Symbiotic hemoglobins are expressed in the cytoplasm of bacteriocytes of nodules formed in symbiotic association between legumes and the bacteriumRhizobium (3Appleby C.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 443-478Crossref Google Scholar, 4Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Day D.A. Udvardi M.K. Appleby C.A. Plant Soil. 1996; 178: 161-169Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or between the actinomyoceteFrankia and variety of non-leguminous woody dicotyledonous plants. In a unique instance, the bacterium Rhizobiumnodulates a non-legume Parasponia andersonii (3Appleby C.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 443-478Crossref Google Scholar). Although symbiotic hemoglobins show large differences in their geminate reactions, all have in common rapid, almost diffusion-limited combination with oxygen and moderate rates of oxygen dissociation, so that they achieve very great oxygen affinity (5Gibson Q.H. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Bogusz D. Appleby C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 100-107Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Typically, nodule hemoglobins occur at up to millimolar concentration in the cytoplasm of the nodule cell, concentrations perhaps 105 times greater than that of free oxygen. These properties, taken together, are ideally suited to facilitate a large flow of oxygen to the symbiosome at free oxygen concentrations as low as 10 nm, the oxygen pressure obtaining in the nodule cell. Nonsymbiotic plant hemoglobin genes of both monocots and dicots fall into a single coherent gene family, distinct from the family of genes that encode symbiotic hemoglobins (6Andersson C.R. Jensen E.O. Llewellyn D.J. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the unique instance of the nodulating tree, P. andersonii, a gene in the nonsymbiotic hemoglobin family encodes a hemoglobin whose pattern of expression and functional properties are those of a symbiotic hemoglobin (5Gibson Q.H. Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Bogusz D. Appleby C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 100-107Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 6Andersson C.R. Jensen E.O. Llewellyn D.J. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Since nonsymbiotic Hb has now been demonstrated to occur in two of the major divisions of the plant kingdom, it is likely that a Hb gene is present in the genome of all higher plants (7Bogusz D. Appleby C.A. Landsmann J. Dennis E.S. Trinick M.J. Peacock W.J. Nature. 1988; 331: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Wittenberg J.B. Wittenberg B.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

Evol. 1984; 21: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 10Appleby C.A. Sci. Prog. 1992; 76: 365-398Google Scholar), and it is suggested that most symbiotic Hb genes arise by duplication of preexisting nonsymbiotic Hb genes (6Andersson C.R. Jensen E.O. Llewellyn D.J. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Barley (Hordeum sp., a monocotyledonous cereal) nonsymbiotic hemoglobin is expressed in seed and root tissues under anaerobic conditions (1Taylor E.R. Nie X.Z. MacGregor A.W. Hill R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since the level of hemoglobin in barley root or aleurone tissue is of the order of 20 μm, we have developed an expression system in Escherichia coli to produce a barley hemoglobin fusion protein that closely resembles the native protein but differs in having five extra amino acids at the N terminus. This report addresses the expression, purification, and characterization of the fusion protein, in particular its reactions with oxygen and carbon monoxide and the configuration of the heme pocket of the ferrous (deoxy) protein. Some properties of native barley hemoglobin are also described. Comparisons with other hemoglobins show that some of the binding properties of recombinant and native barley Hb with gaseous ligands are unique. Two, not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been proposed for nonsymbiotic hemoglobins, as sensors of oxygen concentration and as carriers in oxygen transport (6Andersson C.R. Jensen E.O. Llewellyn D.J. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest a third possibility, namely electron transfer, possibly to a bound oxygen molecule. To our knowledge this report describes the first characterization of a nonsymbiotic monocot plant Hb. pUC 19 plasmid (Canadian Life Technologies), into which barley root Hb cDNA (1Taylor E.R. Nie X.Z. MacGregor A.W. Hill R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was cloned, was used as the source of the barley Hb cDNA. Linker-adapters were constructed by the University of Manitoba DNA laboratory. E. coli strain DH5-α (Canadian Life Technologies) was used as the host for both recombinant and nonrecombinant plasmids. Subcloning efficiency DH5-α competent cells (Canadian Life Technologies) were used for transformation and growth of plasmids. Enzymes for DNA manipulation and agarose were from Canadian Life Technologies. GeneClean II Kit was from Bio-Can Scientific. All other biochemicals were from Sigma or Canadian Life Technologies. pUC 19 plasmid, into which Hb cDNA had been subcloned from Bluescript (1Taylor E.R. Nie X.Z. MacGregor A.W. Hill R.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) between the restriction sites SstI and XbaI, was used as the starting material. The procedure resulted in the removal of the 5′-untranslated region from the cDNA to minimize the extra amino acids of the final recombinant protein. The pUC19 ATG was used as the starting codon. The insert was removed from the plasmid and then reinserted into pUC19 in such a way as to remove the 5′ region and have the coding sequence in the correct reading frame. The plasmid containing the insert (approximately 100 μg) was digested for 6 h with SstII (which cuts the insert at 7th and 10th base pair inside the coding sequence) (7Bogusz D. Appleby C.A. Landsmann J. Dennis E.S. Trinick M.J. Peacock W.J. Nature. 1988; 331: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and then dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The 8-mer (single-stranded adapter, ATCGCCGG) was then phosphorylated and allowed to anneal with the 14-mer (single-stranded adapter, AGCTTAGCGGCCGC) to form a linker-adapter containing an SstII site at one end,HindIII site at the other end, and a NotI site in the middle. The adapter was then ligated to the insert end of theSstII-digested plasmid. The plasmid was then digested withSstI releasing the insert cDNA (with the linker-adapter ligated to it forming a HindIII site at the end). The insert was separated from the plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using GeneClean II Kit. Nonrecombinant pUC19 (approximately 100 μg) was double-digested withSstI and HindIII and then dephosphorylated. The insert was then ligated with the nonrecombinant pUC19, and the resulting ligation mix was used to transform DH5-α E. colicells. DH5-α cells were transformed according to the instructions for the Canadian Life Technologies subcloning efficiency competent cells. Blue-white screening was unnecessary since all the colonies tested contained the recombinant plasmid (efficiency = 100%). Colonies were picked from the agar plates using a sterile loop and transferred to tubes containing 10 ml of sterile LB (with 150 μg/ml ampicillin). The cells were allowed to grow overnight. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the cells using the small scale plasmid preparation protocol from Sambrooket al. (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.25-1.31Google Scholar). Restriction enzyme digests of the resulting plasmid DNA confirmed that Hb cDNA insert could be released as expected by digests using SstI/NotI,SstI/SstII, or SstI/HindIII (data not shown). Cells containing the recombinant and nonrecombinant (pUC 19) plasmids were grown for protein expression in sterile LB media containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 100 μg/ml δ-aminolevulinic acid, with or without 1 mmIPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HbO2, oxyhemoglobin; HbCO, carbon monoxide hemoglobin; 5-C, five coordinate; 6-C, six coordinate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. at 37 °C for 6–8 h. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and frozen at −80 °C until used. SDS-PAGE was performed using a Bio-Rad Miniprotean II gel apparatus according to an established protocol (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Final acrylamide monomer concentration in the 0.75-mm thick slab gels was 15% (w/v) for the separating gel and 4% (w/v) for the stacking gel. For the determination of subunit molecular mass, a plot ofR F versus log molecular mass was constructed using the following protein standards: BSA (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad prepared reagent and BSA as standard. All procedures were performed at 4 °C, and all chromatographic separations used a Pharmacia FPLC system. All buffers were adjusted to pH and degassed at 20 °C. Washed cells (5 g, wet weight) were resuspended in 40 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose (w/v), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 14 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml E-64) and disrupted by three passes through a chilled French pressure cell at approximately 20,000 p.s.i. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant fluid was diluted to 50 ml with extraction buffer and fractionated with polyethylene glycol 8000. The red colored 10–22% polyethylene glycol pellet was redissolved in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5. 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA) and the clarified solution applied at a rate of 1 ml/min to a column (1.5 × 6 cm) of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) preequilibrated with buffer A. After thorough washing at 1 ml/min, the protein was eluted at the same flow rate with a 100-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions eluting around 150–200 mm KCl contained most of the red color and were pooled and diluted approximately 2.5–3-fold with buffer A. The pooled, diluted Hb sample was then applied at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with buffer A. The Hb was then eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in buffer A. The fractions eluting around 160 mm KCL were pooled. Ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled sample to a final concentration of 30% (w/v) and dissolved. The sample was then loaded onto a prepacked phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 30% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. Hb was then eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a 50-ml linear gradient of 30–0% (w/v) ammonium sulfate in buffer A. The fractions eluting from the phenyl-Sepharose column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the most pure fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of approximately 200 μl and buffer exchanged into PBS (40 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl) using a Centricon 10 concentrator. The purified Hb was then either immediately used for analysis or stored at −80 °C until needed. The native molecular mass of recombinant barley root Hb was determined by gel filtration on a prepacked Superose 12 HR 10/30 column using 0.2-ml sample volumes and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 150 mm KCl as column buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and assayed forA 280 and A 412 (absorbance maxima of barley HbO2). The native molecular mass of the fusion protein was determined from a plot of K av(partition coefficient) versus log molecular mass for the following protein standards: alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ribonuclease (14 kDa). Purified native and recombinant hemoglobin underwent electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad minigel system (Ref. 12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, see above) and was then transferred using the Bio-Rad system to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then stained using 0.01% Coomassie Blue, 40% (v/v) methanol, and destained in 40–50% methanol until the hemoglobin band was apparent. The Hb band was excised and subjected to amino acid analysis using an Applied Biosystems Model 420 amino acid derivatizer system. These were acquired using a modified Cary model 17 recording spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) equipped with an Aviv data acquisition and analysis system. Total heme was determined using a pyridine-hemochromogen assay (14Kraus D.W. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16043-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemoglobin concentration was determined by Bradford protein assay or by A 412measurements. 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.40, containing 0.5 mm EDTA was used throughout. The temperature was 20 °C. These were measured using an Hi-Tech model SF 61 (Salisbury, UK) stopped-flow apparatus interfaced to an OLIS Data Acquisition/Computation System (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). Rates were computed using either the Olis system or Origins 4.1 (Microcal Software Northampton, MA). Most kinetic experiments used Hb purified by chromatography on Mono Q HR only, omitting the final hydrophobic interaction chromatography step. A solution of ferrous barley Hb (5.8 μm heme in buffer containing a 3-fold molar excess of dithionite) was mixed rapidly with solutions of oxygen (250–1000 μm) in buffer, and the reaction was followed at 426 and 409 nm, respectively, a minimum and a maximum in the difference spectrum: HbO2 minus ferrous Hb. Measurements were limited to the range of ≥250 μm dissolved oxygen (before mixing) because autoxidation reactions dominate at lower oxygen pressure. Apparent first order rates were calculated assuming a single exponential decay using the Origins 4.1 program. Solutions of ferrous barley Hb (5.8 μm heme in buffer containing a 3-fold molar excess of dithionite) were mixed rapidly with solutions of carbon monoxide (25–1000 μm in buffer), and the reaction was followed at 428 and 415 nm, respectively, a minimum and a maximum in the difference spectrum: HbCO minus ferrous Hb. Apparent first order rates were calculated assuming a single exponential decay using the Origins 4.1 program. A solution of barley Hb02 (3.5 μm HbO2; 27 μm free oxygen in buffer) was mixed rapidly with solutions of carbon monoxide (250–1000 μm in buffer containing 0–4 mm dithionite), and the reaction was followed at 419 and 404 nm, respectively, a maximum and a minimum in the difference spectrum: HbCO minus HbO2. To confirm the rate, the solution of HbO2 was mixed rapidly with 2 mm dithionite alone, and the reaction followed at 426 nm, a maximum in the difference spectrum: HbO2 minus ferrous Hb. Solutions of barley HbCO (3.2 μm HbCO, 5 μm free CO in buffer), prepared by equilibrating solutions of HbO2 first with CO at 1 atm and subsequently with CO in N2 (PCO = 3.7 torr), were mixed rapidly with solutions of oxygen (680 and 1300 μm in buffer), and the reaction was followed at 419 nm, a maximum in the difference spectrum barley HbCO minus HbO2. The rate was the same at lower HbCO concentration (approximately 1 μm, n = 3). To confirm the findings, solutions of HbCO containing a slight excess of dithionite were mixed rapidly with a solution of NO (1,000 μm, in buffer). The reaction was followed at 418 nm, a minimum in the difference spectrum nitric oxide ferrous hemoglobin minus HbCO. A solution of barley HbO2 (4.7 μmheme in buffer) was equilibrated at 1 atm total pressure with wet gas mixtures containing varying proportions of O2 and CO. Autoxidation was minimal under this condition where the sum of the gas partial pressures was kept large. After equilibration at each gas composition was complete, optical spectra were acquired from 450 to 380 nm. Calculations were made from the sum of changes at 419 and 435.5 nm, respectively, a maximum, and an isosbestic point in the difference spectrum: barley HbCO minus HbO2. Agar-LB plates of DH5-α cells transformed with the ligation mix produced many colonies. Cells grown from these colonies when compared with those containing the nonrecombinant pUC 19 were distinctly more red in color (not shown). Restriction digests of plasmid DNA preparations from these cells confirmed the existence of an insert that could be released by the expected restriction enzymes and had the expected molecular weight (approximately 800 base pairs, not shown). SDS-PAGE of crude protein extracts from these cells revealed a major band at 18.5 kDa that was found only in the lanes corresponding to the cells containing the recombinant plasmid (Fig. 1 A). Addition of 1 mm IPTG to the bacterial suspension had no significant effect on the 18.5-kDa band (Fig. 1 A).A 412 measurements of the crude extract (using a crude extract from nonrecombinant bacteria as a blank) gave an estimated concentration of extractable hemoglobin of 0.2 mg/g fresh weight compared with 4 mg/g fresh weight extractable total soluble protein. From these figures and visual analysis of SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 A), the fusion protein appears to be approximately 5% of the total soluble bacterial protein. The purification of barley Hb is shown in Table I. Recombinant barley Hb was purified 16.2-fold to a final purity of over 97% as assessed byA 412 measurements with a yield of 5%. Purified recombinant Hb was over 95% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1 B).Table IPurification of recombinant barley hemoglobinFractionProteinHb1-aAmount of Hb determined by A 412measurements and a standard curve.HbF.P.1-bFold purification.Yieldmgmg%%Crude extract24915.16.01.010010–22% PEG precipitation11212.511.21.983Q-Sepharose chromatography128.975.012.558Mono-Q FPLC65.286.714.234Phenyl-Sepharose FPLC1.31.298.016.251-a Amount of Hb determined by A 412measurements and a standard curve.1-b Fold purification. Open table in a new tab The recombinant Hb has an expected N-terminal sequence of Met-Ile-Thr-Pro-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Glu as compared with the native Hb N-terminal sequence of Met-Ser-Ala-Ala-Glu and therefore has five additional amino acids. SDS-PAGE of the final purified recombinant protein confirms that the expressed Hb has the expected molecular mass (Fig. 1 B). Native molecular mass as assessed by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 12 was determined to be 40 kDa (±4 kDa (n = 3)). This suggests that barley hemoglobin is a homodimer. The amino acid composition of the native 2Germination of barley seeds, antibody preparation, affinity purification of Hb antibodies, preparation of an immunoaffinity column, and immunoaffinity chromatography of barley Hb will be described in a future article (manuscript in preparation). and recombinant hemoglobin is shown in Table II, except for glycine which gave unreliable results probably due to the presence of glycine in the electrophoretic transfer buffer. The observed amino acid composition of the native and recombinant Hb were, within the error of the determination, generally in agreement with the expected, deduced composition, based on nucleotide sequence data. Methionine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine were exceptions. Methionine is noted for being problematic in amino acid determinations. When asparate + asparagine and glutamate + glutamine levels are expressed in combination, the results (Table II) are in agreement with the expected levels. The differences between expected and observed values for lysine are not readily explainable, except to suggest that the differences could have resulted from modifications during the analysis process. It is notable, however, that the levels of lysine are in agreement between the native and recombinant barley hemoglobin. These results suggest that the native and recombinant proteins differ only in the additional five amino acids at the N-terminal end of the recombinant protein.Table IIAmino acid composition of native and recombinant barley hemoglobinAmino acidNative hemoglobinRecombinant hemoglobinExpectedObservedExpectedObservedMet0.310.270.300.21Ser0.310.340.300.35Asp0.28 (0.42)2-aExpected aspartate + asparagine.0.440.26 (0.41)2-aExpected aspartate + asparagine.0.44Gly0.41Unreliable2-bGlycine present in the electrophoresis buffer (12).0.39Unreliable2-bGlycine present in the electrophoresis buffer (12).Ala1.001.001.001.00Glu0.69 (0.86)2-cExpected glutamate + glutamine.0.820.66 (0.83)2-cExpected glutamate + glutamine.0.83Val0.500.520.490.49Phe0.410.420.390.39Lys0.630.510.610.48Ile0.280.290.290.28Asn0.14ND2-dND, not determined.0.13NDArg0.360.360.350.36Pro0.320.360.340.34Thr0.410.370.440.39Leu0.720.720.740.75Trp0.09ND0.09NDHis0.130.130.130.09Cys0.040.020.040.02Tyr0.090.090.090.10Gln0.18ND0.04NDAmounts of each amino acid relative to alanine as 1.00 (pmol).2-a Expected aspartate + asparagine.2-b Glycine present in the electrophoresis buffer (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar).2-c Expected glutamate + glutamine.2-d ND, not determined.

The spectral properties of recombinant barley Hb are reported in Table III, and optical spectra are presented in Figs. 2 and 3. The spectra are essentially invariant from pH 6.0 to pH 9.0. To be certain that the spectrum of deoxy-Hb was independent of the route by which the compound was formed, deoxy-Hb was prepared in three ways: 1) reaction of ferric Hb with dithionite, 2) reaction of HbO2 with large excess of dithionite, and 3) removal of carbon monoxide from a solution of HbCO sparged with inert gas (dithionite was present to prevent ferric Hb formation). The optical spectrum was in each case the same. As discussed below, spectra of the ferric and deoxy ferrous forms suggest that these are low spin six-coordinate (6-C) species.Table IIISpectral properties of recombinant barley hemoglobinDerivativeλmaxεmmFerrous Hb425190529, 53515.0, 14.5555, 56320.5, 21.2HbO241214954017.357617.3HbCO41720253716.656716.4Ferric Hb41114153422565 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Optical spectrum of ferric barley hemoglobin in the visible region.

The rates with each ligand were independent of the observing wavelength. Above 200 μm ligand concentration (after mixing), the rates of O2 and CO combination are similar and independent of ligand concentration (Fig.4). The CO combination rates decline monotonically toward zero at zero ligand concentration. The maximum combination rate for O2 (43 s−1), determined graphically from Fig. 4, is close to that found for CO (41 s−1). At the two lowest CO concentrations examined, 12.6 and 25.2 μm CO (after mixing), the observed combination rate becomes small relative to the maximum rate (Fig. 4), and the initial concentration of CO exceeds the Hb concentration by 4.3- and 8.6-fold, respectively. Second order combination rate constants were approximated as the observed first order rate divided by the ligand concentration. The average value at these two CO concentrations is k = 0.57 × 106m−1 s−1 (n = 10). A single homogeneous kinetic event (k = 0.0272 s−1; n = 5), independent of both CO and dithionite concentration, was observed in the replacement of bound oxygen by carbon monoxide in the presence of dithionite. A single but inhomogeneous rate (k = 0.0243 s−1; n = 2) was observed in the absence of CO. To eliminate the possibility that dithionite was reacting with HbO2 without prior dissociation of bound oxygen, the reaction was followed in the presence of CO alone. The observed rate (0.013 s−1 at 1000 μm CO) serves to substantiate the rates observed in the presence of dithionite but is about 2-fold less and approximately proportional to CO concentration. Evidently CO does not compete effectively with dissolved oxygen in the solution. A single homogeneous rate (k = 1.10 × 10−3 s−1;n = 3) was observed in replacement of bound CO by O2. In confirmation, using a less pure sample of HbCO, a single but inhomogeneous rate (1.2 × 10−3s−1; n = 2) was observed in the replacement of bound CO by O2 and an inhomogeneous rate (1.4 × 10−3 s−1; n = 5) in replacement of bound CO by NO. A plot of the ratio HbO2/HbCO against the ratio oxygen partial pressure/carbon monoxide partial pressure was linear over the range examined (Fig. 5). The partition coefficient, M, given by the reciprocal of the slope of this relation, is M = 1.48. This was calculated from the value of the partition coefficient and the three already established rate constants. The partition coefficient,M, expresses the relative affinities of ferrous Hb for O2 and CO: M =K D /L D, whereK D and L D are the equilibrium binding constants for O2 and CO, respectively.K D and L D in turn express the ratios of the respective dissociation and combination rate constants:K D =k′off,O2/k on,O2 andL D =k off,CO/k′on,CO. Entering the known values into the expression for M, we obtain an approximate numerical value for the second order rate constant for combination of O2 with"

Cu2+ treatment of ECF1from this mutant cross-linked an α subunit to the δ subunit in high yield. Two different sites of disulfide bond formation were involved,i.e. between Cys90 (or the closely spaced Cys47) of α with Cys140 of δ, and between Cys2 of α and Cys140 of δ. Small amounts of other cross-linked products, including α-α, δ internal, and α-α-δ were obtained. In ECF1F0, there was no cross-linking between the intrinsic Cys of α and Cys140. Instead, the product generated between Cys2 of α and Cys140 of δ was obtained at near 90% yield. Small amounts of α-α and δ internal were present, and under high Cu2+ concentrations, α-α-δ was also formed. The ATPase activity of ECF1 and ECF1F0 was not significantly affected by the presence of these cross-links. When Cys140 of δ was first modified with N-ethylmaleimide in ECF1F0, an α-δ cross-link was still produced, although in lower yield, between Cys64 of δ and Cys2 of α. ATP hydrolysis-linked proton pumping of inner membranes from the mutant α2QC was only marginally affected by cross-linking of the α to the δ subunit. These results indicate that Cys140 and Cys64 of the δ subunit and Cys2 of the α subunit are in close proximity. This places the δ subunit near the top of the α-β hexagon and not in the stalk region. As fixing the δ to the α by cross-linking does not greatly impair either the ATPase function of the enzyme, or coupled proton translocation, we argue that the δ subunit forms a portion of the stator linking F1 to F0."

Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, claims twice as many human lives as AIDS and more lives than any other infectious disease (1World Health Organization The World Health Report. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar). The rapid spread of tuberculosis among the AIDS patients and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis demand the development of new drugs (2Bloom B.R. Murray C.

Unfortunately, no new antimycobacterial target for drug development has been characterized in the past 25 years. Since the unique cell wall lipids of mycobacteria play a major role in survival of the pathogen in the hostile environment within the host (4Mehra V. Brennan P.J. Rada E. Convit J. Bloom B.R.

Surface-exposed lipids such as phthiocerol esters and mycosides have been found to be unique to pathogenic mycobacteria (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria.

These lipids contain two diols, phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol, respectively, esterified with multiple methyl-branched long chain fatty acids called mycocerosic acids (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, NY1982: 95-184Google Scholar, 12Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev.

Thus, biosynthesis of mycocerosic acids, phthiocerol, or phenolphthiocerol may provide new antimycobacterial drug targets and clues to pathogenesis of tuberculosis. We previously purified the mycocerosic acid synthase (MAS) 1The abbreviations used are: MAS, mycocerosic acid synthase; AT, acyl transferase; KS, ketoacyl synthase; KR, ketoreductase; ER, enoyl reductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAS, fatty acid synthase; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: MAS, mycocerosic acid synthase; AT, acyl transferase; KS, ketoacyl synthase; KR, ketoreductase; ER, enoyl reductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAS, fatty acid synthase; ORF, open reading frame.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Labeling studies using 14C-labeled propionate and acetate indicated that both are incorporated into the long chain diols (17Gastambide-Odier M. C. R. Hebd. Acad. Sci. C Sci. Chim. 1966; 262: 1401-1404Google Scholar, 18Gastambide-Odier, M., Delaumeny, J. M., and Lederer, E. (1963)Chem. Ind. 1285–86.Google Scholar, 19Gastambide-Odier M. Sarda P. Lederer E. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1967; 49: 849-863PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the aliphatic chains are derived from both malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. However, nothing is known about the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis or the genes that encode them. Based on current biochemical concepts, here we postulate a unique biosynthetic pathway for phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol and a genetic organization for a cluster of genes (pps) that would encode a set of enzymes to catalyze the synthesis of phthiocerol from docosanoyl and phenolphthiocerol fromp-hydroxyphenylheptadecanoyl primers. We report the identification of the postulated pps gene cluster inMycobacterium bovis BCG by demonstrating that disruption of this gene cluster abolishes the production of both phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol derivatives. We also report that the same genes are present in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, the two most pathogenic species of slow-growing mycobacteria.DISCUSSIONMolecular strategies used for the synthesis of fatty acids and polyketides allow us to postulate reasonable mechanisms for the biosynthesis of the two diols, phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol, found uniquely in pathogenic mycobacteria. Both diols have a segment that should be derived from malonyl-CoA and a segment that should be derived from methylmalonyl-CoA. The position of the two hydroxyl groups in both suggests that they could be left during the synthesis of the aliphatic chain rather than by introduction of hydroxyl groups into preformed chains. Thus, an enzyme module that synthesizes this segment would have an AT, KS, KR, but no DH and ER, domains. Only when the synthesis of the entire product involves repetition of all of the steps, such as in the case of FAS or MAS using malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, respectively, a single enzyme module (as dimer) is used. When the synthesis involves multiple dissimilar modules, each enzyme usually catalyzes only one cycle and does not repeat the process. We therefore postulate that two modules each with only AT, KS, and KR sequentially catalyze the condensation with malonyl-CoA each time followed by reduction to generate the 1,3-diol function. Since the next step would involve extension by a fully reduced two-carbon unit, we postulate the need for a full FAS-like module that would use malonyl-CoA as the substrate. The next step should be chain extension by a fully reduced three carbon unit with a methyl branch by a complete MAS-like module. The final process could be condensation by methylmalonyl-CoA requiring a module containing KS and AT domains resembling the corresponding domains of MAS. The resulting 3-keto acid could undergo decarboxylation yielding a keto derivative. Reduction of the carbonyl and methylation of the resulting hydroxyl group would complete the process. The postulated keto intermediates in the synthesis of both phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol occur naturally in mycobacteria (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, NY1982: 95-184Google Scholar, 14Asselineau C. Asselineau J. Kubica G.P. Wayne L.G. The Mycobacteria: A Sourcebook. Marcel Dekker, Inc., NY1984: 345-359Google Scholar, 30Puzo G. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Finding of the postulated specific and unique combination of domains organized in a modular manner in the mycobacterial genome supports our hypothesis that this cluster represents phthiocerol and/or phenolphthiocerol synthase genes. The postulated need formas-like and fas-like AT and KS domains to synthesize the straight chain and methyl-branched segments prompted us to search for mycobacterial genomic segments that would hybridize with both types of domains. This approach led us to the BCG cosmid 49 as the one containing the postulated pps genes. The sequence of cosmid 49 that we had generated helped us to recognize thepps gene cluster when M. tuberculosis andM. leprae genomic sequences became available as part of the mycobacterial genome project.Allelic exchange or gene knockout by homologous recombination is an efficient tool for generating defined mutants to study gene function(s). Gene knockout proved difficult in slow-growing mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis and M. bovisBCG (31McFadden J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). So far, only three reports on gene disruption by allelic exchange in this group of mycobacteria are available (24Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Another involved theleuD gene, and disruption resulted in leucine auxotrophic mutants (33Balasubramaniun V. Pavelka M.S. Bardarov S.S. Martin J. Weisbrod T.R. McAdam R.A. Bloom B.R. Jacobs W.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 273-279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since no general convenient method is available for screening the gene-disrupted mutants, we used PCR to identifymas gene-disrupted mutants (24Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4787-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the present work, we used the sacB gene from B. subtilis (23Steinmetz M. Le Coq D. Aymerich S. Gonzy-Treboul G. Gay P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) as a sucrose sensitivity counter-selectable marker to avoid the need for extensive screening to isolate the allelic exchange mutants. Although some of the mutants that grow in sucrose may represent the mutatedsacB gene and not the desired knockout mutants, this approach should be useful as a general method for screening for the homologous recombinants with double crossover in the slow-growing mycobacteria, because the sucrose-grown transformants are highly enriched in such mutants.Disruption of the gene encoding some of the modules involved in the biosynthesis of phthiocerol and/or phenolphthiocerol should prevent the synthesis of the diol(s) if another set of gene cluster in the genome cannot substitute for the disrupted one. Even thoughpks-like genes appear to be widely distributed in mycobacterial genomes, we could not find another cluster by our search by hybridization with fas and mas domains. Our disruption construct was designed in such a way that pps2 and pps3 would be disrupted. The gene-disrupted mutant was incapable of producing mycoside B and phthiocerol dimycocerosates, the known end products of the diol synthase, showing that the disrupted genes encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of both diols. This cluster of genes is therefore designated phthiocerol/phenolphthiocerol synthase genes, pps. These results show that the same set of enzymes synthesize both diols using two different starting acyl moieties as shown in Fig. 1. The relative amounts of the diols are probably determined by the availability of the starting acyl moieties.Radio gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of fatty acids generated from [1-14C]propionic acid by the pps-disrupted mutant showed no mycocerosic acids, whereas such acids are the major labeled fatty acids in the wild type (24Azad A.K.

That the lack of such acids was not due to any indirect interference on MAS synthesis was shown by the fact that the mutant had normal levels of enzymatically active MAS. Mycocerosic acids occur mainly as esters of phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria.

Comparison of this mutant, which lacks both mycoside B and phthiocerol dimycocerosates, with themas-disrupted mutant, which only lacks the former, should provide information on the function of phthiocerol dimycocerosates. The rapidly expanding information on the genomic sequence of pathogenic mycobacteria can be used if the functional genes can be identified. The present results constitute an example of how the sequence emerging from the genome project can be used to identify functional genes. The gene-disrupted mutants should be useful in testing the postulated roles of the phenolic glycolipids such as inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species by mononuclear cells (34Launois P.

Since thepps genes are unique to pathogenic mycobacteria, they may be used as targets in high throughput screening for antimycobacterial drugs desperately needed to combat a major threat to human health. Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, claims twice as many human lives as AIDS and more lives than any other infectious disease (1World Health Organization The World Health Report. World Health Organization, Geneva1996Google Scholar). The rapid spread of tuberculosis among the AIDS patients and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis demand the development of new drugs (2Bloom B.R. Murray C.

Unfortunately, no new antimycobacterial target for drug development has been characterized in the past 25 years. Since the unique cell wall lipids of mycobacteria play a major role in survival of the pathogen in the hostile environment within the host (4Mehra V. Brennan P.J. Rada E. Convit J. Bloom B.R.

Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 559-567Google Scholar). Surface-exposed lipids such as phthiocerol esters and mycosides have been found to be unique to pathogenic mycobacteria (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria.

These lipids contain two diols, phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol, respectively, esterified with multiple methyl-branched long chain fatty acids called mycocerosic acids (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, NY1982: 95-184Google Scholar, 12Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev.

Thus, biosynthesis of mycocerosic acids, phthiocerol, or phenolphthiocerol may provide new antimycobacterial drug targets and clues to pathogenesis of tuberculosis. We previously purified the mycocerosic acid synthase (MAS) 1The abbreviations used are: MAS, mycocerosic acid synthase; AT, acyl transferase; KS, ketoacyl synthase; KR, ketoreductase; ER, enoyl reductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAS, fatty acid synthase; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: MAS, mycocerosic acid synthase; AT, acyl transferase; KS, ketoacyl synthase; KR, ketoreductase; ER, enoyl reductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; FAS, fatty acid synthase; ORF, open reading frame.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19388-19395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling studies using 14C-labeled propionate and acetate indicated that both are incorporated into the long chain diols (17Gastambide-Odier M. C. R. Hebd. Acad. Sci. C Sci. Chim. 1966; 262: 1401-1404Google Scholar, 18Gastambide-Odier, M., Delaumeny, J. M., and Lederer, E. (1963)Chem. Ind. 1285–86.Google Scholar, 19Gastambide-Odier M. Sarda P. Lederer E. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1967; 49: 849-863PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that the aliphatic chains are derived from both malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. However, nothing is known about the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis or the genes that encode them. Based on current biochemical concepts, here we postulate a unique biosynthetic pathway for phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol and a genetic organization for a cluster of genes (pps) that would encode a set of enzymes to catalyze the synthesis of phthiocerol from docosanoyl and phenolphthiocerol fromp-hydroxyphenylheptadecanoyl primers. We report the identification of the postulated pps gene cluster inMycobacterium bovis BCG by demonstrating that disruption of this gene cluster abolishes the production of both phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol derivatives. We also report that the same genes are present in M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, the two most pathogenic species of slow-growing mycobacteria. DISCUSSIONMolecular strategies used for the synthesis of fatty acids and polyketides allow us to postulate reasonable mechanisms for the biosynthesis of the two diols, phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol, found uniquely in pathogenic mycobacteria. Both diols have a segment that should be derived from malonyl-CoA and a segment that should be derived from methylmalonyl-CoA. The position of the two hydroxyl groups in both suggests that they could be left during the synthesis of the aliphatic chain rather than by introduction of hydroxyl groups into preformed chains. Thus, an enzyme module that synthesizes this segment would have an AT, KS, KR, but no DH and ER, domains. Only when the synthesis of the entire product involves repetition of all of the steps, such as in the case of FAS or MAS using malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, respectively, a single enzyme module (as dimer) is used. When the synthesis involves multiple dissimilar modules, each enzyme usually catalyzes only one cycle and does not repeat the process. We therefore postulate that two modules each with only AT, KS, and KR sequentially catalyze the condensation with malonyl-CoA each time followed by reduction to generate the 1,3-diol function. Since the next step would involve extension by a fully reduced two-carbon unit, we postulate the need for a full FAS-like module that would use malonyl-CoA as the substrate. The next step should be chain extension by a fully reduced three carbon unit with a methyl branch by a complete MAS-like module. The final process could be condensation by methylmalonyl-CoA requiring a module containing KS and AT domains resembling the corresponding domains of MAS. The resulting 3-keto acid could undergo decarboxylation yielding a keto derivative. Reduction of the carbonyl and methylation of the resulting hydroxyl group would complete the process. The postulated keto intermediates in the synthesis of both phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol occur naturally in mycobacteria (8Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, NY1982: 95-184Google Scholar, 14Asselineau C. Asselineau J. Kubica G.P. Wayne L.G. The Mycobacteria: A Sourcebook. Marcel Dekker, Inc., NY1984: 345-359Google Scholar, 30Puzo G. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Finding of the postulated specific and unique combination of domains organized in a modular manner in the mycobacterial genome supports our hypothesis that this cluster represents phthiocerol and/or phenolphthiocerol synthase genes. The postulated need formas-like and fas-like AT and KS domains to synthesize the straight chain and methyl-branched segments prompted us to search for mycobacterial genomic segments that would hybridize with both types of domains. This approach led us to the BCG cosmid 49 as the one containing the postulated pps genes. The sequence of cosmid 49 that we had generated helped us to recognize thepps gene cluster when M. tuberculosis andM. leprae genomic sequences became available as part of the mycobacterial genome project.Allelic exchange or gene knockout by homologous recombination is an efficient tool for generating defined mutants to study gene function(s). Gene knockout proved difficult in slow-growing mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis and M. bovisBCG (31McFadden J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). So far, only three reports on gene disruption by allelic exchange in this group of mycobacteria are available (24Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations in KvLQT1 are associated with a long QT syndrome that causes syncope and sudden death and also with deafness. Here, we show a new mode of association between ion channel forming subunits in that the cytoplasmic C-terminal end of MinK interacts directly with the pore region of KvLQT1. This interaction reduces KvLQT1 channel conductance from 7.6 to 0.58 picosiemens. However, because MinK also reveals a large number of previously silent KvLQT1 channels (× 60), the overall effect is a large increase (× 4) in the macroscopic K+ current. Conformational changes associated with the KvLQT1/MinK association create very slow and complex activation kinetics without much alteration in the deactivation process. Changes induced by MinK have an essential regulatory role in the development of this K+ channel activity upon repetitive electrical stimulation with a particular interest in tachycardia. The very slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel IKs is essential for controlling the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials and K+ homeostasis in the inner ear. The IKschannel is formed via the assembly of two transmembrane proteins, KvLQT1 and MinK.

Delayed K+ rectifier channels initiate the repolarization that terminates the plateau phase of the action potential. The delayed rectifier K+ current is the addition of two components, a rapidly activating one, which is called IKr, and a very slowly activating current called IKs (1Sanguinetti M.C. Jurkiewicz N.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Cardiac arrhythmias, based on abnormal repolarization, are visualized as a prolonged QT interval on an electrocardiogram. Congenital long QT (LQT) 1The abbreviations used are: LQT, long QT; aa, amino acid(s); pS, picosiemens; RP, resting potential. 1The abbreviations used are: LQT, long QT; aa, amino acid(s); pS, picosiemens; RP, resting potential. is an inherited disease characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization that causes syncope and sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia (2Wang Q. Curran M.E. Splawski I. Burn T.C. Millholland J.M. VanRaay T.J. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. De Jager T. Schwartz P.J. Toubin J.A. Moss A.J. Atkinson D.L. Landes G.M. Connors T.D. Keating M.T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). The LQT syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with at least four chromosomal loci (LQT1 to LQT4) implicated in the disease. One of them, the LQT2 locus, corresponds to mutations in the HERG gene that encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel generating IKr. Another one, the LQT1 locus, encodes a K+ channel protein, KvLQT1, that associates with another small transmembrane protein known as MinK, to generate the slowly activating K+ channel IKs (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 4Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zhou A. Shen J., P.S. Spector D.L.A. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Expression of IKs is not limited to the heart. KvLQT1 as well as MinK are also expressed in many other organs such as kidney and the stria vascularis of the inner ear (5Marcus D.C. Shen Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: C857-C864Crossref Google Scholar). Some human mutations of the KVLQT1 gene lead to the Jervell-Lange-Nielsen syndrome (6Neyroud N. Denjoy I. Leibovici M. Donger C. Barhanin J. Fauré S. Gary F. Coumel P. Petit C. Schwartz K. Guicheney P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Patients suffering from this syndrome not only exhibit a long QT wave interval but also profound deafness from birth. On the other hand, mice carrying a null mutation on the MinK gene also display profound inner ear dysfunction associated with drastically altered K+secretion into the endolymph of the inner ear leading to hair cell degeneration (7Vetter D.E. Mann J.R. Wangemann P. Liu J. McLaughlin K.J. Lesage F. Marcus D.C. Lazdunski M. Heinemann S.F. Barhanin J.

Thus, the KvLQT1/MinK assembly forms a K+channel that has a key electrogenic role in ventricular repolarization and a key secretory role in the control of endolymph homeostasis associated with normal hearing. KvLQT1 has the classical structure of a K+ channel protein with six transmembrane regions and one pore structure that is known to confer K+ permeability (8Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. Mackinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), whereas MinK is a small protein (129 amino acids in the mouse) with a single transmembrane domain (9Takumi T.

Nature. 1993; 365: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This paper shows that MinK has unique properties of interaction with KvLQT1. This peculiar mode of interaction confers functional properties to the IKs channel that probably have very important physiopathological implications Transfection of COS cells has been previously described (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The whole cell, cell-attached, and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique were used (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). The external solution at pH 7.4 contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/NaOH. Pipette solutions contained either the external medium (cell-attached) or an internal solution at pH 7.3 with (in mm): 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/KOH, 2 EGTA. The mean current-variance analysis on COS cells expressing KvLQT1/MinK channels was performed using the Biopatch software (Bio-Logic, Grenoble, France). Currents were sampled at 1 kHz and low pass filtered at 150 Hz. Methods of cRNA injection in Xenopus oocytes and electrophysiological recordings have been described (10Honoré E. Attali B. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Ricard P. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2805-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The fragments encompassing part of the N-terminal domain of human MinK (MinKN, aa 11–38) and the entire MinK C terminus (MinKC, aa 67–129) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the Vent DNA polymerase (Biolabs) and subcloned in fusion with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of the yeast vector pAS2 (CLONTECH) into theSmaI/PstI and BamHI/PstI cloning sites, respectively. The domains of KvLQT1 spanning the entire N terminus (KvLQT1N, aa 1–64), the pore (KvLQT1P, aa 218–259) and the entire C terminus (KvLQT1C, aa 290–604) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in fusion with the GAL4 activation domain of the yeast vector pGAD 424 (CLONTECH) into theEcoRI/BamHI cloning sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The two types of hybrid plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain CG-1945 using the lithium acetate method, and transformants were grown on synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His in the presence of 5 mm 3-aminotriazole to inhibit basal levels of HIS3 expression. Primary HIS+transformants were then tested for β-galactosidase reporter gene activity using both a filter and a liquid assay. The β-galactosidase units were calculated according to the CLONTECHprotocol. The pore of KvLQT1 and the corresponding N and C termini did not exhibit any β-galactosidase activity when cotransformed with the pAS2 vector alone, with pVA3 a plasmid encoding the murine p53, or with pLAM5′ a vector encoding the human lamin C (not shown). A series of glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins corresponding to C and N termini of MinK, MinKC (aa 67–129), and MinKN (aa 11–38) and to three different domains of KvLQT1, including the pore, the C and N termini, KvLQTP (aa 218–259), KvLQTC (aa 290–604), and KvLQTN (aa 1–64) were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Sf9-infected cells were homogenized and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) and centrifuged at 21,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The solubilized extracts (20 μg) were incubated in lysis buffer for 90 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of purified fusion protein previously bound to 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were washed three times (1 ml each wash) with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blotting. Immunodetection of MinK and Kv1.5 was carried out using rabbit polyclonal anti-MinK and anti-Kv1.5 antibodies, whereas that of Kv2.2 was performed by using monoclonal anti-FlagM2 antibodies. Kinetic schemes of Fig. 4 were simulated using “Mathematica” Software (Wolfram Research). Although the activation kinetics and level of K+channel expression of KvLQT1 and KvLQT1/MinK are very different, the deactivation kinetics are comparable with both τdeact ∼500 ms at −50 mV (Fig. 1, A–C). The open state accumulation that provokes the increasing successive K+current responses upon repetitive stimulations cannot be obtained with KvLQT1 alone but necessitates the presence of MinK in the channel complex (Fig. 1, D–E). With a stimulation duration in the range of the cardiac action potential (300 ms), a 100% enhancement of the outward current elicited by consecutive depolarizing pulses is observed when the stimulation rate is 120 stimulations/min (Fig.1 F), whereas this cumulative effect is totally absent at 40 stimulations/min. The frequency-cumulative current increase relationship (Fig. 1 G) is centered on the value of 80 stimulations/min, a value close to the human heart beat frequency. Thus, MinK association with KvLQT1 potentially explains the role of the channel in the rate-dependent shortening of normal cardiac action potentials preventing the myocardium from premature excitation (13Hauswirth O. Noble D. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. 1972; 222: 27-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Jurkiewicz N.K. Sanguinetti M.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 75-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dysfunction of IKs in patients with inherited LQT syndrome linked to the LQT1 locus will decrease or suppress this large K+ current, which develops at high stimulation frequencies i.e. with tachycardia. It can be predicted that hearts from these patients would be unable to protect themselves against arrhythmias when sympathetic activity increases with emotional and/or physical stress that precipitates life-threatening events. It makes sense that the most efficient pharmacological strategy in these patients is to prevent tachycardia with β-blockers (15Roden D.M. Lazzara R. Rosen M. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J. Vincent G.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1996-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). At the unitary channel level, the effects of the association MinK-KvLQT1 are also spectacular. COS cells transfected with KvLQT1 only express a small number of channels (1 or 2) in each active patch (n = 10) with a single channel conductance 7.6 ± 0.7 pS (Fig. 2, A–C). Single channel currents cannot be easily detected in most patches (n = 40) from COS cells expressing KvLQT1/MinK. In these patches, the recorded current mimics the global current (Fig. 2 D,a). Therefore, variance analysis was used to estimate both the number of active channels and the value of the unitary current. Fig. 2 D (b) illustrates this method applied to an outside-out patch. Patches typically contained 50–100 channels with a unitary conductance of 0.58 ± 0.14 pS (n = 25) (Fig. 2, D and E). Because the variance-mean current analysis hypothesizes that current fluctuations are directly related to channels flickering between closed and open states, it is not surprising that the parabola fits indicate the existence of numerous channels of small conductance. Furthermore, Fig. 2(E and F) provide convergent results in favor of the validity of the parabola fits: (i) the single channel current-voltage curve intersects the voltage axis at the K+equilibrium potential (≈ −80 mV) (Fig. 2 E), and the calculated number of channels is near constant for the same patch. (ii) A single channel analysis has also been carried out, in rare patches displaying “visible” single channel activities. Elementary conductances and number of channels calculated by the two methods,i.e. variance analysis and amplitude histograms, have given similar results (0.6 pS, two channels). In the Xenopusoocyte, noise analysis on KvLQT1/MinK containing macropatch yields the same unitary conductance (0.52 ± 0.2 pS, n = 20) with a mean number of active channels of about 1000 (not shown). These results are in agreement with those obtained from cardiac patches, suggesting that IKs is due to the activity of a high density very small K+ conductance channel (16Tohse N. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H1200-H1207PubMed Google Scholar, 17Walsh K.B. Arena J.P. Kwok W. Freeman L. Kass R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1390-H1393PubMed Google Scholar). The large increase in K+ current following association of MinK with KvLQT1 results from the melange of two factors: a large reduction in the unitary channel conductance overcompensated by a larger increase in the number of functional channels. The 4-fold increase of the current density in COS cells expressing KvLQT1/MinK (43.1 ± 4 pA/pF, n = 31 at +30 mV) as compared with cells expressing KvLQT1 alone (10.2 ± 1.3 pA/pF,n = 29) reflects a 60-fold increase of the number of functional K+ channels. Most KvLQT1 channels are “nonfunctional” or in a “silent” state with a low probability of opening. The association of MinK converts them into small conductance channels but with a high open state probability. A series of experiments (Fig. 3) demonstrates the interaction of the MinK C-terminal domain, known to be an essential element for the KvLQT1/MinK expression (3Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 11Attali B. Guillemare E. Lesage F. Honoré E. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Nature. 1993; 365: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with structural elements within or close to the KvLQT1 pore. First, the yeast two-hybrid assay shows that the MinK C terminus interacts strongly with the pore of KvLQT1 (Fig. 3 A). It does not interact significantly with either the entire N terminus or the entire C terminus of the KvLQT1 channel protein. The N terminus of MinK fails to interact with any hydrophilic domain (N-terminal, C-terminal, or pore) of KvLQT1 (not shown). Second, affinity chromatography of MinK to the various domains of the KvLQT1 protein was performed. The whole MinK protein was produced in Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (18Lesage F. Attali B. Lakey J. Honoré E. Romey G. Faurobert E. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Detergent cell extracts were incubated with the different domains of KvLQT1 produced as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins in E. coli and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The retained proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted using polyclonal anti-MinK antibodies (18Lesage F. Attali B. Lakey J. Honoré E. Romey G. Faurobert E. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Recept. Channels. 1993; 1: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the results show that only the pore region of KvLQT1 specifically associates with MinK (Fig. 3 B). The two-hybrid and the affinity chromatography assays have been used in several studies designed to map domains mediating protein-protein interactions in K+ channels (19Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,20Yu W.F. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, interactions involving other domains of MinK or KvLQT1 may exist that have not been identified in the present study. Both electrophysiological and biochemical data have been used to propose a minimal model that could help explain how the KvLQT1/MinK association leads to drastic changes in properties of the KvLQT1 channel such as activation kinetics and unitary conductance while preserving K+ selectivity and deactivation kinetics (Fig.4). MinK first binds to the outer shell of the KvLQT1 channel, probably via its transmembrane domain. This step provides a closer positioning of the C-terminal domain of MinK to the pore of KvLQT1. Once the KvLQT1 channel reaches the open conformation (O), the C-terminal domain of MinK enters and binds to the pore (OM k). This leads to a total occlusion that is later transformed into a partial occlusion resulting in a narrower pore (OM k*) that creates an additional barrier to K+ mobility and drastically reduces the unitary conductance. The total pore occlusion produced by MinK before relaxation to a partial occlusion is supported by the fact that the normal 7.6 pS KvLQT1 conductance was never recorded with the KvLQT1/MinK channel before observing the small conductance behavior. The slow kinetics of activation reflect the conformational change (OM k →OM k*) leading to the partial opening of the pore. The difficulty for the channel to close when occupied by the C-terminal end of MinK, the “foot-in-the-door” process (21Yeh J.Z. Armstrong C.M. Nature. 1978; 273: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), leads to the accumulation of open channels (OM k*) and to an increase in the number of functional channels. Actually, long open times (>1 s) are observed in the few patches with detectable unitary currents (Fig.2 F, a). Assigning an arbitrary value of 1 to the rate constant of the transition between the closed states C0 and C1, one can then set all the other rate constants (Fig. 4) for a quantitative treatment of the model. A computer simulation provides a satisfactory fit of the key current properties of KvLQT1/MinK,i.e. the slow activation kinetics, the higher level of K+ channel expression, the unchanged rates of deactivation and the frequency-dependent accumulation as in Fig.1 E. An extension of the model is presented in Fig.4 E in which a tetramer of KvLQT1 can bind from 1 to 4 MinK subunits depending on the concentration of MinK in the membrane. This model explains (i) the complex kinetic behavior of the slow KvLQT1/MinK channel after a long-lasting depolarization (compare Fig. 4,G and H) and (ii) previous results demonstrating that the kinetics of activation of the slow K+ channel formed in the Xenopus oocyte depends on the levels of the MinK protein present in the membrane (22Blumenthal E.M. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cui J. Kline R.P. Pennefather P. Cohen I.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, MinK appears to be a regulatory protein that finely tunes the KvLQT1 channel activity in a concentration-dependent manner. This property is supported by results shown in Fig. 5. The rapidly activating KvLQT1 currents can be first expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with KvLQT1 cRNA alone and then converted into slowly activating ones following expression of MinK 24 h later. This modification of pre-existing channels by the association of the non-pore-forming MinK subunit clearly contrasts with the situation described for classical K+ channel β-subunits (24Pongs O. Semin. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 137-146Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) where the association with a subunits only occurs during the translation process in the endoplasmic reticulum (25Shi G.

The effect of a change in the MinK concentration on KvLQT1/MinK kinetics is of a particular physiological interest because the level of expression of MinK is known to be altered during development (10Honoré E.

https://openalex.org/W2066716403,"Progesterone is an important regulator of normal and malignant breast epithelial cells. In addition to stimulating development of normal mammary epithelium, it can be used to treat hormone-dependent breast tumors. However, the mechanism of growth inhibition by progestins is poorly understood, and only a limited number of progesterone target genes are known so far. We therefore decided to clone such target genes by means of differential display polymerase chain reaction. In this paper, we describe an improved differential display strategy that eliminates false positives, along with the identification of nine positive (TSC-22, CD-9, Na+/K+-ATPase α1, desmoplakin, CD-59, FKBP51, and three unknown genes) and one negative progesterone target genes (annexin-VI) from the mammary carcinoma cell line T47D, which is growth-inhibited by progestins. None of these genes have been reported before to be progesterone targets. Regulation of desmoplakin, CD-9, CD-59, Na+/K+-ATPase α1, and annexin-VI by the progestin suggests that progesterone induces T47D cells to differentiate. Three of these genes were repressed by estradiol and up-regulated by the progestin. Estradiol treatment of T47D cells also leads to formation of lamellipodia and delocalization of two cell adhesion proteins, E-cadherin and α-catenin. All these effects were reversed by the progestin. These data suggest that estradiol dedifferentiates T47D cells, while progestins have the opposite effect. This may be linked to the capacity of progestins to inhibit tumor growth.

The steroid hormone progesterone has important and complex effects in female sex organs. In two of its major target organs, the uterus and the mammary gland, it strongly influences proliferation and differentiation. In mouse mammary epithelium, progesterone stimulates proliferation, which eventually culminates in glandular development. In the endometrial epithelium, progesterone inhibits estrogen-mediated growth but also induces differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 1Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).

Progestins also have strong effects on human hormone-responsive endometrial and breast cancers. Both in endometrial and mammary carcinomas progestins inhibit estrogen-mediated growth, which is, for endometrial carcinoma, associated with increased differentiation. Progestins are therefore used to treat these cancers (reviewed in Ref.1Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The breast tumor-derived cell line T47D exhibits in vitro a similar inhibition of estrogen- or growth factor-mediated growth by progestins, although initially a brief growth stimulation is seen upon progesterone addition (3Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism responsible for this biphasic response is not known (reviewed in Ref. 1Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The influence of progestins on processes essential in tumor progression, like tumor invasion and metastasis, is poorly understood. For endometrial tumor cells, both in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that estrogens stimulate invasion, while progestins inhibit this process (4Fujimoto J. Hori M. Ichigo S. Morishita S. Tamaya T.

Progestins bind inside the cell to the PR, which belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 8Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). This receptor subsequently homodimerizes and activates gene transcription after binding to progesterone response elements (PRE) in promoters (reviewed in Ref. 9Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev.

PREs have the same consensus sequence as response elements for the related glucocorticoid, androgen, and mineralocorticoid receptors. PR cannot only activate, but also repress genes, for example by negative cross-talk with transcription factors of the AP1 and NF-κB families (10Shemshidini L. Knauthe R. Sassone-Corsi P. Pornon A.

To better understand progesterone effects in human breast epithelial cells, we wanted to identify a larger number of progesterone target genes, as only a limited number of established target genes for this hormone in breast tumor cells is known. Negative target genes are the estrogen receptor (ER) (12Read L.D. Greene G.L. Katzenellebogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and PR itself (13Read L.D. Snider C.E. Miller J.S. Greene G.L. Katzenellebogen B.S. Mol.

Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient induction of c-fos and c-myc has been reported and might be involved in the initial growth stimulatory effect (3Musgrove E.A. Lee C.S.L. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5032-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of none of these genes can explain the observed growth inhibition by prolonged progestin treatment of these cells. Therefore, we decided to try to identify additional progesterone target genes in this system. Recently, a new technique for cloning differentially regulated genes has been published, designated as differential display or RNA fingerprinting (18Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar, 19Welsh J. Chada K. Dalal S.S. Cheng R. Ralph D. McClelland M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4965-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). This technique has substantial advantages over earlier techniques, e.g. subtractive libraries or hybridization, since it does not have such a strong bias toward highly abundant genes and is much more versatile, enabling cloning of down-regulated as well as up-regulated genes and allowing a rapid comparison between multiple samples. For identifying progesterone target genes we used a differential display technique as modified by Van Belzen et al. 2Van Belzen, N., Diesveld, M. P. G., Groen, N. A., Van der Made, A. C. J., Nozawa, Y., Vlietstra, R., Dinjens, W. N. M., Trapman, J., and Bosman, F. T. (1997) Lab. Invest., in press. adding a number of improvements. In this paper we present, apart from 10 new progesterone target genes, a fast procedure to identify the most promising genes. Some of the genes identified suggest that the T47D breast tumor cell line differentiates upon progestin treatment. Three of these were repressed by E2 treatment and subsequently up-regulated by the progestin. By means of immunofluorescence detecting three markers for epithelial differentiation, we could also show that E2 addition resulted in delocalization of the marker proteins, while additional progestin treatment reversed this effect. From this we conclude that E2 dedifferentiates the T47D cells, while progestins increase the differentiation state of estrogen-treated T47D cells. A phenol red-free 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (DF) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Trypsin and the EDTA used for cell culture were bought from Flow Laboratories (Irvine, Scotland). Fetal calf serum (FCS) was purchased from Integro (Linz, Austria), E2, cycloheximide, dexamethasone, bFGF, human transferrin, and bovine were from Sigma. Org2058 was kindly provided by Organon (Oss, The Netherlands). Human TGFβ1 was kindly provided by Dr. A. J. M. van den Eijnden-van Raaij. DCC-FCS was prepared by treating FCS with DCC to remove steroids, as described (20Van der Burg B. Rutteman G.R. Blankestein M.A. De Laat S.W. Van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 123: 101-108Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). T47D cells were a kind gift of Dr. R. L. Sutherland (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia). Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 106 cells/175-cm2 dish or 1.5 × 106/60 cm2 dish in DF medium containing 5% (v/v) DCC-FCS, 30 nm selenite, 10 μg/ml transferrin, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine and allowed to attach for 24 h. Medium was refreshed, and hormones were added as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using the guanidine isothiocyanate method according to Ref. 21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162 (Second Ed.): 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with PolyATtract® beads (Promega, Madison WI). The differential display was performed according to Van Belzen et al. 2 with some modifications. RNA was isolated from cells that were treated with 10−9m E2 (48 h before harvesting) and 10−8m Org2058 or vehicle (24 h before harvesting). 20 μg of total RNA was digested with RNase-free RQ1 DNase according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega), then phenol-extracted and precipitated (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 1 μg was used for cDNA synthesis with the Superscript kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) together with 100 ng of T12–18 primer. The cDNA was purified with Qiaquick spin columns according to the manufacturer's conditions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted with 100 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The differential display PCR was performed with 2 μl of cDNA, 200 ng of primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 × Goldstar reaction buffer, 2 μm dNTPs, 1 μCi of [33P]dATP and 4 units of Goldstar Taq polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) per reaction of 20 μl. The primers used were on average 20 bases long, with 50% GC content. Primers already available from other experiments were used after checking whether they gave a clear differential display pattern under the conditions used (sequences of primers available upon request). Cycles were performed as follows: 3 min, 96 °C; 2 × (1 min, 96 °C; 5 min, 37 °C; 5 min, 37–72 °C, 5 min, 72 °C); 30 × (1 min, 96 °C; 2 min, 55 °C; 5 min, 72 °C); 10 min, 72 °C; soak at 4 °C. 5 μl of the PCR was mixed with an equal volume of 96% formamide loading buffer, boiled for 2 min, and 6 μl was electrophoresed on a Sequagel XR (Biozym, Landgraaf, The Netherlands) sequencing gel until the xylene cyanol marker was at the bottom. After immobilizing the gel on Whatman No. 3MM paper and drying for 30–60 min under vacuum at 80 °C, the gel was exposed against Biomax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Positive bands were excised and immersed in 100 μl of TE. The DNA was eluted by freezing the vial twice in liquid N2, thawing at 70 °C, and vortexing. DNA was purified by Qiaquick spin columns, and 5–10 μl was amplified using standard PCR conditions and the primer used for the display (annealing temperature: 55 °C). The mixture was loaded on an agarose gel, bands were excised, purified with glassmax (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cloned in pGEM-T (Promega). If necessary, the PCR was repeated. DNA was isolated from 6 to 8 colonies per excised band using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide miniprep procedure (23Del Sal G. Manfioletti G. Schneider C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). DNA was cut with PstI-ApaI, RsaI, andTaqI and analyzed on agarose gel. Clones with different restriction patterns were sequenced and reamplified from the plasmid by standard PCR with the primers used in the differential display. The PCR mix was dot-blotted in duplicate on two Hybond C extra filters (Amersham Corp., Little Chalfont, United Kingdom; Ref. 24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1995Google Scholar). Clones identified with the same primer were spotted on the same two filters. With this primer, two differential display PCRs were carried out with RNA from progesterone treated and untreated cells. These reactions were performed with 5 μCi of [32P]dCTP instead of 1 μCi of [33P]dATP, precipitated with ammonium acetate and ethanol, and then used as a probe on the two filters. Filters were hybridized and washed as described (25Van der Leede B.M. Van den Brink C.E. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) in 2-ml Eppendorf reaction vials. A schematic outline of the strategy is depicted in Fig. 1.Figure 1Dot blot assay to identify most prominent clones. A, outline of the strategy used to identify the most prominent clones. Two identical Dot blots of the isolated clones are prepared, of which one is probed with the differential display product of +progestin RNA and the other with the differential display product of −progestin RNA. B, examples of Dot blot analysis of the clones Ptg-1, Ptg-2, and Ptg-8. Dot blots were hybridized with differential display product from RNA treated with Org2058 or vehicle for 24 h. All clones are spotted in duplicate on the same filter next to each other. The other dots that are spotted on the same filter as the Ptg clones originate from false positive or weakly regulated clones, amplified with the same primer as the Ptg clone. Fold induction was corrected for input. Ptg clones are indicated byarrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blotting was carried out as described (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The inserts were cut from pGEM-T withApaI-PstI or SstII-PstI, run on agarose gel, and purified. Labeling was performed with the Rediprime random primer labeling kit and 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP (Amersham), hybridization, and washing was as described (25Van der Leede B.M. Van den Brink C.E. Van der Saag P.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells (for 3-day incubations) or 1 × 104 cells (for 6-day incubations) per coverslip and allowed to attach for 24 h. Medium was refreshed, and hormones were added at the concentrations indicated. After 3 days, medium and hormones were refreshed. Cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and immunolabeled following standard procedures. As anti-E-cadherin antibody DECMA-1, a kind gift from Dr. R. Kemler (Freiburg, Germany) was used (1:200); anti-α-catenin was from Sigma (1:2000). As second antibody, species-specific CY-3-labeled antibodies from Jackson (West Grove, PA) were used in a dilution of 1:250. To clone PR target genes we used cDNA prepared from total RNA isolated from control T47D cells in parallel with cells treated for 24 h with Org2058 (a synthetic progestin). In both cases cells were grown in the presence of E2 for 48 h before harvest to obtain maximal PR induction (26Horwitz K.B. McGuire W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2223-2228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each primer the differential display was performed in duplicate with cDNA derived from two different batches of RNA per treatment. In total, 34 primers were used. We isolated 57 clones with different inserts, derived from 38 differentially regulated bands. Most of them represented up-regulation in the presence of the progestin. All clones were partially sequenced and compared against EMBL-44, EMBL-NEW 11, and UGenBank 91_44 data bases, while apparent open reading frames were compared against PIR 46 and Swissprot 31 using IGsuite software. Initially a number of clones was analyzed on Northern blots using total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA Northern blots. Although some clones were found to be up-regulated, several clones gave no signal on Northern blots. In addition, very frequently different clones were isolated from the same band, indicating that the DNA fragments present in the excised gel slices were impure. Therefore, we designed an assay that could potentially discriminate false positives and contaminations from genuine progesterone targets. In Fig. 1 the strategy is illustrated. Because hybridization and washing can be performed in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes, all steps permit simultaneous handling of multiple samples. This allowed us to analyze all samples in one experiment. In this assay, ten positive clones (Ptg-1 to Ptg-10, for progesterone target gene) could be easily distinguished by visual comparison and quantification (Fig.1). After verification by Northern blot analysis, all of these genes were found to be strongly up-regulated by the progestin (Fig.2 A). Ptg-1, Ptg-5, and Ptg-10 were also clearly up-regulated after 6 h by the progestin in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. This indicates that these genes are direct progesterone receptor targets, since protein synthesis is not required. To check if PR target genes had been missed with this selection procedure, 18 from the 47 remaining clones were checked on Northern blots. Five gave no signal at all, ten appeared to be false positives, and three (clones Ptg-11 to Ptg-13) were slightly regulated by the progestin (Fig. 2 B). In conclusion, with this assay we did not obtain false positives. Analysis of the remaining clones suggested that only some weakly regulated clones were missed (3 out of 13 giving a signal on Northern blots). Therefore, this method is a very effective selection procedure, particularly for strongly induced mRNAs. The ten clones identified in the Dot blot assay, Ptg-1 to Ptg-10, were derived from seven different genes: CD-9/MRP-1, a gene known to have effects on tumor metastasis and cell motility (27Shaw A.R.E.

The two clones that were not identified in the Dot blot assay but showed slight up-regulation on Northern blots, Ptg-11 and Ptg-12, were not represented among the sequences present in the EMBL and GenBank™ data bases. However, their open reading frames show homology to splicing factors of the SR protein family and a putative C2H2-type zinc finger protein from Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively (see TableI). This first open reading frame contains five copies of VTRRRSRSRTSP as a repeat. This repeat shows homology (56% amino acid identity) to the arginine-serine domain of SR proteins, although also other arginine-serine-rich proteins have high scores (like protamines and viral DNA-binding proteins). The only clone that was found to be down-regulated (Ptg-13), was annexin-VI. This gene encodes a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein possibly involved in intracellular endosomal trafficking (37Lin H.C. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W.

ND, not done, ch, cycloheximide; aa, amino acid. The expression pattern of four genes (FKBP51, Na+/K+-ATPase α1, CD-9, and desmoplakin) was further characterized (Fig. 3). Time-dependent expression in the presence of the progestin and E2 was investigated to determine whether the response was transient or sustained. All four genes were still strongly up-regulated after 48 h. Furthermore, regulation of these genes by the progestin in the additional presence of different growth stimuli (E2 and bFGF) was examined, and in the mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7, which is also strongly responsive to glucocorticoids and the growth inhibitor TGFβ. FKBP51 was strongly up-regulated by both the progestin and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone under all conditions tested, agreeing with the assumption that FKBP51 is a direct target gene. The three other genes showed more complex expression patterns. The Na+/K+-ATPase α1 was up-regulated by the progestin in T47D cells under all conditions tested (Fig.3 A); in MCF-7 cells, the gene was up-regulated by the progestin but down-regulated by dexamethasone, which is not to be expected for a direct progesterone target gene (Fig. 3 B). Also the regulation by TGFβ was complex with up-regulation in the presence of E2 and down-regulation in its absence. CD-9 was only strongly up-regulated in T47D cells by the progestin in the presence of E2 (Fig. 3 A), while in MCF-7 cells, this gene was activated constitutively (Fig. 3 B). Desmoplakin was clearly induced in T47D cells by the progestin in the absence of additional hormones or in the presence of estradiol, but not in the presence of bFGF (Fig. 3 A). In MCF-7 cells, this gene was only slightly up-regulated by the progestin, dexamethasone, and TGF-β in the presence of estradiol (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, we noted that Na+/K+-ATPase α1, CD-9, and desmoplakin were all down-regulated in T47D cells by E2, while the progestin clearly reversed this effect (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, five of the genes identified suggested that the T47D cells differentiate upon progestin treatment. These are: desmoplakin, which is a marker for epithelial differentiation and is expressed higher in well differentiated mammary carcinoma cell lines (39Sommers C.L. Byers S.W. Thompson E.W.

A mechanism by which Bcl-2 exerts an anti-cell death effect is, however, not fully understood. In the present study, Bcl-2 suppressed cell death of N18TG neuroglioma cells caused by various apoptotic stresses, including etoposide, staurosporine, anisomycin, and ultraviolet irradiation. Concomitantly, Bcl-2 disrupted a signaling cascade to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation induced by the apoptotic stresses. Bcl-2 also prevented the etoposide-induced stimulation of MEKK1. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase antagonized the death-protective function of Bcl-2. These data suggest that suppression of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway may be critical for Bcl-2 action.

For example, Bcl-2 rescues cell death induced by a variety of stresses, including depletion of trophic factors, anti-tumor drugs, oxygen free radicals, viral agents, and heat shock as well as neuronal axotomy (4Dubois-Dauphin M.

Furthermore,bcl-2 is thought to be a mammalian counterpart ofced-9, which acts to prevent cell death inCaenorhabditis elegans (8Vaux D.L. Weissmann I.L. Kim S.K. Science. 1992; 258: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which Bcl-2 prevents cell death remains unknown, however. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated recently that certain apoptotic stresses can induce activation of the specific signaling systems such as sphingomyelin or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SEK, SAPK kinase; JNKK, JNK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase. pathways (9Xia Z.

These findings imply that Bcl-2 might suppress cell death through modulating intracellular signaling cascades associated with apoptosis. JNK, also termed stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), is a new member of the family of mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that mediate intracellular signals originated from diverse extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, or various stresses (11Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). JNK is often activated through upstream protein kinases, including JNKK and MEKK1 in response to a variety of cellular stresses such as ionizing irradiation, alkylating chemicals, ultraviolet (UV) light, or heat shock (12Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodjett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 13Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that many stresses that induce the stimulation of JNK can eventually cause cell death. In fact, the stimulation of JNK was prerequisite for cell death under various conditions, and a blockade of the JNK activation resulted in the prevention of cell death (9Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar, 10Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). These findings imply that JNK may mediate an intracellular signaling pathway leading to cell death. In the present study, we investigated a possible mechanism for anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2. We observed that Bcl-2 blocked the activation of the JNK signaling pathway by various apoptotic stresses and that the blockade of JNK pathway might be associated with the cell survival effect of Bcl-2. N18TG cells were routinely maintained in poly-d-lysine-coated plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with indicated expression vectors by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). For bcl-2transfection, cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3 containing a full-length coding sequence of humanbcl-2. After 48 h of transfection, cultures were maintained in the complete medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml) to select neomycin-resistant cells. For JNK1 transfection, cells were transfected with pCEP4 (Invitrogen) or pCEP4 containing JNK1 cDNA. Stable cell lines were selected by adding hygromycin (200 units/ml) in culture medium. Heterogeneous populations of the stably transfected cells were used in this study to avoid any possible clonal variations. Cultured cells were exposed to etoposide (10 μg/ml) or staurosporine (1 μg/ml) overnight or to anisomycin (50 μg/ml) for 4 h. When indicated, cells were exposed to UV light (40 Jm−2), then further incubated overnight. After treatment with the indicated agents, cells were harvested, and lysed with a solution containing 20 mm EDTA, 0.8% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cell lysates were treated with RNase A, RNase T1, and proteinase K, as described previously (14Kamesaki S. Kamesaki H. Jorgensen T.J. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y. Cossman J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4251-4256PubMed Google Scholar). Fragmented DNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Cells were exposed to 10 μg/ml etoposide for 36 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized with ice-cold ethanol, and stained with 50 ng/ml Hoechst 33258, as described previoiusly (15Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Stained nuclei were observed and photographed with a Zeiss Axiovert135 fluorescent microscope with a × 40 objective. Cells were exposed to the indicated agents, harvested, and lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Solubilized fractions were immunoprecipitated with either a mouse monoclonal anti-JNK1 (PharMingen) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-MEKK1 antibody (Santa Cruz). The immunopellets were assayed for either JNK1 or MEKK1 activity, as described previously (16Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.-J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Either GST-c-Jun or GST-SEK1 fusion protein was used as a substrate for either JNK1 or MEKK1, respectively. The assay reaction mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The phosphorylated proteins were quantified by autoradiography and densitometry. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce), as described in the manufacture's protocol. To investigate the mechanism of anti-cell death function of Bcl-2, we transfected a mammalian expression vector containingbcl-2 or control vector into neuroglioma N18TG cells. Expression of Bcl-2 protein was detected in Bcl-2-transfected cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 1 A). Next, we examined the effect of etoposide on cell death in either control or Bcl-2-expressing cells. Etoposide is an anti-cancer drug that inhibits topoisomerase II (17Champlin R. Gale R.P. Blood. 1987; 69: 1551-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 inbcl-2-transfected cells resulted in suppression of etoposide-induced cell death, compared with control cells (Fig.1 B). We also found that etoposide induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in N18 control cells and that Bcl-2 prevented the etoposide-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C). Bcl-2 also exerts a death-protective effect in cells subjected to other apoptosis-inducing stresses, including staurosporine, ultraviolet (UV) light, or anisomycin. 2J. Park and E.-J. Choi, unpublished observations. The signaling mechanism for the anti-apoptotic action of Bcl-2 remains unclear. The mammalian MAP kinases, which include JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 kinase, are parts of signal transduction cascades leading to a variety of cellular events (11Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In particular, JNK has been shown to mediate intracellular signals leading to apoptosis (9Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar, 10Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 18Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr CM. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). All of the apoptotic stresses used in this study, which included etoposide, staurosporine, UV light, and anisomycin, could induce the stimulation of the JNK signaling pathway in N18 control cells (Fig. 2 A). Using these apoptotic stresses, we investigated a possibility that Bcl-2 might modulate the JNK signaling cascade. In Bcl-2-expressing cells, etoposide had little effect, if at all, on JNK1 activity (Fig.2 A). Bcl-2 also suppressed the stimulation of JNK1 activities induced by staurosporine, UV light, and anisomycin (Fig.2 A). Immunoblot analysis indicated that the cellular level of JNK1 protein was not changed by Bcl-2 expression (Fig.2 B). mRNA levels of endogenous JNK1 between control cells and Bcl-2-expressing cells were also equivalent.2These data suggest that Bcl-2 might disrupt the signaling cascade to JNK1 stimulation initiated by cellular stresses. The JNK signaling cascade includes MEKK1, SEK/JNKK, and JNK (11Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). MEKK1 activates SEK/JNKK that, in turn, activates JNK1 (19Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of Bcl-2 on the stress-induced stimulation of MEKK1. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Bcl-2 suppressed the etoposide-induced activation of MEKK. Taken together, these data indicate that the intracellular signaling machinery for the JNK stimulation is defective in Bcl-2-expressing cells, suggesting that the JNK signaling pathway may be downstream from the target(s) of Bcl-2 action. If the suppression of JNK1 stimulation is a critical step for the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, overexpression of JNK1 could antagonize the action of Bcl-2. To test this possibility, we overexpressed JNK1 in Bcl-2-expressing cells by a stable transfection and named those cells N18-Bcl-2/JNK1. Treatment of N18-Bcl-2/JNK1 cells with various apoptotic stresses resulted in stimulation of JNK1 activity (Fig. 3). This indicates that N18-Bcl-2/JNK1 cells, by overexpressing JNK1 protein, overcame the negative action of Bcl-2 on the JNK signaling pathway. Next, we measured the viability of N18 control, N18-JNK1, N18-Bcl-2, or N18-Bcl-2/JNK1 cells exposed to etoposide, staurosporine, anisomycin, or UV light (Fig.4 A). N18-Bcl-2 cells, which expressed the Bcl-2 protein, were more resistant to the apoptotic stresses used in the study, compared with the other cells. However, N18-Bcl-2/JNK1 cells, which expressed both recombinant Bcl-2 and JNK1 proteins, were as sensitive as control N18 cells to cell death induced by the apoptotic stresses. These data demonstrated that overexpression of JNK1 in Bcl-2-expressing cells counteracted the anti-cell death function of Bcl-2. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Bcl-2 also prevented DNA fragmentation in cells treated with the apoptotic stresses, and this effect of Bcl-2 was negated by the overexpression of JNK1, resulting in the induction of DNA fragmentation by apoptotic stimuli in N18-Bcl-2/JNK1 cells. We also examined morphological changes of apoptotic nuclei with Hoechst 33258 stain after cells were exposed to 10 mm etoposide (Fig. 4, C–F). Treatment of N18 cells with etoposide caused nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4 D), and the etoposide-induced nuclear breakdown was prevented by Bcl-2 (Fig. 4 E). Overexpression of JNK1, however, counteracted the protective effect of Bcl-2 on the etoposide-induced nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4 F). These data strongly suggest that sustained activation of JNK1 may override the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2, leading to cell death.Figure 2Bcl-2 suppresses the JNK1 stimulation induced by cytotoxic stresses. A, either N18 control cells (control) or Bcl-2-expressing cells (Bcl-2) were exposed to etoposide (10 μg/ml), staurosporine (1 μg/ml), or anisomycin (50 μg/ml) for 1 h or to UV irradiation (40 Jm−2). Cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with mouse anti-JNK1 monoclonal antibody. The immunocomplex JNK1 was assayed by phosphorylating a substrate, GST-c-Jun. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). Furthermore, JNK is thought to mediate an intracellular signal for stress-activated apoptosis (9Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar, 10Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I.

The mechanism by which Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis is, however, still unclear, even though Bcl-2 has been proposed to function as an anti-oxidant or free-radical scavenger, or to modulate calcium efflux through the endoplasmic reticulum in some experimental models (21Hockenbery D.M.

Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). We report here that various stresses which induce the stimulation of JNK activity can cause cell death and that Bcl-2 prevents both cell death and JNK stimulation induced by those stresses. Moreover, overexpression of JNK1 counteracted the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2 in response to the apoptotic stresses. Interestingly, a recent study with PC12 cells also reported that JNK activation induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal was blocked by Bcl-2 (24Park D.S. Stefanis L. Yan C.Y.I. Farinelli S.E. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21898-21905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although a detailed mechanism by which Bcl-2 blocks JNK activation is not clear yet, we found that Bcl-2 disrupted the stimulation of MEKK1, an upstream protein kinase in JNK signaling pathway (19Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). It suggests that Bcl-2 might act on its cellular target(s) that might be involved in the stimulation of MEKK, which can activate the JNK pathway. A precise mechanism by which overexpression of JNK1 overcomes the antagonistic effect of Bcl-2 on the stress-induced stimulation of endogenous JNK1 is not clear yet. One possibility could be that it might result from a dose effect of the overexpressed JNK1 protein. That is, JNK1 activity could be enhanced to a significant level in JNK1-overexpressing cells in response to apoptotic stresses, if Bcl-2 could not completely block the MEKK/JNK1 signaling pathway. Another possibility could be that there might exist alternative pathways for stress-induced stimulation of JNK1. In this regard, it is noteworthy that JNK1 signaling pathway can be also regulated through other MAPKKKs such as ASK1 (25Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar), independent of MEKK1. In any event, our findings in this study strongly suggest that the JNK signaling pathway may be downstream from the target(s) of Bcl-2 action. Notably, overexpression of Bcl-XL, a functional analog of Bcl-2 (26Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar), in N18TG cells also resulted in the suppression of the JNK stimulation after treatment of cells with etoposide or the other stresses used in this study.2 Therefore, it appears that suppression of the JNK pathway may be crucial for the anti-cell death function of both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Our findings presented in this study provide new insights into the mechanism by which Bcl-2 and its related proteins regulate cell death and survival. We thank Drs. R. J. Davis, J. Woodgett, M.

Vertebrate epithelial organs are covered, throughout the body, with a mucus lining, which serves as a selective physical barrier between the extracellular milieu and the epithelial surface. The mucus lining, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, is highly resistant to various digestive enzymes and provides protection and lubrication for the underlying cells (2Allen A. Flemstrom G. Garner A. Kivilaakso E. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 823-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 3Forstner J.F. Forstner G.G. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2. Raven Press, New York1994: 1255-1283Google Scholar). The function of mucus is reliant on one major component, mucins, which are highly O-glycosylated proteins. Carbohydrate moieties on mucins commonly account for more than 50% of the protein by weight. The biochemistry and molecular biology of mucins from vertebrates has been broadly studied, with human epithelial mucins being the most extensively studied (for reviews, see Refs. 4Strous G.J.

Studies on invertebrate mucins are very limited in comparison with vertebrate mucins. Drosophila glue proteins from salivary glands (15Garfinkel M.D. Pruitt R.E. Meyerowitz E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 765-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have structural characteristics of mucin-like proteins, although these mucin characteristics have not been studied. Mucin-like proteins have also been reported in protozoans (16Murray P.J. Spithill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24477-24484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Di Noia J.M. Sanchez D.O.

A secretory mucin involved in squid egg mass formation was identified from the nidamental gland (18Kimura S. Sugiura Y. Mizuno H. Kato N. Hanaoka Y. Fish. Sci.

A glycoprotein from Drosophila melanogaster cultured cells, was reported to be a mucin-like protein (20Kramerov A.A. Arbatsky N.P. Rozovsky Y.M. Mikhaleva E.A. Polesskaya O.O. Gvozdev V.A.

Recently, a membrane-associated mucin from the hemocytes of D. melanogaster was identified, and a cDNA for the mucin was subsequently cloned (21Theopold U. Samakovlis C. Erdjument-Bromage H.

There were no reports, however, on mucins identified from invertebrate digestive tracts until the insect intestinal mucin (IIM) 1The abbreviations used are: IIM, insect intestinal mucin; PM, peritrophic membrane; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. was identified from the midgut of Trichoplusia ni larvae.2 Insects do not possess a mucus layer lining the digestive tract and/or other epithelial cells, as is the case with vertebrates. The digestive tract in insects is commonly lined with an invertebrate-unique structure, the peritrophic membrane (PM). PMs are noncellular matrices of chitin and proteins that are suggested to have similar functions to the mucus layer in vertebrates (i.e. a selective barrier protecting the digestive tract from physical damages and microbial infections) (22Spence K.D. Binnington K. Retnakaran A. Physiology of the Insect Epidermis. CSIRO Publications, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia1991: 77-93Google Scholar, 23Peters W. Zoophysiology.30. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, New York1992Google Scholar). The two major constituents of PMs, chitin and IIM, play very important roles in the protection of insects from microbial infections (24Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).2 Biochemical analysis of IIM by Wang and Granados 2Wang, P., and Granados, R. R. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. revealed properties similar to secreted epithelial mucins from vertebrates. Identification of this first insect intestinal mucin has provided a basis for the study of the novel strategy adopted by viruses to overcome the insect host's defensive mechanism by encoding a mucin-degrading enzyme.2 Knowledge of the structure of IIM is necessary for the comparative analysis of invertebrate and vertebrate intestinal mucins, the structure and function of mucins, and the mechanism of mucin-pathogen interaction. In this study, we have cloned and sequenced full-length cDNAs for IIM from T. ni, enabling further characterization of IIM. We report that IIM has a similar structural organization to human intestinal mucin, MUC2, and is expressed in midgut tissue. Sequence analysis indicates potential chitin binding domains that may interact with the chitin present within the PM. Midgut PMs were dissected from mid-fifth instar T. ni larvae and stored at −70 °C before use. IIM was isolated by preparative SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) as described by Wang and Granados,2 and a phosphate-buffered SDS-PAGE system (26Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to prepare IIM for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. IIM was recovered from excised gel slices by electroelution, and the eluted IIM solution was desalted and concentrated as described previously.2 N-terminal amino acid sequencing of IIM was performed using a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems Division 470A gas phase protein sequencer at the Analytical Chemistry and Peptide/DNA Synthesis Facility, Biotechnology Program, Cornell Center for Advanced Technology (Ithaca, NY). Midgut epithelial tissues were dissected from early to mid-fifth instarT. ni larvae in cold Rinaldini's solution (27Rinaldini L.M. J. Physiol. 1954; 123: 20P-21PPubMed Google Scholar). PMs with food contents and other attached tissues (i.e. fat bodies, trachea, and malpighian tubules) were quickly removed from the midgut epithelium. Isolated midgut epithelia were rinsed with cold Rinaldini's solution, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C prior to use. Midgut mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy total RNA isolation kit and the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The quality of mRNA was confirmed by Northern blot analysis, which showed no detectable degradation of mRNA after probing with β-tubulin DNA. A cDNA library was constructed from T. ni midgut mRNA using the ZAP-cDNA Gigapack Cloning Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was unidirectionally ligated into the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites and packaged with the Gigapack II Gold package extract. The resultant cDNA library was amplified once at 50,000 plaques/15-cm plate in XL1-Blue MRF′ E. coli host cells. Screening of the cDNA expression library for IIM cDNA clones was conducted using an IIM-specific polyclonal antiserum2 in conjunction with thepico BlueTM Immunoscreening Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The first round of screening was performed at a high density (i.e.50,000 plaques/15-cm plate). Positive plaques were selected and further purified by screening at a low plating density (i.e. 20–50 plaques/10-cm plate). From purified positive phages, the pBluescript® SK(−) phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was excised in vivo following the ZAP-cDNA Gigapack cloning kit protocol. After restriction enzyme analysis of 20 purified cDNA clones, two different clones were chosen for sequencing. Nested deletions from both orientations of the cDNA inserts were constructed using the Erase-a-Base System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Both strands of the cDNA were sequenced by automated cycle sequencing using T3 and T7 primers, complementary to the pBluescript® SK(−) sequences flanking the cDNA inserts. DNA sequence analysis and a data base search were conducted using the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) and BLAST data base search programs (28Altschul S.F. Boguski M.S. Gish W. Wootton J.C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). ProteinO-glycosylation sites were predicted following an O-GLYCBASE search (29Hansen J.E. Lund O. Nielsen J.O. Hansen J-E.S. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 35 μg of total RNA from fifth instar T. ni midgut tissue was separated on a 1% agarose gel in formaldehyde (2.2 m) and transferred onto a MagnaGraph nylon membrane (MSI, Westboro, MA). The blotting probe was made from an EcoRI/SnaBI fragment isolated from the cDNA clone pIIM22 (see Fig. 1). The probe was labeled with Digoxigenin by random primed labeling. Specific hybridization was detected using a Genius DNA labeling and detection kit (Boerhinger Mannheim). High stringency hybridization was accomplished in 5 × SSC (0.75 m NaCl, 0.075m Na3-citrate, pH 7.0), 2% blocking reagent for nucleic acid hybridization (Boerhinger Mannheim), 0.05m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1%N-lauroylsarcosine, 7% SDS, and 50% formamide at 42 °C, overnight. The blot was washed twice in 2 × SSC (0.3m NaCl, 0.03 m Na3-citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.1% SDS and once in 0.5 × SSC (0.075 m NaCl, 0.0075 m Na3-citrate, pH 7.0) with 0.1% SDS. Specific hybridization was detected using an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and visualized by colorimetric reactions with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. RNA molecular weight marker II (Boerhinger Mannheim) was used as the molecular weight standard.Figure 1Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of IIM cDNA clones.

After tissue sectioning and dewaxing, immunostaining was performed as follows: sections on glass slides were blocked for nonspecific staining with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation with antiserum against IIM in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with the first antiserum, the sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG conjugated with colloidal gold (Sigma). Following secondary antibody incubation and subsequent washing, the sections were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Immunogold staining was intensified by silver enhancement using the Silver Enhancer kit (Sigma). The immunostained sections were counterstained with hematozylin and eosin and examined by microscopy. Tissues were isolated from fifth instar T. ni larvae and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. The tissues were then homogenized and boiled in 0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Undissolved materials were removed by centrifugation. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were estimated using the Bradford protein assay (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 22: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). One microgram of protein from each tissue extract, except for the PM extract, for which 0.04 μg of protein was used, was loaded onto the gel. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by blotting onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and probed with anti-IIM antiserum, as described by Wang and Granados.2 To examine the contribution of disulfide bonds to the stability of IIM, PMs were treated with 10 mm DTT in the presence and absence of active PM endogenous proteases. Inactivation of PM endogenous proteases was performed by heating PMs in 2% SDS and subsequent washing, as described by Wang and Granados.2 After treatments with DTT, the PMs were washed in deionized water. The PMs and the spent incubation solutions were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). A cDNA expression library was constructed from T. nimidgut mRNA. The library has a complexity of 2.35 × 106 plaques, of which over 99.5% were recombinants. Screening of the library with an antiserum specific to IIM indicated that the mRNA for the IIM was abundant; 50 positive plaques were obtained from 50,000 plaques. Since only one in three plaques will be in the correct reading frame for protein expression, the frequency of IIM cDNA clones could be 1 in 333. From these 50 plaques, 20 positive plaques were further purified. From these 20 plaques, the pBluescript® SK(−) phagemids were rescued by in vivo excision. Following restriction enzyme analysis to map the selected clones, two different full-length clones, pIIM14 and pIIM22, were chosen for sequencing. The cDNAs from both pIIM14 and pIIM22 were full-length clones, encoding a protein of 788 and 807 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 1). The open reading frame in the cDNA from IIM14, was 57 base pairs shorter than in IIM22; otherwise, the open reading frames in these two clones were identical (Fig. 1). IIM22 contains a putative polyadenylation signal consensus, AATAAA, located 331 base pairs downstream of the translation stop codon, TAA, and 17 base pairs upstream of the poly(A) (Fig. 1). IIM14 contains a putative polyadenylation signal, AATTAA, located 15 base pairs upstream of the poly(A) (Fig. 1). The deduced protein sequences from IIM14 and IIM22 showed a hydrophilicity profile characteristic of a signal sequence (31Briggs M.S. Gierasch L.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 109-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) at the N terminus of protein sequences (Fig. 2). The N-terminal amino acid sequence determined from purified IIM indicated that the cDNA clones encode a protein containing a signal peptide 25 amino acids long and confirmed that the cDNA clones code for the IIM (Fig. 1). The amino acid composition of the deduced proteins from IIM14 and IIM22 were very similar to the composition of IIM isolated fromT. ni 2 (Table I), further confirming that the cDNA clones code for the IIM. Protein sequence data reveal that there are four potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the biochemical analysis results reported by Wang and Granados, which demonstrated that IIM hasN-linked glycosylation.2Table IAmino acid composition of deduced proteins from cDNA IIM14 and cDNA IIM22ResidueIIM14IIM22Native IIMmol %mol %mol %Ala14.715.115.9Arg1.21.21.5Asp + Asn8.18.18.1Gly3.83.84.5Glu + Gln9.79.59.3Cys4.84.72.5His2.12.02.5Ile2.92.92.4Leu4.24.13.8Lys1.11.00.8Met0.10.10.2Phe2.42.32.1Pro15.716.016.9Ser3.02.93.4Thr18.618.418.7Trp1.01.01.4Tyr2.01.91.4Val5.15.14.7Total amino acid residues763782Molecular weight (kDa)7981Amino acid compositions of the IIM were calculated from the deduced protein sequences from cDNA clone IIM14 and IIM22 with the signal peptide removed.

The amino acid composition of the native IIM is from Wang and Granados.2 The overall IIM sequence can be divided into six distinct regions based upon its sequence features (Fig. 3). The amino acid composition of each region shows characteristics of a secreted epithelial mucin (Table II). Both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (II and VI in Fig. 3), are rich in cysteine, which accounts for 8.2 and 7.8% of the total amino acid residues, respectively. Region III is rich in threonine, proline, and alanine (49.2, 16.2, and 21.5%, respectively) and contains two types of tandem repeats, TTTQAPT and AATTP, which are typical features for a mucin (6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar,32Verma M. Davidson E.A. Glycoconjugate J. 1994; 11: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Region IV is similar to regions II and VI and contains 9.0% cysteine residues. Region V is another threonine-, proline-, and alanine-rich section, containing a repetitive sequence, TAAP. This region differed between IIM14 and IIM22 in sequence length, but the sequence features of the two cDNA clones were similar. This region (V), contains 25 TAAP repeats in IIM22.Table IIRegional amino acid composition of IIMResidueAmino acid composition by regionIIIIIIIVV (IIM14)V (IIM22)VImol %Ala16.012.321.54.729.529.73.9Arg4.01.40.02.30.00.01.9Asn0.01.40.05.11.51.89.7Asp4.04.10.08.20.00.010.7Gly4.05.50.08.20.00.03.9Gln0.02.712.34.70.00.04.9Glu8.08.20.08.61.51.47.8Cys0.08.20.09.00.00.07.8His0.06.90.03.90.00.01.0Ile4.01.40.84.32.01.84.9Leu20.08.20.07.40.00.06.8Lys8.04.10.00.80.00.02.9Met4.00.00.00.00.00.01.0Phe4.05.50.03.90.00.03.9Pro4.015.116.210.526.526.57.8Ser4.01.40.04.73.02.73.9Thr8.05.549.23.928.528.82.9Trp0.01.40.01.60.00.02.9Tyr0.05.50.03.50.00.01.9Val8.01.40.05.17.57.39.7Number of amino acid residues25.073.0130.0257.0200.0219.0103.0Regional amino acid composition of IIM as presented in Fig. 3.

Mol % values were calculated from the deduced protein sequences of the IIM cDNA clones. Northern blot analysis of T. ni midgut RNA with a probe made from IIM22 showed a single band with a molecular size of 3.1 kilobase pairs (Fig.4), indicating that there was no similar polydispersity in IIM transcription, as is found in mammalian mucin transcripts. The IIM from T. ni larvae was localized by immunocytochemistry with the antiserum to IIM. Microscopic observations (Fig. 5) showed that IIM was localized in the peritrophic membrane and in the area surrounding the midgut epithelial brush border (Fig. 5 A). Observation at a high magnification suggested that IIM could be secreted from goblet cells of the midgut epithelium (Fig. 5 B). Immunostaining with preimmune serum from the same rabbit used to generate the anti-IIM antiserum did not show any positive reaction (Fig. 5 C). In addition to the midgut, positive staining was occasionally observed in malpighian tubules on the lumen side (Fig. 5 A, indicated by an arrow). To verify whether this occasional positive staining in malpighian tubules was specific to IIM and to test whether IIM was present in other tissues, a Western blot analysis of extracts from various tissues of T. ni larvae using anti-IIM antiserum was conducted (Fig. 6). The Western blot analysis showed that IIM was primarily present in the noncellular PM (Fig. 6, lane 1). A broad band at 200 kDa could also be detected in the PM extract when this sample was overloaded (Fig. 6,lane 1). We consider this band a degradation product of IIM by active midgut digestive enzymes, since the PM moved through the digestive tract. The midgut was the only tissue in which a significant amount of IIM was detected (Fig. 6, lane 2). Besides the IIM band, some lower molecular weight bands were also present in the midgut extract (Fig. 6, lane 2). These bands possibly were the IIM protein in the process of glycosylation but not yet fully glycosylated. The extract from malpighian tubules did not show any positive staining at the gel position for IIM, although a very faint smear showed at a position slightly over 200 kDa (Fig. 6, lane 3). Some weak positive staining was detected in the extract from hemolymph with a major broad band between 66 and 97 kDa (Fig. 6, lane 6). Salivary gland, fat body, and epidermis extracts did not show any positive reaction to the anti-IIM antiserum (Fig. 6, lanes 4, 5, and 7).Figure 6Detection of IIM in T. ni larval tissues. Proteins from various tissues of fourth instar T. ni larvae were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-IIM antiserum. The protein sources were as follows: PM (lane 1), midgut tissue (lane 2), malpighian tubules (lane 3); salivary glands (lane 4); fat bodies (lane 5); hemolymph (lane 6); and epidermis (lane 7). The arrow indicates IIM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Disulfide bonds appear to be essential for the stability of IIM in the PM (Fig.7), since in the presence of DTT, IIM was quickly degraded by endogenous digestive enzymes associated with the PM (Fig.7, lane 2). Once the endogenous proteases were inactivated, IIM was stable in the PM following treatment with DTT (Fig. 7, lane6). IIM showed a strong association with the chitin-containing PM structure.2 Treatment of PMs by boiling in 2% SDS and subsequent incubation in DTT to reduce disulfide cross-linking bonds did not result in any release of IIM from the PM (Fig. 7, lane 8). Biochemical analysis by Wang and Granados2 has shown that IIM from T. ni midgut peritrophic membranes is a novel invertebrate intestinal mucin. The cDNA sequence presented here confirms the identity of this secreted invertebrate intestinal mucin. Compared with human and other mammalian mucins, the overall structural organization of IIM is similar to human intestinal mucin, MUC2 (8Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which can be described as follows: (a) like a secreted mucin, the IIM contains a 25-amino acid signal peptide at the N terminus (region I); (b) relative to MUC2, which has two different tandem repeat domains interspersed by a cysteine-rich region that distinguishes MUC2 from other mucins, IIM also contains two threonine-rich tandem repeat regions (regions III and V) where potential O-glycosylation sites are located; and (c) the two tandem repeat regions are flanked by cysteine-rich regions (regions II, IV, and VI) (Fig. 3). In comparison with MUC2, which contains more than 5100 amino acid residues, the apoprotein in IIM is relatively small. The mature IIM contains 763–782 amino acid residues. Prediction ofO-glycosylation using the O-GLYCBASE search program (29Hansen J.E. Lund O. Nielsen J.O. Hansen J-E.S. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) indicated that 127 of the 147 threonine residues and 5 of the 23 serine residues in IIM22 (excluding the signal peptide) were potentialO-glycosylation sites. In regions III and V, all threonine residues, except the two at the boundaries of region III (at position 99) and region V (at position 486), were potentialO-glycosylation sites. There is only one threonine in the non-tandem repeat domains (at position 314) marginally predicted as a potential O-glycosylation site. A PROSITE data base search using DNASTAR suggested four tentative N-glycosylation sites. All four sites were located within region V, disrupting the tandem repeat (Fig. 1). Regions III and V have high levels of threonine, alanine, and proline and do not contain any aromatic or sulfur-containing amino acids (TableII), which is similar to the corresponding domains in MUC2 (8Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2440-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IIM contains multiple repeating units. These repeating units are short compared with those found in mammalian mucins (4Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 32Verma M. Davidson E.A. Glycoconjugate J. 1994; 11: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Region III contains two tandem repeating sequences, TTTQAPT and AATTP, throughout the whole region. Region V contains an even shorter repeating unit, TAAP. The repeating units in this region are dispersed at four potential N-glycosylation sites and several other locations. Sequences TTVT(V/S)PP and TTAVPEI occur frequently in the disrupted locations in region V (Fig. 1). The repeating sequences in IIM did not exhibit similarity to any known repeating sequences from other mucins (6Gendler S.J. Spicer A.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The difference between cDNAs IIM14 and IIM22 is in region V. In this region, IIM14 contains 19 fewer amino acids than IIM22, which could be due to genetic polymorphism, as reported for human and other vertebrate mucin genes (33Gum J.R. Byrd J.C. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Lamport D.T.A. Kim Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6480-6487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lancaster C.A. Peat N. Duhig T. Wilson D. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Gendler S.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24620-24624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both IIM cDNAs contain G + C-rich repeated sequence units in region III and V. These G + C-rich repeated sequences (with χ-like sequence features), could be responsible for the evolution of genetic polymorphisms (4Strous G.J. Dekker J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 57-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 36Jarman A.P. Wells R.A. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 367-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Smith G.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 179-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This difference between IIM14 and IIM22 could also be the result of alternative splicing during RNA processing. Such a phenomenon has been observed in mucin gene expression (38Ligtenberg M.J.L. Vos H.L. Gennissen A.M.C. Hilkens J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5573-5578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The AG at position 2005 and 2006 in IIM22 (Fig. 1) could potentially serve as a 3′-splicing site, which would lead to a mRNA corresponding to IIM14. Localization of IIM by immunocytochemistry indicates that IIM is primarily expressed in the midgut tissue (Fig. 5) and is likely to be secreted by goblet cells (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, this is similar to the secretion of mucins by goblet cells in vertebrate intestinal epithelium (39Specian R.D. Oliver M.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C183-C193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although positive staining could occasionally be observed in malpighian tubules by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5 A), Western blot analysis of various tissue extracts from T. ni larvae showed that IIM was expressed in the midgut (Fig. 6, lane 2). Very weak positive reactions were detected in the extracts of malpighian tubules and hemolymph (Fig. 6,lanes 3 and 6). However, the bands detected in the malpighian tubules and hemolymph did not show the correct molecular weight corresponding to IIM, and the reactivity to the anti-IIM serum was very low. Therefore, these bands, which are yet to be determined, do not appear to indicate the presence of IIM. The protein sequence features of IIM are in agreement with the data from the biochemical analysis of IIM reported by Wang and Granados.2 The presence of N-glycosylation motifs and mucin-characteristic threonine-rich tandem repeats in the IIM sequence confirmed the presence of N-glycosylation and extensive O-glycosylation of IIM, previously analyzed by carbohydrate-specific lectin binding and specific glycosidase analyses.2 Cysteine-rich domains are common in mucins and have been suggested to cause oligomerization of mucins by disulfide bonding (8Gum Jr., J.R.

Commun. 1995; 217: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These cysteine-rich regions might also contain globular structures with intramolecular disulfide bonds (43Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9678-9686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These protein regions could become exposed once the disulfide bonds are reduced (44Sheehan J.K. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1991; 265: 169-178Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 7) demonstrate that disulfide bonds in the non-heavilyO-glycosylated regions of IIM were involved in maintaining a digestive protease-resistant structure. However, protein sequence analysis did not show significant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich regions in IIM and the cysteine-rich regions from MUC2 (or other mammalian mucins). This is not surprising, since insects are phylogenetically distant from mammals and since IIM is a constituent of a unique invertebrate chitin-containing structure. Studies on sequence characteristics and the disulfide bond formation in the IIM cysteine-rich regions have yet to be conducted. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that IIM is tightly associated with the PM2 and that IIM is a major structural constituent of the PM. These results indicate that IIM may have a high affinity to the chitinous fibril network of PMs. By computer-assisted sequence analysis, a protein fragment in region IV was aligned to two chitin binding domains in chitinases from a yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (45Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19758-19767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a fungus, Rhizopus oligosporus(46Yanai K. Takaya N. Kojima N. Horiuchi H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7398-7406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 A). In addition to region IV, sequences in regions II and VI also show a certain degree of similarity to the chitin binding domains described above; however, the levels of similarity were lower than that found in region IV (data not shown). In a recent report, a non-mucin insect PM protein from Lucilia cuprina, peritrophin-44, showed binding capability to chitin, but it did not show significant sequence similarity to known chitin binding sequences (1Elvin E.M. Vuocolo T. Pearson R.D. East I.J. Riding G.A. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8925-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), as demonstrated in this study (Fig. 8 A). However, the cysteine-rich domains with peritrophin-44 shared the same structural feature, a six-cysteine-containing sequence present in cysteine-rich domains in chitinases (1Elvin E.M. Vuocolo T. Pearson R.D. East I.J. Riding G.A. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8925-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the sequence features of IIM in the cysteine-rich regions are similar to what Elvinet al. (1Elvin E.M. Vuocolo T. Pearson R.D. East I.J. Riding G.A. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8925-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) proposed for peritrophin-44. Almost all sequences in regions II, IV, and VI are composed of such a six-cysteine consensus (Fig. 8 B). This result supports our findings that IIM may tightly bind to the chitin network of PM in the nonglycosylated cysteine-rich regions. The strong binding of IIM to chitin could be a very important factor for the formation of PMs in invertebrates and aid in the stability of the chitin network. Based on the structural characteristics of IIM and the strong binding associated with IIM and chitin, it is possible that the chitin fibrils in PMs are protected from enzymatic degradation. Considering the biochemical properties of IIM and the putative chitin binding sequences in nonglycosylated regions in IIM, we propose that the IIM protein backbone may be protected from degradation in the hydrolytic enzyme-rich midgut environment by two possible mechanisms: (a) the denselyO-glycosylated regions (regions III and V) are protected by oligosaccharide moieties; and (b) the cysteine-rich nonglycosylated or less glycosylated regions (regions II, IV, and VI) are protected by disulfide covalent bonding forming a “buried” structure or by the protein binding to chitin in the PM. The mucin nature and chitin binding capability of IIM can explain the high resistance of IIM to midgut digestive enzymes and the protective functions of PMs in invertebrates, especially in insects. Any reagents with the potential effect of damaging IIM, such as baculovirus enhancins or reducing agents, will result in the destruction or attenuation of the protective role of the PM against parasites and other microorganisms.

We have studied the mechanisms by which the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone suppresses IFN-γ-stimulated iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Treatment of cells with dexamethasone reduces the formation of nitrite, one of the stable end products of NO production measured in culture supernatants with an IC50 of 9 nm. The reduction of iNOS activity is caused by decreased iNOS protein levels as assessed by immunoblotting using a specific anti-iNOS antibody. Dexamethasone treatment also reduces the formation of iNOS mRNA steady state levels to about 50% in IFN-γ-stimulated cells. This is due to decreased iNOS gene transcription and iNOS mRNA stability. More importantly, dexamethasone reduces the amount of iNOS protein by two additional mechanisms: reduction of the translation of iNOS mRNA and increased degradation of the iNOS protein. Using a specific protease inhibitor for the cysteine protease calpain I,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (calpain inhibitor I), the enhanced proteolysis of the iNOS protein can efficiently be blocked, whereas other protease inhibitors such as tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone have no effect. Dexamethasone does not significantly alter calpain gene expression. Northern blot analyses reveal that calpain mRNA steady state levels are virtually not affected upon incubation of the cells with IFN-γ and dexamethasone. Immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal anti-calpain antibody reveals that calpain protein levels are also not affected by the glucocorticoid.

In recent years the importance of NO for the regulation of vascular homeostasis, the involvement in neurotransmission, and the defense against infectious agents has become established (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 119-125Google Scholar, 2Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS) have been identified and cloned (3Knowles R.G. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar, 4Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The brain (type I) and endothelial (type III) enzymes are constitutively expressed and their enzymatic activity is regulated by changes in concentration of intracellular free Ca2+. The third member of the family of NO synthases is the inducible (type II) NOS. This enzyme is regulated at the transcriptional level and the activity is present at intracellular Ca2+ levels. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed in many different cell types and produces high levels of nitric oxide. Excessive formation of NO mediates the bactericidal and tumoricidal actions of macrophages. However, under pathological conditions, high output of NO is associated with tissue damage observed in arthritis, type I diabetes, septic shock, and nephritis (for review, see Refs. 1Moncada S. Palmer R.M.J. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 119-125Google Scholar and 2Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones with pleiotropic effects. At pharmacological concentrations, glucocorticoids are used to prevent and suppress inflammation and the activation of the immune system. Despite their widespread medical use, the precise mechanism(s) for the effectiveness as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs is not yet entirely understood. Steroids exert their anti-inflammatory actions mainly by modulation of the transcription of a variety of genes involved in the control of inflammatory processes. These include cytokines and their cellular receptors, adhesion molecules, and enzymes producing inflammatory mediators (for review, see Ref. 5Barnes P.J. Adcock I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 436-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Inhibition of transcriptional activity of target genes occurs either by binding of the activated glucocorticoid receptor to a negative GRE within the 5′-flanking region or by cross-coupling, i.e. direct protein-protein interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with transcription factors induced under stimulatory conditions (6Jonat C.

Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a few reports suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms including translation or protein secretion may also be involved in the anti-inflammatory actions of steroids (8Kern J.A. Lamb R.L. Daniele R.P. Nowell P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 9Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I. Cerami A.

Several recent publications document the suppression of iNOS expression by glucocorticoids in various cell types such as mesangial cells (10Pfeilschifter J. Schwarzenbach H.

Pharmacol. 1996; 19: 15-21Google Scholar). We have shown that dexamethasone blocks iNOS expression in rat renal mesangial cells at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (17Kunz D. Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Kunz D. Walker G. Eberhardt W. Pfeilschifter J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report we examined the mechanisms of inhibition of iNOS expression in the IFN-γ-stimulated murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 by dexamethasone. The present study establishes that the glucocorticoid suppresses iNOS formation at different levels of iNOS gene expression. We observed a reduction of the transcription rate of the iNOS gene and a decrease in stability of iNOS mRNA causing reduced, but not completely abolished iNOS mRNA steady state levels. More importantly, post-transcriptional mechanisms, notably the translation of iNOS mRNA and the degradation of iNOS protein are involved in the suppression of iNOS expression even when iNOS is already induced. Moreover, we provide evidence that the enzyme mediating increased proteolysis of the iNOS protein by dexamethasone is the cysteine protease calpain I. The macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was kindly provided by Dr. F. Erard (Ciba, Basel, Switzerland). Recombinant mouse IFN-γ was a gift from Dr. G. Adolf (Boehringer Ingelheim, Vienna, Austria). Dexamethasone,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) were purchased from Sigma. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (calpain inhibitor I) and actinomycin D were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. Calpain I and II were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (Lucerne, Switzerland). Antibodies specific for iNOS were generated using an antigen peptide based on an N-terminal sequence of mouse iNOS as described (17Kunz D. Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies for rat calpain II were generated as described (19Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The β-actin cDNA probe was a gift from Dr. U. Aebi (Maurice E. Müller Institute, Basel, Switzerland). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in Macrophage SFM medium (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For stimulation, RAW 264.7 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DMEM without phenol red (Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), with or without agents for the indicated time periods. NOS activity was measured as nitrite production in RAW 264.7 cell culture supernatants. 100 μl of cell culture supernatant were mixed with 200 μl of Griess reagent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The experiments were repeated four times. The plates were measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (KONTRON Analytical SLT 210) at 550 nm against a calibration curve with sodium nitrite standards. Nitrate was stoichiometrically reduced to nitrite by incubation of sample aliquots for 15 min at 37 °C, in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.2;Aspergillus species; Boehringer Mannheim), 50 μm NADPH, and 5 μm FAD, in a final volume of 160 μl. When nitrate reduction was complete, the remaining NADPH (which would interfere with nitrite determination) was oxidized with 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Boehringer Mannheim) and 10 mm sodium pyruvate, in a final volume of 170 μl for 5 min at 37 °C. The amount of nitrate produced in stimulated cells was approximately 30–35% of that of nitrite. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) in the presence of vehicle, dexamethasone at concentrations of 100 nm and 1 μm or dexamethasone (100 nm) plus RU-486 (1 μm) for 12 h. Then the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 μmleupeptin, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 200,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated overnight with 200 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of a specific polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The beads were washed twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS), twice with buffer B plus 500 mm NaCl, and once with buffer B. Proteins were solubilized from the beads by heating for 5 min at 95 °C in 0.1 ml of Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% (w/v) acrylamide gel). Immunoblotting was performed as decribed (17Kunz D. Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using an anti-iNOS antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (v/v). Total cellular RNA was extracted from RAW 264.7 cells using the Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of RNA (20 μg) were separated on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde before transfer to GeneScreen membranes. After UV-cross-linking and prehybridization for 4–6 h, the filters were hybridized for 16–24 h to a 32P-labeled (approximately 1 × 106cpm/ml) SmaI-digested cDNA insert derived from pGemiNOS coding for murine iNOS (20Lyons C.R. Orloff G.J. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6370-6374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or EcoRI-digested cDNA insert derived from pT7–7fN-rat calpain II (19Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). DNA probes were radioactively labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization reactions were performed in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed three times in 2 × SSC at room temperature for 30 min followed by twice in 0.2 × SSC, 1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 1 h. Filters were exposed for 24 to 48 h to Kodak X-Omat XAR film using intensifying screens. Densitometrical analyses were performed on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. To assess for variations in RNA loading and transfer, ribosomal RNAs were stained on the blots using methylene blue (21Herrin D.L. Schmidt G.W. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 12 h. Subsequently, either vehicle or dexamethasone (1 μm) was added and cells were incubated for a further 2 h. Thereafter, actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added, total RNA was prepared at the indicated time points and used for Northern hybridization as decribed above. For the nuclear run-on transcription assay, a nuclei suspension was prepared and mixed with 0.2 ml of 2 × reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 200 units of RNasin (Boehringer Mannheim) per ml per 1 mm each ATP, GTP, and CTP per 150 μCi (1 μCi = 37 kBq) of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, Dübendorf, Switzerland) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Transcription was stopped by adding 20 μg of DNase I, followed by 80 μg of proteinase K. The 32P-labeled RNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and two sequential precipitations with ammonium acetate. Equal amounts of 32P-labeled RNA were hybridized in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS (1 × SSC = 150 mm NaCl, 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 42 °C for 72 h. Filters contained 10 μg each of linearized plasmids immobilized on GeneScreen membranes (DuPont de Nemours International, Regensdorf, Switzerland) after blotting in 12 × SSPE with a dot-blot apparatus. After hybridization filters were rinsed for 30 min in 2 × SSC at 60 °C, for 5 min in 2 × SSC containing 10 μg of RNase A/ml at 37 °C, and finally for 1 h in 2 × SSC at 37 °C. Filters were air dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR film for 2 to 4 days using intensifying screens. Densitometrical analyses were performed on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. The amount of sample hybridizing to β-actin was used for normalization. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in 150-mm (diameter) culture dishes and stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 3.5 h. Then vehicle, dexamethasone (100 nm), or a combination of dexamethasone (100 nm) and RU-486 (1 μm) was added for 0, 2, and 4 h, as indicated. Thereafter the medium was aspirated and replaced with pulse medium (DMEM without l- methionine) and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min for depletion of intracellular stores of methionine. l-[35S]Methionine (300 μCi/dish) in pulse medium was added for 30 min. The medium was removed, the dishes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were scraped into 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein lysate were incubated overnight with 100 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of a specific polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The beads were washed twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS), twice with buffer B plus 500 mm NaCl, and once with buffer B. Proteins were solubilized from the beads by heating for 5 min at 95 °C in 0.1 ml of Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% (w/v) acrylamide gel). Gels were vacuum dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR film for 2 to 4 days. Densitometrical analyses were performed on a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. For metabolic labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitation of calpain, RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml), IFN-γ (50 units/ml) plus dexamethasone (1 μm), or dexamethasone (1 μm) for 12 h in 10 ml of pulse medium (DMEM withoutl-methionine). Thereafter the medium was aspirated and replaced with pulse medium containingl-[35S]methionine (300 μCi/dish) and incubations were continued in the presence of stimuli for 4.5 h. Lysates were prepared as described above. Immunoprecipitation was performed using a specific polyclonal anti-calpain II antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (9% (w/v) acrylamide gel). RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 6 h. Then dexamethasone (1 μm) was added for 1 h. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of pulse medium (DMEM withoutl-methionine) containing IFN-γ (50 units/ml) and dexamethasone (1 μm). The cells were starved forl-methionine for 45 min to deplete intracellular stores of methionine. Subsequently the cells were pulsed for 2 h withl-[35S]methionine (300 μCi/dish). Thereafter, pulse medium was aspirated and replaced by 10 ml of chase medium (pulse medium containing 15 mg of unlabeledl-methionine per liter). The cells were further incubated for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h, as indicated. Subsequently, cells were harvested and processed for immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as described above. In the experiments using protease inhibitors, cells were incubated as above. N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (calpain inhibitor I, 100 μm) or TLCK (100 μm) were added during the pulse period of 2 h withl-[35S]methionine (300 μCi/dish). Thereafter, pulse medium was aspirated and replaced by 10 ml of chase medium (pulse medium containing 15 mg of unlabeledl-methionine per liter). The cells were further incubated for 0 and 2 h as indicated. Subsequently, cells were harvested and processed for immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as described above. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test, and p < 0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance. Incubation of RAW 264.7 cells for 24 h with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) increases the production of nitrite, one of the stable end products of NO formation, about 66-fold, from 2 ± 0.2 nmol/mg of protein in unstimulated cells to 138 ± 15 nmol/mg of protein (means ± S.D., n = 3). Simultaneous incubation of the cells with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) and dexamethasone for 24 h dose dependently inhibits the formation of nitrite in cell culture supernatants as shown in Fig. 1. Half-maximal inhibition is observed at 9 ± 0.5 nm dexamethasone (means ± S.D., n = 4). To assess whether the reduced production of nitrite in dexamethasone-treated RAW 264.7 cells is due to a decrease in iNOS protein levels, immunoblotting experiments using a specific anti-iNOS antibody were performed. Cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) in the presence of vehicle or dexamethasone at concentrations of 100 nm and 1 μm or a combination of dexamethasone (100 nm) plus a 10-fold molar excess of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 (1 μm) for 12 h. Subsequently cells were lysed and extracts were used for immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2, in unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells no iNOS protein is detected, whereas IFN-γ strongly induces the formation of detectable iNOS protein of approximately 130 kDa. This induction is blocked under the action of dexamethasone at concentrations of 1 μm and 100 nm, respectively. The effect is reversed upon the simultaneous incubation of the cells with dexamethasone (100 nm) and the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 (1 μm; Fig.2). Northern blot analyses were performed to assess whether the glucocorticoid affects the formation of iNOS mRNA steady state levels. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated for 24 h with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) in the presence of vehicle or dexamethasone at concentrations of 1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, and 1 μm. As shown in Fig.3, strong induction of iNOS mRNA is observed upon stimulation of the cells with IFN-γ (50 units/ml). Dexamethasone (1 μm) decreases the formation of iNOS mRNA, however, only to about 50% when compared with levels obtained with IFN-γ alone (Fig. 3). The application of lower concentrations of dexamethasone such as 10 and 1 nm does not block the induction of iNOS mRNA levels in IFN-γ-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Thus, suppression of iNOS protein levels is only in part caused by a decrease in iNOS mRNA steady state levels. We further were interested in determining whether dexamethasone would inhibit the formation of iNOS mRNA levels when the drug is administered at different time points relative to IFN-γ. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with dexamethasone (1 μm) for 1, 8, and 15 h prior to addition of IFN-γ (50 units/ml). Subsequently incubations were continued for 24 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot hybridization. As shown in Fig. 4, dexamethasone efficiently blocks the induction of iNOS mRNA only when administered 15 h prior to IFN-γ. Furthermore, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 1 and 8 h. Subsequently, dexamethasone (1 μm) was added and incubations were continued for a total of 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4, dexamethasone fails to inhibit the induction of iNOS mRNA steady state levels when administered after IFN-γ. We performed mRNA stability experiments to assess whether dexamethasone would affect the half-life of IFN-γ-induced iNOS mRNA. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 12 h. Then vehicle or dexamethasone (1 μm) was added for a further 2 h. Subsequently actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) was added and iNOS mRNA levels were determined after 1, 4, and 12 h. Incubations of RAW 264.7 cells with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) longer than 12 h were not performed because of severe disturbances of cell viability. Whereas the half-life of iNOS mRNA in this experimental setting was determined to be greater than 12 h (Fig. 5), dexamethasone (1 μm) decreased iNOS mRNA half-life to approximately 8 h. Nuclear run-on experiments were performed to evaluate whether changes in iNOS gene transcription may contribute to dexamethasone-dependent reduction of iNOS mRNA formation. As shown in Fig. 6, in unstimulated cells virtually no transcriptional activity is determined. Incubation of the cells for 6 h with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) increases the transcription rate of the iNOS gene. Dexamethasone decreases the transcriptional activity of the iNOS gene by approximately 65% compared with IFN-γ alone (Fig. 6). Thus, the suppressive effect of dexamethasone on the formation of iNOS mRNA steady state levels occurs by a decrease in half-life of iNOS mRNA and by the interference of the drug with the transcriptional machinery regulating iNOS gene expression. The foregoing experiments suggest that dexamethasone may affect additional post-transcriptional steps of iNOS expression such as translation of iNOS mRNA and/or stability of the iNOS protein. Thus, we intended to evaluate the effects of dexamethasone on the translation of iNOS mRNA. RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 3.5 h to achieve increased iNOS mRNA levels (data not shown). Then vehicle, dexamethasone (100 nm), or a combination of dexamethasone (100 nm) plus the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 (1 μm) in a 10-fold molar excess were added to the cells and incubation continued for 0, 2, and 4 h. Finally, RAW 264.7 cells were pulsed withl-[35S]methionine for 30 min to label newly synthesized proteins. Cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody and SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 7. Whereas IFN-γ-induced iNOS mRNA translation increases with time, administration of dexamethasone (100 nm) causes a reduction of the translation of iNOS mRNA in a time-dependent fashion. This effect can completely be reversed by incubation of the cells with dexamethasone (100 nm) in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the receptor antagonist RU-486 (1 μm; Fig. 7). It is noteworthy that anti-iNOS immunoblots of activated RAW 264.7 cells reveal two bands, migrating on SDS-PAGE, with apparent molecular masses of 130 and 115 kDa. Whether the lower band represents a proteolytic degradation product or a post-translationally modified form of iNOS as recently described (22Vodovotz Y. Russell D. Xie Q. Bogdan C. Nathan C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2914-2925PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ringheim G.E. Pan J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) remains to be elucidated. For quantification only the upper bands were used. We next examined whether dexamethasone would affect the degradation of the iNOS protein. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 6 h. Then vehicle or dexamethasone (1 μm) was added, cells were starved forl-methionine for 45 min, then pulsed withl-[35S]methionine for 2 h and finally chased with an excess of nonradioactive l-methionine for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h. Subsequently cells were lysed and iNOS protein was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 8). By the end of the pulse (a total of 3 h 45 min of dexamethasone) a difference in the amount of iNOS protein is detectable between IFN-γ-stimulated and IFN-γ plus dexamethasone-treated cells (Fig. 8). This is most probably caused by the action of dexamethasone during the pulse period. However, the rate of degradation of radioactively labeled iNOS protein during the chase period is drastically accelerated in dexamethasone-treated cells already at 2 h (Fig. 8). Thus, enhanced proteolysis of the iNOS protein, together with a decrease in translation of iNOS mRNA may account for the post-transcriptional part in the dexamethasone-dependent inhibition of IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 cells. To assess the identity of the protease involved in the dexamethasone-induced degradation of the iNOS protein, we performed pulse-chase experiments in the presence of protease inhibitors such as calpain inhibitor I and TLCK. TLCK is known to irreversibly inhibit serine proteases like trypsin. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) for 6 h. Then vehicle or dexamethasone (1 μm) was added and cells were starved for l-methionine for 45 min before being pulsed with l-[35S]methionine for an additional 2 h and finally chased with an excess of nonradioactivel-methionine for 0 and 2 h. During the pulse period, calpain inhibitor I (100 μm) or TLCK (100 μm) were added to the cells. Subsequently cells were lysed, iNOS was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig.9 and 10). As seen in the previous experiment in Fig. 8, by the end of the pulse (a total of 3 h 45 min of dexamethasone) a difference in the amount of iNOS protein is detectable between IFN-γ-stimulated and IFN-γ plus dexamethasone-treated cells (IFN-γ andIFN-γ + DEX in Figs. 9 and 10) which may be caused by the action of dexamethasone during the pulse procedure. Dexamethasone drastically increases the degradation of iNOS protein (IFN-γ + DEX in Figs. 9 and 10). When co-administered with calpain inhibitor I (100 μm), a specific inhibitor of"

Here we characterize a gene (CEL-1) believed to encode the C. elegans capping enzyme. CEL-1 has a C-terminal domain containing motifs found in yeast and vaccinia virus capping enzyme guanylyltransferases. The N-terminal domain of CEL-1 has RNA triphosphatase activity. Surprisingly, this domain does not resemble the vaccinia virus capping enzyme but does have significant sequence similarity to the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) enzyme family. However, CEL-1 has no detectable PTP activity. The mechanism of the RNA triphosphatase is similar to that of PTPs: the active site contains a conserved nucleophilic cysteine required for activity. These results broaden the superfamily of PTP-like phosphatases to include enzymes with RNA substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2070911609,"Abstract We previously found that strand transfer by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is promoted at sites where RT pauses during synthesis. In this report, strand transfer is measured within the 5′ transactivation response region (TAR) of HIV-1 RNA. We hypothesized that the stable hairpin structure of TAR would induce RT pausing, promoting RNase H-directed cleavage of the template and subsequent transfer at that site. We further predicted that HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC), known to melt secondary structures, would decrease transfer. We show that TAR created a strong pause site for RT, but NC significantly promoted strand transfer. The effect of NC is specific, since other single strand binding proteins failed to stimulate transfer. In another unexpected outcome, preferred positions of internal transfer were not at the pause site but were in the upper stem and loop of TAR. Thus, we propose a new mechanism for transfer within TAR described by an interactive hairpin model, in which association between the donor and the acceptor templates within the TAR stem promotes transfer. The model is consistent with the observed stimulation of strand transfer by NC. The model is applicable to internal and replicative end transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1993072674,"SNARE proteins represent a family of related proteins that are thought to have a central role in vesicle targeting and fusion in all eukaryotic cells. The binding properties of the neuronal proteins synaptobrevin 1 (VAMP1), syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, andsoluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitivefactor attachment protein (α-SNAP), have been extensively studied. We report here the first biochemical characterization of a nonneuronal SNARE complex using recombinant forms of the yeast exocytic SNARE proteins Snc1, Sso1, and Sec9 and the yeast α-SNAP homolog, Sec17. Despite the low level of sequence identity, the association properties of the yeast and neuronal complexes are remarkably similar. The most striking difference we have found between the yeast and neuronal proteins is that individually neither of the target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs), Sso1 nor Sec9, show any detectable binding to the synaptobrevin homolog, Snc1. However, as a hetero-oligomeric complex, Sec9 and Sso1 show strong binding to Snc1. The clear dependence on the Sso1-Sec9 complex for t-SNARE function suggests that regulating the formation of this complex may be a key step in determining the site of vesicle fusion.In addition, we have used this in vitro assay to examine the biochemical effects of several mutations in Sec9 that result in pronounced growth defects in vivo. As expected, a temperature-sensitive mutation in the region most highly conserved between Sec9 and SNAP-25 is severely diminished in its ability to bind Sso1 and Snc1 in vitro. In contrast, a temperature-sensitive mutation near the C terminus of Sec9 shows no defect in SNARE binding in vitro. Similarly, a deletion of the C-terminal 17 residues, which is lethal in vivo, also binds Sso1 and Snc1 normally in vitro. Interestingly, we find that these same two C-terminal mutants, but not mutants that show SNARE assembly defects in vitro, act as potent dominant negative alleles when expressed behind a strong regulated promoter. Taken together these results suggest that the C-terminal domain of Sec9 is specifically required for a novel interaction that is required at a step following SNARE assembly.

Taken together these results suggest that the C-terminal domain of Sec9 is specifically required for a novel interaction that is required at a step following SNARE assembly. In recent years, studies on neuronal exocytosis, biochemical analysis of in vitro transport systems, and yeast genetic analysis have converged on a set of structurally related proteins known as SNARE proteins, as critical for the process of vesicle targeting and fusion in eukaryotic cells (1Bennett M.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This has led to the SNARE hypothesis, which suggests that SNARE proteins on the surface of vesicles (v-SNAREs) 1The abbreviations used are: v-SNARE, vesicle SNARE; t-SNARE, target membrane SNARE; NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. can interact specifically with SNARE proteins on the target membrane (t-SNAREs) to form a complex that recruits factors required for fusion of the two membrane bilayers (2Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In neurons the vesicular protein, synaptobrevin, associates with the two plasma membrane proteins syntaxin and soluble SNAP-25 to form a complex that acts as a receptor for α-SNAP and NSF. Hydrolysis of ATP by NSF leads to SNARE complex disassembly and is thought to be linked to membrane fusion, although precisely how NSF is involved in the membrane fusion event is still unclear (3Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Binding studies with recombinant neuronal proteins have shown that although syntaxin and SNAP-25 can bind to one another with high affinity, they can also individually bind to the vesicle protein, synaptobrevin, with lower affinities (4Pevsner J. Hsu S. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A. Bennett M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The presence of both t-SNAREs, however, potentiates the interaction of syntaxin with synaptobrevin about 10-fold and that of SNAP-25 with synaptobrevin approximately 2-fold. This suggests that the formation of a highly stable ternary complex drives the interaction between these proteins and consequently aids in determining the overall specificity of synaptic vesicle docking (4Pevsner J. Hsu S. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A. Bennett M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The regions of each neuronal SNARE protein that mediate these binding activities have been extensively characterized. Within the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 1, for example, a small 73-residue juxtamembrane region, predicted to form coiled-coils, can mediate both binding to synaptobrevin (5Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 6Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S. Scheller R.H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of syntaxin is also capable of binding the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein, and this interaction appears to be somewhat inhibitory to synaptobrevin binding (5Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal half of SNAP-25, which is also predicted to form a coiled-coil structure, is required for binding to syntaxin, while the interaction between SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin requires the entire protein (7Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 9 residues of SNAP-25 by botulinum neurotoxin A, was shown in vitro to diminish the interaction of SNAP-25 with synaptobrevin (7Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibit the ability of SNAP-25 to form an SDS-resistant complex with syntaxin and synaptobrevin (8Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, suggest that toxin poisoning of synaptosomes does not affect SNARE complex assembly or disassembly but rather acts at a later stage (9Otto H. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Blasi J. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Also, studies in neuroendocrine cells have shown that a C-terminal 20-mer corresponding to the BoTx A cleavage of SNAP-25 can inhibit Ca2+-dependant exocytosis presumably via interactions with other components of the fusion complex (11Gutierrez L.M. Canaves J.M. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Reig J.A. Montal M. Viniegra S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Binding of synaptobrevin to syntaxin and SNAP-25 requires the presence of the entire conserved domain of the protein (8Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), and mapping of the interacting sequences revealed that complex formation correlated with the presence of coiled-coil domains. The t-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP-25 can each bind specifically to α-SNAP, and the interaction between α-SNAP and syntaxin was mapped to the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the protein (6Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Although the v-SNARE synaptobrevin does not directly bind α-SNAP, it greatly potentiates α-SNAP binding to syntaxin (13McMahon H.T. Südhof T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2213-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) by formation of a third binding site in the SNARE complex (8Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In yeast, SNC1 and SNC2 represent a duplicated gene family that encodes homologs of synaptobrevin that are required for post-Golgi transport and have been localized to post-Golgi vesicles (14Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Likewise, SSO1 and SSO2 represent a duplicated gene family whose protein products are homologous to syntaxin, are required for post-Golgi transport, and are localized to the plasma membrane in yeast (15Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keränen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Finally, SEC9 encodes a soluble protein that is related to SNAP-25, is required for post-Golgi transport, and is localized to the plasma membrane in yeast (15Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Like their neuronal counterparts, the Sec9, Sso1/2, and Snc1/2 proteins can be co-precipitated as a complex from detergent extracts of yeast, and this complex is disassociated in the presence of ATP and magnesium (15Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In this paper we examine the binding properties of recombinant forms of the yeast exocytic SNARE proteins Snc1, Sso1, and Sec9 and the α-SNAP homolog Sec17. We have found that although the yeast proteins show limited conservation with their mammalian counterparts in their primary sequences, their binding properties are extremely similar and form a complex with Sec17 that appears to associate with identical stoichiometries to those found in the neuronal SNARE/α-SNAP complex. We have used this system to begin to assess the biochemical defects associated with four distinct mutant alleles of Sec9 with clearin vivo defects in function. We show that in two of these alleles the in vivo defect correlates precisely with a clear biochemical defect in SNARE interactions, while two alleles containing mutations in the extreme C terminus of Sec9 show no detectable defect in SNARE interactions and act as dominant negative mutants when expressed behind a strong regulated promoter. Taken together, these mutants appear to identify a functional requirement for the C terminus of Sec9, which appears to play a role following the assembly of Sec9 into SNARE complexes. Sso1-(1–265), Sso1-(193–265), and Snc1-(1–93) were subcloned into the pGEX4T1 expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using fragments generated by PCR withEcoRI and SalI sites introduced in the PCR primers. Sec17-(1–292) was subcloned as aXhoI-BamHI fragment into the same vector. The details of the Sec9-(402–651) GST fusion construct will be described elsewhere. 2L. M. Rice, P. Brennwald, and A. T. Brünger, manuscript in preparation. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis to ensure that no mutations had been introduced during their construction. Plasmids expressing GST-Sec9 and GST-Sec17 were transformed in BL21 cells. The remaining GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α. Cells were grown to A 600 = 0.7 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 2 h. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 3.5 ml of ice-cold PBS with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (2 mm) and frozen in Eppendorf tubes on dry ice. The cell pellets were then thawed on ice and sonicated for 30 s with a probe sonicator. PBS with 1% Triton was then added at a 1:1 ratio to the cell lysate, and after 15 min on ice, the lysate was spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and the supernatant containing the soluble recombinant protein was pooled and incubated with 3 ml of a 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 1 h on ice with gentle mixing. The beads were subsequently washed twice with 1 × PBS, three times with 1 × PBS plus 1% Triton, and then stored at 4 °C in 1 × PBS with 10 mm NaN3. Soluble recombinant proteins were obtained from the fusion proteins bound to beads by thrombin cleavage in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl using 2.5 units of thrombin (Pharmacia)/0.1 ml of beads for 2 h at room temperature. In the case of the GST-Sec9 and GST-Sec17 fusion proteins, however, 4 and 1.25 units of thrombin were added for 4 and 1 h, respectively. The supernatant was then separated from the beads, and the beads were washed twice in cleavage buffer. The supernatants containing the soluble proteins were then pooled and treated with benzamidine-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) to remove any thrombin activity by raising the NaCl concentration to 0.5 m and then adding approximately 0.2 ml of 1:1 slurry of benzamidine-Sepharose beads, 0.1 ml of original glutathione-Sepharose bead bed volume. After 30 min on ice, the supernatant was separated from the beads and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and then concentrated in a Centricon concentrator (Amicon). Protein concentrations were then quantitated by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and by comparison to purified standards following SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Affinity-purified antibodies against the C-terminal 70 residues of Sec9 were described previously (15Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera were raised against recombinant GST-Sec17 and GST-Sso1 (Cocalico Biologicals) and affinity-purified as described previously (15Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Wild type or mutantSEC9 sequences were placed under control of a T7 promoter by PCR amplification with the following primer pair: the S9/T7 primer, TAATACGACTCACTATAGAAGCTTGCAATCCCCCAAAACAGACAGAATGGCCAAAGAAGAGGAGGCTCGCCA, and the S9-DS primer, GCGTCAAGCTTGGGATCCCGAAGGTATTCTTTCAATTCAC. The amplified DNA was added directly to a reticulocyte lysate-coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (TNT system from Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. For the binding of radiolabeled Sec9 to the glutathione-Sepharose-bound fusion proteins, 4 μl of the [35S]methionine-labeled in vitrotranscription-translation reaction mixture was added to a 100-μl reaction containing a final concentration of 2 μm of immobilized fusion protein in 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride. The reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the supernatants were separated from the pellets by centrifugation. The supernatants were boiled in 2 × sample buffer, while the pellets were washed three times with binding buffer and then boiled in 200 μl of sample buffer. Equal volumes of the samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained, destained, treated with sodium salicylate (1 m), dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The binding reactions with recombinant Sec9 and Sso1 proteins were performed identically except that SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with the appropriate affinity-purified antisera, detected with125I-Protein A, and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For the Sec17 binding experiment the SNARE complex was preassembled onto GST-Snc1 beads by incubating the beads overnight in binding buffer. The beads were then washed in binding buffer and used for the incubation with Sec17 (3 μm) at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were processed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using125I-Protein A to detect bound antibodies. For the saturation experiments, the soluble protein was incubated with the glutathione beads in a final volume of 50 μl. The concentration of protein bound to the glutathione beads was kept constant at approximately 0.4 μm, while the concentration of the soluble protein was varied between 0.05 and 30 μm. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 2 h. The reactions were then treated as above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. The binding was quantitated by use of a PhosphorImager, and the EC50 values were obtained using a Prism program. ThePstI site in pRS316 (CEN, URA3) was removed by filling in with Klenow and religating. ABamHI/SacI fragment of SEC9 was subcloned into this vector and then digested with PstI and XbaI to create a gap over most of the SNAP-25 domain. This gapped DNA was used to transform a yeast strain, BY70 (a,sec9–7, ura3–52). Transformants, which arose from repair of this gapped plasmid with sequences present at the chromosomal sec9–7 locus, were scored for temperature sensitivity. Approximately half of the transformants were temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C, and half showed normal growth at 37 °C. This indicated that the site of temperature sensitivity was not within the gapped region but just outside the boundary of the gap. We showed that the mutation was present on the C-terminal side of this gap by subcloning theXbaI-SacI region from a plasmid recovered from a temperature-sensitive transformant. The resulting subclone gave rise to 100% temperature-sensitive transformants. Sequencing of the SNAP-25 domain of the temperature-sensitive Sec9 clone showed a single base change in the expected region causing a leucine to histidine substitution at residue 627. Thesec9-Δ17 and sec9-Δ38 alleles were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of SEC9 on a LEU2integration vector (pRS305). Deletion mutants were identified by restriction analysis followed by automated sequencing to confirm the sequence of each mutant. To determine the phenotype of the two deletion mutants as the only source of Sec9, the constructs were transformed into a diploid yeast strain heterozygous for a chromosomal deletion ofSEC9. BY153 (a/α ura3–52/ura3–52; leu2–3, 112/leu2–3, 112, his3–200/his3–200, sec9::HIS3/SEC9) has one copy of the SEC9 gene in which the sequences bounded by the internal BglII and XbaI sites were deleted to generate a disrupted copy of SEC9. The plasmids containing the mutations were cleaved within the LEU2 gene to target chromosomal integration at the LEU2 locus. The transformants were colony-purified and sporulated, and tetrads were dissected with a micromanipulator on YPD plates. The plates were grown at 25 °C, and the haploid progeny were analyzed by replica plating for the presence of the integrated mutants (scored as leu+) and for the presence of a deleted copy of SEC9 (scored as his+). Analysis of 24 tetrads for each of the two deletion mutants showed 2:2 segregation for viability, and all of the viable spores were his−, demonstrating that both thesec9-Δ17 and sec9-Δ38 mutations are lethal to Sec9 function. The lack of dominant effects when these mutants were expressed behind their own promoter was apparent from the normal growth seen in the his−, leu+ segregants, which have both the wild type and mutant copies of Sec9. To look for possible dominant negative phenotypes associated with moderate overexpression of these alleles, DNA fragments were PCR-amplified from the cloned SEC9, sec9–4,sec9–7, sec9-Δ17, and sec9-Δ38alleles and subcloned behind the GAL1 promoter in aLEU2 integration vector (pNB527). Two independent subclones of each allele were linearized with PstI to target integration at the LEU2 locus and transformed into aGAL+,leu2–3,112 strain. Two independent transformants of each construct (four isolates for each allele) were picked into microtiter wells and replica-plated onto YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and YP-Gal (YP with 3% galactose) plates at 25 and 37 °C and incubated for 2–3 days to monitor growth. We have previously described a SNARE-like complex among Sec9, Sso1/2, and Snc1/2 in co-precipitation experiments from detergent lysates of yeast (15Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To study more directly the specific interactions seen between the yeast t-SNAREs Sec9p and Sso1p and the v-SNARE Snc1 and compare these interactions to those observed with the neuronal SNARE proteins, we prepared GST fusion constructs containing the cytoplasmic domains of Snc1 (residues 1–93), Sso1 (residues 1–265), and the essential, SNAP-25-like domain of Sec9 (residues 402–651). Since the yeast syntaxin homologs, SSO1 and SSO2, and the yeast synaptobrevin homologs SNC1 and SNC2 are encoded by duplicated gene families with redundant functions, we chose one member of each gene family for our analysis. While the Snc1 and Sso1 constructs readily expressed fusion protein (see Fig.1), attempts to express recombinant Sec9 were unsuccessful in a variety of Escherichia coli expression systems. The most likely explanation for the lack of expression was the poor codon usage in this domain, since the SNAP-25 domain of Sec9 contains 26 arginine AGG and AGA codons, which are the two rarest codons in Gram-negative bacteria. To overcome this problem, we prepared a synthetic version of this domain of Sec9 whose codon usage was optimal for E. coli.2 As predicted, GST-Sec9 constructs containing the synthetic coding sequence expressed large amounts of fusion protein of the expected size, which is recognized by affinity-purified antiserum raised against the C terminus of Sec9 (Figs. 1 and 2). We also prepared an N-terminally truncated version of Sso1 (residues 193–265), which corresponds to the minimal domain in syntaxin 1A required for binding to SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin. The GST fusion proteins were then immobilized on Sepharose beads and used directly or as a source of soluble recombinant proteins following thrombin cleavage (Fig. 1). Because antibody to the truncated Sso1 protein was unavailable, we also prepared radiolabeled soluble Sso1-(193–265) from a 35S-labeled bacterial culture to quantitatively follow the association properties of this protein.Figure 2Recombinant Sec9 protein binds to GST-Sso1 but only binds to GST-Snc1 in the presence of soluble Sso1 protein. A, binding of recombinant Sec9p to various GST fusion proteins. B, binding of recombinant Sec9 to various GST fusion proteins in the presence of soluble Sso1 proteins. All binding assays were performed with the recombinant Sec9-(402–651) at a final concentration of 1 μm. In B, Sec9p binding was in the presence of excess (3 μm) recombinant full-length or truncated Sso1. The binding reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the supernatants were separated from the pellets by centrifugation. The supernatants were boiled in 2 × sample buffer, while the pellets were washed 3 × with binding buffer and then boiled in a proportional volume of sample buffer. The samples were then electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with antibodies to Sec9p. Binding was quantitated by use of the PhosphorImager and expressed as a percentage of the total protein. Results show that recombinant soluble Sec9p binds to Sso1p in conditions in which it does not bind to GST-Snc1 and that soluble Sso1p promotes the binding of Sec9p to GST-Snc1 beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Coomassie staining of recombinant proteins used in this study. Fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Soluble recombinant proteins were obtained from the beads by thrombin cleavage. An aliquot (1.5 μg) of fusion protein bound to beads (lanes 1–5) or soluble (lanes 6–9) was boiled in sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the interactions among Sec9p, Sso1p, and Snc1p and compare them to the interactions of the neuronal SNARE proteins, we examined the binding of the purified soluble recombinant SNAP-25 domain of Sec9p (present at about 1 μm in the binding reaction) to beads prebound with Sso1 and Snc1 fusion proteins (present at about 2–3 μm in the binding reaction). The results are shown in Fig. 2 A. As expected from our previous work and from studies on the neuronal SNARE proteins, recombinant Sec9 interacts directly with both full-length cytoplasmic domain of Sso1 (residues 1–265) and a truncated Sso1 construct (residues 193–265), which corresponds to the minimal SNAP-25 binding domain in syntaxin 1a (7Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The binding of Sec9 was considerably better to the truncated form of Sso1 (98% bound) than to the full-length cytoplasmic domain (38%). Saturation binding experiments with soluble Sec9 to the two GST-Sso1 proteins demonstrate that the difference in binding observed here is in fact due to a significant difference in affinity for the two proteins; Sec9 has a nearly 10-fold higher affinity for the truncated Sso1 (EC50 ≈ 0.9 μm) compared with the full-length protein (EC50 ≈ 8 μm) under these conditions (data not shown). In very similar conditions, however, SNAP-25 binding to full-length and truncated forms of syntaxin 1a was shown to be identical (7Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a more dramatic influence of the N-terminal domain on the C-terminal domain of Sso1 in yeast (5Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Since recombinant SNAP-25 has been shown to directly bind to synaptobrevin in vitro, we were surprised to find that Sec9 did not detectably bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the synaptobrevin homolog, Snc1, fused to GST (Fig. 2 A). This is not simply a consequence of the concentration of Sec9 used (which was s"

Coexpression of dominant-negative Jak2 inhibited chimeric receptor-stimulated MAPK activity by ∼70%, while expression of dominant-negative Ras completely blocked MAPK activation by either receptor polypeptide. Deletion analysis identified a 24-amino acid region of gp130 that was necessary for maximal stimulation of MAPK, and contained box 3 (positions 120–129) and a consensus tyrosine binding motif (Tyr-118) for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Expression of receptors lacking this region or of chimeric gp130(Y118F) point mutants inhibited MAPK activity by ∼55%, suggesting that Tyr-118, but not box 3, was required during activation of MAPK by gp130. Similarly, expression of chimeric LIFR constructs lacking box 3 maximally stimulated MAPK activity, while those lacking Tyr-115, a putative SHP2 binding site, inhibited stimulation of MAPK by this polypeptide. Our results demonstrate that gp130 and LIFR stimulate MAPK activity through box 3-independent mechanisms involving: (i) effects at Tyr-118 and Tyr-115, respectively, for maximal stimulation of MAPK activity and (ii) a Jak/Tyk-dependent pathway that, together with Tyr-118- or Tyr-115-generated signals, converges at the level of Ras during activation of MAPK by cytokine.

With respect to stimulation of protein-tyrosine kinases, both subunits of activated heterodimeric LIF receptor complexes, namely LIFR and gp130, have been shown to associate with and stimulate all known members of the Jak/Tyk family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (6Stahl N.

The role of protein-tyrosine kinase activation during LIF receptor signaling is further complicated by the findings that stimulation of LIF receptor and/or gp130 has been shown to activate Lyn, Fyn, Hck, Btk, Tec, Fes, and Yes nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (11Schieven G.L.

Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6376-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While a number of studies have clearly identified regions termed boxes 1, 2, and 3 within the cytoplasmic domains of LIFR and gp130 required for STAT activation and the initiation of gene induction, no data currently exist describing regions or residues within these polypeptides responsible for eliciting the stimulation of MAPK following cytokine administration. To address this question, we transiently transfected Cos-7 cells with chimeric receptors containing the entire or various truncated cytoplasmic domains of either LIFR or gp130, and measured their ability to stimulate MAPK. Our data indicate that gp130 and LIFR stimulate the activation of MAPK through a box 3-independent mechanism involving effects at Tyr-118 and Tyr-115, respectively, for maximal stimulation of MAPK activity by cytokine. Both receptor subunits use a Jak/Tyk-dependent pathway that, together with Tyr-118- or Tyr-115-generated signals, converges at the level of Ras during activation of MAPK by these polypeptides.

Polyclonal anti-gp130 and anti-LIFR antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic amino acids 740–896 or 1005–1063 of human gp130 or human LIFR, respectively. EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., while MBP was obtained from Sigma. DMEM, FBS, and penicillin-streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All additional supplies or materials were routinely available. The chimeric G-CSFR-gp130 (full-length (FL) and the 230, 165, 133, 109, 91, 65, and 40 truncation mutants) and -LIFR (FL and 190, 180, 150, and 140 truncation mutants, and the Δ141–151 and Δ4–70 deletion mutants) cDNA constructs have been described in detail elsewhere (21Baumann H.

The parenthesized numbers used in naming the chimeric receptor constructs correspond to the amino acid number of their full-length cytoplasmic domains, which begin at amino acid positions 620 and 860 of the mature, wild-type gp130 and LIFR polypeptides, respectively. The chimeric receptor cDNA constructs encoding LIFR(111), LIFR(121), LIFR(Y115F/FL), and gp130(Y118F/FL) were created using sequential overlap PCR (22Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1993) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates, Inc./John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar) with mutagenic oligonucleotides containing single base substitutions to produce the desired stop codons (LIFR(111) and LIFR(121)) or Tyr to Phe substitutions (LIFR(Y115F) and gp130(Y118F)). To facilitate subsequent subcloning of isolated fragments back into the parental mammalian expression vector (pDC302), the outer 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides also contained BglII restriction sites for all isolated LIFR fragments, or NsiI and SphI restriction sites, respectively, for isolated gp130(Y118F/FL) fragments. All newly generated chimeric receptor cDNA constructs were sequenced throughout their entire coding regions on an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencing system. Cos-7 cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and were maintained in a constant atmosphere of 10% CO2 at 37 °C. Upon reaching ∼60–70% confluence, the cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate/chloroquine method (22Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1993) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates, Inc./John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar) with 30 μg of total cDNA consisting of 10, 5, and 15 μg of the cDNAs encoding chimeric receptor, HA-ERK1, and carrier cDNA (empty pDC302 vector), respectively. In some experiments, the effects of coexpression of either DNRas or DNJak2 on chimeric receptor-stimulated HA-ERK1 activity was tested by transfection of Cos-7 cells as above in the absence (empty vector cDNA) or presence of either 20 μg of DNRas cDNA (35 μg of total cDNA) or 30 μg of DNJak2 cDNA (40 μg of total cDNA with 5 μg each of receptor and HA-ERK1 cDNA). Twenty-four h post-transfection, the cells were subcultured onto six-well plates, and ∼2.5 h after plating were rendered quiescent by overnight incubation at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM. Preliminary experiments designed to optimize measurable MAPK activity stimulated by either gp130 or LIFR established that transient transfection of Cos-7 cells with 10 μg of chimeric receptor cDNA and 5 μg of HA-ERK1 cDNA produced the greatest signal to noise ratios when assayed 48 h after transfection (data not shown). Stimulation of quiescent transfected Cos-7 cells was performed at 37 °C in 2 ml of serum-free DMEM containing the appropriate diluent (phosphate-buffered saline) or drug additions as indicated. After 0–60 min, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (3 ml/rinse) and were immediately lysed by addition of 500 μl of ice-cold buffer H (16Schiemann W.P. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6376-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Cell extracts were solubilized on ice for 60 min and subsequently clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of HA-ERK1 was accomplished by rotating the clarified supernatants in the presence of 5 μg of anti-hemagglutinin 12CA5 antibody and 30 μl of protein G-agarose for ∼2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered by brief centrifugation and were subsequently washed (500 μl/wash) two times in ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by two washes in ice-cold buffer H. Analysis of immunoprecipitated HA-ERK1 phosphotransferase activity was performed in a final assay volume of 40 μl containing 0.4 mg/ml MBP and 25 μl of buffer H resuspended immunocomplexes. Reactions, initiated by addition of 10 μl of 4 × assay buffer (buffer AB: final concentrations of 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.25 mm EGTA, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 2 μm PKI, 10 μm calmidazolium, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, ∼2000 cpm/pmol)), were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and were subsequently terminated by addition of 4 μl of 88% formic acid. Reaction mixtures were clarified by brief centrifugation, and were subsequently spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). Following six washes in 125 mm phosphoric acid, the dried papers were subjected to scintillation counting to determine the specific phosphorylation of MBP, which was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity measured in immunocomplexes obtained from mock-transfected cells (carrier cDNA) from those obtained from HA-ERK1-transfected cells. To control for differences in transfection efficiency, paired basal and G-CSF-stimulated HA-ERK1 activities were corrected against the MAPK activities stimulated through activation of endogenous EGF receptors present on identically transfected Cos-7 cells; cells were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with 100 ng/ml EGF. Data are presented as the mean (± S.E.) activity ratios relative to EGF of basal and G-CSF-stimulated MBP phosphorylation. In some experiments, the activity ratios were normalized to HA-ERK1 phosphotransferase activity stimulated by the relevant full-length chimeric receptor. Following initial recovery of HA-ERK1 immunocomplexes by brief centrifugation, selected supernatants were subjected to further immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C following their transfer to fresh microcentrifuge tubes containing 30 μl of protein G-agarose and 3 μl of either anti-G-CSFR, -gp130, or -LIFRα antibodies as indicated. The resulting immunocomplexes were recovered by brief centrifugation, washed twice in lysis buffer and once in buffer H (500 μl/rinse), and following their fractionation through 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins >50 kDa were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P (Millipore). After blockade of nonspecific binding sites by incubation in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin, the immunoblots were probed initially with a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies 4G10 and PY20 (1/2000 dilution each), followed by stripping and subsequent reprobing of the immunoblot with the relevant anti-receptor antibodies (1/750 dilution) as indicated. Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). The results of several recent studies of LIFR and gp130 have identified a number of cytoplasmic motifs and/or signaling modules that are required for the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, and the initiation of gene induction (8Lai C.-F.

There are also no data on the potential roles for either Jak/Tyk protein-tyrosine kinases or Ras during activation of MAPK by these receptor polypeptides. To address these questions, we transiently transfected into Cos-7 cells chimeric cytokine receptors composed of the ligand binding domain of the G-CSFR linked to the entire or various truncated cytoplasmic domains of either gp130 or LIFR, and measured their ability to stimulate the MBP phosphotransferase activity of coexpressed epitope-tagged HA-ERK1 (MAPK). Treatment of transfected Cos-7 cells with G-CSF stimulated the MBP phosphotransferase activity contained in HA-ERK1 immunocomplexes obtained from chimeric gp130 or LIFR transfectants in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Control experiments on Cos-7 transfectants expressing only epitope-tagged MAPK (i.e. no chimeric receptors) demonstrated that G-CSF treatment stimulated MAPK activity to 16.3 ± 6.8% (n = 5, S.D.) of the levels stimulated in Cos-7 cells expressing chimeric gp130 receptors. In response to saturating concentrations of G-CSF, chimeric receptor-mediated activation of MAPK activity was rapid, reaching peak levels at 10 min, and thereafter declining to basal levels by 60 min (Fig. 1 A). The magnitude of MAPK activation stimulated by chimeric LIFR was typically 70–80% of that attained by stimulation of chimeric gp130 (Fig. 1 B, data not shown). Although the reason(s) for this difference is currently unknown, its origins may arise from differences in the efficiency of dimerization induced by G-CSF to produce homodimers of gp130 or LIFR. While homodimers of LIFR are not currently known to exist naturally, signaling through chimeric LIFR is physiologically relevant because: (i) LIFR and gp130 exhibit significant homology throughout their cytoplasmic domains (27Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Bechmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), (ii) LIFR substitutes for a second molecule of gp130 during initiation of endogenous LIF receptor signaling (28Gearing D.P.

Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), (iii) gene induction mediated by chimeric LIFR is indistinguishable from that observed with gp130 (21Baumann H. Symes A.J.

U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5361-5365Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and on the surface of HeLa, HepG2, WI-26-VA4, IMTLH, SK-HEP-1, and JAR cells (17Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Having shown that chimeric gp130 and LIFR can stimulate MAPK activity in a manner similar to that of endogenous LIF receptors, we tested whether or not Jak/Tyk protein-tyrosine activity was required during activation of MAPK by these receptor polypeptides by determining the effect of overexpression of kinase-inactive DNJak2 on chimeric receptor-stimulated MAPK activity. Coexpression of DNJak was found to: (i) inhibit chimeric receptor-stimulated MAPK activity by ∼70% (Fig.2 A), (ii) attenuate cytokine-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of these receptor polypeptides (Fig.2 B), and (iii) have no effect on chimeric receptor expression levels (Fig. 2 C). These effects are specific for the gp130 and LIFR polypeptides, as expression of DNJak failed to alter the magnitude of MAPK activity stimulated through activation of the endogenous EGF receptors present on identically transfected Cos-7 cells (Fig. 2 A). These results are the first to show a link between Jak/Tyk protein-tyrosine kinase activation and the ability of the gp130 and LIFR polypeptides to stimulate MAPK activity. Additionally, the Jak/Tyk-stimulated MAPK pathway activated by either gp130 or LIFR must proceed through Ras, as coexpression of DNRas was found to eliminate completely cytokine-stimulated MAPK activation by these polypeptides (Fig. 2 D). Having established the necessity for stimulation of Jak/Tyk protein-tyrosine kinase and Ras activities during gp130- and LIFR-mediated activation of MAPK, we sought to identify cytoplasmic regions within gp130 and LIFR that are required for the stimulation of MAPK. Expression of chimeric gp130 constructs containing progressive C-terminal truncations identified a 24-amino acid region located between amino acids 109–133 that was necessary for mediating maximal stimulation of MAPK. Deletion of this region by expression of gp130 constructs truncated to position 109 or beyond significantly reduced cytokine-stimulated MAPK activity by ∼60–70% of full-length gp130-stimulated activities (Fig. 3 A). Previous work demonstrated that these chimeric receptor constructs are all expressed at similar levels (21Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Western blotting of immunoprecipitated chimeric gp130 receptors with a combination of anti-G-CSFR and -gp130 antibodies confirmed that the various chimeric gp130 receptor deletion constructs were expressed at similar levels in these experiments (data not shown). Thus, the loss of cytokine-stimulated MAPK activity is not due to differences in receptor expression, but rather to the loss of cytoplasmic residues required for maximal activation of MAPK by gp130. The 24-amino acid region between residues 109 and 133 of gp130 contains two interesting features: (i) the conserved cytokine signaling motif, box 3 (amino acids 120–129), and (ii) a YXXV tyrosine-containing module located at position 118 that has previously been shown to be necessary for gp130-mediated activation of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (24Stahl N. Rarruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Because SHP2 is known to function as an upstream regulator of MAPK activity in a variety of systems (30Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we mutated Tyr-118 to Phe and determined its effects on gp130-mediated activation of MAPK. Full-length chimeric gp130(Y118F) mutants were transiently expressed and tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to agonist in a manner indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (Fig.3 B); however, cytokine-stimulated MAPK activity was reduced (by ∼55%), but not eliminated, in cells expressing gp130(Y118F) mutants (Fig. 3 A). The finding that chimeric gp130(109) and gp130(Y118F) exhibited identical phenotypes with respect to stimulation of MAPK suggests that gp130-mediated activation of MAPK occurs independently of box 3, and requires effects at Tyr-118, most likely via tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent stimulation of SHP2, for maximal activation of MAPK activity by the receptor polypeptide. Similar to gp130, expression of chimeric LIFR constructs lacking box 3 (amino acids 136–145) retained their ability to maximally stimulate MAPK (Fig. 3 C). Previous work has demonstrated that these chimeric receptor constructs are expressed at similar levels (21Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 138-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Western blot analyses confirmed that they were expressed here at concentrations comparable to wild-type expression levels (data not shown). Truncation of chimeric LIFR from position 121 to 111 significantly reduced cytokine-stimulated MAPK activity (Fig.3 C), suggesting that this 10-amino acid region is required for maximal stimulation of MAPK by LIFR. Interestingly, this region also contains a putative SHP2 tyrosine binding site located at position Tyr-115. Although attempts to demonstrate LIFR-mediated activation of SHP2 have been unsuccessful (24Stahl N. Rarruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), expression of full-length chimeric LIFR(Y115F) mutants was found to attenuate (by ∼53%), but not eliminate, cytokine-stimulated MAPK activity (Fig. 3 C). Similar to G-CSFR-gp130(Y118F), G-CSFR-LIFR(Y115F) mutants were expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in response to agonist in a manner indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (Fig.3 D), suggesting that LIFR-mediated activation of MAPK is also independent of box 3 and occurs through effects at the putative SHP2 consensus binding site, Tyr-115. The results presented here show that gp130 and LIFR stimulate the activation of MAPK through: (i) Jak/Tyk protein-tyrosine kinase- and Ras-dependent pathways and (ii) box 3-independent mechanisms involving effects at Tyr-118 and Tyr-115, respectively, for maximal stimulation of MAPK activity by cytokine. Previous work by Stahl and colleagues (24Stahl N. Rarruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 stimulated by gp130 occurred through the tyrosine-based YXXV motif located at position 118 of the receptor polypeptide. Their results, coupled with those in the current paper, suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation at position 118 of gp130 leads to the phosphorylation and activation of SHP2 and the subsequent activation of MAPK. Although they were unable to show LIFR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP2 (24Stahl N. Rarruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), we find that mutation of the putative SHP2 binding motif (i.e. Tyr-115) within LIFR was capable of significantly inhibiting MAPK activation in response to cytokine, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-115 within LIFR, like Tyr-118 within gp130, elicits stimulation of MAPK through the activation of SHP2. Although the reason(s) for the discrepancy between their findings and those in the present study remain to be determined fully, we have found recently that coexpression of dominant-negative SHP2 blocks ∼70% of chimeric gp130- and LIFR-stimulated MAPK activity in Cos-7 cells (31Bartoe J.L. Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: A400.2Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that stimulation of MAPK by gp130 and LIFR is mediated in part through activation of SHP2. In light of this result, we were surprised to find that expression of the G-CSFR-gp130(Y118F) and G-CSFR-LIFR(Y115F) mutants failed to completely eliminate the ability of these receptor polypeptides to stimulate MAPK activity. Because cytokine-stimulated Jak/Tyk activity would be expected to lie upstream of Tyr-118 and Tyr-115 phosphorylation, expression of chimeric gp130(Y118F) or LIFR(Y115F) constructs would be predicted to produce inhibitions of cytokine-stimulated MAPK activity equaling or surpassing those produced by expression of DNJak. The finding that gp130(Y118F) and LIFR(Y115F) mutants signal more effectively to MAPK than cells expressing wild-type receptors with DNJak, suggests the presence of an additional membrane proximal signaling pathway(s) that, together with effects at Tyr-118 and Tyr-115 within gp130 and LIFR, respectively, converge at the level of Ras for maximal activation of MAPK by these polypeptides. The bifurcation in gp130 and LIFR signaling may arise at the level of the substrates for the Jak/Tyk protein-tyrosine kinases themselves. Indeed, like the receptors for growth hormone (32Souza S.C.

This kinase-IRS-1 association would have the potential of permitting activated LIF receptors to greatly amplify their intracellular signals by increasing both the quantity and the diversity of signaling molecules brought into the proximity of its activated nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases. Alternatively, the receptor for interleukin-11, a relative of LIF which also uses gp130 in its activated signaling complex (1Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Taga T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), has recently been shown to induce the formation of complexes comprising Grb2, Fyn, and Jak2 following agonist administration (36Wang X.-Y. Fuhrer D.K. Marshall M.S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27999-28002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By analogy, the finding that gp130(Y118F) and LIFR(Y115F) mutants retain the ability to stimulate, albeit to submaximal levels, the activation of MAPK activity could be explained if these polypeptides could form complexes that were comprised of Jak2-IRS-1, Jak2-Grb2-Fyn, or both, and were able to bypass the block produced by removal of SHP2 binding sites within gp130 and LIFR (i.e. still maintain stimulation of SHP2 via Jak2-generated complex formation). Finally, the results of several recent studies have established that C-terminal Ser phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 by a proline-directed protein kinase, presumably MAPK, is capable of augmenting gene induction mediated by these transcription factors (9Symes A.

Expression of G-CSFR-gp130(Y118F) mutants, which inhibit gp130-stimulated activation of MAPK by ∼55%, did not decrease cytokine-stimulated expression of either vasoactive intestinal peptide-luciferase or c-Fos-luciferase reporter genes. 2W. P. Schiemann and N. M. Nathanson, unpublished data. This lack of effect on gene induction could occur if the residual stimulation of MAPK activity by Tyr-118-deficient gp130 constructs were sufficient for maximal Ser phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins. Alternatively, Ser phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins might be mediated by a proline-directed protein kinase distinct from MAPK, a possibility supported by our earlier findings in IMR-32 cells demonstrating that induction of VIP and c-Fos by CNTF and LIF were dissociated from stimulation of Ras-coupled pathways (19Johnson J.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18856-18863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the results of this study support our earlier findings demonstrating that LIF-mediated activation of MAPK occurs through a bifurcated signaling system involving the integration of multiple signaling inputs, one of which is dependent upon the presence of PKC (16Schiemann W.P. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6376-6382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to our recent results describing the ability of activated LIF receptors to stimulate MAPK activity through both Raf-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, 3W. P. Schiemann and N. M. Nathanson, submitted for publication. we now show that maximal stimulation of MAPK activity by gp130 and LIFR is mediated through box 3-independent mechanisms involving: (i) effects at Tyr-118 and Tyr-115, respectively, for maximal stimulation of MAPK activity; and (ii) a Jak/Tyk-dependent pathway that, together with Tyr-118- or Tyr-115-generated signals, converges at the level of Ras during activation of MAPK by cytokine.

The mutant gene product blocked transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by the wild type (wt) Ptn gene product. The mutant Ptn cDNA was then introduced into human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, and clonal lines that stably express the mutant Ptn cDNA were selected. The truncated PTN was shown to form heterodimers with the endogenous Ptn gene product in these cells. Furthermore, the MDA-MB-231 cells that express the mutant Ptn gene were no longer transformed; they failed to form plaques or colonies in soft agar and were unable to form tumors in the athymic nude mouse.

The importance of PTN in malignant cell growth was first established when introduction of the exogenous Ptn gene into NIH 3T3 and NRK cells led to morphological transformation, anchorage independent growth, and tumor formation with significant neovascularizationin vivo in the nude mouse (16Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was shown subsequently that SW13 cells transformed by Ptn also develop highly vascular tumors in the flanks of athymic nude mice (9Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that high levels of the Ptn gene are expressed in specimens of many human tumors, including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and Wilms' tumor, and that many breast cancer cells and about one-fourth of over 40 human tumor cell lines of different origins also express the Ptn gene in significant levels (9Fang W.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1281-1285PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, strengthened by observations that the transformed phenotype of human melanoma cells (WM852) can be suppressed specifically by Ptn-targeted ribozymes (19Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21358-21363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), strongly support the view that PTN has a central regulatory role in neoplastic cell growth. To directly test the role of PTN in human tumor cell lines, we constructed a mutant Ptn cDNA to encode a truncated PTN designed to heterodimerize with the wt Ptngene during processing and thus to act as a dominant negative effector of PTN. In this manuscript, we establish that expression of the truncated PTN prevents transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by wt PTN and that the mutant PTN forms heterodimers with PTN itself. We then demonstrate that expression of the truncated PTN reverts the transformed phenotype of clonally selected human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells that constitutively express significant levels of the endogenousPtn gene. The results establish that high levels of expression of PTN appear to be essential to maintain the transformed phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells and that the Ptn gene may be a central regulator of the dysregulated growth of many human tumors. A 345-base pair (bp) cDNA fragment containing 111-bp 5′-untranslated sequences and the sequences to encode mouse PTN residues −32 to +40 was fused in frame with an 18-bp DNA fragment encoding 6 histidine residues and cloned into the PstI/XbaI site downstream from the pGK promoter of the eukaryotic expression vector pPGK-Neo-bpA (21Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid was designated pMMutPtn-1. The human wild type (wt) Ptn expression vector, pHuPtn, containing a full-length human Ptn cDNA fragment, was cloned into the KpnI/EcoRI site of pAGE103 vector driven by SV40 promoter as described previously (16Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues 1–40 (after cleavage of the signal peptide) of mouse and human PTN are identical, and thus the truncated PTN is equally effective in mouse and human lines. Mouse NIH 3T3 and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. 1 × 106 cells per dish were plated on 100-mm culture dishes 20 h before transfection with 15 μg of pHuPtn plus 15 μg of pBluescript II, 15 μg of pMMutPtn-1 plus 15 μg of pHuPtn, or 15 μg of the empty pAGE103 vector plus 15 μg of pBluescript II into NIH 3T3 cells as indicated, using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation technique (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected on three separate occasions with DNA from three separate extractions. The results were effectively the same. After 3 days, cells were selected with neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 700 μg/ml, and media were changed every 3 days until foci appeared. Cells from established foci were pooled and subsequently assayed by focus formation and growth in soft agar. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the Lipofectin method (23Shamah S.M. Stiles C.D. Guha A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7203-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and selected with G418 at 500 μg/ml. Media were changed every 3 days until colonies formed. These clonal cell lines were selected by mechanical agitation, expanded for later use, and designated HBC (human breast cancer) Ptn1, -2, and -3. The controls that lacked the Ptn mutant constructs (“empty” vector) were designated as HBC vector 1, 2, and 3. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium-thiocyanate method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted onto nylon membranes (Hyclon, Micron Separations, Westboro, MA), prehybridized, and hybridized with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeledSmaI fragment of mouse Ptn cDNA. After overnight hybridization, blots were washed twice with 0.5 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature and once for 20 min at 68 °C and autoradiographed with intensifying screens at −70 °C. To detect heterodimers of mutant PTN and wt PTN, clonally selected MDA-MB-231 cells that harbored pMMutPtn-1 or vector alone were lysed in 0.8 ml of cell lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 142.5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) per 100-mm dish for 30 min. After centrifugation, 25 μl of Ni-NTA Sepharose beads (Qiagen) were added to the supernatants, incubated at 4 °C for 24 h, washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST, pH 7.35), and eluted with 15–30 μl of SDS-gel loading buffer. Eluates were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), immunoblotted with an anti-histidine “tag” monoclonal antibody (1:250, Novagen), and visualized by the ECL system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To test whether the PTN mutant protein forms heterodimers with wild-type PTN of MDA-MB-231 cells, the same blot was stripped and probed with a chicken anti-human PTN antibody under the same conditions as above to establish that the human wt PTN molecule was isolated with the truncated mutant PTN using the affinity isolation technique specific for the His-tagged mutant PTN. Chicken anti-human PTN antibodies were prepared using recombinant human PTN expressed in Escherichia coli as antigen and purified as described (1Milner P.G. Li Y.S. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Siegel N.R. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is used at a dilution of 1:500. For focus formation assays, 2 × 105 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were pooled and plated in triplicate onto 60-mm dishes. Media were changed every 3 days. After 16 days, cultures were stained with crystal violet, and the foci on each dish were photographed and counted. To test anchorage-independent growth on soft agar, 5 × 104 cells from the pooled NIH 3T3 or clonally selected MDA-MB-231 cell lines were suspended in 5 ml of agar containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% calf serum or 10% fetal calf serum and were overlaid over 0.7% agar in two 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, colonies with more than 20 cells were scored as positive using an inverted microscope equipped with a measuring grid. For tumor formation, female athymic nude mice (Ner nu/nu; Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were injected subcutaneously in each flank with 2 × 106 cells from the above 6 clonally selected cell lines, and tumor size was measured daily, starting at 10 days following the injections. PTN contains 10 cysteine residues that establish intramolecular disulfide bonds (25Fabri L. Nice E.C. Ward L.D. Maruta H. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore constructed a mutant cDNA (pMMutPtn-1) to encode mouse PTN amino acid residues −32 to +40 that likely would establish non-functional heterodimers with the product of the wtPtn cDNA (wtpHuPtn) after cleavage of the signal sequence and tested the ability of the mutant cDNA product to inhibit transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by PTN. Northern blots established that the NIH 3T3 cells that were transfected with wt pHuPtn alone or with wt pHuPtn and pMMutPtn-1 expressed both genes at essentially equal levels (data not shown). Cells that were co-transfected with wt pHuPtn and pMMutPtn-1 together were normal in appearance and growth rate. The growth characteristics and appearance of these cells did not differ from cells transfected with the empty vector or from non-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, cells transfected with the wt HuPtn construct alone were typically transformed; they had a higher growth rate and were clustered, highly refractile, and spindle-shaped in appearance. At confluence, these cells grew to a density ∼2-fold higher than the cells co-transfected with the wt HuPtn and pMMutPtn-1 plasmids together or cells co-transfected with the empty vector alone. Cells that were transfected with the wt HuPtn construct had readily detected foci after 16 days. However, the number of foci was dramatically reduced in NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with both the wt HuPtn and pMMutPtn-1 constructs as scored in Table I. However, when lysates were prepared from the foci that developed from cells that were co-transfected with wt and mutant Ptn constructs and analyzed in Northern blots, transcripts of the exogenous Ptn mutant gene were not detected (data not shown), indicating that the mutant gene was not expressed at detectable levels. Although these foci were scored as observed, a (0) was placed after the number of foci observed in Table Ito indicate that in the foci examined by Northern blots, the mutantPtn transcripts were not detected; it is presumed that these foci arose from clonally selected cells that express the neomycin resistance gene and the wt Ptn cDNA but failed to express the mutant Ptn cDNA.Table IMMutPtn blocks focus formation and anchorage-independent growth of NIH 3T3 cells transfected by wt PtnExpression plasmidFoci per dishColonies in soft agar assay (% total)pAGE103 vector alone∼40wt pHuPtn∼275∼6wt pHu/Ptn/pMMutPtn-1∼79 (0)∼2.5 (0)NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with wt pHuPtnexpression vector, wt pHuPtn plus pMMutPtn-1, and pAGE103 alone as described above and grown in the presence of G418 for 3 weeks. To assay focus formation, 2 × 105 pooled, stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells were plated in triplicate onto 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, the number of foci on each dish was counted. To assay anchorage-independent growth, 5 × 104 pooled cells were plated in soft agar in 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, colonies with more than 20 cells were scored as positive. Open table in a new tab NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with wt pHuPtnexpression vector, wt pHuPtn plus pMMutPtn-1, and pAGE103 alone as described above and grown in the presence of G418 for 3 weeks. To assay focus formation, 2 × 105 pooled, stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells were plated in triplicate onto 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, the number of foci on each dish was counted. To assay anchorage-independent growth, 5 × 104 pooled cells were plated in soft agar in 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, colonies with more than 20 cells were scored as positive. In soft agar assays, expression of the mutant Ptn gene also effectively prevented transformation by the wt Ptn gene (Table I). When colonies that arose from the clonally selected cells transfected with both wt Ptn and mutant PtncDNAs were analyzed by Northern blots as above, in no instance were transcripts of the mutant Ptn cDNA detected. These colonies were scored as observed; the (0) following the number of colonies indicates that in the colonies tested, none expressed the mutant Ptn cDNA in detectable levels. The data suggest that the truncated PTN product of pMMutPtn-1 functions as a true dominant negative effector of PTN and establish that PTN-dependent transformation in both focus and colonary formation assays is effectively prevented by expression of the Ptn mutant cDNA to encode PTN residues 1–40. MDA-MB-231 cells are derived from a highly malignant human breast cancer and constitutively express the endogenous Ptn gene in high levels (9Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), raising the important question whether the endogenous Ptn gene and the PTN signaling pathway have an important regulatory role in the aggressive growth of these cells. To test the mutant Ptngene construct in this highly transformed cell line, we introduced pMMutPtn-1 into MDA-MB-231 cells and isolated, expanded, and analyzed G418-resistant clones by Northern blots (Fig.1 A). The exogenous Ptn mRNA (∼1.0 kilobase) is easily differentiated from the endogenousPtn mRNA (−1.5 kilobases). Clones HBC Ptn-1 and HBC Ptn-2 express high levels of the mutantPtn gene whereas it was not detected in HBC Ptn-3 or in cell lines that harbor the pGK-Neo-pbA vector alone (HBC vectors 1, 2, and 3). Since the mouse PTN mutant protein was fused with a six-histidine “tag” at its C terminus, the mutant protein is readily detected with a His-tag monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig.1 B, only HBC Ptn-1 and HBC Ptn-2 expressed the mutant PTN protein. Clones transfected with the neomycin resistance gene alone and clone HBC Ptn-3, which failed to express the mutant Ptn gene, also failed to express the protein in Western blots probed with the anti-6× histidine tag monoclonal antibody. All six of the clonally selected, stably transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were expanded and placed in soft agar. Cells harboring pMMutPtn-1 and pMMutPtn-2 formed substantially fewer colonies in soft agar (Table II). These colonies also were substantially smaller than colonies of HBC Ptn-3 in soft agar. The results indicate that the dominant negative PTN effector greatly attenuates focus formation and anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 cells and suggest that the PTN signaling pathway has an important and perhaps essential regulatory role in the ability of these human tumor cells to sustain the transformed phenotype.Table IIMMutPTN 1–40 reverses colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cell lines in soft agar assay and prevents tumor formation in the nude mouseStably transfected MDA-MB-231 cell lineColonies in soft agar assayTumor size% cells seededmm 2HBCPtn-1∼0.810 ± 4HBCPtn-2∼0.7515 ± 8HBCPtn-3∼8.565 ± 12HBC vector 1∼8.270 ± 8HBC vector 2∼7.968 ± 10HBC vector 3∼8.161 ± 14MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the Ptn mutant constructs and vector alone as a control.

After 16 days, colonies with greater than 20 cells were scored as positive. Four animals per group were injected with 2 × 106 cells/site. Tumors were measured 6 weeks after injection of cells. Tumor size was calculated as the product of two perpendicular diameters (in mm2) of tumors and were analyzed statistically. Open table in a new tab MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the Ptn mutant constructs and vector alone as a control. Transfectants were selected with G418 until colony formation was observed. Drug-resistant clonal cell lines were established that expressed high levels of thePtn mutant gene product (HBC Ptn-1 and HBCPtn-2), failed to express the mouse Ptn mutant gene product (HBC Ptn-3), or expressed the vector alone (HBC vector 1, HBC vector 2, and HBC vector 3) and expanded and seeded at 2 × 105 cells/cell line in triplicate into 60-mm dishes. After 16 days, colonies with greater than 20 cells were scored as positive. Four animals per group were injected with 2 × 106 cells/site. Tumors were measured 6 weeks after injection of cells. Tumor size was calculated as the product of two perpendicular diameters (in mm2) of tumors and were analyzed statistically. The clones that stably express mutant PTN-(1–40) were also tested for their ability to form tumors in the nude mouse. The two clones that expressed the mutant PTN-(1–40) protein at high levels (HBCPtn-1 and HBC Ptn-2) were compared with HBCPtn-3 cells and with cells expressing vector alone (HBC vector 1, 2, and 3); after 6 weeks, tumors at the sites of injection of MDA-MB-231 cells that express mutant PTN-(1–40) were strikingly smaller than tumors in animals injected with control MDA-MB-231 cells that stably express the neomycin gene alone (Table II). These results indicate that the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to form tumors in vivo in the nude mouse is markedly attenuated by the dominant negative PTN effector. The results confirm the results of the tumorigenic assays in soft agar and argue strongly that in MDA-MB-231 cells, PTN has a central regulatory role in maintaining the transformed phenotype in vivo. Fully processed PTN is a monomer with internal cysteine residues −15 and −44, −23 and −53, −30 and −57, −67 and −99, and −77 and −109 linked as disulfide bonds (25Fabri L. Nice E.C. Ward L.D. Maruta H. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Biochem. Int. 1992; 28: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative cDNA construct was designed to encode residues −32 to +40. There are 3 cysteine residues (+15, +23, +30) in the truncated PTN product; it was anticipated that these residues would dimerize with the wt Ptn gene product during processing. To determine if the mutant PTN protein establishes heterodimers with wt PTN in MDA-MB-231 cells that stably express the mutant Ptngene, cell lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA to “capture” the His-tagged PTN mutant, and eluates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting with chicken polyclonal anti-human PTN antibodies. 2N. Zhang, R. Zhong, Z.-Y. Wang, and T. F. Deuel, unpublished data. The chicken polyclonal anti-human PTN antibody recognized the endogenous (wt) PTN in lanes in which lysates of HBC clones Ptn-1 and Ptn-2 were analyzed (Fig. 2). When the membranes used in Western blotting were stripped and reprobed with the anti-His tag antisera, the truncated PTN (data not shown) was recognized as well, indicating that the Ni-NTA captured both the mutant His-tagged truncated PTN and the wt PTN together. As anticipated, endogenous (wt) PTN was not “captured” with the His-tagged PTN mutant in lysates of HBCPtn-3 or lysates of the control HBC vector 1, 2, and 3 cells, suggesting that the Ni-NTA column effectively captured the His-tagged mutant PTN as a heterodimer with wt PTN. These results thus indicate that the His-tagged mutant PTN-(1–40) associates with wt PTN to form heterodimers in MDA-MB-231 cells and suggest that the mechanism of the dominant negative effect of the truncated PTN-(1–40) is the formation of non-functional heterodimers with wt PTN. The data demonstrate that the mutant Ptn cDNA to encode PTN residues −32 to +40 functions as a dominant negative effector of wt PTN. The mutant PTN-(1–40) effectively prevents transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by wt PTN and effectively reverses the malignant phenotype of the human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line that constitutively expresses high levels of the endogenousPtn gene. Finally, the data establish that mutant PTN-(1–40) forms heterodimers with wt PTN, suggesting that the mechanism of the dominant negative effect of PTN-(1–40) is to establish non-functional complexes presumably through disulfide interactions with wt PTN during processing. Because Mdk retains perfect conservation of cysteine residues with PTN (3Li Y.S. Milner P.G. Chauhan A.K. Watson M.A. Hoffman R.M. Kodner C.M. Milbrandt J. Deuel T.F. Science. 1990; 250: 1690-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), it may also be possible for Mdk to heterodimerize with the truncated PTN and be inactivated through heterodimerization. To further establish the specificity of the mutant PTN for PTN itself in MDA-MB-231 cells, Northern blots were prepared and Mdk transcripts were not found (data not shown). This result is consistent with published experiments that established a negative correlation of the levels of expression of the Mdkgene as rat mammary tumors progress in malignancy (26Chen Y. McKenzie K.E. Aldaz C.M. Sukumar S. Mol. Carcinogen. 1996; 17: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The most important conclusion of this work is the dependence of a highly malignant human breast cancer cell line on the constitutive high expression of PTN and PTN-mediated signal transduction to maintain the transformed phenotype in culture and in vivo. The ability to block transformation with the dominant negative mutant suggests a central role of the PTN signaling system in tumorigenesis and supports the contention that this signaling system may be a major regulator of neoplastic transformation in the highly malignant MDA-MD-231 human breast cancer cell line. The results suggest that expression of thePtn gene and its signaling pathway in appropriately high levels may play a crucial regulatory role in many neoplasms of diverse origins. This potentially highly important regulatory role of PTN in transformation is consistent with previous results that established that the Ptn gene itself directly transforms NIH 3T3 cells (16Chauhan A.K. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and that a Ptn ribozyme construct reverses transformation of human melanoma cells in culture (19Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A.

https://openalex.org/W1997409891,"Human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize specific complexes of HLA class I molecules and peptides, which assemble when nascent class I molecules bind peptides transported from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum by the heterodimeric transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Increased class I molecule expression on the cell surface increases the efficiency of CTL lysis. The kinetics of interferon (IFN)-gamma induction of TAP, peptide transport capacity, and HLA class I molecule expression was determined in endothelial cells, which are targets of CTL following transplantation or viral infection. TAP mRNAs are induced rapidly, increasing 20-fold (TAP1) or 10-fold (TAP2) by 12 h, whereas HLA class I mRNA is induced more slowly, increasing 10-fold in 24 h. TAP1 and TAP2 proteins are also induced rapidly, increasing 10-fold in 24 h, whereas HLA class I heavy chain proteins and surface expression increase more slowly. Peptide transport capacity in endothelial and HeLa cells increases within 6 h of IFN-gamma treatment, suggesting that the IFN-gamma-induced TAP heterodimers are functional. Therefore, the IFN-gamma-induced increase in TAP proteins is accompanied by an increased peptide transport capacity, which may be important in supporting the subsequent rise in HLA class I protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2066431883,"Immunostimulants trigger vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to express both the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) and argininosuccinate synthetase (AS). With constitutively expressed argininosuccinate lyase (AL), AS confers cells with an Arg/Cit cycle that can sustain NO production via continuous regeneration of the NOS substrate, l-arginine (Arg), from the NOS coproduct, l-citrulline (Cit). To assess whether NO synthesis can be rate-limited by Arg recycling, we tested whether AS-overexpressing cells have an enhanced capacity for immununostimulant-induced NO synthesis. Rat VSMC were stably transfected with human AS cDNA in a eukaryotic cell expression vector, driven by a strong viral promoter. AS activity in transfected VSMC exceeded that induced in untransfected cells treated for 24 h with a combination of bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ (LPS/IFN). AS activity was predominantly associated with membranes but was also found in cytosol. Recombinant AS was purified from cytosol and possessed a specific activity exceeding that reported for native AS. Western blotting verified the basal expression of AS antigen in membranes from untreated AS-transfected VSMC and from untransfected VSMC after 24 h exposure to LPS/IFN. Epifluorescence histochemistry revealed a punctate distribution of AS antigen in transfected cells, consistent with a predominant membrane localization. Remarkably, on a per cell basis, LPS/IFN-induced NO production was 3–4-fold greater in AS-transfected cells than untransfected VSMC. In untransfected VSMC, maximal NO production during 48 h required millimolar Arg; notably, Cit was needed at ≈3-fold higher concentrations than Arg for a comparable NO synthesis rate. In contrast, AS-transfected VSMC utilized Arg and Cit equi-effectively and at much lower concentrations; 100 μm of either precursor supported a maximal rate of NO synthesis for 48 h. The enhanced ability of AS-transfected cells to produce NO, compared with untransfected cells, could not be ascribed to differences in iNOS protein content or LPS/IFN potency for immunoactivation. We conclude that transfection with AS provides a continuous flux of Arg which drives NO synthesis in immunoactivated VSMC. Arg regeneration by AS is rate-limiting to NO synthesis and apparently provides iNOS with a preferred cellular source of Arg. In accord with the reported “channeling” of substrates by urea cycle enzymes, we hypothesize that the Arg/Cit cycle sequesters a discrete pool of recyclable substrate that sustains high-output NO synthesis.

Nitric oxide is a cell signaling gas with diverse functions and global importance to mammalian cell physiology (1Sadrzadeh S.M. Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). NO synthases (NOS, 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; AS, argininosuccinate synthetase; AL, argininosuccinate lyase; iNOS, the high-output inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFN, interferon-γ PCR, polymerase chain reaction; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; Arg,l-arginine; Cit, l-citrulline; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. EC 1.14.13.39) catalyze two sequential oxygenations of l-arginine (Arg), producing stoichiometric amounts of NO and l-citrulline (Cit) (2Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu Rev Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All nucleated mammalian cells have the capacity for high-output NO production upon transcription of the gene that encodes inducible NOS (iNOS). While the iNOS gene lies dormant in cells at rest, iNOS transcription can be initiated by various immunostimulants, cytokines, and growth factors (3Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In macrophages, iNOS-derived NO appears to be a major weapon in the arsenal of molecules that mediate host defense (1Sadrzadeh S.M. Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inappropriate expression of iNOS mediates a variety of pathophysiological conditions caused by NO excess (4Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar),e.g. iNOS induction in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) has been implicated in the genesis of lethal septic shock (5Kilbourn R.G. Griffith O.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 84: 827-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Appreciation of the factors that control iNOS activity should provide a rationale for the design of therapeutics that effectively limit pathophysiological NO overproduction. Inasmuch as high-output NO synthesis requires a continuous supply of substrate, it is important to identify where and how this Arg originates. Possible sources of cellular Arg include uptake from plasma, intracellular protein degradation, and de novobiosynthesis from Cit. Although de novo biosynthesis of Arg in ureotelic organisms is accomplished principally by the kidney, and to a lesser extent the small intestine (6Morris Jr., S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Takiguchi M. Mori M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it has become clear that other tissues can also produce Arg from Cit. Biosynthesis of Arg requires two enzymes, argininosuccinate synthetase (AS, EC 6.3.4.5) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL, EC 4.3.2.1), that together catalyze the conversion of Cit, l-aspartate, and ATP to Arg, fumarate, AMP, and pyrophosphate. AS and AL are typically considered in the context of their contribution to the five-enzyme urea cycle of liver; however, in conjunction with NOS, these enzymes endow cells with an Arg/Cit cycle that can continually regenerate Arg from Cit for sustained NO production (8Hattori Y. Campbell E.B. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, Arg production from Cit has been observed in endothelial cells, which basally produce NO, and has been shown to increase as a function of NO synthesis rate (9Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We reported earlier that along with iNOS, immunostimulants synergistically induce VSMC to express AS mRNA and activity (8Hattori Y. Campbell E.B. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9405-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing for NO synthesis from Cit in the absence of extracellular arginine. Induction of AS is rate-limiting to Arg synthesis in VSMC, since AL mRNA and activity were found to be constitutively expressed. Notably, AS is also the rate-limiting enzyme of the urea cycle (6Morris Jr., S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similar induction by immunostimulants of AS mRNA and activity, and constitutive expression of AL, were also found in murine macrophages (10Nussler A.K. Billiar T.R. Liu Z.-Z. Morris Jr., S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1257-1261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human pancreatic β-cells (11Flodstrom M. Niemann A. Bedoya F.J. Morris Jr., S.M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3200-3206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in culture. Coinduction of AS and iNOS has more recently been shown in vivo in spleen, heart, and lung of LPS-treated rats (12Hattori Y. Shimoda S. Gross S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Nagasaki A. Gotoh T. Takeya M. Yu Y. Takiguchi M. Matsuzaki H. Takatsuki K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2658-2662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast with in vitro findings, AL expression was also observed to be up-regulated by LPS in vivo. These findings suggest that together AS and AL play a special function in providing substrate for high-output NO synthesis. The present study was performed to investigate whether the availability of AS may limit NO synthesis in VSMC. Toward this end, we engineered VSMC to overexpress human AS and examined how this impacted on immunostimulant-induced NO synthase activity and substrate preference. While it is predictable that AS-overexpressing cells would more efficiently produce NO from Cit, it is remarkable that maximal NO production from Arg was also increased 3–4-fold on a per cell basis. This suggests that the Arg/Cit cycle provides the preferred source of Arg for NO synthesis by VSMC and can be rate-limiting to high-output NO production. Human AS cDNA, kindly provided by Drs. William O'Brien and Gerald Petajunas (Baylor College of Medicine), served as template for PCR amplification. Primers used were as follows: AS forward 24-mer (created to contain an EcoRV site), 5′-ATCCCAGACGATATCTCCAGCAAAGGC-3′ AS reverse 23-mer (created to contain a SalI site), 5′-CTCATTGTCGACGGGTCTATTTGG-3′. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed according to the following schedule: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV-induced fluorescence. This resulted in the amplification of a single product of the predicted size for human AS (1266 base pairs) that was ligated into the TA3 pCR™ vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into competent DH5α Escherichia coli. Successful subcloning of the PCR product was confirmed by restriction analysis of purified plasmid DNA (Wizard Minipreps, Promega). AS cDNA was then subcloned from the TA3 pCR™ plasmid into pMAL-P2 (New England Biolabs) to enable high level bacterial expression of AS as a fusion with maltose-binding protein. The pMAL-P2 plasmid was cut with bothXmnI and SalI, and the AS DNA/TA3 pCR™ plasmid was cut with both EcoRV and SalI. Cut plasmids were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose, purified, ligated overnight at 16 °C, and transformed into DH5α E. coli. pMAL-P2/AS plasmid DNA was purified (Wizard Minipreps, Promega), sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method, and found to be >99% identical to that for human AS cDNA (22Su T.-S. Bock H.-G.O. O'Brien W.E. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11826-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Observed nucleotide differences from the reported human cDNA were three, an A to G substitution at nucleotide 410 and substitution of CT for AC at nucleotides 1050–1051. A clone harboring the pMAL-P2/AS plasmid was inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cultures were incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, and pellets were stored at −20 °C until use. For AS purification, the stored pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of TEND buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) which was supplemented with 1 mm citrulline, 1 mm aspartate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then subjected to two cycles of freezing at −70 °C and thawing at 37 °C. Sodium chloride was added to final concentration 1 m, and samples were lysed using a Branson sonicator. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were applied to a 5-ml column of amylose resin (New England Biolabs) that had been previously equilibrated with TEND buffer. The column was washed with 25 ml of TEND buffer two times. Finally, the column was eluted with 50 ml of 10 mm maltose in TEND buffer containing 1 mm citrulline and 1 mm aspartate. SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining revealed a predominant protein band which was of predicted size for the AS-fusion protein; this identity was confirmed by factor Xa cleavage (4 °C for 3 h, using factor Xa at a 1% w/w ratio with fusion protein), yielding two fragments of the predicted sizes. The products of factor Xa cleavage were separated by ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography using a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and a NaCl gradient as follows: 100% buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm aspartate, 1 mm citrulline) for 0–5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% buffer B (buffer A containing 25 mm NaCl) from 5 to 35 min. Purified AS eluted as a discrete peak at 24 min and gave a single protein band of ≈46 kDa on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from thoracic aorta explants of Fisher rats and grown as described previously (14Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in passage 8–12 were seeded and grown to confluence in 96-well plates for nitrite assay or in 75-cm2 culture flasks for preparation of extracts for AS activity measurements. For transfection, cells in passage 4–6 were seeded and grown to 50% confluence in 6-well plates. Human AS cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of a cDNA encoding AS preceded by six N-terminal histidine residues and containing convenient restriction sites for ligation into the cytomegalovirus promoter-driven mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Primers for PCR were as follows: AS forward 49-mer (containing a BamHI site and His-Tag sequence), 5-CGGGATCCACGATGCACCACCACCACCACCACATGTCCAGCAAAGGCTC-3′ AS reverse 25-mer (containing an EcoR V site), 5′-CCAGCCGGGGATATCAAGTCACAAT-3′. Both the PCR product and pcDNA3 plasmid were digested with BamHI and EcoRV, purified, and ligated at 16 °C overnight. The resulting AS/pcDNA3 was transformed into DH5α E. coli. Plasmid DNA was purified from a positive clone for nucleotide sequencing and transfection into rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Sequencing revealed identity of the insert with that in our AS-pMAL-P2 plasmid (described above), encoding a predicted protein having >99% amino acid identity to human AS (22Su T.-S. Bock H.-G.O. O'Brien W.E. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11826-11831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection of VSMC was performed using 15 μg of AS/pcDNA3, 52.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 500 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). While mixing the plasmid/LipofectAMINE mixture by inversion for 30 min, a plate of cells was twice washed with Opti-MEM and incubated with an additional 5 ml of Opti-MEM. The plasmid/LipofectAMINE mixture was then added to the cells and incubated for 6 h, followed by replacement with unmodified cell culture medium. After 48 h, G418 was added at a concentration of 500 μg/ml to initiate selection of stably transfected/resistant cells; culture medium was replaced at 2–3-day intervals. Approximately 3 weeks later, G418-resistant clones were isolated using an 8 × 8-mm cloning cylinder and analyzed individually for expression of AS activity. His6-AS protein was purified from a cell pellet prepared from 60 confluent T-75 flasks of a VSMC clone that was found to be positive for AS activity. The purification was performed using His-bind resin, according to the manufacturer's (Novagen) protocol. The purified and concentrated AS/maltose-binding protein fusion was used to develop polyclonal antibodies in each of two rabbits. Fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant was injected intradermally into four dorsal sites (50 μg/injection) in each rabbit. After 28 days the animals were boosted by intradermal injection of an additional 100 μg of fusion protein in incomplete adjuvant and thereafter boosted by subcutaneous injection of 50 μg of protein at 14-day intervals. Commencing at week 8, animals were bled every 2 weeks from a marginal ear vein. Serum was separated from the clotted blood and stored at −20 °C until use. Antibody titer was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and specificity for AS was established by Western blot analysis. Cells were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with a Teflon cell scraper into an additional 10 ml of iced phosphate-buffered saline. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and pelleted cells from five 75-cm2 culture flasks were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold distilled H2O containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in a 37 °C water bath. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the pellets were discarded. The resulting supernatants were recentrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min; this pellet provided the membrane fraction, and the supernatant, after a further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, provided the cytosolic fraction. Both fractions were immediately assayed for AS activity. Protein was measured by the Bio-Rad dye binding assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as standard. After the protein concentrations of both cell cytosol and membrane samples were determined, they were added 1:1 with 2 × SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and incubated for 10 min at 95 °C (Novex). Samples were then normalized for protein content and applied to lanes for SDS-PAGE on 8–16% gradient gels (Novex). Proteins were transferred by electroelution onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm, Trans-Blot medium, Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis of AS expression was performed using polyclonal AS antiserum from rabbit, at a dilution of 1: 1,000. Immunoreactive bands were detected by sequential incubation in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3,000), streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (1:3,000, Life Technologies, Inc.), and the chemiluminescent 1,2-dioxytene substrate, CSPD® (Tropix). Western blotting to demonstrate iNOS protein in VSMC cytosol was similar to the above, except that rabbit antibody was to iNOS holoprotein (Upstate Biotechnology) and used at 1:3,000 dilution. Binding of alkaline phosphatase-coupled second antibody was visualized using a chromogenic substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium; Life Technologies, Inc.). AS activity was assayed using each of two techniques. The first was based on the conversion of [3H]aspartate to [3H]argininosuccinate, as described by O'Brien (15O'Brien W.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5353-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with the exception that [3H]aspartate was present at a concentration of 400 μm. Each reaction mixture contained (final concentration) citrulline (5 mm), Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.5), ATP (0.1 mm), MgCl2 (6 mm), KCl (20 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (1.5 mm), pyruvate kinase (4.5 units), myokinase (4 units), and pyrophosphatase (0.2 units) in a final volume of 150 μl. Reactions were incubated in glass test tubes and allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C, before enzyme activity was terminated with addition of 50 μl of 1 macetic acid and heating for 30 min at 90 °C. Following this procedure, 800 μl of distilled H2O was added to incubates, and the contents were applied to 0.5 × 4-cm columns of Dowex 1-X8 (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) in 0.05 m acetic acid. An additional 2 × 1 ml of 0.05 m acetic acid was then applied to the columns. Radioactivity in the column flow-through, reflecting [3H]argininosuccinate, was added to In-Flow BD liquid scintillant (IN/US Systems Inc.) and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Additionally, purified AS activity was assessed by measuring the formation of inorganic phosphate by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (36Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), as previously adapted to the 96-well microtiter plate format (37Sadrzadeh S.M.H. Vincenzi F.F. Hinds T.R. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 1993; 30: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Incubation mixtures were identical to above, except they were scaled to 100 μl total volume, the ATP concentration was increased to 300 μm, and the ATP regenerating system was omitted (i.e. phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and myokinase). Nitrite was used as an indicator of cellular NO synthesis, as described previously (16Gross S.S. Stuehr D.J. Aisaka K. Jaffe E.A. Levi R. Griffith O.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For experiments that assessed the dependence of NO production on citrulline or arginine concentration, cells were washed twice with serum-free and Arg-free RPMI 1640 cell culture medium and then incubated for 24 h with the same medium containing the desired concentration of test agents. In all other experiments, RPMI containing 10% newborn calf serum and standard levels of Arg (200 mg/liter) was used. The accumulation of nitrite in the cell culture medium was quantified colorimetrically after adding 100 μl of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% naphthalenediamine in 5% o-phosphoric acid) to an equal volume of sample. For immunofluorescence studies, rat aortic smooth muscle cells, stably-transfected with human AS, were grown on glass microscope slide chambers (Costar). Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with neutral buffered 4% paraformaldehyde and washed 3 times with Ca2+/Mg2+-containing HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.5; HBS). Cells were then permeabilized, and nonspecific binding was blocked by treatment for 2 h with 0.075% saponin in HBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After an additional wash in HBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1:500 AS antiserum, diluted in HBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.075% saponin. Cells were washed 3 times in HBS and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector Labs) in HBS/bovine serum albumin. After a final 3 washes in HBS, cells were washed in distilled H2O and coverslipped with glycerol-based mountant (Vectorshield, Vector Labs). Antibody binding was visualized by epifluorescence using an Olympus BX-60 microscope and a U-MWB fluorescence filter cube. Rat recombinant IFN-γ, RPMI culture medium, and cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Aspartic acid was purchased from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. (specific activity = 40 Ci/mmol). Factor Xa was from New England Biolabs. Enzymes, LPS (E. coli serotype 0111:B4), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Calbiochem. AS protein was previously isolated from human (15O'Brien W.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5353-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Kimball M.E. Jacoby L.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), bovine (18Rochovansky O. Kodowaki H. Ratner S. J. Biol.

Beaudet A.L. O'Brien W.E. Genomics. 1989; 5: 442-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on cDNA cloning, the predicted polypeptide sequence is 412 amino acids and 46.4 kDa (22Su T.-S.

To obtain large quantities of human AS for antibody development and to confirm functionality of the recombinant protein, we sought to express AS in bacteria. Although AS has previously been purified after overexpression in bacteria, it was not recovered in a catalytically active state (23Yu Y. Terada K. Nagasaki A. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 952-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). AS was directionally cloned into pMAL-P2 in an orientation that would result in the N terminus of AS fused to the C terminus of maltose-binding protein. Relative to the reported human AS cDNA, the plasmid we constructed was found to contain an A to G substitution at nucleotide 410 and a substitution of CT for AC at nucleotides 1050–1051. These nucleotide changes are non-conservative, resulting in predicted differences in amino acid sequence from that reported for human AS: Lys112 to Glu and Leu325-Arg326 to Phe-Trp. Although Lys112 is conserved in human, rat, murine, and bovine AS cDNA, it is notable that Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Streptomyces lavendulae, and E. coli each have a different amino acid at the corresponding position (Phe, Gln, and Asn, respectively). Thus, although conserved in mammals, a basic residue in this position is not a requirement for AS activity. Substitution in human AS of Phe-Trp for Leu325-Arg326 is also consistent with enzymatic activity. Indeed, sequence alignment reveals that rat, mouse, and bovine AS sequences each have Phe-Trp at the corresponding sites. Therefore, the reported Leu325-Arg326 sequence in human AS cDNA is the exception, rather than the rule. This Phe-Trp is partially conserved in AS cDNAs from S. cerevisiae, S. lavendulae, and E. coli AS cDNAs, which encode Phe-Leu, Arg-Trp, and Arg-Trp, respectively. Thus, the sequence we observed at this site makes our predicted enzyme identical with that from three other mammalian isoforms and more closely in agreement with more evolutionarily divergent species. Since all other nucleotides in our human AS-containing plasmids were common to human rather than rodent AS cDNA, we are confident that we have not inadvertently amplified from rodent template cDNA. This substitution could conceivably represent a correction to the previously reported sequence or perhaps results from human gene pleiotropy. E. coli harboring the AS/pMAL-P2 plasmid expressed the predicted 89.1-kDa fusion protein to an extent of 10–20% total cellular protein (estimated from Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE). A single step purification on amylose resin gave near-homogeneous AS/MBP (>90% purity; see Fig. 1 A, lane 1), the most prominent contaminant being free MBP. Yields of 10–15 mg of purified fusion protein were obtained per liter of culture broth. The purified AS/MBP fusion protein was found to be catalytically active, as indicated by Fig. 1 B. While the specific activity of the preparation described in Fig. 1 B was 5.4 μmol/mg/h, other preparations ranged in activity to 11.9 μmol/mg/h (based on the initial rate of AS formation). Considering that the fusion protein is ≈50% AS by weight, the specific activity of AS/MBP fusion protein was 20–40% that observed with AS purified from a human lymphoblast cell line (17Kimball M.E. Jacoby L.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in lane 2 of Fig. 1 A, cleavage of AS/MBP by treatment with factor Xa yielded a mixture of free AS (46.4 kDa) and MBP (42.7 kDa). Subsequent purification of free AS on Mono Q resin was performed using f"
https://openalex.org/W2010618176,"We describe a novel promoter for E. coli RNA polymerase that functions efficiently only in the form of single-stranded DNA. Derived from the leading region of F plasmid, single-stranded F rpo sequence directs RNA polymerase to initiate transcription at a specific site within F rpo, and this specific transcription is highly stimulated by SSB. Prior denaturation activates transcription from otherwise inactive duplex DNA containing F rpo. Since RNAs synthesized on SSB-coated single-stranded F rpo are efficiently elongated into DNA chains by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, transcription at F rpo serves also for priming DNA replication. A mode of recognition by RNA polymerase of a unique secondary structure within F rpo is proposed, and possible roles of this novel single-stranded promoter in expression and replication during conjugal transfer of F plasmid are discussed."

Rifkind B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Part of this protection may be attributed to the participation of HDL in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, a mechanism which reduces the accumulation of cholesterol in the arterial wall and the narrowing which subsequently occurs (2Reichl D. Miller N.E. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 785-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent evidence would indicate that HDL influences many other biological events in a manner consistent with a protective function, suggesting that the antiatherogenic role of HDL is likely to be complex. HDL may have antioxidant and antithrombotic properties (3Tribble D.L. Chu B.M. Gong E.L. van Venrooij F. Nichols A.V. J.

Despite these observations, the mechanism(s) responsible for the HDL-induced physiological effects remain enigmatic. The fact that HDL binds to a variety of cells with varying degrees of specificity has invited speculation about the existence of an HDL receptor. Our laboratory (8Tozuka M. Fidge N. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and others (9Bond H.M. Morrone G. Venuta S. Howell K.E. Biochem.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have purified liver cellular HDL-binding proteins, thereby strengthening the evidence for the existence of HDL receptor(s) that may have important functions as determinants of HDL metabolism. To date, only SR-B1, a member of the scavenger receptor class of membrane proteins that binds LDL, modified LDL and HDL, has been shown to elicit a physiological response,viz. the transfer of cholesteryl ester into cells, particularly in steroidogenic tissues (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). We have identified two liver plasma membrane proteins named HB1 and HB2 (HDL-binding proteins 1 and 2) which are candidate HDL receptors (8Tozuka M. Fidge N. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Hidaka H. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although present in low abundance, HB2 was purified in sufficient quantities to provide amino acid sequence data. This paper describes the subsequent cloning of HB2, its complete amino acid sequence, and evidence for increased binding of HDL to HB2 in cells overexpressing HB2. HepG2, COS, CHO, and THP-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained under standard tissue culture conditions using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for HepG2 and COS, α-minimal essential medium for CHO cells, and RPMI 1640 medium for THP-1 cells, plus 10% fetal bovine serum. THP-1 cells were differentiated into adherent macrophages by treatment with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 72 h. Human HDL3(d 1.12–1.21 g/ml) was obtained from plasma as described previously and contained apoAI and apoAII but no apoE (8Tozuka M. Fidge N. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HDL3 was radioiodinated using IODOBEADS (Pierce) to specific activities ranging from 150–210 cpm/ng of protein. HDL3 was also labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (13Pieters M.N. Schouten D. Bakkeren H.F. Esbach B. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Biochem J. 1991; 280: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, HDL3 was incubated with donor particles containing egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether, and lipoprotein-deficient serum (d > 1.21 g/ml) as a source of cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer protein for 6 h at 37 °C, and the HDL was then separated from donor particles by ultracentrifugation at 1.06 g/ml. HDL3 was labeled with [14C]CE by incubating ad > 1.12 g/ml (dialyzed) fraction of human plasma (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase source) with [14C]cholesterol (Amersham). The CE-labeled HDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation at d 1.21 g/ml and dialyzed. HB2, a glycoprotein ofM r 100,000 was purified from rat liver plasma membrane as described previously (12Hidaka H. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Attempts at NH2-terminal sequencing were unsuccessful. Internal sequences were obtained following cleavage with an endoproteinase (Lys C) using an enzyme substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w). Peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography using an RP300 column (30-min gradient of acetonitrile from 0–60%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase. This approach produced low yields and limited sequence information. Better yields were obtained following digestion of HB2 with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) for 16 h at room temperature. The CNBr fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to Problott membranes (Applied Biosystems), and the peptides were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. Bands on Problott membranes were excised, cut into pieces, and applied directly to the cartridge of an Applied Biosystems Model 470A sequencer equipped with an on-line Model 120A PTH analyzer. Sequences, ranging from 11 to 20 amino acid residues, were obtained from several peptides. Total RNA was prepared from both liver and lung of male Sprague-Dawley rats by homogenizing with guanidium isothiocyanate and centrifugation through a cushion of CsCl (14Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16657) Google Scholar). Total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamers and oligo(dT)16 as primers. PCR was performed with oligonucleotides 9511 (forward) and 9519 (reverse) (based on the amino acid sequence of internal peptides of HB2) as follows: primer 9511, 5′-CA(A/G)TAFGAFGA(T/C)GT(F/G)CC(F/G)GA(A/G)TA; 9519, 5′-T(A/G)AAFTCFTC(F/G)GG(F/G)GGNGG(A/G)TT (F = T/C, N = any). As indicated, 5′-fluoro-dUMP (F) was incorporated into the oligonucleotides during synthesis (Bresatec, Australia) to limit degeneracy (15Habener J.F. Vo C.D. Le D.B. Gryan G.P. Ercolani L. Wang A.H-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Conditions for PCR were 95 °C, 2 min for one cycle, then 30 cycles of 95 °C, 1 min, an annealing step commencing at 53 °C for 30 s, then increasing to 72 °C at a ramp rate of 0.1 °C/s; 72 °C, 2 min ending with 5-min elongation at 72 °C. The amplified product was subcloned into vector, pCRTMII, using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Double-stranded sequencing of the fragment was performed using M13 forward and reverse primers and Sequenase Version 2 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Poly(A)+RNA from rat lung was isolated from total RNA by Oligotex [d(T)]30 (Roche). Synthesis of cDNA from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was catalyzed by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with a Timesaver cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia) which includes EcoRI/NotI adapters. The cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI site of Lambda ZAP II vector (Stratagene) and packaged into phage particles with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). The recombinant phage was used to infect Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue MRF. Approximately 2.5 × 105 plaque-forming units were screened for HB2 clones after lifting onto Colony/Plaque ScreenTM membrane (DuPont). The PCR product from primers 9511/9519 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed three times with 2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS solution at 50 °C for 15 min, then washed with 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS solution at 50 °C for 30 min. Thirty-three positive plaques remained after tertiary screening from which 15 clones were selected, excised in vivo, and used for further sequencing analysis. The HB2cDNA (1– 2,771 nucleotides) was introduced into theEcoRI site of the expression vector, pcDNA I/Amp (Invitrogen) for transient expression. Transfection was performed by the DEAE-dextran method for COS and CHO cells and by calcium phosphate precipitation for HepG2 cells (16Ausubel, F., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Struhl, K. & Smith, J. A. (eds) (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chap. 9.2, John Wiley & Sons, New York.Google Scholar). The same procedure was followed, except for the omission of the plasmid, to produce mock-transfected cells. After 24 h, the cells were removed from the flasks and dispensed into 12-well plates at appropriate seeding densities in preparation for binding experiments which were performed at 48 h after transfection. In some experiments, cells were washed and harvested, and membranes were recovered for ligand blotting analysis (see below). COS or HepG2 cells in monolayers were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to binding experiments, cells were washed with serum-free DMEM, and the growth medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Transfected and mock-transfected cells were incubated with 125I-labeled HDL3 (as described under “Results”) with or without unlabeled HDL3. Specific binding was determined as described previously (17Kagami A. Fidge N.H. Nestel P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 705-712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell membranes were prepared as described previously (8Tozuka M. Fidge N. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed after transfer of membrane proteins (following SDS-PAGE) to nitrocellulose which was incubated with antiserum against HB2 and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (8Tozuka M. Fidge N. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis of rat tissues, total RNA was isolated from tissues including liver, intestine, lung, spleen, kidney, brain, ovary, and thymus, fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membranes. These were probed with32P-labeled probes (see “Results”), and hybridizing bands were identified by autoradiography or bioimaging. Membranes were stripped and rehybridized with a cDNA probe for rat glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. For detection of HB2 mRNA in human tissues, human multiple RNA blots (CLONTECH) were similarly probed as described above, except that the actin probe provided with the blots was used as an internal standard. Cells were lysed in the presence of 20 mm CHAPS, and solubilized proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Glycoproteins were isolated with wheat germ lectin agarose (Pharmacia) and then applied to SDS-PAGE gels. Ligand blotting was performed as described previously (12Hidaka H. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Data base searches with the nucleotide sequence of rat HB2 cDNA were performed with GenBank and EMBL data bases by the FASTA program from the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software. Alignments and consensus sequence derivation of peptide sequences were analyzed by GENETYX (version 9.0) from Software Development Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Further analyses of the HB2 gene product for common motifs and potential secondary structure were performed using GENETYX. HB2 antiserum was used to probe membranes from various rat organs as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown previously (18Lutton C. Fidge N. Biochemistry. 1994; 317: 731-735Google Scholar), the strongest expression of HB2 was present in liver, lung, and intestine. Total RNA from lung and liver were therefore subjected to reverse transcription-PCR as described under “Materials and Methods,” with primers 9511 and 9519. Under the annealing/elongation conditions described for PCR, a single product of 600 base pairs was amplified from lung, but not from liver. Sequencing of this fragment confirmed the presence of both primers as well as an additional internal peptide of HB2, in the correct reading frame. To obtain a full-length clone, a lung cDNA library was prepared and probed with the 600-base pair fragment. Of 2.5 × 105 plaque-forming units probed, 33 positive clones remained after three rounds of screening. Fifteen of these were further analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, the cDNA of HB2 encoded a protein of 65 kDa constituted from 583 amino acids, considerably smaller than the apparent size of 100 kDa of the glycosylated form of HB2 identified by ligand blotting as previously reported by our laboratory (12Hidaka H. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Over the entire coding region, rat HB2 showed highest homology with human ALCAM (93%) (19Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Wang W-C. Marquardt H. Neubauer M. Pesando J.M. Francke U. Haynes B.F. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and the avian protein BEN (70%) (20Pourquı́e O. Corbel C. Le Caer J-P. Rossier J. Le Douarin N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There was no significant homology with any other lipoprotein receptor including candidate HDL receptors previously reported (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

This increased binding however was not associated with transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to cells because no differences were observed in cholesteryl ester uptake between mock and transfected COS or HepG2 cells (data not shown). Glycoproteins isolated from mock- or transiently transfected CHO or HepG2 cells were compared for their HDL binding capacity by ligand blots. As shown in Fig. 2 C, untransfected HepG2 cells showed binding of HDL3 to both HB2 and HB1, but the signal for HB2 was much stronger in transfected cells. Similarly the faint signal for HB2observed in mock-transfected CHO cells was markedly increased when membrane proteins from transfected CHO cells were incubated with HDL3 (Fig. 2 D). Fig. 3 A shows Northern blot analyses of HB2 mRNA expression in various rat tissues. Strongest expression was found in the lung, then brain, liver, and kidney. In comparison, to the rat, human mRNA to HB2(probed with rat HB2 cDNA) was strongest in the brain, prostate, pancreas, small intestine, and liver of human (Fig.3 B), but lower in the lung. To determine whether blood monocytes or macrophages express HB2, RNA from THP-1 cells or from cells differentiated by treatment with PMA was subjected to Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 A, HB2 mRNA, hardly detectable in untreated THP-1 cells, was strongly induced when the cells were transformed into macrophages by PMA treatment. After incubating THP-1 cells with 50 or 100 μg/ml acetylated LDL, a dose-dependent reduction in HB2 mRNA expression was observed. No changes were observed in expression of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA with any of the treatments (Fig. 4 B). Ligand blots of membrane proteins revealed weak HDL3 binding for THP1 cells, but after differentiation with PMA, strong binding was detected for HB2 (Fig. 4 C) as well as an increase in binding to HB1. Binding was also stronger to another protein (approximately 66 kDa) which may represent degraded HB2 or another isoform of HB2. Cloning and sequencing of HB2, one of a pair of HDL-binding proteins previously identified and purified in this laboratory (12Hidaka H. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), have revealed its identity with a subclass of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins with adhesion type properties. To confirm that HB2 performed a role as an HDL-binding protein, HepG2, CHO, and COS cells were transiently transfected with HB2 cDNA. Compared with control (mock-transfected) cells, HepG2 and COS cells (transfected) demonstrated an 80–100% increase in HDL binding, establishing that HB2, together with other candidate HDL receptors (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 21McKnight G.L. Reasoner J. Gilbert T. Sundquist K.O. Hokland B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12131-12141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may play an important role in HDL metabolism in the body. The level of HDL binding activity resulting from transfection with HB2 cDNA was intermediate between that of an HDL-binding protein found in endothelial cells when expressed in COS cells (21McKnight G.L. Reasoner J. Gilbert T. Sundquist K.O. Hokland B. McKernan P.A. Champagne J. Johnson C.J. Bailey M.C. Holly R. O'Hara P.J. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12131-12141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that of SR-B1 (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar), another candidate HDL receptor. It is not surprising that untransfected cells will demonstrate variable levels of specific HDL binding in view of the presence on most cells of “specific” but low affinity HDL binding sites recently identified in this laboratory (22Morrison J.R. McPherson G.A. Fidge N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13205-13209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is a characteristic of the interaction between HDL and cells and the most likely explanation for the relatively high level of specific binding observed in the mock-transfected cells in this study. Additional evidence that HB2 is involved in the cellular recognition of HDL came from ligand blotting studies which confirmed that this membrane protein, when overexpressed in HepG2, CHO, and THP-1 cells, bound HDL3. Untransfected cells, apparently expressing low levels of HB2 compared with HB1(Fig. 2 C) showed a marked increase in HB2 that was active in binding HDL3, when transfected with HB2 cDNA. Similarly, ligand blotting revealed a significant increase in HDL binding to HB2 present in transiently transfected CHO cells, compared with controls. The up-regulation of HB2 mRNA that followed transformation of THP-1 cells into “macrophages” following PMA treatment was also associated with an increase in expression of HB2 which was active in binding HDL3 as seen in Fig.4 C. These experiments have not yet provided definitive information about the clinical relevance of HB2, but they do support a functional role for HB2 that involves interaction with HDL. Expression of HB2 mRNA, barely detectable in blood monocytes, is up-regulated when THP-1 cells undergo differentiation to macrophages on treatment with PMA, and further, a reduction in expression of HB2 mRNA follows cholesterol loading with acetylated LDL. This suggests some association, either direct or indirect, between HB2 and cholesterol metabolism. If, as expected, sterol synthesis was decreased in the cholesterol-loaded cells, it would be consistent with a finding reported by this laboratory previously (23Mathai D. Tozuka M. Mitchell A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1990; 10: 1045-1050Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that the administration of simvastatin to rats down-regulated HB2 (and HB1) expression by 50%. More studies are planned to investigate these relationships between HDL binding, HB2 levels, and cell cholesterol metabolism. Our present studies however have demonstrated that expression of HB2 is not associated with selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester by cells, a function which has been demonstrated for another candidate HDL receptor, SR-B1 (11Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). Another function attributed to the family of membrane proteins that includes HB2, BEN, and ALCAM is adhesion. When expression of HB2 is up-regulated in cells (such as blood monocytes as described above) it is conceivable that the increased adhesion that follows may produce vascular remodelling and the initiation of atherogenesis. While many proteins which elicit injurious effects on the vessel wall are known to be produced by stimulated macrophages, increased levels of HDL or of apoAI-rich particles, may compete with binding sites on the HB2 adhesion molecules to significantly reduce the migration of macrophages into the arterial wall thereby achieving some protection against damage to the vessel. This model is entirely consistent with the protective role of HDL against premature atherosclerosis. The scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain of CD6 is also recognized by this family of adhesion molecules (24Whitney G.S. Starling G.C. Bowen M.A. Modrell B. Siadak A.W. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18187-18190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and interruption of this interaction by HDL may contribute to a decreased cell-cell association that is injurious to the vessel wall. Together with the observation that HDL apparently down-regulates the expression of soluble adhesion molecules (7Cockerill G.W. Rye K-A. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Barter P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 1987-1994Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar), the combined inhibitory effect of HDL on cell adhesion may provide a formidable protective action against vascular disease. Clearly, these and other systems need to be explored, because the protective role of HDL is apparently not only limited to metabolic processes connected with lipid metabolism, such as reverse cholesterol transport, but may include mitogenic effects, secretagogue activity, and possible cellular signaling pathways (6Ailhaud G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1992; 3: 222-226Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In fact, the tissue distribution of HB2mRNA is consistent with any of the functions suggested above. In the human, organs that play important roles in lipoprotein transport such as the liver and intestine and steroidogenic tissue express HB2, but others such as the lung, brain, placenta, and pancreas, which may participate in the alternative protective functions listed above, also contain varying proportions of HB2mRNA. The structural features of HB2 are also consistent with a “receptor” role for this membrane protein. As shown in the working model (Fig. 5) based on available structural information on this group of membrane proteins of the IgG superfamily, HB2 is characterized by a 32-amino acid cytoplasmic domain, a 24-amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and approximately 500 residues of an extracellular domain terminating in the NH2residue. Data base searches of consensus sequences forN-glycosylation sites revealed eight potential sites, all extracellular, at residues 95, 167, 265, 306, 361, 457, 480, and 499. It is likely that most sites are glycosylated since the protein is mainly expressed in the higher M r form, although in HepG2 cells the presence of a faster migrating HB2isoform was found by Western blotting. 2A. Matsumoto, A. Mitchell, H. Kurata, L. Pyle, K. Kondo, H. Itakura, and N. Fidge, unpublished data. The function of glycosylation in HDL binding is unclear, although previous ligand blot studies (12Hidaka H. Fidge N.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) indicate that glycosylation is not essential for HDL binding. The carbohydrate however may contribute to other essential functions such as intracellular transport and influence the capacity of HB2 (in some tissues) to reach sites for HDL binding. Some provisional protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (residues 8, 73, 74, 209, and 421) were found, but since all are extracellular, their potential function as determinants of signaling via protein kinase C is weakened. cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites were also found. Possibly, sites which are inactive when HB2 is membrane-bound are activated if the protein is internalized. Further experiments are planned to investigate the interrelationships between structure and function, as related to HDL binding, and cellular localization of HB2.

Factor IX (F.IX) 1The abbreviations used are: F.IX, factor IX; C.IV, collagen IV; SFM, scanning force microscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: F.IX, factor IX; C.IV, collagen IV; SFM, scanning force microscopy. is a 57-kDa zymogen of a serine protease that participates in blood coagulation. Activated F.IX (factor IXa), with its nonenzymatic cofactor, factor VIIIa, activates factor X to factor Xa, which converts prothrombin to thrombin in the penultimate step of the coagulation cascade. Mutations in F.IX result in the bleeding disorder hemophilia B (1Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Lillicrap D.P. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It has been observed that F.IX binds to bovine aortic endothelial cells with high affinity (5 nm K d ) (2Heimark R.L. Schwartz S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

C.IV is an extracellular matrix protein and a major component of the basement membrane region of endothelial cells. C.IV is a right-handed triple helix composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain, each of which is a left-handed helix (6Brodsky B. Shah N.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Each of these chains encodes the repeating GXX sequence (where the first X and second X can be any amino acid, but are frequently proline and hydroxyproline, respectively) characteristic of collagenous proteins (7Hostikka S.L.

Two noncollagenous regions flank the triple helical collagenous domain: a 7S domain on the N-terminal end and an NC1 domain on the C-terminal end. The 7S domain mediates tetramer formation between four C.IV monomers joined at their N-terminal ends, whereas the globular NC1 domain participates in dimer formation between the C-terminal ends of two C.IV monomers (12Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V. Furthmayr H. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 13Kühn K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Risteli J. Dieringer H. Voss R. Glanville R.W. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The NC1 and 7S domains mediate polymerization to form an extensive C.IV network. Treatment of this network with pepsin produces C.IV tetramers linked by their 7S domains (see Fig. 2). These tetramers can be used in in vitro studies (12Timpl R. Wiedemann H. van Delden V.

A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that F.IX binding to C.IV requires the intact triple helix. It is not known, however, whether F.IX binds to a single specific site or if there are numerous F.IX recognition sites on the C.IV molecule. We used scanning force microscopy (SFM) to localize F.IX binding on C.IV by directly visualizing the interaction between F.IX and C.IV. SFM (also called atomic force microscopy) is a powerful tool for investigating the structure of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid complexes. SFM produces a topographic image of a sample by scanning a surface with a nanometer scale tip attached to a flexible cantilever. Consequently, it is possible to obtain three-dimensional images of macromolecules that are deposited on very smooth surfaces such as mica (reviewed in Refs. 15Bustamante C. Rivetti C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 395-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and 16Yang J. Tamm L.K. Somlyo A.P. Shao Z. J. Microsc. ( Oxf. ). 1993; 171: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because of the sensitivity of the instrument to variations in the dimensions of macromolecules, SFM is an excellent method for investigating the binding of F.IX to C.IV. In this study, we imaged both F.IX and C.IV separately and F.IX bound to C.IV tetramers. We observed two specific F.IX binding sites and identified F.IX that was nonspecifically bound to C.IV. F.IX was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Human C.IV tetramers (from placenta) and heparin were purchased from Sigma. Antibody A-5, which recognizes the F.IX catalytic domain (17Frazier D. Smith K.J. Cheung W.F. Ware J. Lin S.W. Thompson A.R. Reisner H. Bajaj S.P. Stafford D.W. Blood. 1989; 74: 971-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was a generous gift from Dr. Kenneth Smith of Emory University. To assure that the material used in this study was functionally identical to that used by Cheunget al. (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we performed the binding assay as described (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and obtained a K d of ∼60 nm, similar to that obtained in the earlier study. Antibody A-5, which does not affect C.IV binding, 2W.-F. Cheung and D. W. Stafford, unpublished results. was used to increase the apparent size of the F.IX molecule to make F.IX more easily identifiable. To form F.IX and A-5 (F.IX·A-5) complexes, F.IX (90 nm) and A-5 (18 nm) were incubated in TBS-CM (20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) for 2 h at 4 °C. To form complexes between C.IV and F.IX·A-5, C.IV (50 μg/ml) was incubated with F.IX (90 nm) and A-5 (90 nm) for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 μg/ml heparin in TBS-CM (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As a control, A-5 (18 nm) was incubated with C.IV (50 μg/ml) and heparin (1 μg/ml) in the absence of F.IX. Each sample was diluted 1:15 or 1:20 into TBS-CM, and 10 μl of the diluted sample were deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica surface. Consequently, the concentrations of F.IX and heparin at the time of deposition were ∼6 nm each, which is below the K d values for both F.IX and heparin binding to C.IV. These concentrations gave optimal coverage and visibility of individual collagen molecules. After allowing the samples to set for 5 s, the surfaces were thoroughly rinsed five times with ∼0.5 ml of doubly distilled water using a wash bottle. This procedure removes salt but leaves proteins bound to the surface, i.e. F.IX·A-5 complexes bound to C.IV remained bound to the surface. The surfaces were then dried with N2and imaged in air. Images were obtained in tapping mode using a Nanoscope IIIa from Digital Instruments (Santa Barbara, CA). Silicon cantilevers (125 μm) with a resonance frequency between 300 and 350 kHz were used (Digital Instruments). The scan rate was 1.85 lines/s with 512 lines/image. Images were flattened prior to analysis. F.IX, A-5, and C.IV molecules were stable under repeated scans and had consistent appearances in several different depositions. F.IX molecules were globular, with a diameter of 16 ± 2 nm (n = 10, where n is the number of molecules measured; Fig.1). F.IX·A-5 complexes were globular with a diameter of 23 ± 3 nm and a height approximately twice that of F.IX (n = 10; Fig. 1). C.IV molecules were tetrameric (Fig.2); however, some C.IV structures contained less than four monomers. The three “bumps” indicated by small arrows in the 7S domain in Fig. 3 A were observed on tetrameric C.IV both in the presence and the absence of F.IX·A-5. C.IV deposited in the absence of F.IX and A-5 was essentially free of features having F.IX·A-5 dimensions. In depositions with both F.IX·A-5 complexes and C.IV, features on C.IV with dimensions consistent with free F.IX·A-5 complexes were identified as bound complexes (Fig. 3). To assure that the complexes were a result of F.IX association and not an interaction between A-5 and C.IV, we imaged both A-5 and C.IV alone (n = 30) and F.IX·A-5 complexes and C.IV in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (n = 18), which inhibits F.IX binding to C.IV. In these images, molecules associated with C.IV were randomly bound to the collagenous domain (data not shown). Furthermore, in the presence of EDTA, only a few F.IX molecules were associated with C.IV (data not shown). Only collagen molecules with clearly visible N (7S domain) and C termini were analyzed. All distances were measured using Digital Instruments software. Standard error of measurement that was determined by measuring individual collagen strands was ± 13 nm. The length distribution of the collagenous domains (see legend to Fig. 2) of C.IV molecules deposited in the absence of F.IX. A-5 was gaussian, with an average of 318 nm and a standard deviation of ±48. 132 complexes were analyzed and two peaks (located at 98 ± 13 and 50 ± 13 nm) were observed (Fig. 4). These peaks were not due to differences in monomer length, because the average lengths of monomers with complexes bound at 98 and 50 nm were 316 ± 24 and 315 ± 28 nm, respectively. Both binding sites were statistically significant when examined by the goodness of fit of a binomial distribution (p < 10−10 and 0.004 for the binding sites located 98 and 50 nm from the C-terminal end, respectively). Our results support earlier conclusions (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that F.IX recognizes and binds with high affinity to C.IV and not to a contaminant protein in the C.IV preparation. The data in Fig. 4 reveal that F.IX binding is localized to the C-terminal portion of the C.IV monomer within two sharp peaks centered at ∼98 and ∼50 nm from the C-terminal end. The larger peak at 98 nm likely represents a high affinity, specific F.IX binding site on the collagenous domain, whereas the smaller peak may represent a secondary, specific F.IX binding site, having 3–4-fold lower affinity for C.IV than the primary site. Because the breadth of the entire F.IX distribution is too large to be explained by errors in our measurements, we suggest that the distribution represents both specifically bound F.IX and F.IX that is nonspecifically bound to the C.IV molecule. The stability of the specific complex is likely to be a result of nonspecific interactions with the triple helix, as well as interactions with specific amino acid residues. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect F.IX to bind nonspecifically along the length of C.IV. The large number of nonspecifically bound F.IX molecules on the C.IV monomer strongly supports earlier suggestions that F.IX interacts with the triple helix (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and not with a single peptide chain, because nonspecific binding would not be expected if F.IX were interacting with a conformationally distinct looped out region. This nonspecific binding is analogous to that observed for proteins that bind to DNA, which, like collagen, is also a long regular helical molecule. Indeed, the structurally regular “backbone” of the triple helical region may provide a significant portion of the binding free energy, as is observed for DNA binding proteins (18Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Waters T. Connolly B.A. JenJacobson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7548-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Takeda Y. Sarai A. Rivera V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20Kim J.G. Takeda Y. Matthews B.W. Anderson W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In general, the number of F.IX molecules bound specifically and nonspecifically to C.IV is determined by the concentration of nonspecific and specific binding sites and the relative binding affinities to these sites. According to a lattice binding model (21McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar), if F.IX interacts with 5–30 residues of the triple helix, the number of potential binding sites for a single F.IX molecule is approximately 1300. If we assume that F.IX has a single, specific binding site, the concentration of nonspecific sites is 1300 times greater than the specific site. Consequently, if F.IX has a 1300-fold higher affinity for its specific site versus its nonspecific sites, we expect to observe ∼50% of the F.IX molecules to be bound specifically and 50% to be bound nonspecifically. Such a difference in specific and nonspecific binding affinities is typical for DNA binding proteins (18Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Waters T. Connolly B.A. JenJacobson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7548-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19Takeda Y. Sarai A. Rivera V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 20Kim J.G. Takeda Y. Matthews B.W. Anderson W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In our study, ∼55% of F.IX molecules is specifically bound to the C.IV molecule, indicating that F.IX has ∼1000-fold greater affinity for its specific sites than its nonspecific sites. Surprisingly, the nonspecifically bound complexes were adjacent to the high affinity binding site (within 100 nm) and were not spread across the entire length of the molecule. This result is consistent with a mechanism of one-dimensional diffusion in which microscopic associations and dissociations between F.IX and C.IV permit F.IX to “slide” or “hop” along the C.IV molecule in transit to and from its specific site (22von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In the absence of this mechanism, we would expect nonspecific binding of F.IX to be governed by three-dimensional, diffusion-controlled, random protein-protein associations, and therefore, we would expect to observe F.IX binding across the entire length of the C.IV molecule. Significantly, a similar distribution of binding has been observed for Cro binding to DNA, which exhibits kinetics indicative of one-dimensional diffusion (24Erie D.A. Yang G. Schultz H.C. Bustamante C. Science. 1994; 266: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 3D. A. Erie, unpublished observation. These results for F.IX binding to C.IV suggest that one-dimensional diffusion may be important for protein-protein interactions involving long regular structures, as well as for DNA binding proteins. From our measurements of the position of the specific F.IX binding sites and from data on triple helix structure, we can identify the regions of amino acids that mediate specific F.IX binding to C.IV. C.IV differs from fibrillar collagens, because it contains interruptions of noncollagenous sequences within its collagenous repeats. Because these interruptions do not alter triple helix propagation in the collagenous domain, it is unlikely that they disrupt the triple-helical character of the collagenous domain (6Brodsky B. Shah N.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 25Dolz R. Engel J. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 27Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we assumed a linear dependence of helical length for the 1304 amino acid residues in the collagenous domain. This assumption allowed us to localize F.IX binding to specific amino acid regions by measuring the position of F.IX along the helix. From the 318 nm measured length of the collagenous domain, we calculated a distance of 2.44 Å per amino acid along each chain in the collagenous domain, which is consistent with the published value for a synthetic triple helical peptide (2.9 Å) (28Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Using this value, we concluded that the specific F.IX binding site located 98 ± 13 nm from the C-terminal end corresponds to residues 985–1092 of the α1 chain and residues 1030–1137 of the α2 chain (Fig.5). Similarly, the secondary specific F.IX binding site located 50 ± 13 nm from the C-terminal end corresponds to residues 1182–1288 of the α1 chain and residues 1227–1333 of the α2 chain. A search of the amino acids surrounding the mapped F.IX binding regions reveals several noncollagenous inserts within the GXXcollagenous repeats. Noncollagenous sequences at residues 1056–1057 (GI) of the α1 chain and 1033 (K) and 1097–1100 (INLP) of the α2 chain are located within the identified primary specific binding region (FIX 1 in Fig. 5). Additionally, noncollagenous sequences at residues 939–947 (DKVDMGSMK) of the α1 chain and 980–990 (PVILPGMKDIK) of the α2 chain flank the identified region. Residues 1182–1288 (α1 chain), which correspond to the secondary peak at ∼50 nm from the C-terminal end (FIX 2 in Fig. 5), also contain several noncollagenous sequences: residues 1231–1232 (TE) of the α1 chain, and residues 1235–1238 (NTLP), 1272–1277 (PPSNIS), and 1305–1307 (ALP) of the α2 chain. Each of these noncollagenous regions most likely maintains the triple helical nature of the collagenous domain (6Brodsky B. Shah N.K.

These sequences, therefore, merit investigation in identifying the specific F.IX binding sites on C.IV. Because several groups have successfully constructed and characterized structurally intact triple helical peptides (26Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B.

J. 1987; 248: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it may be possible to identify specific F.IX-binding amino acid residues on C.IV using synthetic peptides or alternatively, using site-directed mutagenesis. Because heparin has been shown to increase the binding affinity of F.IX to C.IV (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is interesting that the primary specific F.IX binding site was located in the same region as a previously identified heparin binding site (31Koliakos G.G.

It is possible that heparin increases the affinity of F.IX to the primary site on C.IV by binding to both F.IX and to C.IV and stabilizing their interaction. It is unlikely, however, that heparin is solely responsible for mediating this interaction because F.IX binds to C.IV in the absence of heparin (5Cheung W.F. van den Born J. Kühn K. Kjellen L. Hudson B.G. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11068-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and because the heparin concentration used in this study is below the measuredK d for the heparin-C.IV interaction. In addition, we did not observe F.IX binding to the heparin binding site proximal to the 7S domain (HEP1 in Fig. 5) (31Koliakos G.G. Kouzi-Koliakos K. Furcht L.T. Reger L.A. Tsilibary E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2313-2323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we did observe specific binding of F.IX ∼50 nm from the C terminus (FIX2 in Fig. 5) where there is no evidence for heparin binding. Because two groups previously reported that heparin fails to bind to pepsin-treated (tetrameric) C.IV (32Tsilibary E.C. Koliakos G.G. Charonis A.S. Vogel A.M. Reger L.A. Furcht L.T. J. Biol.

The collagens previously have been implicated in a variety of physiological activities. Collagen types I, II, III, and IV induce platelet adhesion (reviewed in Ref. 34Sixma J.J. van Zanten G.H.

C.IV plays a role in cell migration and cell binding during tumor metastasis (35Fields C.G. Mickelson D.J. Drake S.L. McCarthy J.B. Fields G.B. J. Biol.

Given the unique site on F.IX that interacts with C.IV and the specificity of the recognition sites on C.IV, these results strongly suggest that the F.IX-C.IV interaction is physiologically relevant.

https://openalex.org/W2001147604,"The tRNA splicing endonuclease cleaves intron-containing tRNA precursors on both sides of the intron. The prevailing belief has been that the enzyme binds only to the mature domain through the invariant bases. We show instead that, for recognition, the endonuclease utilizes distinct sets of structural elements, several of which are within the intron. One subset of recognition elements, localized in the mature domain, is needed for recognition of both cleavage sites, while two other subsets, localized at the exon–intron boundaries, are used for recognition of either one or the other cleavage site. The two cleavage sites are essentially independent: neither is required by the other for cleavage to take place. These results support a two-active-site model for the eucaryal endonuclease."

We have addressed this issue for two intimately related serine proteases, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), by modifying the technique of substrate phage display to create substrate subtraction libraries. Characterization of individual members of the substrate subtraction library accomplished the rapid, direct identification of small, highly selective substrates for t-PA. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these selective substrates with the consensus sequence for optimal substrates for t-PA, derived using standard substrate phage display protocols, suggested that the P3 and P4 residues are the primary determinants of the ability of a substrate to discriminate between t-PA and u-PA. Mutagenesis of the P3 and P4 residues of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, the primary physiological inhibitor of both t-PA and u-PA, confirmed this prediction and indicated a predominant role for the P3 residue. Appropriate replacement of both the P3 and P4 residues enhanced the t-PA specificity of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 by a factor of 600, and mutation of the P3 residue alone increased this selectivity by a factor of 170.

The chymotrypsin family of serine proteases has evolved to include members with both widely divergent and intimately related substrate specificities (1Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). We chose two members of this family, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) 1The abbreviations used are: t-PA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; u-PA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; fTC, fAFF1-tether C; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and urokinase (u-PA), to test the hypothesis that small molecule libraries could be used to identify substrates that discriminate between closely related enzymes. This choice of enzymes assured a rigorous test of the hypothesis because t-PA and u-PA possess an extremely high degree of structural similarity (2Lamba B. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3597-3604PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that selective inhibition of either enzyme might have beneficial therapeutic effects. Mice lacking t-PA, for example, are resistant to specific excitotoxins that cause extensive neurodegeneration in wild type mice (11Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S. Nature. 1995; 377: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and mice lacking u-PA exhibit defects in the proliferation and/or migration of smooth muscle cells in a model of restenosis following vascular injury (9Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). u-PA-deficient mice are also resistant to the induction and/or progression of several tumor types in a two-stage, chemical carcinogenesis model (16Shapiro R.L. Duquette J.G. Roses D.F. Nunes I. Harris M.N. Kamino H. Wilson E.L. Rifkin D.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3597-3604PubMed Google Scholar). Because mice lacking either t-PA or u-PA do not develop thrombotic disorders, selective inhibition of either of these two enzymes seems unlikely to create thrombotic complications in vivo. On the other hand, mice lacking both t-PA and u-PA suffer severe thrombosis in many organs and tissues, resulting in a significantly reduced life expectancy (9Carmeliet P. Schoonjans L. Kieckens L. Ream B. Degen J. Bronson R. De Vos R. van den Oord J.J. Collen D. Mulligan R.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Nonselective inhibition of these two enzymes, therefore, seems almost certain to produce catastrophic consequences in the clinical setting. Consequently, significant interest exists in the development of inhibitors that are stringently specific for either t-PA or u-PA. Rational design of these selective inhibitors is greatly complicated, however, by the absence of obvious “lead compounds” both their primary physiological substrate and inhibitors fail to discriminate between the two closely related proteases. We have previously described the use of substrate phage display, a strategy originally developed by Matthews and Wells (17Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), to elucidate optimal subsite occupancy for substrates of t-PA and to isolate peptide substrates that were cleaved as much as 5300 times more efficiently by t-PA than peptides containing the primary sequence of the actual target site present in plasminogen (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Four of these selected substrates, including the most labile t-PA substrate, were chosen for detailed characterization; consequently, small peptides containing the four selected amino acid sequences were synthesized, and a kinetic analysis of the cleavage of these peptides by t-PA was performed (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of these four selected substrates demonstrated that they were also efficiently cleaved by u-PA and therefore were not selective for t-PA versus u-PA. Consequently, to facilitate the rapid isolation of peptide substrates that were cleaved at greater catalytic efficiencies by t-PA than by u-PA, we developed a novel protocol to prepare phage “substrate subtraction libraries” (Fig.1). Characterization of individual members of the substrate subtraction library quickly accomplished the direct identification of highly labile, small peptide substrates that were preferentially cleaved by t-PA. In addition, insights gained during the analysis of these selective substrates were used to design a variant of the serpin PAI-1 whose selectivity toward t-PA was enhanced by a factor of 600. Competent MC1061 (F−)Escherichia coli and nitrocellulose were purchased from Bio-Rad. Pansorbin (Protein A-bearing Staphylococcus aureus) cells were obtained from Calbiochem. K91 (F+) and MC1061 (F−) strains of E. coli were provided by Steve Cwirla (Affymax). mAb 179 which recognizes the epitope (ACLEPYTACD) of the human placental alkaline phosphatase protein with subnanomolar affinity, was provided by Ron Barrett (Affymax). mAb 3-E7 was purchased from Gramsch Laboratories (Schwabhausen, FRG). t-PA was obtained from Bruce Keyt (Genentech), and u-PA was obtained from Jack Henkin (Abbott Laboratories). Construction of the phage vector fAFF1-tether C (fTC) and the random hexapeptide library fAFF-TC-LIB has been previously described (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Control substrate phage fTC-PL was constructed by hybridizing the single-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-TCGAGCGGTGGATCCGGTACTGGTCGTACTGGTCATGCTCTGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CGCCACCTAGGCCAGGACCAGCACAACAACCACGAGAC-3′ and then ligating the annealed, double-stranded products into theXhoI/KpnI-cut vector fTC. All constructs were first transformed into MC1061 by electroporation and then transferred into K91. Concentrations of functional t-PA and u-PA were measured by active site titration with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (20Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle S.A. Ellmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence fluorometer as described previously (7Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Urano T. Urano S. Castellino F.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzymes were titrated with a standard PAI-1 preparation that had been previously titrated against a trypsin primary standard. Total enzyme concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conventional substrate phage display was originally developed by Matthews and Wells (17Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) using monovalent phage, and another method that used multivalent phage was reported later (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Multivalent substrate phage were screened with t-PA using reaction conditions reported previously (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Identical reaction conditions were used to screen the phage library with u-PA except that digestion of the phage was performed using enzyme concentrations varying from 5 to 10 μg/ml and incubation times varying from 1 to 10 h. The initial random hexapeptide library fAFF-TC-LIB was subjected to three rounds of high stringency screening with t-PA (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to prepare an intermediate library containing phage whose randomized hexamer sequences were digested efficiently by t-PA. The intermediate library was then amplified and screened, at low stringency, with u-PA. Following digestion of the intermediate library with u-PA, mAb E-7 and immobilized protein A were added to the mixture, and the resulting ternary complexes were pelleted by centrifugation as described previously (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast to all previous screening steps, however, we retained the precipitated ternary complexes and discarded the supernatant, which contained phage that were digested by u-PA. The precipitated ternary complexes were washed four times with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.01% Tween 80, resuspended, and digested with 50 μg/ml t-PA at 37 °C for 4 h. The remaining ternary complexes were precipitated by centrifugation and discarded, and the supernatant, which contained t-PA-selective phage, was retained. Phage in the final supernatant were amplified overnight in E. coli K91 cells. Following amplification, individual phage clones were functionally characterized using a dot blot assay and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Phage precipitation and dot blot analysis were performed as described previously (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Individual phage stocks were prepared and digested with no enzyme, t-PA, u-PA, or u-PA in the presence of 1 mm amiloride, a specific inhibitor of u-PA, for periods of time varying from 15 min to 10 h. Individual reaction mixtures were spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter using a dot blotter apparatus (Bio-Rad). The filter was probed with mAb 3E-7 and developed using the Amersham Western ECL kit. Loss of positive staining indicates loss of antibody epitopes from the phage due to proteolytic cleavage of the randomized hexamer region. DNA samples were prepared from interesting phage clones as described previously (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, phage are precipitated from a 1-ml overnight culture by adding 200 μl of 20% polyethylene glycol in 2.5m NaCl. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min, and the phage pellet was collected by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The phage were resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) and heated at 80 °C for 15 min. Single-stranded DNA was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. One-third of the single-stranded DNA was used for dideoxy sequencing. Peptides were synthesized and purified as described (7Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were obtained by incubating various concentrations of peptide with a constant enzyme concentration to achieve between 5 and 20% cleavage of the peptide in each reaction. For assays with u-PA, enzyme concentration was either 815 or 635 nm. For assays with t-PA, enzyme concentration was 700 nm. Peptide concentrations were chosen where possible to surroundK m and in all cases were between 1 and 32 mm. The buffer used in these assays has been described (7Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to 0.33% or by freezing on dry ice. Cleavage of the 13- and 14-residue peptides was monitored by reverse phase HPLC as described (7Madison E.L. Coombs G.S. Corey D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7558-7562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The 4–6-residue peptides were acylated at their amino termini and amidated at their carboxyl termini. Cleavage of the 4–6-residue peptides was monitored by hydrophilic interaction HPLC chromatography (22Alpert A.J. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 499: 177-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) using a polyhydroxyaspartamine column from PolyLC (Columbia, MD). Buffer A was 50 mm triethylamine phosphate in 10% acetonitrile, and buffer B was 10 mm triethylamine phosphate in 80% acetonitrile. Peptides were eluted by a gradient that was varied from 100% buffer B to 100% buffer A during a 13-min interval. The percentage of cleaved peptide was calculated by dividing the area under the product peaks by the total area under substrate and product peaks. For all peptides containing multiple basic residues, mass spectral analysis of products confirmed that cleavage occurred at a single site and identified the scissile bond. Data were interpreted by Eadie-Hofstee analysis. Errors were determined as described (23Taylor J.R. An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1982Google Scholar) and were <25%. The expression vector pPAIST7HS was derived from the plasmid pBR322 and contains a full-length cDNA encoding human PAI-1 that is transcribed from a T7 gene 10 promoter (24Tucker H.M. Mottonen J. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 300-base pair SalI/BamHI fragment of human PAI-1 was subcloned from pPAIST7HS into bacteriophage M13mp18. Single-stranded DNA produced by the recombinant M13mp18 constructs was used as a template for site-specific mutagenesis according to the method of Zoller and Smith (25Zoller M.J. Smith M. DNA. 1984; 3: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) as modified by Kunkel (26Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Following mutagenesis, single-stranded DNA corresponding to the entire 300-base pair SalI-BamHI fragment was fully sequenced to ensure the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any additional mutation. The 300-base pairSalI-BamHI double-stranded DNA fragments from mutated, replicative form DNAs were used to replace the corresponding fragment in pPAIST7HS to yield full-length cDNAs encoding PAI/P3R, PAI/P4Q, and PAI/P4Q,P3R. Expression of wild type and mutated variants of PAI-1 was accomplished in the E. coli strain BL21[DE3]pLyss (Novagen), which synthesizes T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking to anA 595 of 1.1–1.3, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase and the production of PAI-1 proteins. Cultures were grown for an additional 1–2 h at 37 °C and then shifted to 30 °C for 2–6 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 40 ml of cold start buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 5.6). The cell suspension was disrupted in a French pressure cell (Aminco), and cellular debris was removed by ultracentrifugation for 25 min at 32,000 × g. Purification of soluble, active PAI-1 was performed as described previously (27Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PAI-1-containing supernatants were injected onto a XK-26 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) packed with CM-50 Sephadex (Pharmacia). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of start buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20, pH 5.6), and PAI-1 proteins were eluted using a 0.2–1.8 m linear gradient of NaCl in the same buffer. Peak fractions were collected, pooled, and concentrated using a centriplus 30 concentrator (Amicon). Purified preparations were analyzed by activity measurements using standard, direct assays of t-PA, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measurement of optical density at 280 nm. A primary standard of trypsin was prepared by active site titration usingp-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate HCl as described previously (28Chase T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Concentrations of active molecules in purified preparations of wild type or mutated PAI-1s were determined by titration of standardized trypsin as described by Olson et al. (29Olson S.T. Bock P.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30007-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and by titration of standardized t-PA preparations. Second order rate constants (k i ) for inhibition of tPA or uPA were determined using pseudo-first order (k i < 2 × 106) or second order (k i > 2 × 106) conditions. For each reaction, the concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor were chosen to yield several data points for which the residual enzymatic activity varied between 20 and 80% of the initial activity. Reaction conditions and data analysis for pseudo-first order reactions were as described previously (30Holmes W.E. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol.

For second order reactions, equimolar concentrations of u-PA and PAI-1 were mixed directly in microtiter plate wells and preincubated at room temperature for periods of time varying from 0 to 30 min. Following preincubation the mixtures were quenched with an excess of neutralizing anti-PAI-1 antibody (generously provided by Dr. David Loskutoff, The Scripps Research Institute), and residual enzymatic activity was measured using a standard, indirect chromogenic assay. These indirect, chromogenic assays were compared with control reactions containing no PAI-1 or with reactions to which PAI-1 was added after preincubation and the addition of anti-PAI-1 antibody, plasminogen, and Spec PL. Data were analyzed by plotting the reciprocal of the residual enzyme concentration versus the time of preincubation. A polyvalent fd phage library that displayed random hexapeptide sequences and contained 2 × 108 independent recombinants was prepared (18Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7627-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Each member of this library displayed an N-terminal extension from phage coat protein III containing a randomized region of six amino acids followed by a six-residue linker sequence (SSGGSG) and the epitopes for mAb 179 and mAb 3-E7. Because neither t-PA nor u-PA digests the protein III sequence, the antibody epitopes, or the flexible linker sequence, the loss of antibody epitopes from the phage surface upon incubation with either enzyme requires cleavage of the randomized peptide insert. Incubation of the library with t-PA, followed by removal of phage retaining the antibody epitopes, therefore, accomplishes the enrichment of phage clones whose random hexamer sequence can be cleaved by t-PA. The initial phage library was subjected to three rounds of high stringency selection with t-PA to assure the preparation of an intermediate library that is highly enriched for phage that are efficient substrates of t-PA (Fig. 1). This intermediate library was then digested at low stringency with u-PA to remove phage that are moderate or good substrates for u-PA. Substrate subtraction was accomplished after the protease digestion of phage by adding mAb 3E-7 and immobilized protein A to the reaction mixture and precipitating the ternary complexes that contain the undigested phage. By contrast to all earlier selections, the phage remaining in solution were discarded, and the precipitate containing the ternary complexes was resuspended. Phage that were preferentially cleaved by t-PA were then released from the ternary complexes by digestion with t-PA. Using the protocol outlined in Fig. 1 and a previously described (18Ding L.

As illustrated by the experiment depicted in Fig. 2, the dot blot assay can rapidly provide information regarding both the activity and specificity of individual substrate phage clones. Based on the results of these assays, three peptide substrates (II–IV) containing hexamer sequences present in individual members of the substrate subtraction library were synthesized and characterized to provide a quantitative analysis of the properties of putative t-PA-selective substrates. These peptides were cleaved 180–1500-fold times more efficiently by t-PA than a control peptide (I) containing the physiological cleavage site present in plasminogen (Table I). In addition, by contrast to the plasminogen-derived, control peptide, which was cleaved 3-fold more efficiently by u-PA than by t-PA, the three selected peptides were cleaved 13–47 times more efficiently by t-PA than by u-PA.Figure 3Primary sequence of the randomized hexamer found in phage that were selective substrates of t-PA.

Hyperosmosis elicited characteristic phosphotyrosine accumulation in at least 3 proteins (≈42, ≈85, and ≈120 kDa). The most prominent response occurred in the 85-kDa band (p85) whose phosphorylation was rapid, sustained, apparent already at mild hypertonicity (350 mosm), proportional to the extracellular osmotic concentration, and reversible. Hyperosmotic environment could not induce tyrosine phosphorylation if cell shrinkage was prevented by nystatin and appropriately composed media. Conversely, isotonic shrinkage caused strong tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the initial signal is a decrease in cell volume and not an increase in the intra- or extracellular osmotic concentration, or a rise in cytosolic K+ and Cl− levels. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 was not due to the hypertonicity-induced protein kinase C-dependent stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, nor to the activation of stress-activated protein kinases. Tonicity-responsive proteins interacted with Grb2-glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins: the 120-kDa protein complexed with the SH2 and both SH3 domains, whereas p85 associated with the SH2 and the N-terminal SH3 domains of the adapter. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is a sensitive indicator of reduced intracellular hydration and might signify a hitherto unrecognized, early volume-dependent signaling event.

Although many of these events are of homeostatic nature which serve the restoration of the near-normal cell volume (7Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 10Sarkadi B. Parker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), ample evidence has been accumulating that moderate volume changes themselves constitute an important signal that can be induced by and may be necessary for the action of different metabolic hormones (1Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). While the role of cellular hydration state as both aregulated and a regulating factor has been well established, very little is known about the mechanisms through which it is detected and about the subsequent signaling steps that convey the information to the effectors. Not even the exact parameter sensed during aniso-osmotic challenge is clear: it may be a change in the extra- and/or intracellular total osmotic activity, or an alteration in the cell volume. Furthermore, the volume change itself may exert its effect via various mechanisms. Conceivably, it may act by eliciting changes in the intracellular ionic strength or in the concentration of specific ions or other regulatory constituents. It is noteworthy that cytosolic Cl− concentration was found to modulate the operation of the Na+/H+ exchanger (11Robertson M.A. Foskett J.K. Am. J.

Alternatively, the mechanical strain of various cytoskeletal components may also initiate some of the effector responses (see Ref. 7Hoffmann E.K. Dunham P.B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 161: 173-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Whatever the initial events are, the further processing of the signal is believed to involve a set of protein phosphorylations.

Serine/threonine kinases which were shown to be stimulated by hyperosmolarity in mammalian cells now include ERK-1 and 2 (22Terada Y. Tomita K. Homma M.K. Nonoguchi H. Yang T. Yamada T. Yuasa Y.

Interestingly in certain cell types hypotonicity also was found to activate ERK-1 and -2 (31Tilly B.C. van den Berghe N. Tertoolen L.G.J. Edixhoven M.J. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol.

While the potential link between these serine/threonine kinases and the effector functions (e.g. membrane transporters) remained unresolved, pharmacological data indicate that protein tyrosine phosphorylations may also play a pivotal role in mediating some of the hypo- or hyperosmotic stress-induced functional responses. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogated the hypotonicity-triggered ion efflux from epithelial cells (31Tilly B.C. van den Berghe N. Tertoolen L.G.J. Edixhoven M.J. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19919-19922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and prevented the hypertonicity-evoked inhibition of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE-3) in kidney cells (33Good D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9883-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These drugs were reported to suppress ERK activation induced by hypotonicity (32Schliess F. Schreiber R. Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) but did not abolish the hypertonicity-elicited stimulation of this MAP kinase (22Terada Y. Tomita K. Homma M.K. Nonoguchi H. Yang T. Yamada T. Yuasa Y. Krebs E.G. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31296-31301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that their effects may not be ascribed to the inhibition of MEKs and SEKs, the only identified members of the above cascades exhibiting tyrosine kinase activity. Despite their likely significance, the osmotic stress-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylations have never been systematically studied. Very little information is available about tonicity-regulated tyrosine kinases and their substrates are mostly unknown. The aim of the present work was to investigate whether hypertonicity provokes characteristic tyrosine phosphorylations in cellular proteins and to establish whether the primary signal for these reactions is a change in the intracellular osmotic concentration or in the cell volume. We also addressed whether the observed tyrosine phosphorylations might be downstream of the activity of ERKs and SAPKs or may signify upstream or independent events. These experiments were performed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing known isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger in which the functional responses to hypertonicity (i.e. stimulation of NHE-1 and inhibition of NHE-3) have been well characterized (2Kapus A.

The most prominent of these is an approximate 85-kDa band. Its phosphorylation is quick, proportional, and specific to the imposed osmotic stress, requires a decrease in the cell volume, and is not downstream to ERKs or SAPKs. The 85-kDa protein may represent an early element of a shrinkage-sensitive signaling pathway.

The iso-NMG medium was composed of 140 mm NMG, 140 mm gluconic acid lactone, 3 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.194 mm CaCl2 (100 nm free Ca2+), 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.1. The osmolarity of the isotonic solutions was adjusted to 290 ± 5 mosm with the major salt. When required, media were made hypertonic to the indicated level by the addition of sucrose or KCl as detailed in the text. Osmolarity was checked with a Knauer semimicro-osmometer calibrated with distilled water and a NaCl solution of 400 mosm. Wild type CHO K1 or CHO cells devoid of endogenous NHE and stably transfected with rat NHE-1 or NHE-3 were generous gifts from Dr. G. L. Lukács and Dr. John Orlowski, respectively. Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing 25 mm NaHCO3, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin, under a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1) at 37 °C. Cultures were re-established from frozen stocks and cells from passage number between 8 and 25 were used. Prior to experiments cells were incubated for at least 3 h in serum- and HCO3−-free RPMI 1640 at 37 °C. To down-regulate protein kinase C (PKC) the culture medium was supplemented with 100 nm PMA for 18 h and PMA was also present during serum depletion. The pattern of hypertonicity-induced phosphorylations was identical in the different transfectants and in the wild type CHO cells. Confluent cultures grown in 6-well tissue culture plates or glass Petri dishes were preincubated for 10 min in iso-sodium medium and then subjected to various treatments as indicated. The bathing medium was then removed and cells were lysed with an ice-cold buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmNa-EGTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5. Aliquots of total cell lysates were diluted (1:1) into 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hoefer Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II apparatus. To check effectiveness of transfer and similarity of protein amount, lanes were visualized by staining with Ponceau S. Blots were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (dilution 1:5000). The binding of the antibody was visualized by peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG, using the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification of the bands was performed using an UltroScan XL laser densitometer (LKB, Bromma) and evaluation of data was carried out with the Gelscan® computer program. In the absorbance range used for analysis, the OD values of the bands were linearly proportional to the protein amount as verified by blotting and scanning different (1–10-fold) dilutions obtained from the same sample. Hypertonicity-induced changes are always expressed as -fold increase in the integrated OD compared with the corresponding isotonic control. To follow ERK activation, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels (16 × 18 cm) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin then incubated with anti-ERK-2 or anti-Pan-ERK antibodies (500-fold dilution) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing Tris-buffered saline-Tween. After extensive washing, the reaction was detected with a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG and blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. This was carried out by Western blotting using a phospho-specific SAPK antibody (dilution 1:1000), and a phospho-specific p38 antibody (dilution 1:500). To precipitate proteins interacting with the full-size Grb2 or with certain domains of the adapter, cells were treated and lysed as described earlier then Triton X-100-insoluble material was sedimented out. The various Grb2-GST fusion proteins (5 μg/sample) coupled to agarose resin and containing either full-length Grb2 or a mutant version of it (comprising either only a functional SH2 domain, or the N-terminal SH3 domain or the C-terminal SH3 domain) were added to the supernatant. After allowing 1 h for the interaction to occur under continuous rotation at 4 °C, samples were sedimented in Eppendorf centrifuge 5402 (4 °C, 15,600 × g). The pellet was washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1 mmNa3VO4, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Lysates containing equivalent amounts of proteins obtained from iso- or hypertonically-treated cells were clarified by centrifugation at 15,600 × g for 5 min. Extracts were incubated overnight with 8 μg of anti-phosphoinositide 3-kinase followed by a 3-h incubation with immobilized protein A at 4 °C. Then beads were sedimented and washed four times with lysis buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 1 mm Na3VO4. Precipitated proteins and aliquots of the first supernatant were electrophoresed and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine. After stripping, the same blot was developed with anti-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (1:1000 dilution). Cell volume was measured as the difference between the [14C]sucrose permeable space and total 3H2O space of the samples (37Rottenberg H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 547-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Cells from confluent cultures were detached with trypsin-EGTA, washed, and resuspended (approximately 106cells/sample) in 1 ml of the corresponding medium (iso-sodium, iso-NMG, or iso-potassium supplemented with 1 mm unlabeled sucrose). When applied, 400 units/ml nystatin was added to the cells for 5 min. Thereafter cells were either left untreated or exposed to hypertonicity by the addition of 200 mm sucrose (from a 2 mstock) or 100 mm KCl (from a 1 m stock solution). Three minutes later (or at the indicated time) [14C]sucrose (1 μCi/ml) and3H2O (10 μCi/ml) were added to the suspension and after an additional 2-min incubation the cells were pelleted (15,600 × g for 1 min). After taking a 10-μl aliquot for scintillation counting, the rest of the supernatant was completely removed and the pellet was dissolved in 50 μl of iso-sodium containing 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity of the whole pellet and the sample from the supernatant was determined in a toluene/Triton based mixture using a Beckman LS-250 liquid scintillation spectrometer. Data are presented as representative immunoblots of at least three similar experiments or as mean ± S.E. of the number of experiments indicated (n). Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad Protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. To test the effect of osmotic challenge on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, confluent cultures of CHO cells were exposed to iso- or hypertonic media and whole cell lysates obtained from these samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Hyperosmolarity (imposed by the inclusion of 200 mm sucrose into the iso-sodium medium) caused an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in some protein bands with apparent molecular masses of ≈42, ≈85, and ≈120 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lanes ISO andHYPER). The most remarkable and always reproducible phosphotyrosine accumulation appeared in the ≈85-kDa band. In lysates of isotonically-treated cells this region showed only a faint labeling over the background whereas a prominent signal occurred in the extracts obtained from hypertonically stimulated samples. The overall increase in the absorbance of this area was 8.6 ± 1.1-fold (n = 10) as measured by densitometry (Fig.1 B). The observed rise in chemiluminescence was due to protein tyrosine phosphorylation and not to an aspecific binding of the primary or secondary antibody as evidenced by the following observations. 1) No labeling was found in this region when the blots were incubated with the primary antibody in the presence of 1 mm phosphotyrosine (not shown); 2) the band was not detected either when only the secondary antibody was applied (not shown); and 3) pretreatment of the cells with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 μm, 30 min) largely reduced (but did not completely abolish) the change provoked by hypertonicity (Fig. 1 C). As the phosphorylation of the 85-kDa protein (referred below as p85) seemed to be far the most sensitive to increased tonicity, we decided to use this band as a semi-quantitative indicator for further characterization of the hyperosmotic response. To establish the dependence of tyrosine phosphorylation on the extracellular osmotic concentration, we treated the cells with sodium medium supplemented with varying concentrations of sucrose. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 was occasionally observable upon addition of as low as 25 mm sucrose, whereas a clearly detectable rise consistently occurred after using 50 mmsugar (total osmolarity approximately 350 mosm). Other non-permeable osmolytes (NaCl and KCl) were equally effective in eliciting phosphorylation (see below). The signal became markedly stronger with increasing osmolarity, approaching a plateau above 600 mosm (Fig. 2, A andB). Fig. 2, C and D, reports the kinetic of the response. Using an osmotic concentration of 500 mosm, the signal was readily visible after 0.5–1 min (the earliest time points that could be reliably tested) and it increased further with time. Maximal effects were generally reached between 5 and 10 min. In most samples the signal showed a slow decay at times longer than 20–30 min. To test the reversibility of tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were first treated with a hypertonic solution for 10 min after which isotonicity was re-established for varying times before lysing the cells. As illustrated on Fig. 2 E, upon readdition of the isotonic sodium medium a quick and large decrease occurred in the phosphotyrosine content of p85: after 1 min the labeling became 80% weaker and by 2 min it dropped to the background level. To decide whether downward departures from isotonicity could also elicit the phosphorylation of p85, we reduced the osmolality of the extracellular medium by 33%. This maneuver did not cause phosphotyrosine accumulation in this band. Taken together, the tyrosine phosphorylation (and dephosphorylation) of the 85-kDa protein is a rapid, reversible, time- and osmotic concentration-dependent process, the level of which reflects the course and magnitude of changes in extracellular osmotic activity in a wide range above the isotonic values.Figure 3Tyrosine phosphorylation is induced by cells shrinkage and not by an increase in intra- or extracellular osmolarity. Changes in cell volume (columns, upper panels) and tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 (blots, lower panels) were followed in parallel. A, cells were kept in iso-potassium medium and treated as indicated in the table under the blots. Nystatin (400 units/ml), when present, was added to the cells 5 min prior to any further treatment. Hypertonic exposure (10 min) was achieved by the addition of either 100 mm KCl or 200 mm sucrose. For volume determinations, cells were used in suspension (≈106/ml) and the intracellular water space was measured by [14C]sucrose and3H2O as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were normalized to the average volume of untreated cells obtained in iso-potassium medium (n = 3). Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, cell volume and tyrosine phophorylation were determined after a 10-min incubation either in iso-sodium or iso-NMG medium as indicated. Neither of the above treatments caused cell detachment or lysis as verified by microscopic inspection and protein determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Hyperosmolarity induces tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in CHO cells. A, cells were preincubated in isotonic sodium medium (Iso-Na) for 10 min. The medium was then replaced either by the same iso-sodium (290 mosm) or by hyper-sodium medium (iso-sodium supplemented with 200 mm sucrose, 500 mosm) for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer and tyrosine phosphorylation in the extracts obtained from the iso- or hypertonically-treated samples was detected by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence (lanes ISO and HYPER, respectively). Upon hypertonic exposure the predominant tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in a band of approximately 85 kDa (indicated by the arrow). B, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 85-kDa band was quantified by densitometry (see “Experimental Procedures”). In each experiment the integrated OD of the corresponding band in the extract of isotonically-treated samples (taken as unity) was compared with the OD of the band obtained from lysates of hypertonically-treated samples (n = 10).C, effect of genistein on the hypertonicity-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p85.

We have recently described the isolation of a protein p20-CGGBP that binds sequence-specifically to the double-stranded trinucleotide repeat 5′-d(CGG)-3′ (Deissler, H., Behn-Krappa, A., and Doerfler, W. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 4327–4334). We demonstrate now that the p20-CGGBP can also bind to an interrupted repeat sequence. Peptide sequence tags of p20-CGGBP obtained by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry were screened against an expressed sequence tag data base, retrieving a clone that contained the full-length coding sequence for p20-CGGBP. A bacterially expressed fusion protein p20-CGGBP-6xHis exhibits a binding pattern to the double-stranded 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ repeat similar to that of the authentic p20-CGGBP. This novel protein lacks any overall homology to other known proteins but carries a putative nuclear localization signal. The p20-CGGBP gene is conserved among mammals but shows no homology to non-vertebrate species. The gene encoding the sequence for the new protein has been mapped to human chromosome 3.

DNA sequences containing trinucleotide repeats of the general sequence (CXG) n or (GAA) n appear to be genetically unstable. Amplifications of such repeats were found to be associated with several human diseases, e.g. fragile X (FraX) 1The abbreviations used are: FraX, fragile X; bp, base pair(s); CGGBP, 5′-d(CGG)-3′ds binding protein; ds, double-stranded; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; EST, expressed sequence tag; FMRP, fragile X mental retardation (protein); MS, mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame; UTR, untranslated region; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. syndrome, Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy, or Friedreich's ataxia (for reviews see Refs. 1Ashley Jr C.T.

The FraX syndrome is associated with an amplification of the trinucleotide sequence 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ in the 5′-UTR of theFMR1 (fragile X mental retardation) gene and extensive 5′-d(CG)-3′ methylation in the repeat as well as in adjacent regions (3Fu Y.-H.

Fragile sites similar to this locus have been identified on several of the human chromosomes, and all sites characterized so far have shown an expansion of 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ repeats suggesting an important structural function of this DNA sequence. Several studies have demonstrated that single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides of the general sequence 5′-d(CXG) n -3′ with X = A or G can form stable secondary structures in vitro (8Fry M.

The mechanism of the amplification of unstable DNA sequences is not understood. Expansion might involve DNA slippage or unequal crossing over, but these models do not explain the observed phenomenon sufficiently (for review see Ref. 15McMurray C.T. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1995; 104: 2-13PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the repeat itself is also unknown. A 5′-d(CGG)4-3′ fragment in the rRNA gene promoter (16Perevozchikov A.P. Orlov S.V. Kuteikin K.B. Dokl. Akad. Nauk. SSSR. 1994; 338: 411-414Google Scholar) and a 5′-d(CTG)25-3′ element located in the promoter of the mouse growth inhibitory factor gene (17Imagawa M. Ishikawa Y. Shimano H. Osada S. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20898-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) are thought to function as regulatory elements. Genetic instability of long 5′-d(CXG) n -3′ tracts with deletion products of triplet repeat sequences has also been observed in Escherichia coli (18Gastier J.M. Pulido J.C. Sunden S. Brody T.

The instability of long 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ repeats in E. coli has been shown to depend on host cell genotype, length, polymorphism, and on the orientation of the triplet repeat relative to the replication origin (19Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Expansion products of triplet repeat sequences have also been detected (20Ohshima K.

We are interested in the characterization of human cellular proteins binding to 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ repeats in a sequence-specific manner. The study of these proteins may improve our understanding of triplet repeat amplifications and their function. Double-stranded as well as single-stranded simple trinucleotide repeat sequences are target sequences for sequence-specific DNA binding proteins (21Richards R.I. Holman K. Yu S. Sutherland G.R. Hum.

We have recently isolated the 20-kDa protein p20-CGGBP (5′-d(CGG) n -3′ binding protein) from HeLa nuclear extracts by DNA affinity chromatography. This protein binds sequence-specifically to the unstable, double-stranded 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ trinucleotide repeat (24Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The protein requires more than eight repeats for proper binding. Base pair exchanges in the 1st base pair of every second triplet repeat abolish binding. None of the other known unstable trinucleotide repeats or either single strand of the trinucleotide repeat 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ can serve as a target sequence for this protein. The binding of p20-CGGBP is also severely inhibited by complete or partial cytosine-specific DNA methylation of the binding motif. Interestingly, a p20-CGGBP activity has been found in several human and mammalian cell lines and in human primary lymphocytes. Here we describe the rapid cloning of the full-length cDNA for p20-CGGBP by a novel strategy. Peptide sequence tags obtained by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (25Wilm M. Shevchenko A.

The encoded protein has been expressed in bacteria, and its binding specificity has been investigated in detail. Human HeLa cells were purchased from the Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany. The 5′-d(CGG) n -3′ binding protein p20-CGGBP was purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by anion exchange chromatography and DNA affinity chromatography as described (24Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A mixture of double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded calf thymus DNA-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used as an unspecific DNA matrix. As a specific DNA matrix 5′-d(CGG)17-3′ds-Sepharose was used. Each fraction was tested for its ability to bind sequence-specifically to the oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5′-d(CGG)17-3′ds as described. The sequences of various oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this study were summarized in Table I. Protein fractions prepared for peptide sequencing were eluted from 5′-d(CGG)17-3′ds-Sepharose at 65 °C for 10 min in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1% SDS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 6.9, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Problot, Applied Biosystems) in 10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11.

Proteins were denatured by washing the membrane twice for 10 min in buffer SWA (10 mm K-HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 7.9) and were renatured by removing half of the volume of buffer SWA, replacing it with buffer SW, and incubating the membrane for 10 min. This step was repeated four times and followed by a 5-min incubation in buffer SW. The membrane was blocked in buffer SW containing 5% low fat milk powder, 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg/ml poly(dA·dT) for 60 min. After washing the membrane in buffer SW with 0.5% low fat milk powder, the membrane was incubated for 2 h at 18 °C in buffer SW with 60 fmol of 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide (1.7 × 106 cpm) and 4 μg/ml poly(dA·dT). The membrane was finally washed in buffer SW for 10 min, dried, and exposed for 2–4 days on Kodak XAR films. The PVDF membrane carrying the blotted protein was destained in water. The protein was reduced, alkylated, and digested overnight with trypsin (12.5 ng/μl; Boehringer Mannheim, sequencing grade) at 37 °C in a 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 5 mmCaCl2 buffer (25Wilm M.

Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Peptides were extracted from the membrane in 10 μl of aqueous 5% formic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and subsequently in 10 μl of 1:1 acetonitrile:water, 5% formic acid (two changes). The resulting peptide mixture was dried and stored at −20 °C. The solution was reconstituted in 1 μl of 70% formic acid, rapidly diluted with 9 μl of water to avoid formylation, and was concentrated and desalted using 50 nl of Poros™ R2 material (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) prepared in a glass capillary as described previously (25Wilm M.

Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was eluted directly into a gold-coated glass capillary by passing 2 volumes of 0.4 μl of 50% methanol, 5% formic acid over the Poros™ column. The gold-coated glass capillary was mounted in the nanoelectrospray ion source (28Wilm M.S. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 29Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 66: 1-8Crossref Scopus (1719) Google Scholar) on the mass spectrometer for peptide tandem mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing. Tandem MS investigations were performed on an API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an updated collision cell (30Thomson B.A. Douglas D.J. Corr J.J. Hager J.W. Joliffe C.L. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1696-1704Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and a nanoelectrospray ion source (28Wilm M.S. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Proc. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 29Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 66: 1-8Crossref Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). To detect peptides, which were below the chemical noise level, the parent ion scan technique, a filtering method for triple quadruple mass spectrometers, was used on the isoleucine/leucine immonium ion (31Wilm M. Neubauer G. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3). Only peptides generating upon fragmentation a predefined fragment ion, in this instance the 86-Da immonium ion of isoleucine/leucine, were detected. By applying this filtering procedure, even peptides generating signals below the noise level in the spectrum could still be recognized. Data base searches were performed using the sequence tag approach and the PeptideSearch program (32Mann M. Wilm M.S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Sequence tags present information on part of a peptide sequence and typically comprise an internal sequence stretch of about three to four amino acids and the mass location in a peptide of known total mass. Frequently, this information can be gained from a tandem mass spectrum and facilitates the highly specific identification of the underlying complete peptide sequence during a data base search. A non-redundant data base currently containing more than 200,000 protein sequences or open reading frames was searched. Another data base was prepared from the available EST data base dBEST (33Boguski M.S. Lowe T.M.J. Tolshtoshev C.M. Nat.

The EST clone ID269133 (Genbank accession numbers N24697 and N36676) was obtained via the I.M.A.G.E. consortium (35Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), distributed by Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL, and resequenced on automated DNA sequencers. A fragment p20–518 was amplified from the plasmid 269133 by using primers p20Bam5′ (5′-dCGCGGATCCGAGCGATTTGTAGTAACAGCA-3′) and p20Kpn3′ (5′-dGGGGTACCTCAACAATCTTGTGAGTTGAG-3′) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The fragment p20–518 contained aBamHI recognition site at the 5′-end, a site forKpnI at the 3′-end, and coded for amino acids (aa) 2–166 of p20-CGGBP. This fragment was cloned into the vector pQE40 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and cut with BamHI and KpnI. Thereby, a histidine hexamer was introduced at the N terminus of the fusion protein (see below). The correct sequence of the fusion construct pQE40-518 was ascertained by DNA sequencing of 10 independent clones after transformation into E. coli M15[pREP4] (Qiagen). The vector pQE40 encoded the fusion protein 6xHis-dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR-6xHis). Its coding sequence was removed by cleavage with the above-mentioned enzymes. The E. coli strains containing the appropriate constructs were grown in liquid culture at 37 °C to anA 600 nm of 0.7. Synthesis of the fusion protein was induced by adjusting the medium to 1.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (MBI Fermentas). After incubation for another 2 h, bacteria were pelleted and lysed for 30 min on ice in buffer SB (50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 20% glycerol, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.85) in the presence of 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Calbiochem). The lysate was sonicated on ice for 1 min at 40 watts (Sonifier B12, Branson Sonic Power Company, Danbury, CT). The cytoplasmic extract was collected after centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 4 °C, 10 min), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The fusion protein p20-CGGBP-6xHis and the control protein DHFR-6xHis were purified by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography from bacteria expressing the constructs pQE40–518 and pQE40, respectively. Proteins from cytoplasmic extracts were bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 3 h and, subsequently, at room temperature for 30 min. All following steps were carried out at 4 °C. The material was washed with buffer SB and SB100 (same as SB but containing 100 mmimidazole, pH 6.5), and the fusion proteins were eluted with buffer SB500 (same as SB, but containing 500 mm imidazole, pH 6.0). Since imidazole inhibited the DNA-binding activity, the eluted fusion proteins were equilibrated in 20 mm K-HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.9. Even in the presence of protective carrier proteins, the purified proteins were stable at −80 °C for only 2 weeks. The purity of the fusion proteins was followed by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The DNA-binding specificities of the purified fusion proteins and of the bacterial lysates were tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). EMSAs were carried out essentially as described (24Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (nomenclature and sequences see Table I) were hybridized in a thermal cycler and 5′-end-labeled to a specific activity of 15,000 cpm/fmol by T4 polynucleotide kinase. When the binding activity of the bacterially expressed fusion protein p20-CGGBP-6xHis was determined, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin and/or 0.15 mm spermine were added per assay to increase the stability of the protein. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell lines according to standard procedures. Electrophoresis was carried out under denaturing conditions (36Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Qiabrane, Qiagen) and hybridized (37Koetsier P. Schorr J. Doerfler W. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 260-262PubMed Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled probe p20-701. A dot blot membrane carrying standardized amounts of mRNA isolated from a number of human tissues (human master mRNA blot, CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) was also hybridized with the p20-701 probe. A somatic cell hybrid panel (Oncor, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) containing 15 μg of PstI-cleaved genomic DNA from 23 different rodent cell lines each carrying one human chromosome was hybridized with probe p20-779. The DNA probe p20-779 contained the complete 779-bp insert and was isolated from the EST clone ID269133 after EcoRI and NotI cleavage. The DNA fragment p20-701 lacked the poly(A)-tail of the insert and was isolated afterBfaI cleavage of probe p20-779. Hybridization probes were32P-labeled by randomly primed tagging (38Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Protein fractions isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts and highly enriched for the 5′-d(CGG)17-3′-ds-binding activity were analyzed by Southwestern blotting for their binding activity to the target sequence of the p20-CGGBP protein (Fig. 1). Separated and blotted proteins were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide that carried either 17 5′-d(CGG)-3′ repeats [(CGG)17ds] or with the control oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CAG)17ds that contained 17 5′-d(CAG)-3′ repeats. A band of about 20 kDa was detected in all fractions highly enriched for p20-CGGBP with 32P-labeled (CGG)17ds as a binding probe (Fig. 1, lanes designated fractions III andIV). This band was not present when (CAG)17ds was used as a probe. It also failed to be detected in a fraction deficient of 5′-d(CGG)17-3′-ds-binding activity. An additional band of 100 kDa was observed in some fractions as well as in crude nuclear extracts (Fig. 1, and data not shown) when either binding probe was used. This activity was likely due to unspecific DNA-protein interactions since this binding was also detected with HeLa nuclear extracts when a variety of single- or double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides were used as binding probes (data not shown). These results confirmed that p20-CGGBP could bind directly to its target sequence without the involvement of additional cellular proteins. For the determination of the amino acid sequence of several internal peptides of p20-CGGBP, about 400 ng of p20-CGGBP were isolated from 5 × 109 HeLa cells, separated from accompanying proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The experimental design for the determination of the amino acid sequence is outlined in Fig. 2. Extraction of the peptides from the membrane resulted in limited recovery, as seen by the poor signal-to-noise ratio in Fig. 3, upper panel. Only one peptide was apparent whose fragmentation spectrum is shown in Fig. 3, lower panel. To detect peptide ion signals below the level of chemical noise, a parent ion scan for the immonium ion of isoleucine/leucine was performed. This scan revealed two more peptides that were subsequently fragmented (Fig. 3, 2nd panel from top). Tandem MS spectra of all three peptides were generated. Interpretation of these spectra resulted in one complete and two partial sequences. The sequence of peptide “a” was determined to be FVVTAPPAR. For peptide “b,” interpretation of the high m/z range resulted in the N-terminal sequence VSV(I/L) or a peptide sequence tag (17 Da) VSV(I/L) (634.4 Da). A peptide sequence tag could also be assigned to peptide “c”: (172.2 Da) (I/L)YV (601.80 Da). A search of a large non-redundant protein data base containing more than 200,000 entries revealed no match to the sequence FVVTAPPAR or the sequence tags, indicating that the protein was unknown. A search in the expressed sequence tag data base (dbEST) with PeptideSearch, however, did retrieve a matching EST (clone ID269133). This clone had been sequenced from the 3′- (Genbank accession no. N24697) and 5′-ends (Genbank accession no. N36676). Peptide a was found in the former and peptide b in the latter. The retrieved sequence for peptide b wasVSVIQDFVK, which matched the obtained tandem mass spectrum for this peptide. Peptide c did not match directly, but regions 1 and 2 of the peptide sequence tag were found to match, indicating a sequence error in the DNA sequencing coding for the C-terminal part of the peptide (32Mann M. Wilm M.S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Resequencing of the clone indeed revealed a different DNA sequence. After its correction the peptide sequence wasTALYVPLD which also led to complete agreement with the tandem mass spectrum of peptide c. The derived amino acid sequence of the 501-bp open reading frame, obtained after double-stranded resequencing of the EST clone, thus contained all three peptides covering 28 amino acids (Fig. 3, bottom). The analysis of the cDNA sequence revealed that the nucleotide sequence context of a putative start codon ATG (AGGATGG) at nucleotide position 197 of the 779-bp insert was in accordance with the Kozak rules (40Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) for functional translational start sites in eucaryotes. In addition, several very short ORFs were detected 5′ of the putative start codon. The stop codon at nucleotide 698 was followed by a polyadenylation signal at nucleotide 729 and a poly(A)-tail starting at nucleotide 759. The 501-bp ORF encoded a 166-aa long protein with a molecular mass of about 19 kDa which is in accordance with the apparent molecular mass for p20-CGGBP as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that the EST clone ID269133 contained the complete coding sequence of p20-CGGBP. Northern blot analyses of RNA isolated from human HeLa cells detected only one transcript with an apparent size of 1.2 kilobases with p20-CGGBP cDNA (probe p20-701) as hybridization probe (data not shown). This finding suggested the presence of a large 5′-UTR of p20-CGGBP-specific RNA. Low level expression of this RNA was found in a number of human tissues by dot bl"

Using our native gel technique for examining subcomplexes of the V-ATPase V1 sector, we have developed an in vitro reconstitution assay for assembly of this complex. Assembly of complex II, the soluble V1complex observed in native gels, is dependent upon the presence of divalent cations and physiological temperatures. Assembly of soluble V1 can occur in a stepwise fashion from smaller subcomplexes found in some strains deleted for V-ATPase subunits. Specifically, V1 can be assembled directly from complex III (subunits E and G) with complex IV (subunits A, B, D, and F) without prior disassembly of complex IV. The formation of complex III in vivo is also shown to be essential and could not be achievedin vitro. Assembly from simpler precursors is possible and is enhanced by added ATP. Assembly can be blocked byN-ethylmaleimide in a Vma1p (subunit A)-specific manner. From these data, we extend our previous model to consider an assembly pathway whose steps reflect the catalytic mechanism of the Boyer binding-change model.

Many enzymes are oligomeric and require the coordinated assembly of numerous individual subunits.

Nelson N. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 1-485PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is also found at plasma membranes in certain species and tissues. More complex than its evolutionary cousin, the F-type ATP synthase, the V-ATPase is composed of over 22 individual protein subunits that are the product of at least 12 unique genes, some of which have multiple isoforms in higher eukaryotes. Because interactions between these subunits are fundamental to both the assembly and the energy-transducing mechanism of this enzyme, we imagine that the pathway of assembly might be related to the mechanism of the enzyme. We have utilized native PAGE to reveal a myriad of partial V-ATPase complexes (Table I) found at steady state in the cytoplasm of both wild-type yeast as well as in deletion mutants of specific ATPase subunits encoded by the VMA andVPH gene families (2Tomashek J.J.

In wild-type yeast, as well as strains lacking one or more integral membrane sector subunits (e.g. vma3Δ andvph1Δstv1Δ), we observe a large stable complex (II; 576 ± 96 kDa) that we believe is the soluble cytoplasmic form of V1. This complex contains at least Vma1p (A subunit), Vma2p (B subunit), Vma4p (E subunit), Vma7p (F subunit), Vma8p (D subunit), and Vma10p (G subunit), with a probable stoichiometry of A3B3DEFG. This complex is also present invma5Δ (Vma5p is the peripheral subunit C), indicating Vma5p is not necessary for assembly of the V1. In all strains except vma4Δ and vma10Δ, we observe a small complex (III; 96 ± 28 kDa) consisting of, minimally, Vma4p and Vma10p. In vma4Δ and vma10Δ, we observe an intermediate complex (IV; 317 ± 49 kDa) that contains all of the above proteins except for Vma4p and Vma10p, and invma7Δ, we observe a complex (I) of low stability that runs above complex II and is of indeterminate mass. Again, it appears to contain all of the examined subunits, except for Vma7p. Finally, in all strains except vma7Δ and vma8Δ, we observe complex VI that contains Vma7p and Vma8p.Table ISubcomplexes of the V-ATPase detected by native gel electrophoresisSubcomplexMass in kDaContains at leastFound inIND1-aND, not determined.1p, 2p, 4p, 8p, 10pvma7ΔII576 ± 961p, 2p, 4p, 7p, 8p, 10pWild type, vma3Δ, vma5Δ, vph1Δstv1ΔIII96 ± 284p, 10pAll but vma4Δ andvma10ΔIV317 ± 491p, 2p, 7p, 8pvma4Δ, vma10ΔVIND7p, 8pAll butvma7Δ and vma8Δ1-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab From these observations, we have formulated speculative models for the assembly of the V1 complex. However, these models are limited by assumptions regarding the intermediate nature of the observed complexes. We have not known if the observed complexes were intermediates trapped along a bona fide assembly pathway, or if they were products of artifactual sidetracks that resulted from the deletion of a specific subunit. In the present study, we have extended our analysis of the intermediate complexes. We demonstrate that these complexes are able to assemblein vitro to form the soluble V1 sector observed as complex II, thus indicating that they are not terminal complexes. We show that an early assembly step is ATP-dependent and that this is associated with the catalytic site of the enzyme. Finally, we show specific assembly of complex II onto isolated vacuolar membranes containing the V0 sector, indicating that complex II is capable of V0-dependent membrane association. Kinetic studies of these processes have begun to distinguish discrete steps along the assembly pathway. These results lead us to conclude that the assembly pathway of the enzyme may recapitulate the functional mechanism. All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. HEPES buffer was from Research Organics, Inc. Media components were from Difco. All single deletion strains were based on the wild-type W303–1B (MATα leu2 his3 ade2 trp1 ura3) and were gifts from N.

The VMA7 and VMA7HA expression plasmids were constructed as follows. Primers to VMA7, which isolated the ORF and attached a 5′-BamHI and a 3′-XhoI site, were designed and used to isolate the VMA7 ORF from YPN1VMA7 (5Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. J. Biol.

The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI/XhoI and cloned into theBamHI/SalI sites of pHADR. This plasmid was constructed by excising the multiple cloning site of pRS423 (containing a HIS3 marker) and replacing it with a singleSphI site to form pRS423S. The ADH/GAL4 fusion expression cassette from pA′ (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Extracts were kept on ice except during reconstitution as described in the figure legends and text. Incubations were for 10–60 min, as indicated. The following were used at these final concentrations, where indicated: metal cations (5 mm), ATP (1 mm), EDTA (10 mm), NEM (1 mm). Reconstitutions were always returned to ice before loading onto 6% native gels. Immunoblots were quantitated with Millipore BioImage software. Cells were harvested at midlog phase, washed with water, and incubated in 20 ml of 10 mm Tris-SO4, pH 9.4, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol) and incubated with Zymolyase (ICN) for 30 min. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 15 ml of Buffer A (10 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.9, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 12% Ficoll 400) containing 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (5 mg/ml each pepstatin A,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, α2-macroglobulin, and 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed at 4 °C by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was divided into ultracentrifuge tubes, overlaid with 4 ml of Buffer B (as Buffer A, but 8% Ficoll 400), and spun at 30,000 rpm for 30 min. Vacuolar membranes were collected off the top, homogenized in Buffer C (10 mmMES/Tris, pH 6.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) and spun at 30,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing vacuole membranes was resuspended in native gel sample buffer and stored at −80 °C until needed. For membrane association experiments, thawed membranes were combined with vma3Δ cytosolic extract and incubated in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 for 25 min at 30 °C. The membranes were pelleted at high speed in a microcentrifuge for 1.5 min, and the supernatant fraction was moved to a separate tube. Some supernatant/pellet pairs were brought up in Laemmli buffer and examined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Strains bearing disruptions in single VMAgenes assemble subcomplexes of the peripheral V1 sector. To demonstrate that the intermediate subcomplexes previously characterized were on the assembly pathway, we developed an in vitroreconstitution protocol. Preliminary experiments consisted of mixing extracts from vma4Δ and vma8Δ. These extracts were chosen because the former accumulates complex IV and the latter accumulates complex III, complexes which contain mutually exclusive subunits. Mixing crude extracts containing these complexes resulted in formation of complex II in a divalent cation-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). We examined the effect of different anions and cations on complex II formation and observed that Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ were all effective, whereas Zn2+ was ineffective (Fig.1 B). In fact, ZnCl2 caused the complete loss of complexes III and IV when combined with extracts containing these complexes (data not shown). Both MgCl2 and MgOAc2 were effective, suggesting that no specific anion is necessary for assembly. Occasionally, we observed weak assembly with NaCl, but the signal from complex II was faint and inconsistent. Because there is 1 mm EDTA in our extract buffer, we suspect that 5 mm Na+ may compete weakly and release enough endogenous divalent cations to effect some limited reconstitution. To show that the ATPase-specific subcomplexes were responsible for the appearance of complex II, we did a titration ofvma4Δ extract versus vma8Δ extract (Fig.2). The formation of complex II clearly depends upon both extracts, with maximal reconstitution occurring when the extracts are at near equal proportions. Likewise, complex III and IV both disappear as they become limiting. It is interesting to note that complex VI (Vma7p, Vma8p) does not decrease significantly until complex IV (Vma1p, Vma2p, Vma7p, Vma8p) has first been consumed, suggesting that complex IV is a more direct precursor to complex II than is complex VI. Under the conditions where complex III becomes limiting, we see the formation of a new complex, designated complex Q. This complex only appears in reconstitutions where vma4Δ is one of the partners and may be an intermediate complex between IV and II. It runs at a position nearly identical to complex III. This complex is only weakly and transiently detectable relative to the other complexes observed, making complete analysis of its composition difficult. Because the assembly was dependent on the presence of Mg2+, we surmised it would be possible to gather kinetic data by stopping the assembly with the further addition of EDTA. Reactions were prepared by mixing two extracts on ice and then started with the addition of MgCl2(5 mm final) and the transfer to either ice or a 30 °C waterbath. Aliquots were taken at given time points and transferred to iced tubes containing EDTA (10 mm final concentration). From quantitation of native gels (Fig. 3), it can be seen that the assembly of complex II is temperature-dependent and occurs with a half-time of <5 min at 30 °C. We wished to know if some amount of in vivo assembly or modification was required for in vitro assembly to occur. To test this, we attempted reconstitutions with all possible combinations of extracts, and the results are summarized in Table II. All combinations were able to support formation of complex II, except for vma4Δ × vma10Δ and occasionallyvma1Δ × vma2Δ (see below). Kinetics of assembly in all positive combinations were similar to thevma4Δ × vma8Δ cross, with half-times of ∼5 min (data not shown). The vma4Δ × vma10Δcombination, which completely lacks complex III ab initio, does not support formation of complex II under any conditions tested. However, we have observed that the steady-state levels of Vma4p are extremely low in vma10Δ cells and that Vma4p is rapidly degraded in this strain.2 Thus, levels of Vma4p may be the limiting factor. However, assembly of this complex may depend upon conditions found only in the intact cell.Table IIComplex II assembly in different extract combinationsSecond extractFirst extractvma1Δvma2Δvma4Δvma7Δvma8Δvma10Δvma1Δ−±++++vma2Δ−++++vma4Δ−++−vma7Δ−++vma8Δ−+vma10Δ− Open table in a new tab Because we observed reassembly in most cases, even those where there were no pre-existing large complexes in either of the starting extracts, it remained an open question whether or not complex II assembles directly from subcomplexes or from individual subunits that became available as the subcomplexes dissociate. In particular, we decided to examine if complex IV is competent for further assembly without dissociation. To examine this, we employed the epitope-tagged Vma7p (4Graham L.A. Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25974-25977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to label complex IV as shown in the scheme in Fig. 4 A. By creating tagged and untagged complex IV and then complementing itin vitro with vma8Δ extract containing untagged or tagged Vma7p, respectively, we could determine if complex IV was dissassembled because its Vma7p would mix with that in the total reaction. The presence of the tagged Vma7p causes a slight shift in the position of complex IV (Fig. 4 B, right panel, lane 1 versus lane 2) and the position of complex II (Fig. 4 B,right panel, lanes 5 and 8 versus lanes 6 and7). There is also the appearance of an additional signal below complex VI. The tagged Vma7p is found in complex II only when it begins in complex IV (Fig. 4 B, right panel versus left panel, lanes 5 and 8). Tagged Vma7p is excluded from complex II when complex IV in the reaction contains only untagged Vma7p (Fig. 4 B, right panel versus left panel, lanes 6 and 7). Levels of tagged Vma7p were comparable in the extracts from the strains in which this construct was expressed (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that complex IV is a bonafide intermediate on the pathway to formation of complex II and that dissociation of complex IV does not occur to any appreciable extent prior to complex II assembly. We also note a similar result for complex VI; free Vma7pHA does not replace Vma7p that is present in a complex with Vma8p (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). To demonstrate that complex II was not a dead-end product itself, we undertook experiments to show it could assemble on isolated vacuolar membranes containing V0. We prepared membranes from vma2Δ, which have been shown to contain V0 without peripheral subunits (6Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We also prepared vacuolar membranes from vma3Δ, which do not contain V0, as a control. Cytosolic extract fromvma3Δ, which contains large quantities of complex II, was combined with these membranes both in the presence (Fig.5) and absence (data not shown) of MgCl2. We observed that MgCl2 was necessary for association with the membrane. After a 25-min incubation at 30 °C, membranes were pelleted and examined by immunoblot for the presence of V1subunits. Association with the membrane is dependent upon both cytosol containing complex II and membranes containing V0. The membranes fromvma2Δ show the presence of representative V1subunits found in complex II. Membrane binding is specific as evidenced by the absence of complex II subunits from the vma3Δmembranes. The membranes from vma2Δ also bring down Vma13p, a protein that has been shown to be necessary for activity but not assembly of the V-ATPase (7Ho M.N. Hirata R. Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18286-18292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of native gels with antibodies to Vma13p gave equivocal results (data not shown); it may be a component of complex II, but it does not appear to be associated with any other complex. Interestingly, Vma5p is not associated with the membrane, which may explain our inability to detect activity from these membranes (data not shown). The V-ATPase has been observed to assemble without this subunit in other systems although its presence does enhance the level of activity (8Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the yeast vma5Δstrain, no V-ATPase activity is detected, and the V1subunits are found assembled but not attached to the membrane (2Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 9Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vma5p may be involved in a transient interaction, necessary for attachment and full activity but not necessary for maintenance of a stable V1V0 association. Our data suggest that complex II is capable of assembly onto the V0 sector of the V-ATPase. Under our standard conditions for reconstitution, we found weak assembly of complex II from thevma1Δ × vma2Δ combination. Upon further examination, it was found that assembly of complex II fromvma1Δ × vma2Δ could be enhanced by the addition of 1 mm ATP. Measurement of assembly kinetics with MgATP, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ reveal both a lag and lower overall assembly without added ATP (Fig.6). Because the extracts have not been depleted for triphosphonucleotides, there may be residual ATP available to support limited reconstitution in the absence of added ATP. Attempts to deplete the extracts with apyrase and hexokinase did abolish assembly (data not shown), although subsequent add-back of ATP was impossible due to the presence of the scavenger. ATP analogues such as ATPγS and AMP-PNP showed no significant effect by themselves and did not show any competition at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 times the ATP concentration (data not shown). Interestingly, the divalent cation dependence for vma1Δ × vma2Δ is ion-specific and parallels reported preferences of divalent cations for ATPase activity (10Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tognoli L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 12Wang Z.-Q. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21957-21965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Okamoto M. Hiratani N. Arai K. Ohkuma S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine if ATP binding at the catalytic site was important to formation of complex II, we examined the ability of N-ethyl maleimide to inhibit assembly. NEM reacts specifically and irreversibly with a cysteine residue in the active site on Vma1p (14Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recombination reaction of vma1Δ × vma2Δ, which was first treated with NEM followed by ATP showed no reconstitution, whereas if first treated with ATP, weak reconsititution was observed (Fig. 7 A). More significantly, if the deletion extracts were treated separately, pretreatment ofvma2Δ (containing Vma1p) with NEM abolishes reconstitution while pretreatment of vma1Δ (containing Vma2p) with NEM is still capable of assembly (Fig. 7 B). This strongly suggests that binding of ATP at a functional catalytic site is necessary for assembly of the V1 complex since the cytosolic constituents of these two extracts should be identical except for the specific Vma proteins. As our revised model makes clear, this can be elegantly coordinated with the favored mechanistic model, the Boyer binding-change mechanism. Biosynthesis and assembly of multimeric proteins into their quaternary structures must be regulated by both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. The stability of complex II suggests that it is a thermodynamic trap, making it the dominant complex in wild-type cells and also allowing us to form it in vitro. We do not see complex IV form in vitro, even under conditions where we assume it must be a transient intermediate (e.g. thevma1Δ × vma2Δ reaction) because its equilibrium favors dissociation into smaller complexes or individual subunits unless it can further assemble to complex II. Attempts to form complex IV in vitro (vma4Δvma7Δ ×vma4Δvma8Δ) were unsuccessful (data not shown). Once formed, the attachment and detachment of complex II to the membrane sector would then have an equilibrium independent of the levels of individual subunits. Assembly and disassembly of the V1V0 has been proposed as a mechanism of regulation (15Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is supported by the hyperassembly of V1onto V0 in cells with point mutations in V0sector subunits that abolish function but not assembly (16Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This equilibrium would be regulated by other subunits, e.g.Vma5p, which is not necessary for assembly of V1 but is required for assembly on the membrane in vivo and is involved in glucose deprivation-mediated modification of the V1 following detachment from the membrane sector. 3J. Tomashek, unpublished data. Interestingly, cytosolic V1 complexes, which apparently do not exchange with membrane-bound complexes, have been observed in tissue culture cells (17Myers M. Forgac M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). What the role of such complexes might be and whether they exist in yeast remain to be determined. In contrast, assembly steps from individual subunits to complex II depend on temperature, divalent cation, and nucleotide. At 30 °C, our kinetic data indicate that most combinations of deletion strains assemble with roughly equal half-times (∼5 min) although there is a tendency for extracts containing higher order complexes to show faster assembly (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 6). At lower temperatures, measurable differences in assembly rates may appear and reveal key steps where kinetic control assumes a larger role. We have expanded our previous assembly models to consider these data (Fig. 8). In addition to our data which support the model, we favor it because of its similarity to the Boyer binding-change model of F-type ATP synthase catalysis (18Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a mechanism which has been proposed for the V-type enzymes as well (19Kasho V.N. Boyer P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8708-8711Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Boyer model proposes three sites, catalytically equivalent over time but instantaneously nonequivalent. We hypothesize that these three possible states (MgATP bound (T), MgADP/Pi bound (D), and open (O)) are not energetically equivalent. Thus, if assembly begins with the association of Vma1p and Vma2p to form the catalytic site (found predominantly on Vma1p but shared by both), one of these three states may be preferred, and an accumulation of dimers in one state would result. The suggestion that these two subunits associate to form a catalytic site is supported by recent evidence that these two subunits have low but detectable ATPase activity higher than either individual subunit (20Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, our own two-hybrid data indicate that Vma1p and Vma2p can interact independent of other subunits. Here, we propose that this interaction nucleates around the catalytic site of the heterodimer and suggest that MgATP stabilizes this dimerization. Thus, Vma1p-T-Vma2p is the most favored of the three possible initial complexes. Association with another subunit or subcomplex, in our model complex VI, would convert Vma1p-T-Vma2p into a new state stabilized by both hydrolysis of the nucleotide and incorporation of the new subunits into the growing complex. We prefer a model where association of the two subcomplexes (Vma1p-T-Vma2p and VI) would precede hydrolysis of ATP. In our model, complex VI acts as a nucleotidase activating factor, similar to GTPase activating proteins. After the catalytic step, complex VI (associated now with Vma1p-D-Vma2p) is situated to bind another Vma1p-T-Vma2p dimer from the cytosolic pool. The result is the formation of complex IV, which now has two catalytic sites each in a different energetic state defined by their nucleotide contents and interactions with complex VI. Complex III (Vma4p-Vma10p) may now interact with the Vma1p-D-Vma2p portion of complex IV, and stimulate release of the nucleotide and phosphate. In this sense, complex III is a nucleotide exchange factor. Release of ADP and Pi, in turn, allows hydrolysis to proceed at the second site, and thus the core subunits become positioned to receive the third Vma1p-T-Vma2p dimer. The final complex now has the three different sites in the correct energetic states necessary for catalysis to commence. The complete V1 might be regarded as three ATPases rotating around a complex of hydrolysis activating and nucleotide exchange factors. This model also accommodates an explanation for why ATP analogues have no apparent effect on assembly. The ATP-bound site is, based on the Boyer model, predicted to be of extremely high affinity. However, this may be true only for the ATP-bound site in the complete enzyme,i.e. of the last site added during assembly (incorporation of which makes the site “tight”). The Vma1p-T-Vma2p free dimer may have a low affinity and high exchange rate for nucleotide. Thus, in the absence of ATP, the analogues would not support assembly because they cannot be hydrolyzed. In the presence of ATP, the analogues would compete at high enough concentration but not block assembly, even if they were incorporated into the final “tight” site (although this would poison the enzyme). In our experiments, we are not able to eliminate completely endogenous ATP. NEM, which binds covalently and irreversibly, does block assembly. What about complexes I and V? Complex V, seen in significant steady-state amounts only from vma4Δ andvma10Δ extracts, disappears very rapidly at 30 °C or when combined with other extracts, and thus could not be followed in our assays. Complex I appears in the absence of Vma7p, a subunit which we have implicated in early assembly events. Because complex I is very unstable, we believe it may be an artifactual complex that assembles incorrectly, accepting Vma8p alone in lieu of complex VI. As a result, the catalytic dimers would all be in the Vma1p-T-Vma2p configuration, or possibly a combination of Vma1p-T-Vma2p and Vma1p-O-Vma2p, if complex III is able to release ATP from the second site incorporated. Because the energetic states in complex I would be discoordinated, disassembly of this complex may be necessary for subsequent correct assembly to occur. Therefore, complex I may be the dead end of an artifactual pathway that occurs only because of the absence of Vma7p. Our assembly system is different from previously described reconstitution systems from plants (21Ward J.M. Sze H. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), animals (20Xie X.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30980-30985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Puopolo K. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14836-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and yeast (6Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in three significant ways. First, we do not rely on chemical treatment (e.g. nitrate, iodide, or urea) to break apart the V-ATPase, a treatment which may chemically modify the enzyme (23Dschida W.J.A. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1557-1563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Instead, we begin with subunits and partially assembled complexes in a physiological milieu. Second, we are working with crude extracts, whereas other reconstitution has been done with purified enzymes and heterologously expressed subunits. Thus, we cannot exclude the involvement of factors apart from the ATPase subunits themselves. Third, we have been as yet unable to recover activity, while other systems have obtained detectable yields of activity from dialyzed mixtures of subunits. However, we expect with further attenuation to be able to recover activity and identify the specific factors responsible. Reassembly in other systems is achieved in the absence of Mg2+ and ATP and at 4 °C, albeit after long incubation and dialysis. From the results in our system, we believe assembly of the V1 complex is an ordered process that recapitulates its proposed functional mechanism. We hope that further experiments will provide greater insight regarding the validity of this provocative ATPase assembly model. We thank Dr. Nathan Nelson for the gift of the vmaΔ strains and plasmid YPN1VMA7 and Drs. Laurie Graham and Tom Stevens for pLG20 and antisera to HA-epitope and Vma13p."

Thus it is of interest to know what signaling pathways are utilized by this receptor. Previously, we showed that activation of D4 receptors in a mouse mesencephalic neuronal cell line (MN9D) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a pertussis toxin-sensitive (Ptx-sensitive) fashion. Of the known Ptx-sensitive G-protein α subunits, MN9D-expressed Gαi2, GαoA, and GαoB; however, none of these coupled to the D4 receptor. Using a low stringency polymerase chain reaction cloning method, we found an additional Ptx-sensitive G-protein cone transducin (Gαt2) expressed in the MN9D cells. We also found that Gαt2 mRNA is highly expressed in rat mesencephalic tissue. To test the hypothesis that the D4 receptor couples to Gαt2, we cotransfected MN9D cells with the D4 receptor and a mutagenized Ptx-resistant Gαt2 subunit (mGαt2). Application of the dopaminergic agonist quinpirole to cotransfected cells inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the presence or absence of Ptx. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that the D4 dopamine receptor functionally couples to a specific G-protein and that a non-opsin-like receptor can couple with a transducin subunit.

Dopamine is a major neurotransmitter in a wide variety of organisms. In mammalian brain, dopamine modulates motor, affective, cognitive, and neuroendocrine functions. There are five cloned dopamine receptors, D1–5, that can be distinguished by pharmacological and physiological criteria (1Kebabian J.W. Calne D.B.

The D4 receptor exhibits a high affinity for clozapine, the prototype for a new class of antipsychotic drugs with reduced extrapyramidal side effects (8Van Tol H.H.M. Bunzow J.R. Guan H.-C.

This is in keeping with its distribution in limbic and cortical brain regions as well as its relative absence in striatal regions (6O'Malley K.L. Harmon S. Tang L. Todd R.D.

Nature. 1993; 365: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In rat striatum, treatment for 1 month with the antipsychotic haloperidol elevates the density of D4 receptors by about 2-fold, whereas D2 and D3 are only modestly affected (11Schoots O. Seeman P. Guan H.-C. Paterson A.D. Van Tol H.H.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Characterization of the signal transduction pathways of D4and other dopamine receptors in vivo has been difficult because of the heterogeneity of tissue and cell types as well as the lack of truly selective agonists and antagonists. Transiently or stably expressed D4 receptors in several cell lines show similar binding characteristics and effects of guanine nucleotides on agonist binding (8Van Tol H.H.M. Bunzow J.R. Guan H.-C.

For example, in HEK and CHO cells transfected with the D4 receptor, forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation is reduced by the D2, D3, and D4receptor agonist, quinpirole (8Van Tol H.H.M. Bunzow J.R.

Previous studies in our laboratory found that D4 receptors are present in the photoreceptor layer of mouse retina and that dopaminergic agonists reduce light-sensitive cAMP levels with a D4-like pharmacological profile (16Cohen A.I. Todd R.D. Harmon S. O'Malley K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12093-12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that D4 receptors inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a dopaminergic cell line, MN9D (17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the G-protein(s) that couples to the D4 receptor, MN9D cells were cotransfected with D4 and a pertussis toxin-resistant (Ptx-resistant) 1The abbreviations used are: Ptx, pertussis toxin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; mGαt2, mutagenized Ptx-resistant Gαt2 subunit; RT, reverse transcriptase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; IBMX, 3-isobutyl1-methylxanthine. mutant of Gαi2, Gαi3, GαoA (17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar), or GαoB. 2C. O'Hara, R. D. Todd, and K. L. O'Malley, unpublished data. However, none of the G-protein α subunits tested could rescue receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation from Ptx treatment. Based on this result, we attempted to clone additional G-protein α subunits from these cells using PCR-based strategies. Here we show that cone transducin (Gαt2) is expressed in MN9D cells and demonstrate that it couples to the D4 receptor. All enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Promega (Madison, WI). The expression vectors pcDNA1/neo and pHook-2 were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Eticlopride, spiperone, (+)-butaclamol, (−)-quinpirole, forskolin, and pertussis toxin were from Research Biochemical Inc. (Wayland, MA). G418, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and LipofectAMINE reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). [3H]Spiperone was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Four degenerate primers were designed from conserved regions of the G-protein α subunit family, Gαi, Gαo, and Gαt. These included amino acids STIVKQM (o-865, 5′-AG(C/T)ACIAT(C/T)GT(G/C)AA(A/G)CAGATGAA-3′), KKWIHCF (o-967, 5′-AA(A/G)AA(A/G)TGGATCCACTGCTT(C/T)GA-3′), NPKDCGLF (o-965, 5′-A(G/A)AA(G/A)AG(C/G)CC(A/G)CAGTC(T/C)TT(C/G)AGGTT-3′), and HMTCATD (o-966, 5′-GTGTCIGT(G/A)GC(G/A)CAIGTCATGTG-3′) (19Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides made to NPKDCGLF (o-965) and HMTCATD (o-966) were in the antisense orientation. Total MN9D RNA was reverse-transcribed using primer o-965 and then amplified using primers o-865 and o-965 (94 °C, 1 min; 50 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 3 min; 30 cycles). First round PCR products were similarly amplified using the internal primers o-966 and o-967. The isolated PCR fragments were subcloned into plasmid pCR II (Invitrogen) and sequenced (Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Total RNA was isolated from various tissues and MN9D cells as described (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Gαt2-specific messages (21Kubo M. Hirano T. Kakinuma M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were detected using primers o-955 (5′-TTCTCTAGAGCTGGAGAAGAAGCTG-3′, identical to nucleotides 58–74) and o-978 (5′-CTAGAGTGGACATGGCTC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 262–278) at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles. In other experiments, primers o-955 and o-956 (5′-TATTCTAGATGGCCAGGATGGACTG-3′, complementary to nucleotides 241–258) were used. Products were electrophoresed, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with a radiolabeled internal primer o-1053 (5′-ATTGTCAAACAGATGAAGAT-3′). Image analysis was performed using a PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The mRNA levels were normalized for equal amounts of the 18 S fragment of ribosomal RNA (22Chan Y.L. Gutell R. Noller H.F. Wool I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described (6O'Malley K.L. Harmon S. Tang L. Todd R.D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar). An expression vector containing the bovine Gαt2 cDNA was kindly provided by N. Gautam (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). A Ptx-resistant Gαt2 clone was constructed by introducing a cysteine-to-serine change four residues from the carboxyl terminus (23Taussig R. Sanchez S. Rifo M. Gilman A.G. Belardetti F. Neuron. 1992; 8: 799-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using standard techniques for site-directed mutagenesis (24Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) and the primers o-983 (5′-ACCTCAA(A/G)GACAGCGG(A/G)CTCTTCT-3′, nucleotides 1045–1066) and its complement, o-984 (25Lerea C.L. Somers D.E. Hurley J.B. Klock I.B. Bunt-Milan A.H. Science. 1986; 234: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The resulting clone (mGαt2) was confirmed by sequence analysis. MN9D cells (26Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffman P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Choi H.K. Won L. Roback J.D. Wainer B.H. Heller A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8943-8947Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were maintained and transfected as described previously (17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Each stable subclone was screened for the rat D4 receptor and mGαt2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR assays. Several rounds of further subcloning by limiting dilution were performed to establish homogeneous cell populations. Membrane preparation, receptor binding assays, and cellular cAMP measurements were performed exactly as described (18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Saturation binding data were analyzed using programs from Lundon Software (Chagrin Falls, OH). For Ptx treatment, cells were incubated overnight in 50 ng/ml Ptx, which was previously shown to be a maximally effective dose (18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using the Capture Tec pHook-2 kit (Invitrogen) were performed according to manufacturer protocol. pHook-2 encodes a fusion protein consisting of a signal peptide, a single chain antibody against the hapten, phOx, and a transmembrane domain to anchor the antibody in the plasma membrane (28Hoogenboom H.R.

Nature. 1984; 312: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 30Coloma M.J. Hastings A. Wims L.A. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 152: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). pHook-2-expressing cells can be isolated from whole cultures magnetically using beads coated with phOx. All data were normally distributed. For multiple comparisons within a given cell line, one-way analysis of variance was used to estimate significance followed by post hoc t tests corrected for multiple comparisons by the method of Bonferroni. For the single comparisons using a single cell line, pairedt tests were used. All analyses were adjusted for inequality of variances when appropriate. All analyses were completed using the SAS suite of programs (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Previously, we showed that the G-protein α subunits Gαi2 and GαoA that are expressed in MN9D cells (18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar) do not couple to D4 receptors in order to decrease cAMP levels (17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies have also ruled out coupling to Gαi3(17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar), Gαi1, and GαoB. 2C. O'Hara, R. D. Todd, and K. L. O'Malley, unpublished data. To determine whether other known or novel Gα subunits were present in this cell line, we used a low stringency nested PCR approach. Sets of degenerate primers derived from conserved domains among the Ptx-sensitive Gα subunits were synthesized and used to amplify cDNA derived from MN9D cells. PCR products were subcloned and transformed then randomly selected. Clones were further identified by sequence analysis. As shown in Table I, Gαi2 and GαoAsequences were recovered (18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a single Gαi3clone. No Gαi1 or Gαt1 clones were detected in this screen (not shown). Unexpectedly, 40% of the clones sequenced corresponded to mouse Gαt2. To verify that Gαt2 was expressed in MN9D cells, we used mouse-specific primer pairs to amplify Gαt2 mRNA. The predicted Gαt2 band was seen at a level comparable to that present in mouse retina (Fig. 1 A).Table IResults of screening MN9D cells with degenerate oligonucleotides from conserved Gαi, Gαo and GαtdomainsPrimersGαoA/GαoBGαi2Gαi3Gαt2865/967011115976/9771201955/9561000952/9532200The G-protein subtypes were identified by sequence analysis. The primer pairs used would not have distinguished GαoA or GαoB. Open table in a new tab The G-protein subtypes were identified by sequence analysis. The primer pairs used would not have distinguished GαoA or GαoB. Because MN9D cells were derived from dopaminergic mesencephalic cells (26Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffman P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Choi H.K. Won L. Roback J.D. Wainer B.H. Heller A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8943-8947Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we examined mesencephalic tissue as well as other central nervous system and peripheral tissues for the presence and relative abundance of Gαt2 transcripts. As suggested by its presence in MN9D cells, Gαt2 mRNA was abundant in the mesencephalon as well as in the retina (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, detectable but relatively low levels of Gαt2 transcripts were seen in other central nervous system and peripheral tissues, with the exception of the kidney, where Gαt2 mRNA was more abundantly expressed. Taken together, these data suggest that Gαt2is expressed outside of the retina, where it may couple to non-opsin-like receptors. To test the hypothesis that D4 receptors can couple to Gαt2, we cotransfected MN9D cells with the rat D4 receptor and a Ptx-resistant mGαt2. In this paradigm, Gαt2 has been mutated such that the expressed protein is incapable of being ADP-ribosylated, thus rendering it insensitive to Ptx (23Taussig R. Sanchez S. Rifo M. Gilman A.G. Belardetti F. Neuron. 1992; 8: 799-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). If D4 receptors couple to Gαt2 to inhibit cAMP accumulation, then cotransfection with the mutagenized Gαt2 should rescue the receptor-stimulated inhibition of cAMP accumulation from Ptx treatment. Cotransfected, stable cell lines (17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar) were characterized by RT-PCR to confirm D4 receptor expression (not shown) and Gαt2 (Fig. 2 A). Because the primers chosen were from the bovine Gαt2 3′-flanking region, the endogenous mouse cone message would not have been detected. Next, we used an indirect approach to look for mGαt2protein expression because we were unable to obtain antibodies directed against bovine Gαt2. Since Gαt2 cDNA was expressed together with the fusion protein in the pHook vector system, we measured expression of the pHook cell surface antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, when magnetic beads coated with phOx hapten were added to cell cultures, the D4 receptor cells transfected with the Gαt2/phOx vector were surrounded by beads, whereas parental cells were not. Finally, the level of D4 receptor expression was determined by saturation binding using increasing concentrations of [3H]spiperone, a D2-like dopamine receptor antagonist, and (±)-butaclamol to define nonspecific binding. [3H]Spiperone bound to MN9D-D4/mGαt2 cell membranes in a saturable fashion with a B max of 3.42 ± 0.36 pmol/mg of protein (mean ± S.D., n = 3) and aK d of 0.56 ± 0.40 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3) (Fig. 2 C). No specific [3H]spiperone binding was detected in untransfected MN9D cells (18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that agonist stimulation of D4 receptors in MN9D cells inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 30–40% (17O'Hara C.M. Tang L. Taussig R. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 354-360PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows comparable and significant inhibition of cAMP accumulation in cells with or without Gαt2. D4-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation could be blocked by overnight pretreatment with 50 ng/ml Ptx (Fig. 3 Aand Ref. 18Tang L. Todd R.D. Heller A. O'Malley K.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in the cotransfected MN9D-D4/mGαt2 cells, Ptx could no longer block the effects of agonist treatment (Fig. 3 B). Thus the D4 receptor can couple to Gαt2, making it, to our knowledge, the first non-opsin-like receptor to couple to this retinal-enriched G-protein. Transducins are known to couple to cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) leading to decreased cyclic nucleotide levels and closure of cation-specific channels in the plasma membrane (31Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that D4-mediated inhibition of cAMP levels is achieved via coupling to Gαt2 followed by activation of a cAMP PDE, we performed cAMP accumulation assays in the presence of several PDE inhibitors. We first tested 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a non-selective PDE inhibitor. However, IBMX did not block the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation by quinpirole (n = 4) nor did 8-methoxymethyl-IBMX (25 μm), a specific inhibitor of PDE type I, trequinsin (10 nm), a PDE type III specific inhibitor, rolipram (10 μm), a type IV inhibitor, or a type V inhibitor (4-{[3′,4′-(methylenedioxy)benzyl]amino}-6-methoxyquinazoline, 1 μm). We have also looked for but not found any changes in cGMP levels associated with receptor stimulation. Thus the downstream target of D4 receptor-activated Gαt2 (or its associated βγ dimer) in MN9D cells is unclear at present. PCR-based cloning techniques allowed us to survey the repertoire of Ptx-sensitive G-protein α subunits in the mesencephalic-derived MN9D cell line (26Choi H.K. Won L.A. Kontur P.J. Hammond D.N. Fox A.P. Wainer B.H. Hoffman P.C. Heller A. Brain Res. 1991; 552: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Choi H.K. Won L. Roback J.D. Wainer B.H. Heller A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8943-8947Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gαt2 was isolated with about the same frequency as Gαi2 using several different primer sets. Gαt2 was also expressed in nontransfected mesencephalic tissue as well as other central nervous system and peripheral tissue. Cellular expression of a Ptx-resistant mutant of Gαt2 restored agonist-stimulated inhibition of cAMP accumulation in D4-expressing cells in which the endogenous G-proteins were uncoupled from the receptor by pretreatment with Ptx. This is the first report of a non-opsin-like receptor coupling to a transducin as well as the first identification of a specific G-protein coupled to the D4 dopamine receptor. Previously, we have shown that the D4 receptor is most abundantly expressed in the inner segment layer of mouse photoreceptors (16Cohen A.I. Todd R.D. Harmon S. O'Malley K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12093-12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, in this tissue, the light-sensitive pool of cAMP can be eliminated in the dark by application of ligands with the rank order of affinities characteristic of the D4 receptor. Thus,in vivo the D4 receptor is physiologically coupled to the modulation of cAMP levels. Our finding that the D4 receptor can couple to Gαt2 in transfected cells raises the possibility that this also occurs within the retina. Numerous studies have suggested that Gαt2 is specifically expressed in the retina (25Lerea C.L. Somers D.E. Hurley J.B. Klock I.B. Bunt-Milan A.H. Science. 1986; 234: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Zigman et al. (32Zigman J.M. Westermark G.T. Lamendola J. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found Gαt2 mRNA in pancreatic islet cells, adrenal gland, and pituitary. The presence of Gαt2in immortalized cells from the central nervous system as well as in various central nervous system and peripheral tissues confirms and extends these observations. Interestingly, the D4 receptor is expressed in some but not all of these regions. For example in rats, D4 receptors are present in kidney (33Sun D. Schafer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F391-F400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and retina (16Cohen A.I. Todd R.D. Harmon S. O'Malley K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12093-12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) but not in mesencephalic tissues (6O'Malley K.L. Harmon S. Tang L. Todd R.D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 137-146PubMed Google Scholar). Given the high level of Gαt2 in the latter region (Fig. 1 B), this suggests that Gαt2 can couple to other receptors as well. What is the function of Gαt2 outside of the retina? Within photoreceptors, Gαt1 and Gαt2activate cGMP PDE, leading to decreased cGMP levels and closure of cation-specific channels in the plasma membrane (31Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies by Margolskee and co-workers (34Ruiz-Avila L. Mclaughlin S.K. Wildman D. Mckinnon P.J. Robichon A. Spickofsky N. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35Kolesnikov S.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have shown that rod transducin is also present in vertebrate taste cells, where it appears to activate a cAMP-specific PDE. In this cell type, phosphodiesterase-mediated degradation of cAMP appears to activate a cyclic nucleotide-suppressive channel, leading to depolarization and Ca2+ influx (35Kolesnikov S.S. Margolskee R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, rod transducin also appears to be functionally important outside of the retina, although the receptor to which it is coupling has yet to be identified. We tested the hypothesis that D4-mediated inhibition of cAMP accumulation is achieved via coupling to Gαt2followed by activation of a cAMP PDE by performing cAMP accumulation assays in the presence of several PDE inhibitors. To date, however, none of the PDE inhibitors tested appeared to have any effect. We have also looked for but not found any changes in cGMP levels associated with receptor stimulation. Conceivably, the β/γ subunits associated with Gαt2 might modulate adenylyl cyclase activity, as observed with β/γ subunits associated with Gαi or Gαo (36Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IBMX-insensitive PDEs might be involved. Further investigations are needed to determine what the downstream signaling molecule is in MN9D cells. Although D1 and D2 dopamine receptors appear to mediate most of the known biological effects of dopamine receptors in the central nervous system, the presence and expression patterns of the less abundantly expressed receptors such as D4 make their function all the more intriguing. The mechanisms mediating the effects of D4 are of particular interest. Since the D4receptor may be involved in schizophrenia, knowledge of its signal transduction pathway might be of therapeutic importance as well. We gratefully acknowledge Drs. A. Heller, L. Won, and P. Hoffman not only for providing us with the MN9D cell line but also for their many insightful comments in using this system. We also thank Drs. N. Gautam and R. Reed for insightful discussions and J. M. Hickok for technical and statistical support."

Crystal structures of rat intestine FABP (I-FABP) and its complex with FA show that the hydrocarbon chain of the FA interacts directly with about 19 amino acid resides and several bound waters within this cavity (2Sacchettini J.C.

The net free energy for these steps for wild type I-FABP is approximately −10 kcal/mol (10Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

To understand how the amino acid residue-FA interactions revealed by the crystal structure contribute to the energy of binding we have used site-specific mutagenesis to alter amino acid residues within the binding cavity. Most mutagenesis studies aimed at understanding ligand binding interactions have relied on changes in affinity to determine which residues play important roles in the active site (13Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 14Mynarcik D.C. Yu G.Q. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2439-2442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the affinity is related to the free energy change (K d = (e − (ΔG 0/RT))) and, through ΔG 0 = ΔH 0 −TΔS 0, to the enthalpy and entropy changes of the binding reaction. 2Although the binding constants are given as dissociation constants (K d ), the thermodynamic parameters throughout the paper are for the association reaction as in our previous studies (10Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The parameters for association are simply the negative of those for dissociation. Because mutations alter both enthalpic and entropic contributions to ligand binding, the changes in the underlying molecular interactions may not be correlated with changes in affinity (15Sturtevant J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Dill K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 701-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the present study, therefore, we have determined the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy changes of binding for each mutant interacting with long chain FAs. Mutants were constructed by extension of overlapping oligonucleotides, which together spanned restriction endonuclease sites in I-FABP, and insertion of the resulting double-stranded DNA as described (17Richieri G.V.

E51A and F93A were expressed as inclusion bodies and were solubilized by denaturation in 4 m GdnHCl followed by renaturation by dialysis against a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mmNaHPO4, at pH 7.4. This buffer was also used in all the binding measurements. Protein purification and delipidation for all proteins was done as described (18Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

Measurements of the binding of FA to FABP were done by using ADIFAB fluorescence to monitor the binding of the sodium salts of the FA to each FABP at temperatures between 10 and 45 °C as described (10Richieri G.V.

For each combination of FA and FABP, a binding isotherm was measured for each temperature and in all cases showed a stoichiometry of 1 FA binding per FABP monomer. The temperature dependence of the K d values for each FA and FABP exhibited linear van't Hoff behavior, and ΔH 0 values were determined from the slopes of each of the van't Hoff plots. For the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3, ΔG 0 values were evaluated from theK d values measured at 25 °C, and −TΔS 0 was calculated as ΔG 0 − ΔH 0.Figure 3Thermodynamic parameter differences for Arg-106.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as compared with the 3-fold reduction observed in the present study, is likely the result of the inability of calorimetry to measure accurately the binding affinities of FA-FABP complexes (11Kurian E.

We substituted Ala for 16 of the 19 residues interacting with the FA in the cavity (Fig. 1 A), as well as Gln at residue 106. We also investigated Ala substitutions of the more distal amino acid residues shown in Fig. 1 B. FA binding to each mutant was measured as a function of temperature using the fluorescent probe ADIFAB (10Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

Dissociation constants (K d ) determined at 37 °C for binding of 6 long chain FA to the wild type protein and to each of the 24 mutants were found to range between 0.5 and 4500 nm (Table I and Fig. 3). These results show that substitution of single residues in I-FABP can result in proteins that bind with affinities ranging from 30-fold higher (Leu-72, Arg-106) to almost 30-fold lower (Met-18, Phe-68) than the wild type (WT) protein.Table IDissociation constants (K d ) for fatty acid binding to wild type and site-specific mutants of rat intestinal fatty acid-binding proteinFABP1-aWT is the wild type I-FABP, and single-letter designations are used to indicate the WT residue, amino acid sequence position, and the substituted amino acid residue for each mutant.PASAOALALNAAAWT2062790367200L72A10.528812R106A4124108L102A713122627Y117A524103520Q115A136194912760E51A1462383230244Y14A1482445121147W82A38256188155100F93A1916558310066Y70A301644177611322N11A321047151478383L78A271643243620572M21A533994227408424V60A451360182437624F17A562773211461205F47A8221804041168855F62A892713545215651162I23A94321865091109589D34A706524749313301590F55A1045424847813761515R126A14814835252012501550M18A1499336674816402300F68A510365878218345001890K d values were measured at 37 °C and are given in nm. Measurement standard deviations are approximately 10%.1-a WT is the wild type I-FABP, and single-letter designations are used to indicate the WT residue, amino acid sequence position, and the substituted amino acid residue for each mutant. Open table in a new tab K d values were measured at 37 °C and are given in nm. Measurement standard deviations are approximately 10%. From the temperature dependence of the K d values we determined the differences in enthalpy (ΔΔH 0), entropy (TΔΔS 0), and free energy (ΔΔG 0) of FA binding between each mutant and the WT protein. These results, arranged so that the ΔΔG 0 values for linoleate increase monotonically, are shown in Fig. 2 and demonstrate that changes in affinity, equivalent to ΔΔG 0values, are not correlated with ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0. This lack of correlation results because ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0 tend to compensate in these binding reactions. As a consequence, the mutation-induced changes in binding enthalpy and entropy are almost always larger than ΔΔG 0, so that relatively small mismatches in the enthalpy/entropy compensation can result in highly significant changes in binding affinity. A striking feature of these results is that the changes in affinity are not related uniquely to the changes in enthalpy and entropy. For example, although Ala substitutions for Leu-72, Arg-106, and Tyr-117 all result in substantial increases in affinity, the molecular interactions that generate these increases are different in each case. The increase in affinity for L72A is caused by an increase in ‖ΔH 0‖ with a smaller decrease in entropy, that for R106A is caused by a decrease in ‖ΔH 0‖ with a larger increase in entropy, and that for Y117A by both of these kind of changes, but generally with smaller magnitudes. At the other end of the scale, M18A and F68A have substantially lower affinities than the WT protein. This is achieved by quite large (>6 kcal/mol) decreases in ‖ΔH 0‖ with smaller increases in entropy for M18A but quite modest (<2 kcal/mol) changes in entropy and enthalpy, that are not quite compensatory, for Phe-68, which has the smallest affinity of any mutant. In the cases of Tyr-14, Leu-78, and Asn-11, Ala substitutions result in virtually no change in affinity and the appearance of no interaction between the FA and the WT residue. However, for Y14A and L78A, the lack of change in affinity results from quite large but virtually exactly compensating changes in enthalpy and entropy, although of opposite signs for the two sites. Only for N11A is the lack of a change in affinity consistent with virtually no change in the underlying molecular interactions. An especially clear example of the value of measuring binding enthalpy and entropy is provided by the results for Arg-106. The crystal structure of I-FABP suggests that electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate oxygens of the FA and the NH groups of Arg-106 contributes significantly to FA binding (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 12Jakoby M.G. Miller K.R. Toner J.J. Bauman A. Cheng L. Li E. Cistola D.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, elimination of these interactions by the R106A substitution results in an up to 28-fold increase in binding affinity (Table I and Fig. 3). Also shown in Fig. 3 are the results of a Gln substitution for Arg-106. This mutant, for which Gln-106 would be expected to have a reduced level of attractive electrostatic interactions relative to Arg-106, reveals at most a modest reduction in FA binding, with the exception of palmitate. Examination of Fig. 3, however, reveals that although ΔG 0 is decreased, increased, or unchanged by the Ala and Gln mutations, both these mutations result in large reductions (average of about 5 kcal/mol) in the enthalpy of binding. At the same time, an increase in entropy either compensates for (R106Q) or is significantly greater than (R106A) the loss in enthalpy. These results illustrate that using site-directed mutagenesis to assess the role of individual residues in ligand binding requires an accurate understanding of how the ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0 values are generated at the structural level. These results indicating significant increases in binding entropy for the Arg-106 mutants are consistent with the crystal structures of the WT and R106Q mutant complexed with oleate (9Eads J. Sacchettini J.C. Kromminga A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26375-26385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These structures reveal that for the C-5 to C-18 portion of the FA hydrocarbon chain, the conformation and degree of order are similar in the WT and R106Q mutant. However, C-4 to C-1 of oleate exhibits considerably greater disorder in R106Q than in the WT protein. This suggests that the loss of an attractive electrostatic interaction in the mutant, as reflected by the decrease in enthalpy of binding, is counteracted by an increase in entropy derived, at least in part, from the increase in disorder of C-4–C-1 of the FA. The somewhat ambiguous role of Arg-106 in FA binding raises the question of what other interactions are responsible for binding within the cavity. Analysis of the crystal structure suggests that FA binding is due to a “series of feeble forces” resulting from protein-FA interactions along the length of the FA (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Eads J. Sacchettini J.C. Kromminga A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26375-26385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 2 and Table II) are consistent with this notion because in all cases ‖ΔΔG 0‖ ≤ 2 kcal/mol. At the same time, however, the variation of ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0 for these mutants suggest that at the molecular level a wide spectrum of interactions contribute to FA binding, with many being quite strong (ΔΔH 0 > 5 kcal/mol). Several of the mutants illustrate that large enthalpy changes of either sign can occur even in the absence of apparent electrostatic interactions. For instance, an Ala substitution of Leu-102 results in an average 4.7 kcal/mol more favorable enthalpy while the enthalpy of the M18A mutant has a less favorable enthalpy by an average of about 6.5 kcal/mol. In contrast to both of these examples in which large changes in the underlying molecular interactions are reflected in large changes in binding, the Y14A mutant reveals almost no change in binding, but up to 6 kcal/mol of almost exactly compensating ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0.Table IIThermodynamic parameter differences between site-specific alanine mutants of amino acid residues in direct contact with bound FA and the WT I-FABPΔΔG0ΔΔH 0−TΔΔS 0PAOALAAAPAOALAAAPAOALAAAF68A2.11.91.71.41.71.11.4−10.40.80.32.4M18A*1.71.81.21.47.27.55.16−5.5−5.7−3.9−4.6F55A1.31.311.14.23.42.71.5−2.9−2.1−1.7−0.4I23A1.31.10.80.33.23.30.3−3.9−1.9−2.20.54.2F62A1.20.80.70.80.6−0.5−1−1.10.61.31.71.9F17A10.70.5−0.24.63.82.6−2.5−3.6−3.1−2.12.3V60A0.80.40.30.41.4−1.30.4−0.1−0.61.7−0.10.5L78A0.40.30.30.3−2.9−3.6−4.3−5.23.33.94.65.5F93A*0.20.3−0.1−0.91.42.33.6−1.3−1.21−3.70.4Y70A*0.40.10.20.21.3−2.3−1.1−1.6−0.92.41.31.8W82A*0.80.5−0.1−0.541.51−0.5−3.2−1−1.10Y14A0.20.1−0.3−0.23.54.64.86−3.3−4.5−5.1−6.2Y117A*−0.5−1.2−1.3−1.5−0.5−2.4−0.20.301.2−1.1−1.8L102A−0.7−1.5−1.5−1.5−4.6−3.9−5.4−6.13.92.43.94.6R106A*−0.6−1.7−2−25.93.23.20.9−6.5−4.9−5.2−2.9L72A*−1.5−1.6−2−1.8−3.21.4−5.8−3.51.7−33.81.7—2-aValues in this row are estimates of the WT thermodynamic parameters (ΔG 0, ΔH 0, and TΔS 0) calculated as: −∑ΔΔG i 0, −∑ΔΔHi0, ∑TΔΔ i 0, respectively, wherei represents each of the mutants in column 1.−8.1−3.30.62.7−27.8−18.1−7.312.119.711.87.9−9.4*2-bValues in this row are sums of a subset of mutants indicated by *.

Open table in a new tab The thermodynamic functions are for association of the fatty acid-protein complex. All values are in kcal/mol, and ΔΔG 0 and TΔΔS 0are calculated at 25 °C. If the thermodynamic parameter differences for each Ala substitution indicate the individual interaction energies between the FA and the amino acid residues for the WT protein, then the sum of the individual interactions should be comparable with the total binding energies for the WT protein. The energies of Fig. 2 and Table II reflect interactions only within the cavity, while the measured ΔG 0 values for binding include interactions involved in the desolvation step. A significant portion of the desolvation free energy is entropic (10Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the last row of Table IIshows the thermodynamic parameters with this contribution removed. As Table II indicates, the sums of the thermodynamic contributions for all of the mutants are significantly different from the measured ΔG 0, ΔH 0, andTΔS 0 values. That these sums do not equal the actual binding energies is not surprising because the ΔΔG 0, ΔΔH 0, andTΔΔS 0 values are generally not independent (16Dill K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 701-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and the values for the mutants may not accurately reflect the interactions in the WT protein (15Sturtevant J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Studies of the gene V protein of bacteriophage f1 suggest that additivity might be more accurate for well separated mutations (20Sandberg W.S. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8367-8371Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An improvement is obtained by restricting the summation for the I-FABP mutants to 7 well-separated residues out of the total 15 cavity residues (the asterisk row of TableII), but significant differences remain. In particular, the sums of the cavity enthalpies differ systematically with double bond number, although the measured binding enthalpy is virtually identical (−11 kcal/mol) for each of the 4 FA (Table II). This variation may reflect interactions internal to the FA that differ in the bound and free state, and this difference may be different for each of the FA (21Rich M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and would be consistent with a compensating entropy as discussed previously (10Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus accurate estimates of the FA's internal energy differences in the solvent and I-FABP bound states would help to determine whether summation over mutation-induced changes in thermodynamic parameters provides an accurate estimate of the total binding energetics within the cavity. Some of the substituted I-FABPs involved residues that are more distal to the FA binding site (Fig. 1 B). Perhaps the most interesting of these involves Arg-126, which appears to play a direct role in FA binding to all FABPs except intestine where it is more than 6.5 Å from the FA (3Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as Fig. 2 shows, R126A has a substantial effect on binding due to large ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0. Because very similar changes are produced by the D34A mutation (Fig. 2), and because Arg-126 forms an electrostatic interaction with Asp-34 (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26375-26385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the large effect on FA binding by both of these mutations suggests that this electrostatic bond is important, perhaps for the conformation of the binding cavity. Relatively small ΔΔH 0 andTΔΔS 0 at distal locations can also profoundly affect ligand binding as illustrated by Ala mutations of Phe-47 and Phe-68, which together with Phe-62 form a barrier between the interior and exterior of the protein and are ≥4.5 Å from the FA at the carboxylate end (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations result in substantial reductions in affinity and indeed the F68A mutation produced the largest ΔΔG 0 (∼1.9 kcal/mol) of all 24 mutants. These alterations of ΔG 0 are, however, achieved by relatively small (generally less than 2 kcal/mol) non-compensating changes in ΔH 0 andTΔS 0 (F68A is the only mutant not exhibiting enthalpy/entropy compensation). The quite small effect for the relatively neutral residue Asn-11, which is predicted to be involved in the initial binding step (2Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is >10 Å from the FA, demonstrates that not all residues affect FA binding. The ability of FABPs to discriminate among different FA is an important issue in FA metabolism. In general FA metabolism exhibits a high degree of FA specificity, distinguishing clearly among FA on the basis of chain length and saturation (for example, Ref. 22Cook H.W. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 141-169Google Scholar). Presumably, FA recognition by proteins occurs at various steps in FA metabolism. Although FA binding to FABPs does not reveal the kind of selectivity observed in cellular metabolism (18Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23918-23930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23495-23501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), FABPs might provide a good model of how selectivity can be built into FA recognition. Unfortunately, most of the mutants generated little change in binding specificity, and much of the specificity apparent in Table I (for example, K d values for all mutants are in the order SA<OA<LA<LNA) is a reflection of FA solubility differences (10Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Richieri G.V. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol.

However, a few of the mutants such as R106A, W82A, Y117A, Y14A, F93A, and M21A have significant effects on binding specificity. In the case of Trp-82, for example, the Ala mutation results in a monotonic increase in binding with double bond number for the 18-carbon series of FA, producing a 10-fold increase in binding of linolenate (18:3) relative to stearate (18:0). The molecular details of how these alterations are achieved are unclear, although the predominance of aromatic residues within the I-FABP binding cavity and the frequent deviations of arachidonate's (20:4) thermodynamic parameters relative to the other FA raise the possibility that the aromatic double bond interaction may play a role in modulating FA binding specificity."

These receptors are thought to participate in the fusion of carrier vesicles with their target membranes by facilitating both vesicle docking and bilayer interaction (1Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr.

SNAREs are found on both the vesicular compartment (v-SNAREs), as well as on the acceptor or target compartment (t-SNAREs), and at all levels of the secretory pathway.We have identified two proteins that act as v-SNAREs on carrier vesicles of the late secretory pathway in yeast.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Snc protein expression accumulate secretory vesicles and fail to secrete normally. In addition, these cells show conditional-lethal phenotypes that result from the blockage of vesicle fusion. Like their neuronal counterparts, Snc proteins are thought to interact physically with t-SNAREs from the plasma membrane to form a putative SNARE complex (9Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol.

Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have determined that Snc proteins are modified by the palmitoylation of unique cysteine residues located proximal to their transmembrane domains (15Couve A. Protopopov V. Gerst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5987-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is required to yield the mature form of the protein but is not necessary for exocytic function.Synaptobrevin/VAMP and Snc proteins are conserved type II membrane proteins. They consist of a variable region of ∼30 residues at the amino terminus, followed by a conserved region (∼60 residues) bearing two predicted amphipathic α-helices separated by a nonhelical spacer, and a single membrane-spanning domain at the carboxyl terminus (16Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmidt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar,17Trimble W.S. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1993; 87: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The variable and conserved regions are cytosolic, whereas the 3–4 residues adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain are likely to be intravesicular. The first helix of the conserved region of synaptobrevin/VAMP (known as helix 1 and designated here as “H1”) contains a signal for the targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles in PC12 cells (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The second helix of synaptobrevin/VAMP (known as helix 2 and designated here as “H2”) is thought to participate, along with H1, in the interaction with cognate t-SNAREs from the presynaptic membrane (e.g. SNAP-25 and syntaxins A and B), based uponin vitro studies (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 20Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These v- and t-SNARE interactions are thought to result from the formation of coiled-coil structures involving the amphipathic α-helices of the individual SNARE partners.To address whether specific regions within the synaptobrevin/VAMPs confer the SNARE-SNARE interactions that lead to exocytosis, we have used the yeast system to perform a structure/function analysis of the Snc v-SNAREs. By using genetic and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the ability of Snc proteins to confer exocytic function in vivo corresponds to their ability to interact genetically with components of the putative fusion complex (Sec17, Sec9, and Sso2). We also demonstrate that the H1 and H2 segments together mediate the exocytic functions of these v-SNAREs. In addition, there is a distinct requirement for the membrane-spanning domain but no requirement for the intravesicular and variable regions. The latter suggests that this region is unlikely to act in a fusogenic capacity, as proposed for the amino terminus of the hemagglutinin antigen (HA), a viral fusion protein bearing similar structural motifs (reviewed in Ref. 21Stegmann T. Helenius A. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 89-112Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONYeast Snc proteins are archetypal v-SNAREs of the late secretory pathway. These proteins share structural homology with members of the synaptobrevin/VAMP/cellubrevin family and engage in similar exocytic functions. Like their brethren, Snc proteins localize to secretory vesicles (3Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), interact with t-SNAREs from the plasma membrane (9, 10, and this study), and are likely to undergo a dynamic cycle of transport to, and retrieval from, the plasma membrane.Here we have demonstrated that the conserved amphipathic α-helical region (residues 32–85) is essential for conferring the exocytic functions of these v-SNAREs. Deletions or gross substitutions in either of the predicted H1 or H2 segments result in a complete loss of function of the proteins, although they appear to reach secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane. Thus, as was predicted by experiments performed in vitro with mammalian v- and t-SNAREs (18–20, and 33), it would seem likely that both helices are required for SNARE complexing in vivo. Although we cannot say whether the individual helices prefer specific t-SNARE partners, it appears that both helices can interact either with Sec9 or Sso2. This is based upon the result that Snc proteins lacking in either H1 or H2 are unable to suppress ts defects in either Sec9 or Sso2 and inhibit the growth ofsec9 and sso2 cells at permissive temperatures. These proteins, Snc1Δ31-50 and Snc1Δ57-81, appear to exert a dominant negative effect when overexpressed. Thus, it is possible that they compete with the native proteins in undergoing SNARE partnering but are unable to confer secretory functions. Interestingly, the Snc1Δ2-27 mutant was unable to confer suppression of the ts defects in either Sec9 or Sso2, unlike Snc1 or Snc1Δ2-17, suggesting that a portion of the variable domain aids in the rescue of the mutant t-SNAREs.Work by Hayashi et al. (19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the domains required for SNARE complex formation in vitro correlate well with the regions predicted to form α-helices. Specifically, synaptobrevin binding to the carboxyl-terminal third of syntaxin or SNAP-25 was shown to involve the entire conserved domain (residues 27–96) (19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Earlier studies also showed binary interactions between synaptobrevin/VAMP and syntaxin (33Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and SNAP-25 (20Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions of both the variable region as well as the transmembrane domain of synaptobrevin were found to have no deleterious effect upon complex formation and, in contrast, were found to enhance the interaction (19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Here, using in vivo studies with mutant Snc proteins, we have shown that the structural requirements that lead to secretion are quite similar to those proposed for SNARE complex formation in vitro. In our study, however, the transmembrane domain of the protein is required for function, probably due to its membrane anchoring capacity. This is likely to be essential for the localization of Snc proteins to secretory vesicles, although it may be unnecessary for SNARE complex formation per se.Importantly, the results obtained in our in vivo study have been collaborated by a recent work in which the regions of VAMP required for conferring Ca2+-mediated exocytosis from permeabilized insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells were examined (34Regazzi R. Sadoul K. Meda P. Kelly R.B. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By using tetanus toxin-resistant mutants of VAMP, the authors demonstrate that deletions in either of the amphipathic α-helices inhibited the ability of these mutants to restore exocytosis in tetanus toxin-treated cells. In addition, deletion of the variable region (residues 2–31) had no effect upon VAMP2 function, as shown here for Snc1. Moreover, the ability of these mutants to bind to either syntaxin Ia or SNAP-25in vitro paralleled their ability to confer exocytic functions. Thus, the results obtained in our mutational analysis of the yeast synaptobrevin/VAMP homologs are identical to those obtained for VAMP using a permeabilized cell system.It has been suggested that the amino terminus of the synaptobrevin/VAMP proteins might act in a fusogenic capacity (35Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) to confer bilayer fusion in the manner described for the fusion peptides of the influenza hemagglutinin antigen. This study suggests that removal of the amino-terminal variable region of a yeast v-SNARE has no deleterious effect upon its ability to confer exocytosis in snc cells. Thus, the likelihood that this region would act in an essential fusogenic capacity would seem slight. This is supported by the previous study (34Regazzi R. Sadoul K. Meda P. Kelly R.B. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yet neither work can rule out the possibility that the H1 segment alone could act in the capacity of a fusion peptide, if such a mechanism were indeed operant.Although no well defined role for the variable region has been described, other studies suggest that it may be involved in neuronal transmission. For example, peptides corresponding to the variable region of VAMP2 (but not VAMP1) inhibit acetylcholine release fromAplysia neurons (36Cornille F. Deloye F. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Poulain B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16826-16832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the interaction between VAMP and synaptophysin in vitro (37Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the variable region could have additional functions in higher eukaryotes and may well be cell- and isoform-specific. As no synaptophysin/synaptoporin homologs have been identified in yeast thus far, we are unable to determine whether this interaction (38Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Edelmann L. Hanson O.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) is involved in constitutive exocytosis in lower eukaryotes.Another study has demonstrated the requirements for the sorting of VAMP proteins to synaptic vesicles (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There the authors show that the synaptic vesicle sorting signal for both VAMP and cellubrevin is contained within the H1 segment. Removal of residues within H1 was shown to block targeting to synaptic vesicles, whereas alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that certain hydrophobic residues that participate in the heptad repeat of the H1 helix are important for sorting (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These mutations are likely to decrease the overall hydrophobicity of the helix and to lessen its ability to form a coiled-coil structure.In our study, we have found that both VAMP2 and VAMP2snc90-117 are likely to target to secretory vesicles and reach the plasma membrane when expressed in yeast. Yet these proteins are deficient in conferring exocytosis, as well as in localizing in quantity to secretory vesicles, during vesiculation insec6 cells. In contrast, Snc1 and several Snc-VAMP chimeras (e.g. Snc1vamp49-116 and Snc1vamp54-93) associated primarily with the vesicles under the same conditions. Therefore, it would seem likely (although not exclusively) that certain sequences in Snc1 confer protein retrieval from the plasma membrane. In our labeling experiment, we cannot differentiate between proteins contributed from the biosynthetic pool and those recycled from the cell surface. Yet, because those proteins that bore the Snc1 H1 segment underwent a significant re-localization to the vesicle population (upon vesiculation), we are inclined to believe that the H1 of the yeast homologs, like that of synaptobrevin/VAMP, may play a role in protein sorting to vesicles. Correspondingly, those chimeras which possess the VAMP2 H1 segment associated primarily with the plasma membrane and not with vesicles. Perhaps, then, the cellular machinery required for Snc retrieval is unable to recognize efficiently the H1 domain of the mammalian isoforms. More work will be required to fully address these issues.Overall, there is a significant degree of structural as well as functional homology between the Snc and synaptobrevin/VAMP proteins, despite the fact that they confer different exocytic programs in vastly diverged systems. Some differences remain to be resolved, but the beauty of these v-SNAREs lies in their overwhelmingly simple structure and conserved set of interactions and functions. Solving the tertiary and quaternary structures of these proteins will ultimately shed light upon how they act in mediating SNARE complex formation and exocytosis.

Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), are homologs of neuronal proteins known as synaptobrevins or VAMPs (4Baumert M. Maycox P.R. Navone F. DeCamilli P.

Niemann H. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Synaptobrevin/VAMPs were first identified as components of synaptic vesicles (4Baumert M. Maycox P.R.

Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Genetic studies demonstrate that Snc proteins are required for vesicle docking and fusion (3Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Snc protein expression accumulate secretory vesicles and fail to secrete normally. In addition, these cells show conditional-lethal phenotypes that result from the blockage of vesicle fusion. Like their neuronal counterparts, Snc proteins are thought to interact physically with t-SNAREs from the plasma membrane to form a putative SNARE complex (9Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Brennwald P. Kerns B. Champion K. Keränen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P.

Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) from yeast detergent extracts, and genetic studies suggest that Sec9 function in exocytosis may be Snc-dependent (9Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have determined that Snc proteins are modified by the palmitoylation of unique cysteine residues located proximal to their transmembrane domains (15Couve A. Protopopov V. Gerst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5987-5991Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation is required to yield the mature form of the protein but is not necessary for exocytic function. Synaptobrevin/VAMP and Snc proteins are conserved type II membrane proteins. They consist of a variable region of ∼30 residues at the amino terminus, followed by a conserved region (∼60 residues) bearing two predicted amphipathic α-helices separated by a nonhelical spacer, and a single membrane-spanning domain at the carboxyl terminus (16Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmidt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar,17Trimble W.S. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1993; 87: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The variable and conserved regions are cytosolic, whereas the 3–4 residues adjacent to the membrane-spanning domain are likely to be intravesicular. The first helix of the conserved region of synaptobrevin/VAMP (known as helix 1 and designated here as “H1”) contains a signal for the targeting to synaptic-like microvesicles in PC12 cells (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The second helix of synaptobrevin/VAMP (known as helix 2 and designated here as “H2”) is thought to participate, along with H1, in the interaction with cognate t-SNAREs from the presynaptic membrane (e.g. SNAP-25 and syntaxins A and B), based uponin vitro studies (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 20Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These v- and t-SNARE interactions are thought to result from the formation of coiled-coil structures involving the amphipathic α-helices of the individual SNARE partners. To address whether specific regions within the synaptobrevin/VAMPs confer the SNARE-SNARE interactions that lead to exocytosis, we have used the yeast system to perform a structure/function analysis of the Snc v-SNAREs. By using genetic and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that the ability of Snc proteins to confer exocytic function in vivo corresponds to their ability to interact genetically with components of the putative fusion complex (Sec17, Sec9, and Sso2). We also demonstrate that the H1 and H2 segments together mediate the exocytic functions of these v-SNAREs. In addition, there is a distinct requirement for the membrane-spanning domain but no requirement for the intravesicular and variable regions. The latter suggests that this region is unlikely to act in a fusogenic capacity, as proposed for the amino terminus of the hemagglutinin antigen (HA), a viral fusion protein bearing similar structural motifs (reviewed in Ref. 21Stegmann T. Helenius A. Bentz J. Viral Fusion Mechanisms. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 89-112Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONYeast Snc proteins are archetypal v-SNAREs of the late secretory pathway. These proteins share structural homology with members of the synaptobrevin/VAMP/cellubrevin family and engage in similar exocytic functions. Like their brethren, Snc proteins localize to secretory vesicles (3Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), interact with t-SNAREs from the plasma membrane (9, 10, and this study), and are likely to undergo a dynamic cycle of transport to, and retrieval from, the plasma membrane.Here we have demonstrated that the conserved amphipathic α-helical region (residues 32–85) is essential for conferring the exocytic functions of these v-SNAREs. Deletions or gross substitutions in either of the predicted H1 or H2 segments result in a complete loss of function of the proteins, although they appear to reach secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane. Thus, as was predicted by experiments performed in vitro with mammalian v- and t-SNAREs (18–20, and 33), it would seem likely that both helices are required for SNARE complexing in vivo. Although we cannot say whether the individual helices prefer specific t-SNARE partners, it appears that both helices can interact either with Sec9 or Sso2. This is based upon the result that Snc proteins lacking in either H1 or H2 are unable to suppress ts defects in either Sec9 or Sso2 and inhibit the growth ofsec9 and sso2 cells at permissive temperatures. These proteins, Snc1Δ31-50 and Snc1Δ57-81, appear to exert a dominant negative effect when overexpressed. Thus, it is possible that they compete with the native proteins in undergoing SNARE partnering but are unable to confer secretory functions. Interestingly, the Snc1Δ2-27 mutant was unable to confer suppression of the ts defects in either Sec9 or Sso2, unlike Snc1 or Snc1Δ2-17, suggesting that a portion of the variable domain aids in the rescue of the mutant t-SNAREs.Work by Hayashi et al. (19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the domains required for SNARE complex formation in vitro correlate well with the regions predicted to form α-helices. Specifically, synaptobrevin binding to the carboxyl-terminal third of syntaxin or SNAP-25 was shown to involve the entire conserved domain (residues 27–96) (19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Earlier studies also showed binary interactions between synaptobrevin/VAMP and syntaxin (33Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and SNAP-25 (20Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions of both the variable region as well as the transmembrane domain of synaptobrevin were found to have no deleterious effect upon complex formation and, in contrast, were found to enhance the interaction (19Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Binz T. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Here, using in vivo studies with mutant Snc proteins, we have shown that the structural requirements that lead to secretion are quite similar to those proposed for SNARE complex formation in vitro. In our study, however, the transmembrane domain of the protein is required for function, probably due to its membrane anchoring capacity. This is likely to be essential for the localization of Snc proteins to secretory vesicles, although it may be unnecessary for SNARE complex formation per se.Importantly, the results obtained in our in vivo study have been collaborated by a recent work in which the regions of VAMP required for conferring Ca2+-mediated exocytosis from permeabilized insulin-secreting HIT-T15 cells were examined (34Regazzi R. Sadoul K. Meda P. Kelly R.B. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By using tetanus toxin-resistant mutants of VAMP, the authors demonstrate that deletions in either of the amphipathic α-helices inhibited the ability of these mutants to restore exocytosis in tetanus toxin-treated cells. In addition, deletion of the variable region (residues 2–31) had no effect upon VAMP2 function, as shown here for Snc1. Moreover, the ability of these mutants to bind to either syntaxin Ia or SNAP-25in vitro paralleled their ability to confer exocytic functions. Thus, the results obtained in our mutational analysis of the yeast synaptobrevin/VAMP homologs are identical to those obtained for VAMP using a permeabilized cell system.It has been suggested that the amino terminus of the synaptobrevin/VAMP proteins might act in a fusogenic capacity (35Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) to confer bilayer fusion in the manner described for the fusion peptides of the influenza hemagglutinin antigen. This study suggests that removal of the amino-terminal variable region of a yeast v-SNARE has no deleterious effect upon its ability to confer exocytosis in snc cells. Thus, the likelihood that this region would act in an essential fusogenic capacity would seem slight. This is supported by the previous study (34Regazzi R. Sadoul K. Meda P. Kelly R.B. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), yet neither work can rule out the possibility that the H1 segment alone could act in the capacity of a fusion peptide, if such a mechanism were indeed operant.Although no well defined role for the variable region has been described, other studies suggest that it may be involved in neuronal transmission. For example, peptides corresponding to the variable region of VAMP2 (but not VAMP1) inhibit acetylcholine release fromAplysia neurons (36Cornille F. Deloye F. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Poulain B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16826-16832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the interaction between VAMP and synaptophysin in vitro (37Washbourne P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the variable region could have additional functions in higher eukaryotes and may well be cell- and isoform-specific. As no synaptophysin/synaptoporin homologs have been identified in yeast thus far, we are unable to determine whether this interaction (38Calakos N. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24534-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Edelmann L. Hanson O.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) is involved in constitutive exocytosis in lower eukaryotes.Another study has demonstrated the requirements for the sorting of VAMP proteins to synaptic vesicles (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). There the authors show that the synaptic vesicle sorting signal for both VAMP and cellubrevin is contained within the H1 segment. Removal of residues within H1 was shown to block targeting to synaptic vesicles, whereas alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that certain hydrophobic residues that participate in the heptad repeat of the H1 helix are important for sorting (18Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These mutations are likely to decrease the overall hydrophobicity of the helix and to lessen its ability to form a coiled-coil structure.In our study, we have found that both VAMP2 and VAMP2snc90-117 are likely to target to secretory vesicles and reach the plasma membrane when expressed in yeast. Yet these proteins are deficient in conferring exocytosis, as well as in localizing in quantity to secretory vesicles, during vesiculation insec6 cells. In contrast, Snc1 and several Snc-VAMP chimeras (e.g. Snc1vamp49-116 and Snc1vamp54-93) associated primarily with the vesicles under the same conditions. Therefore, it would seem likely (although not exclusively) that certain sequences in Snc1 confer protein retrieval from the plasma membrane. In our labeling experiment, we cannot differentiate between proteins contributed from the biosynthetic pool and those recycled from the cell surface. Yet, because those proteins that bore the Snc1 H1 segment underwent a significant re-localization to the vesicle population (upon vesiculation), we are inclined to believe that the H1 of the yeast homologs, like that of synaptobrevin/VAMP, may play a role in protein sorting to vesicles. Correspondingly, those chimeras which possess the VAMP2 H1 segment associated primarily with the plasma membrane and not with vesicles. Perhaps, then, the cellular machinery required for Snc retrieval is unable to recognize efficiently the H1 domain of the mammalian isoforms. More work will be required to fully address these issues.Overall, there is a significant degree of structural as well as functional homology between the Snc and synaptobrevin/VAMP proteins, despite the fact that they confer different exocytic programs in vastly diverged systems. Some differences remain to be resolved, but the beauty of these v-SNAREs lies in their overwhelmingly simple structure and conserved set of interactions and functions. Solving the tertiary and quaternary structures of these proteins will ultimately shed light upon how they act in mediating SNARE complex formation and exocytosis. Yeast Snc proteins are archetypal v-SNAREs of the late secretory pathway. These proteins share structural homology with members of the synaptobrevin/VAMP/cellubrevin family and engage in similar exocytic functions.

https://openalex.org/W2057424920,"A novel, systematic approach was used to identify amino acid residues responsible for substrate recognition in the transmembrane 10 region of the Gal2 galactose transporter ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. A mixture of approximately 25,000 distinct plasmids that encode all the combinations of 12 amino acids in transmembrane 10 that are different in Gal2 and the homologous glucose transporter Hxt2 was synthesized. Selection of galactose transport-positive clones on galactose limited agar plates yielded 19 clones, all of which contained the Tyr446 residue found in Gal2. 14 of the 19 clones contained Trp455 found in Gal2, whereas the other 5 contained Cys455, a residue not found in either Gal2 or Hxt2. When Tyr446 of Gal2 was replaced with any of the other 19 amino acids, no galactose transport activity was observed in the resulting transporters, indicating that Tyr446 plays an essential role in the transport of this sugar. Replacement of 2 amino acids of Hxt2 with the corresponding Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2 allowed the modified Hxt2 to transport galactose. The K m of galactose transport for the modified transporter was 8-fold higher than that of Gal2. These results and other evidence unequivocally show that Tyr446 is essential and Trp455 is important for the discrimination of galactose versus glucose.

This approach is limited, however, by the fact that it is usually not possible to mutate every amino acid and replacements that are made often yield results that are negative in nature (3Nishizawa K.

Biol. 1993; 28: 259-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These two transporters belong to the Glut transporter family, the largest known organic solute transporter family comprising more than 80 transporters found in prokaryotes through mammals (11Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 12-20Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 12Nelissen B. Mordant P. Jonniaux J.-L. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Creating chimeras between the Gal2 and Hxt2 transporters gave us an opportunity to study the galactose recognition site in Gal2 and to gain insights into the substrate recognition sites in Glut family transporters in general. To unequivocally determine the substrate recognition site, we have taken two steps. In the first step (3Nishizawa K. Shimoda E. Kasahara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2423-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), three types of systematic chimeras were made using theEscherichia coli homologous recombination system. The site responsible for differentially recognizing galactose and glucose was localized to a 101-amino acid region that includes the transmembrane 10 (TM10), 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. TM11, and TM12 segments and the proximal half of the C-terminal hydrophilic tail. In the second step (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the 101-amino acid region was subdivided into the above four regions by introducing five restriction enzyme sites into the corresponding segments of each gene without changing the amino acids encoded. By analyzing plasmids containing all the possible combinations of these segments inserted into the corresponding parts of Hxt2, we identified TM10 as the domain where galactose and glucose are differentially recognized. TM10 contains 35 amino acid residues, of which only 12 are different between Gal2 and Hxt2. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the amino acid residue(s) essential for the substrate recognition can be found among these 12 residues. We employed a new comprehensive approach and found that 2 amino acid residues in TM10 are important for substrate recognition.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe have devised a novel method to systematically identify amino acid residue(s) in TM10 that are critical for the substrate recognition. We have tentatively named this method “multiple mixed mutagenesis.” We first used PCR to prepare a mixture of approximately 25,000 distinct sequences that encode all the possible combinations of different amino acid residues between Gal2 and Hxt2. The PCR products were substituted for the corresponding TM10 region of HXT2, and these constructs were introduced into the galactose transport-negative strain LBY416. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of 19 clones selected as galactose transport-positive clones revealed that Tyr446 was the only location where an amino acid residue from Gal2 was always found (Fig. 1). In addition, the Trp455 of Gal2 was present in 14 of 19 clones, with Cys present at this location in the remaining 5 clones. LBY416 cells harboring each of the 19 clones showed galactose transport (Fig. 1) at levels 8–36% of the original Gal2 transporter, a level of transport comparable with the 17% observed for the chimeric transporter Hxt2-8 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing TM10 derived from Gal2 and the remaining parts from Hxt2.To confirm that Tyr446 and Trp455 are important for galactose recognition, several experiments were performed. 1) A random mixture of Gal2 clones encoding 20 different amino acid substitutions at Tyr446 and Trp455 was subjected to galactose transport-positive selection. Each of the 15 clones picked up possessed Tyr446 and Trp455. 2) Similarly, when Phe431 and Tyr440 of Hxt2 (corresponding to Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2, respectively) were randomly substituted with 20 amino acids, 13 galactose transport-positive clones were found to contain Tyr431. By contrast, 5 Trp440, 3 Cys440, 4 Thr440, and 1 Leu440clones were observed among the galactose transport-positive clones. 3) In addition, random mutagenesis of Tyr440 in a modified Hxt2 containing Tyr431 yielded 13 Trp440, 3 His440, and 1 Met440 galactose transport-positive clones. 4) Tyr446 of Gal2 was replaced with the other 19 amino acids, and galactose and glucose transport activities were measured (Fig. 2). Only the Tyr446 clone was active in galactose transport, whereas several clones including Gal2 containing Phe446, Trp446, and Tyr446 were active in glucose transport. Expression of all the 20 clones in this series was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell homogenates (Fig. 3). Thus, with the change of Tyr446 to Phe, the Gal2 transporter is changed to a glucose-specific transporter, the activity of which in the presence of 0.1 mm glucose is about half that of the Hxt2 transporter. 5) Hxt2 containing Tyr431 and Trp440, designated Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), showed almost the same characteristics of galactose transport as Hxt2-8: theK m and V max of galactose transport in Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp) cells were 39 ± 6 mm(mean ± S.E., n = 3) and 1.0 ± 0.7 nmol/107 cells/5 s, and those of Hxt2-8 cells were 41 ± 2 mm and 0.69 ± 0.03 nmol/107 cells/5 s. By contrast, galactose transport in Gal2 cells has aK m of 5.3 ± 0.3 mm and aV max of 0.97 ± 0.1 nmol/107cells/5 s (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fact that Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp) showed almost the sameK m as that of Hxt2-8, which was 8-fold higher than that of Gal2, suggests that there is some other region(s) contributing to galactose recognition in Gal2 but that there are no other critical amino acid residues within TM10. No significant differences in substrate specificity were found in these cells (Fig.4). Thus, changing two critical amino acids (Phe431 to Tyr and Tyr440 to Trp) causes the Hxt2 transporter to recognize galactose in addition to glucose.Figure 3Expression of Gal2 (X-Trp) series transporters. Gal2 was modified to create 19 clones coding for different amino acids at the position 446. Cell harboring 20 different clones were cultured in the same conditions as the transport assays. Cell homogenates (10 μg each) were immunoblotted with antibody to the Hxt2 C terminus. Autoradiography of [125I]protein A (IM144, Amersham Corp.) was performed using imaging plates (BAS2000, Fuji Film). The 53-kDa band (53K) corresponds to Gal2, and the bands immediately below the 53-KDa band seem to be degradation products, because they increased when freeze-thawing was repeated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Substrate specificity of Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), Hxt2-8, and Gal2. PCR reaction was used to replace Phe431 and Tyr440 of Hxt2 with Tyr and Trp, respectively (corresponding to Tyr446 and Trp455 in Gal2). Galactose transport at 0.1 mmin the presence of a 200-fold excess of the indicated nonradioactive monosaccharide was performed for 5 s. The average and S.E. from more than three assays are expressed relative to the value in the presence of sorbitol, which was used to adjust osmolality. Hxt2-8 indicates plasmid containing HXT2–0, TM10 of which was replaced with GAL2 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For many sugars Gal2 showed stronger inhibition than Hxt2-8 or Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), which may be due to higher affinity for galactose in Gal2 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies on the Glut family transporters have overlooked the importance of the amino acid situated at Tyr446 in Gal2 and the equivalent residues in other transporters. When TM10 is depicted as forming an α-helix (Fig. 5), Tyr446 is situated in the middle of the amino acids that are different in Gal2 and Hxt2, whereas the other side of the α-helix consists of amino acid residues that are common to both Gal2 and Hxt2. Tyr446is not conserved in Glut family transporters that also transport galactose in other organisms including GalP in E. coli (16Cairns M.T. McDonald T.P. Horne P. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8176-8183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), STP1 in Arabidopsis thaliana (17Sauer N. Friedlander K. Graml-Wicke U.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4247-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there are subtle changes in substrate recognition sites among these homologous transporters. The importance of Trp388 of the mammalian Glut1 transporter (corresponding to Trp455 of Gal2) has been pointed out previously (20Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol.

Replacement of Trp with other amino acids changed several aspects of transporter physiology including expression levels (20Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), targeting (20Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol.

J. 1993; 290: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest to determine whether the replacement of Trp with other amino acids brings any change in various functional aspects of Gal2 in addition to the substrate recognition. The role of Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2 in substrate recognition may be interpreted in many ways. These amino acid residues may relieve steric hindrance, so that galactose that is excluded from Hxt2 may be accepted by Gal2. However, the fact that Gal2 transporters possessing different amino acids at residue 446 show more strict selectivity for galactose transport compared with glucose transport (Fig. 2) may not be consistent with this idea. It is possible that the two aromatic side chains of Tyr and Trp form hydrogen bonds with galactose. With this interpretation, the structure around C4 of galactose may form a bond primarily with Tyr. Another possibility is that these aromatic residues lie close to galactose (“stacking effect”) as is the case in galactose binding lectins (24Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The possibility that these residues play an indirect but crucial role in determining the conformation of amino acid residue(s) directly interacting with galactose is not excluded by this study. It is also possible that two amino acids may not form a single recognition site but instead function independently. Considerable evidence supports the notion of two substrate binding sites in Glut family transporters (2Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Figure 5Schematic representation of Gal2 transporter. A 12 membrane-spanning model is based on the alignment described (2Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). 2 amino acid residues, Tyr446 and Trp455, important for the discrimination of galactoseversus glucose are indicated by the arrows. Of 35 amino acids in the TM10 region bordered by SacI andMluI sites, 23 common to Gal2 and Hxt2 are indicated using the one-letter amino acid code.

Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16519-16527Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) constructed eight chimeras of human Glut2 and Glut3 and used them to show that TM7 is important for substrate recognition. The reason why the region identified for substrate recognition is different from ours is not known. The difference in the results of their study and ours may reflect difference in homologous transporters in human and yeast or differences in the transport substrates used; Arbuckle et al. used fructose as a discriminating sugar, whereas we used galactose. If the latter possibility proved to be the case, it would suggest that both regions are necessary for the recognition of sugar molecules. It is also possible that TM7 and TM10 contribute to two different binding sites that have different substrate specificities, TM7 for exofacial binding site and TM10 for endofacial binding site (2Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Using a three-step chimera approach, we were able to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the differential recognition of galactose and glucose. At each step we have tried to avoid making assumptions about particular locations. It seems reasonable to expect that this multiple mixed mutagenesis method will be generally applicable to other classes of proteins that have homologous counterparts. This method is an alternative to site-directed mutagenesis and is an appropriate approach for determining not only the substrate recognition site but also other functionally important sites. Site-directed mutagenesis has been extensively used in attempts to determine functional sites in transporters (1Kaback H.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137A: 97-125Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This approach is limited, however, by the fact that it is usually not possible to mutate every amino acid and replacements that are made often yield results that are negative in nature (3Nishizawa K.

The PCR products were substituted for the corresponding TM10 region of HXT2, and these constructs were introduced into the galactose transport-negative strain LBY416. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of 19 clones selected as galactose transport-positive clones revealed that Tyr446 was the only location where an amino acid residue from Gal2 was always found (Fig. 1). In addition, the Trp455 of Gal2 was present in 14 of 19 clones, with Cys present at this location in the remaining 5 clones. LBY416 cells harboring each of the 19 clones showed galactose transport (Fig. 1) at levels 8–36% of the original Gal2 transporter, a level of transport comparable with the 17% observed for the chimeric transporter Hxt2-8 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M.

By contrast, 5 Trp440, 3 Cys440, 4 Thr440, and 1 Leu440clones were observed among the galactose transport-positive clones. 3) In addition, random mutagenesis of Tyr440 in a modified Hxt2 containing Tyr431 yielded 13 Trp440, 3 His440, and 1 Met440 galactose transport-positive clones. 4) Tyr446 of Gal2 was replaced with the other 19 amino acids, and galactose and glucose transport activities were measured (Fig. 2). Only the Tyr446 clone was active in galactose transport, whereas several clones including Gal2 containing Phe446, Trp446, and Tyr446 were active in glucose transport. Expression of all the 20 clones in this series was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell homogenates (Fig. 3). Thus, with the change of Tyr446 to Phe, the Gal2 transporter is changed to a glucose-specific transporter, the activity of which in the presence of 0.1 mm glucose is about half that of the Hxt2 transporter. 5) Hxt2 containing Tyr431 and Trp440, designated Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), showed almost the same characteristics of galactose transport as Hxt2-8: theK m and V max of galactose transport in Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp) cells were 39 ± 6 mm(mean ± S.E., n = 3) and 1.0 ± 0.7 nmol/107 cells/5 s, and those of Hxt2-8 cells were 41 ± 2 mm and 0.69 ± 0.03 nmol/107 cells/5 s. By contrast, galactose transport in Gal2 cells has aK m of 5.3 ± 0.3 mm and aV max of 0.97 ± 0.1 nmol/107cells/5 s (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fact that Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp) showed almost the sameK m as that of Hxt2-8, which was 8-fold higher than that of Gal2, suggests that there is some other region(s) contributing to galactose recognition in Gal2 but that there are no other critical amino acid residues within TM10. No significant differences in substrate specificity were found in these cells (Fig.4). Thus, changing two critical amino acids (Phe431 to Tyr and Tyr440 to Trp) causes the Hxt2 transporter to recognize galactose in addition to glucose.Figure 4Substrate specificity of Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), Hxt2-8, and Gal2. PCR reaction was used to replace Phe431 and Tyr440 of Hxt2 with Tyr and Trp, respectively (corresponding to Tyr446 and Trp455 in Gal2). Galactose transport at 0.1 mmin the presence of a 200-fold excess of the indicated nonradioactive monosaccharide was performed for 5 s. The average and S.E. from more than three assays are expressed relative to the value in the presence of sorbitol, which was used to adjust osmolality. Hxt2-8 indicates plasmid containing HXT2–0, TM10 of which was replaced with GAL2 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For many sugars Gal2 showed stronger inhibition than Hxt2-8 or Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), which may be due to higher affinity for galactose in Gal2 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies on the Glut family transporters have overlooked the importance of the amino acid situated at Tyr446 in Gal2 and the equivalent residues in other transporters. When TM10 is depicted as forming an α-helix (Fig. 5), Tyr446 is situated in the middle of the amino acids that are different in Gal2 and Hxt2, whereas the other side of the α-helix consists of amino acid residues that are common to both Gal2 and Hxt2. Tyr446is not conserved in Glut family transporters that also transport galactose in other organisms including GalP in E. coli (16Cairns M.T. McDonald T.P. Horne P. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. J.

Replacement of Trp with other amino acids changed several aspects of transporter physiology including expression levels (20Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol.

It is of particular interest to determine whether the replacement of Trp with other amino acids brings any change in various functional aspects of Gal2 in addition to the substrate recognition. The role of Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2 in substrate recognition may be interpreted in many ways. These amino acid residues may relieve steric hindrance, so that galactose that is excluded from Hxt2 may be accepted by Gal2. However, the fact that Gal2 transporters possessing different amino acids at residue 446 show more strict selectivity for galactose transport compared with glucose transport (Fig. 2) may not be consistent with this idea. It is possible that the two aromatic side chains of Tyr and Trp form hydrogen bonds with galactose. With this interpretation, the structure around C4 of galactose may form a bond primarily with Tyr. Another possibility is that these aromatic residues lie close to galactose (“stacking effect”) as is the case in galactose binding lectins (24Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The possibility that these residues play an indirect but crucial role in determining the conformation of amino acid residue(s) directly interacting with galactose is not excluded by this study. It is also possible that two amino acids may not form a single recognition site but instead function independently. Considerable evidence supports the notion of two substrate binding sites in Glut family transporters (2Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Figure 5Schematic representation of Gal2 transporter.

Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16519-16527Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) constructed eight chimeras of human Glut2 and Glut3 and used them to show that TM7 is important for substrate recognition. The reason why the region identified for substrate recognition is different from ours is not known. The difference in the results of their study and ours may reflect difference in homologous transporters in human and yeast or differences in the transport substrates used; Arbuckle et al. used fructose as a discriminating sugar, whereas we used galactose. If the latter possibility proved to be the case, it would suggest that both regions are necessary for the recognition of sugar molecules. It is also possible that TM7 and TM10 contribute to two different binding sites that have different substrate specificities, TM7 for exofacial binding site and TM10 for endofacial binding site (2Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Using a three-step chimera approach, we were able to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the differential recognition of galactose and glucose. At each step we have tried to avoid making assumptions about particular locations. It seems reasonable to expect that this multiple mixed mutagenesis method will be generally applicable to other classes of proteins that have homologous counterparts. This method is an alternative to site-directed mutagenesis and is an appropriate approach for determining not only the substrate recognition site but also other functionally important sites. We have devised a novel method to systematically identify amino acid residue(s) in TM10 that are critical for the substrate recognition. We have tentatively named this method “multiple mixed mutagenesis.” We first used PCR to prepare a mixture of approximately 25,000 distinct sequences that encode all the possible combinations of different amino acid residues between Gal2 and Hxt2. The PCR products were substituted for the corresponding TM10 region of HXT2, and these constructs were introduced into the galactose transport-negative strain LBY416. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of 19 clones selected as galactose transport-positive clones revealed that Tyr446 was the only location where an amino acid residue from Gal2 was always found (Fig. 1). In addition, the Trp455 of Gal2 was present in 14 of 19 clones, with Cys present at this location in the remaining 5 clones. LBY416 cells harboring each of the 19 clones showed galactose transport (Fig. 1) at levels 8–36% of the original Gal2 transporter, a level of transport comparable with the 17% observed for the chimeric transporter Hxt2-8 (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing TM10 derived from Gal2 and the remaining parts from Hxt2. To confirm that Tyr446 and Trp455 are important for galactose recognition, several experiments were performed. 1) A random mixture of Gal2 clones encoding 20 different amino acid substitutions at Tyr446 and Trp455 was subjected to galactose transport-positive selection. Each of the 15 clones picked up possessed Tyr446 and Trp455. 2) Similarly, when Phe431 and Tyr440 of Hxt2 (corresponding to Tyr446 and Trp455 of Gal2, respectively) were randomly substituted with 20 amino acids, 13 galactose transport-positive clones were found to contain Tyr431. By contrast, 5 Trp440, 3 Cys440, 4 Thr440, and 1 Leu440clones were observed among the galactose transport-positive clones. 3) In addition, random mutagenesis of Tyr440 in a modified Hxt2 containing Tyr431 yielded 13 Trp440, 3 His440, and 1 Met440 galactose transport-positive clones. 4) Tyr446 of Gal2 was replaced with the other 19 amino acids, and galactose and glucose transport activities were measured (Fig. 2). Only the Tyr446 clone was active in galactose transport, whereas several clones including Gal2 containing Phe446, Trp446, and Tyr446 were active in glucose transport. Expression of all the 20 clones in this series was confirmed by immunoblotting of cell homogenates (Fig. 3). Thus, with the change of Tyr446 to Phe, the Gal2 transporter is changed to a glucose-specific transporter, the activity of which in the presence of 0.1 mm glucose is about half that of the Hxt2 transporter. 5) Hxt2 containing Tyr431 and Trp440, designated Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp), showed almost the same characteristics of galactose transport as Hxt2-8: theK m and V max of galactose transport in Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp) cells were 39 ± 6 mm(mean ± S.E., n = 3) and 1.0 ± 0.7 nmol/107 cells/5 s, and those of Hxt2-8 cells were 41 ± 2 mm and 0.69 ± 0.03 nmol/107 cells/5 s. By contrast, galactose transport in Gal2 cells has aK m of 5.3 ± 0.3 mm and aV max of 0.97 ± 0.1 nmol/107cells/5 s (4Kasahara M. Shimoda E. Maeda M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fact that Hxt2 (Tyr-Trp) showed almost the sameK m as that of Hxt2-8, which was 8-fold higher than that of Gal2, suggests that there is some other region(s) contributing to galactose recognition in Gal2 but that there are no other critical amino acid residues within TM10. No significant differences in substrate specificity were found in these cells (Fig.4). Thus, changing two critical amino acids (Phe431 to Tyr and Tyr440 to Trp) causes the Hxt2 transporter to recognize galactose in addition to glucose.

Subsequently, there is infection of B lymphocytes with two types of cycles, latent and lytic. Apart from linkage of the EBV latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) with benign and malignant conditions of squamous epithelial cells, little is known about other EBV gene products that may be important in these processes as well as cellular transcriptional factors that regulate EBV gene expression in these epithelial cells. The EBV ED-L2 promoter, an early lytic cycle promoter, is located upstream of a transcription start site for a short open reading frame designated BNLF2 and just downstream of the BNLF1 (LMP-1) open reading frame. We have previously used the EBV ED-L2 promoter to target oncogenes in transgenic mice, resulting in tissue-specific expression in the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and skin, all sharing stratifying squamous epithelia, alternatively called keratinocytes. In the present study, we have functionally dissected the ED-L2 promoter by making deletion constructs fused to the luciferase reporter gene with transient transfections into squamous and nonsquamous epithelial cell lines as well as B lymphocytes. A CACCC box-like cis-regulatory element has been identified that is located between −218 and −187 base pairs of the ED-L2 promoter that confers significant promoter activity only in squamous epithelial cells. This cis-regulatory element is active in a heterologous minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter reporter gene construct when transfected into squamous epithelial cells but not in nonsquamous epithelial cells. DNA gel mobility shift assays have led to the identification of DNA-protein complexes that bind the CACCC box-like element. One of these proteins is a novel transcriptional factor that is uniquely active in stratified squamous epithelial cells, designated as keratinocyte specific factor (KSF). KSF may be related to Sp1 but appears to be distinct from Sp1. In addition, KSF may interact with related or identicalcis-regulatory elements found in human papillomavirus-11 E6 and cytokeratin K3 promoters that are active in keratinocytes.

The EBV genome is over 170 kilobases existing in a circular or a linear duplex form. Among the encoded proteins are nuclear antigens (EBNA) and latent infection membrane proteins (LMP). EBV may infect oropharyngeal epithelial cells by virtue of association between the external viral glycoprotein 350/220 and a CR-2 like receptor on host cells (1Cohen J.I. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Kieff, E. (1996) in Virology (Felds, B. N., Knipe, D. M., and Howley, P. M., eds) Chapter 74, pp. 2343–2396, Lippincott-Raven Press, Ltd., New York.Google Scholar). After entry into the epithelial cells, EBV initiates a lytic infection that in turn leads to infection of circulating B lymphocytes that traffic through the nasopharynx. EBV undergoes two types of cycles in B lymphocytes. The first is a lytic infection where a high copy number of EBV genomes is initiated, followed by production of viral particles that can be released from the host cell. In contrast, the second consists of a latent infection in which the circular EBV genome is episomal. While much investigation has sought to elucidate EBV's role in the immortalization and transformation of B lymphocytes, thereby leading to lymphoproliferative diseases (1Cohen J.I. Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, T-cell lymphoma, among others, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying EBV's lytic infection of oropharyngeal epithelial cells. It is known that latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) can induce transformation of rodent fibroblasts resulting in growth in reduced serum conditions, loss of contact inhibition, anchorage independence, and tumor formation in nude mice (3Wang D. Liebowitz D. Kieff E. Cell. 1985; 43: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). LMP-1 can additionally block differentiation in epithelial cells that can be induced to differentiate terminally in a manner similar to normal keratinocytes (4Dawson C.W. Rickinson A.B. Young L.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 5Fahraeus R. Rymo L. Rhim J.S. Klein G. Nature. 1990; 345: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LMP-1 transcripts are associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (6Raab-Traub N. Hood R. Yang C.S. Henry B.I. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 580-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, although LMP-1 does play a significant role, the repertoire of genes of EBV that are involved in producing the lytic cycle in epithelial cells remains to be elucidated, and the cellular transcriptional factors in the epithelial cells that govern the transcriptional regulation of these genes require further investigation. The EBV ED-L2 promoter, an early lytic cycle promoter, was originally defined as one of the TATA boxes found in EcoRI D/BamHI N fragments of the EBV genome and is located 30 base pairs upstream of a transcription start site for a short open reading frame designated BNLF2 whose function remains to be elucidated (7Hudson G.S. Farrell P.J. Barrell B.G. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 528-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1 A, a noncoding sequence containing the TATA element, hence designated the ED-L2 promoter region, is located just downstream of another open reading frame, BNLF1, that encodes the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). When a MlnI-BamHI fragment of the EBV genome containing coding sequences for BNLF1 and -2 as well as flanking sequences was expressed under the BNLF1/BNLF2 promoters and a polyoma virus enhancer in transgenic mice, the BNLF2 gene transcript was expressed uniquely in tissues sharing a stratified squamous epithelium such as the tongue, esophagus, and to a lesser extent the skin, whereas the BNLF1 transcript was expressed ubiquitously (8Wilson J.B. Weinberg W. Johnson R. Yupsa S. Levine A.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 1315-1327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As a means of understanding oncogenesis in the oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus) with stratified squamous epithelia, we have engineered transgenic mice in which 782 bp of the ED-L2 promoter was fused to the cyclin D1 complementary DNA without any additional enhancers, yielding the expression of cyclin D1 in the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, and to a lesser extent skin (9Nakagawa H. Wang T. Zukerberg L. Odze R. Togawa K. May G. Wilson J. Rustgi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, the transgene expression was localized immunohistochemically to the basal and suprabasal layers of the stratified squamous epithelia but was not detectable in other layers of the epithelium or layers underneath the epithelium. These findings led to the hypothesis that the ED-L2 promoter is active in the oral cavity and upper gastrointestinal (esophageal) stratified squamous epithelial cells, or keratinocytes, by virtue of cell type-specific interactions betweencis-acting regulatory elements in this promoter and cellulartrans-acting nuclear factors possibly without the need for transactivation by other EBV gene products. We have identified in the present study a CACCC box-like cis-regulatory element in the EBV-ED L2 promoter that interacts with several nuclear transcriptional factors, one of which appears to be keratinocyte-specific. This in itself is a novel finding for EBV's role in epithelial cells, but placed in a broader context, the same nuclear transcriptional factors interact with similar or identical cis-regulatory elements of the human papillomavirus-11 E6 promoter and some of the cytokeratin promoters that are active in keratinocytes. A 782-base pair (bp) sequence extending between 168,268 and 167,487 nucleotides of the B95–8 Epstein-Barr virus genome, according to the the numbering method of Baer et al. (10Baer R. Bankier A.T. Biggin M.D. Farrell P.J. Gibson T.J. Hatfull G. Hudson G.S. Satchwell S.C. Seguin C. Tuffnell P.S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1984; 310: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), contains the ED-L2 promoter (Fig.1 A). This promoter has been fused to the human cyclin D1 complementary DNA, and this transgene (designated pL2HD1) has been expressed in mice (9Nakagawa H. Wang T. Zukerberg L. Odze R. Togawa K. May G. Wilson J. Rustgi A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The 782-bp fragment was isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pL2HD1 as a DNA template with a sense primer from 168,268 and an antisense primer from 167,487 (see Table I for primer sequences), each of which was synthesized with aBamHI site in the 5′-end of the sense primer and anXhoI site in the 5′-end of the antisense primer. The PCR reaction was done in 1 × Native Pfu buffer (Stratagene) consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mm KCl, 6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin supplemented with 200 μm each dNTP, 0.6 μm sense and antisense primers, 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and 10 ng of plasmid DNA template. The PCR amplification conditions consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min for 20 cycles. After PCR amplification, the reaction product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, agarose gel-purified, and ligated into the luciferase promoterless vector, pXP2 (11Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar), to generate the pL2-782 plasmid. A subsequent series of deletion constructs (pL2-610, pL2-287, pL2-218, pL2-187, pL2-164, pL2-144, and pL2-114) were made in a similar fashion using pL2-782 as a template for PCR with sense primers designed at the different positions of the promoter and an antisense primer from +24 of the coding region of the luciferase reporter gene (Table I). The pL2-435 was generated by digestion of pL2-782 with BamHI andSmaI, deleting 347 bp of the promoter sequence and followed by religation of the plasmid. Plasmids were purified by a modified alkaline lysis method (Qiagen plasmid kit and QIAprep spin plasmid kit).Table IOligonucleotide primer sequences for plasmid constructionsPrimerSequenceConstructXhoI-L2 AS5′-GAAGATCTCGAGAGTGAGGCACAGCTG-3′pL2–782BamHI-L2 S45′-CGGGATCCATGGCGGCGGTGATCCACA-3′pL2–782BamHI-L2 S85′-CGGGATCCTGGGAATGCCTTAGCTAATCA-3′pL2–610BamHI-L2 S75′-CGGGATCCTGTCTCCCACCCAGTAACT-3′pL2–287BamHI-L2 S65′-CGGGATCCAAGCCACACCTAACTCAT-3′pL2–218BamHI-L2 S95′-CGGGATCCAGGAACACCTGTTGTTGA-3′pL2–187BamHI-L2 S105′-CGGGATCCTTCTTTGCGCATAAGCAC-3′pL2–164BamHI-L2 S115′-CGGGATCCTAATCCCTCTCTCACA-3′pL2–144BamHI-L2 S55′-CGGGATCCGCTAGCCCAAAACCTCCA-3′pL2–114Luciferase AS5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′BamHI restriction enzyme site is underlined.

Minimal promoter DNA constructs containing the wild-type (WT) or mutant (MT) nucleotides spanning −218 to −184 of the pL2-782 were generated by ligation of kinased double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides into theBamHI site of the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter vector, pT81, with the luciferase reporter gene (11Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by the phosphoramidite procedure (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis. All plasmid and minimal promoter DNA constructions were verified by DNA sequencing with the dideoxy-mediated chain termination method using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell lines TE-11, TE-12 (gift of Dr.T. Nishihira), T.T (JCRB 0262, Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank), and HCE4 (gift of Dr. C. C. Harris) were grown as described previously (12Nakagawa H. Zukerberg L. Togawa K. Meltzer S.J. Nishihira T. Rustgi A.K. Cancer. 1995; 76: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Panc-1 (ATCC CRL 1739), HepG2 (ATCC HB 8065), HeLa (ATCC CCL 2), and AGS (ATCC HTB 22), obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Rockville, MD), were cultured under standard conditions, namely Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). A human B cell line, BJAB (gift of Dr. B. Cherayil), was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). Human skin (SCC-13) and tongue (SCC-25) squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (gifts of Dr. J. Rheinwald) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) and 10% fetal calf serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) (13Rheinwald J.G. Beckett M.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1657-1663PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of the plasmid and minimal DNA constructions in cultured cells was done by the calcium phosphate method (14Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar) using the CaHPO4 transfection kit (5′ → 3′, Inc., Boulder, CO), except for BJAB that was transfected by electroporation using the Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). For the calcium phosphate transfections, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/35-mm well and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 2 μg of pXG5, a plasmid containing the mouse metallothionein-I promoter fused to the human growth hormone gene (Nichols Institute), in a 250 μl of solution consisting of 125 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmKCl, 140 mm NaCl, 6 mm glucose. After an 8-h incubation, SCC-13, SCC-25, Panc-1, HepG2, and HCE4 cells were subjected to a glycerol (15%) shock for 3 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (BioWhittaker), and fresh medium was exchanged. The other cell lines (TE-11, TE-12, T.T, AGS, and HeLa) were transfected in an identical fashion but without glycerol shock as this was not found to be optimal for the cells. For electroporation of BJAB, 6 × 106 cells were incubated with 15 μg each of the plasmids in 600 μl of complete medium on ice for 10 min and then electroporated at 450 V and 125 microfarads. All cells were harvested for the luciferase assay at 48 h post-transfection. The luciferase assay was performed in the following manner. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of 1 × cell culture lysis reagent (Promega), and 40 μl of the lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent consisting of 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm MgCO3, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm coenzyme A, 530 μm ATP, and 470 μm luciferin. The luciferase activities were measured with a monolight luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory), and transfection efficiency was normalized by quantitatively measuring the human growth hormone secreted by transfected cells according to the manufacturer's directions as provided in the HGH-TGES 100T Kit (Nichols Institute). Transfections were carried out at least three times and variation between experiments was not greater than 15%. Nuclear extracts from cultured cells were prepared essentially as described by Schreiber et al. (15Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) except the buffers were supplemented with a mixture of 0.5 μg/ml protease inhibitors (aprotinin, chymostatin, pepstatin) (Boehringer Mannheim). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). To make the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probes, 5 pmol of a double-stranded oligonucleotide was radiolabeled by the Klenow fill-in reaction in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mmdithiothreitol, 33 μm dATP, 33 μm dGTP, 33 μm dTTP, 0.33 μm[α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products), 1 unit of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (Amersham Corp.) and then polyacrylamide gel-purified. GMSAs were carried out by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extract with 5 fmol of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe (20,000 cpm) in a 20-μl binding reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT)/poly(dA-dT) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 0.25 × Tris borate gel and electrophoresed at 10 V/cm for 2 h. For competition experiments, the nuclear extract was preincubated with 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe (see Table II for sequences of competitor oligonucleotides). Immune supershift assays were performed using a polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz), a monoclonal anti-AP2 antibody (gift of Dr. T. Williams), a monoclonal anti-Sp3 antibody (gift of Dr. G. Suske), and a polyclonal anti-α basonuclin antibody (gift of Dr. H. Green) and preincubated with the nuclear extract at room temperature for 10 min prior to the addition of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide DNA probe, as described previously (17Chung D.C. Brand S.J.

Note the CACACCT motif in DWT, FWT, and EWT probes. Wild-type (DWT) and mutated (DMT 1–5) oligonucleotides were also fused to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in the pT81 vector. To make an oligonucleotide DNA probe for UV cross-linking with nuclear proteins, 2.5 pmol each of a sense single-stranded oligonucleotide extending between −218 and −184 (probe D), 5′-gatcCAAGCCACACCTAACTCATGCCAGCAGAGGCAGG-3′, and an antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-CCTCTGCTGGCATGAG 3′, extending between −184 and −199 were annealed and subjected to a Klenow fill-in reaction in a fashion similar to the preparation of the oligonucleotide DNA probe for the GMSA, except [α-32P]dGTP (NEN Life Science Products) and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate (Sigma) were incorporated instead of dGTP and dTTP, respectively. 75 μg of crude nuclear extract from TE-11 cells was incubated with the oligonucleotide DNA probe (100,000 cpm) in a 150-μl binding reaction, which was increased in volume but otherwise equivalent to that for GMSA reaction, at room temperature for 30 min, and then UV-irradiated at 310 nm at room temperature for 15 min. UV cross-linking experiments were performed in an identical fashion with probes for Keratin 3 and HPV-11 E6 (sequences are in Fig. 9 A). The UV-irradiated DNA-protein complexes of interest were electrophoretically fractionated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel, isolated by electroelution at 4 °C, and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Since 782 bp of the EBV ED-L2 promoter proved to be sufficient in achieving gene expression in a tissue-specific fashion, this region was subjected to functional dissection by transient transfection of various cell lines with a series of plasmid constructs in which the full-length or serially deleted EBV ED-L2 promoter sequences were ligated to the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 1 A). A prominent transcriptional activity of the EBV ED-L2 promoter was observed in an esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, TE-11, by transfection of the full-length EBV ED-L2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, designated pL2–782 (Fig. 1 B), nearly 2-fold more active than the potent promoter, pRSV-luc. The EBV ED-L2 promoter was also active, although to a lesser extent, in another esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line, T.T (Table III). Importantly, activity was also observed in the SCC-13 skin squamous carcinoma cell line (Table III). However, the EBV ED-L2 promoter was weakly active in the esophageal HCE-4 and TE-12 cell lines and tongue SCC-25 cell line (Table III). The ED-L2 promoter's activity may reflect the degree of differentiation in these cell lines, as depicted by the expression of cytokeratins. In this context, TE-11, T.T, TE-12, and SCC-13 express K5 and K14, typically expressed in proliferating basal cells, whereas HCE-4 and SCC-25 do not have the same keratin profile (18Leask A. Byrne C. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7948-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). 2H. Nakagawa and A. K. Rustgi, unpublished data. SCC-25 was the only tongue cell line tested, and we cannot exclude the possibility of the EBV-ED L2 promoter being more active in other cell lines derived from the tongue which would be commensurate with the pattern in transgenic mice.Table IIIThe EBV ED-L2 promoter activity in various cell linesCell linesConstructspL2–782pL2–218pL2–114pXP2T.T.32.0 ± 6.716.8 ± 7.00.3 ± 0.00.1 ± 0.0TE-123.4 ± 0.61.9 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.0HCE-41.0 ± 0.3NDND0.0 ± 0.0SCC-1320.6 ± 1.926.3 ± 6.50.3 ± 0.00.5 ± 0.0SCC-253.1 ± 1.3NDND0.2 ± 0.0HeLa3.8 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.00.4 ± 0.0AGS0.3 ± 0.0NDND0.0 ± 0.0HepG20.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.0Panc-10.1 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.00.0 ± 0.0BJAB0.9 ± 0.01.1 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.1The full-length (pL2–782) and two of the deletion constructs (pL2–218 and pL2–114) were transfected in various cell lines to determine the EBV ED-L2 promoter activity by luciferase assay.

The EBV ED-L2 promoter was inactive in cells of nonsquamous epithelial origin (Table III) including the stomach (AGS), liver (HepG2), and pancreas (Panc-1), as well as B lymphocytes (BJAB). Minimal activity was evident in HeLa, a simple epithelial derived cervical cancer cell line (Table III). Cytokeratins K5 and K14 are not expressed in HepG2 and HeLa cells (19Leask A. Rosenberg M. Vassar R. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1985-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), consistent with the notion that cell type and its differentiation status may affect EBV ED-L2 promoter activity. The TE-11 cell line was selected for testing deletions of the EBV ED-L2 promoter. Deletional analysis of the EBV ED-L2 promoter in TE-11 cells revealed maximum activity with the pL2-610 construct (Fig.1 B). Promoter activity continuously declined from −610 to −218 suggesting the presence of multiple positivecis-regulatory elements. However, the most obvious loss of activity was observed between −218 and −114, indicating that the intervening sequences contain cis-regulatory elements that account for nearly 70% total activity. This tendency was also observed in T.T, TE-12, and SCC-13 cells (Table III). pL2-114 yielded basal activity comparable with that of the promoterless pXP2. Further functional mapping of cis-regulatory elements was carried out with TE-11 cells, indicating the presence ofcis-regulatory element(s) in the sequence between −218 and −187 and also between sequences −187 and −164 (Fig. 1 B). We concentrated our studies on the sequences between −218 and −187 since the greatest reduction in promoter activity occurred in this region. The region between nucleotide positions −218 and −187, designated arbitrarily as region D, contains two sequences that resemble known cis-acting regulatory elements, namely one similar to the CACCC box and another that has 70% homology to KER1 (Fig. 2 and Tables IVand V). The CACCC box was identified originally in promoters of the rabbit, human, and mouse β-globin genes. The CCACACCC cis-regulatory element plays an essential role in the transactivation of the β-globin promoter through its interaction with the erythroid cell-specific erythroid Krüppel-like factor as well as a ubiquitous factor Sp1 (20Cowie A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3122-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The CACCC core motif also has been found in viral promoters or enhancers, for example human papillomavirus-11 E6 promoter (22Dong G. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the SV40 enhancer (23Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P.

Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Whereas the CACCC motif is more prevalent in promoters, another motif for consideration is KER1, a palindromic sequence, 5′-GCCTGCAGGC-3′, that was identified originally in the 5′-regulatory region of the cytokeratin K14 gene (19Leask A.

The respiratory chain enzyme ubiquinol-cytochrome coxidoreductase, or bc 1 complex, transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c (1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The eukaryotic enzyme is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and couples electron transfer to proton translocation across this membrane. This enzyme complex may consist of up to 11 subunits, as in the bovine heart complex (2Schägger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but only three subunits contain prosthetic groups and are directly involved in electron transfer. These subunits are cytochromeb, cytochrome c 1, and the Rieske Fe-S protein and they form the “minimal,” or “core” complex. In many prokaryotes the bc 1 complex is constituted of only these three subunits (1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bc 1 complex from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains at least seven subunits lacking a prosthetic group, giving a total of 10 subunits described up until now (3de Vries S. Marres C.A.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12947-12953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although in recent years a great deal of information has become available on these subunits lacking a prosthetic group, their function is still poorly defined. A very similar situation holds for the other proton-pumping respiratory complexes, complex I, cytochrome c oxidase, and ATP synthase. A role that is generally attributed to these “accessory” subunits is that they may contribute to the structural stability of these complexes (1Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cooper C. Nicholls P. Freedman J.A. Biochim.

Because of its membrane-permeable nature, it is commonly used as an inhibitor of enzymes that require such a metal atom for catalytic activity, like the family of mitochondrial metalloproteases (6Yasuhara T. Mera Y. Nakai T. Ohashi A. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Nakai T. Mera Y. Yasuhara T. Ohashi A. J. Biochem. 1994; 116: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and the matrix-processing peptidase (8Böhni P.C. Daum G. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4937-4943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OP was found to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of complex I in bovine submitochondrial particles (9Finel M. Majander A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The inhibition site of OP is similar to that of rotenone, namely between all the Fe-S clusters of complex I and the ubiquinone pool. The sensitivity toward OP of isolated complex I is very similar to that of submitochondrial particles, indicating that complex I is the main site of inhibition by OP in the respiratory chain (9Finel M. Majander A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). OP also inhibits electron transfer in the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center by displacing the secondary quinone from the QB site (10Sinning I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 150-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). OP binds to the QB binding pocket by hydrogen bonding to the histidine at position 190 of the L-chain (HisL190) (11Michel H. Epp O. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2445-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we report the effect of OP on the yeastbc 1 complex and its use as probe for the structural stability of the complex. In addition, the OP-ferrous sulfate complex (ferroin) is found to have an inhibitory effect on thebc 1 complex but of a different type. The characteristics of this latter type of inhibition are discussed in relation to the dimeric structure of the bc 1complex. Yeast strain DL1 (mat α, his3–11, 15, leu2–3, 112, ura3–251, 328, 372) (12van Loon A.P.G.M. van Eijk E. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in lactate medium (0.5% yeast extract, 0.2% w/v magnesium sulfate, 0.6% w/v ammonium phosphate, 2% sodium lactate (70% w/v), 1.3% lactic acid (75% w/v), pH 4.5) until late logarithmic phase. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (13Schoppink P.J. Hemrika W. Reynen J.M. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.6 msorbitol; 25 mm KPi, pH 7.4; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm MgCl2. Protein concentrations were determined with the Lowry method (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membranes were solubilized with 1 mg/mg protein lauryl maltoside (dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml mitochondrial protein. Partly purified bc 1complex, used for EPR analysis, was prepared according to (15Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Trumpower B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), except for the final purification step. Spectral measurements were carried out at room temperature in an Aminco dual wavelength spectrophotometer model DW2000. Concentrations of cytochromes were determined using the following absorbance coefficients and wavelength pairs for the reduced minus oxidized proteins: 24.0 mm−1 cm−1 at 603–625 nm for cytochrome aa 3 (16van Gelder B.F. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), 20.1 mm−1 cm−1 at 550–540 nm for cytochromes c+c 1 (17van Gelder B.F. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 58: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and 28.5 mm−1 cm−1 at 562–575 nm for cytochrome b (17van Gelder B.F. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 58: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc 1) assay was performed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C by measuring the reduction of 18 μm horse heart ferricytochrome c at 550–540 nm by 25 μm Q2H2. The buffer used contained 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm potassium cyanide, and 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, to obtain maximal activity with horse heart cytochrome c as acceptor (18Schoppink P.J. Hemrika W. Berden J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Solubilized mitochondria were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was used in the pre-steady-state measurements. Spectral analysis before the measurements indicated that less than 10% of the cytochromes was in the reduced state because of endogenous substrate. Spectra taken after pre-steady-state reduction indicated that complete reduction is achieved, despite the absence of KCN, an inhibitor of cytochromec oxidase. These spectra further indicated that the amount of cytochrome c was significantly reduced. Stopped-flow measurements were performed using the RX-1000 Rapid Kinetics Spectrometer Accessory (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, U. K.), connected to the DW2000 spectrophotometer. Rapid mixing of enzyme and substrate (ratio 1:1) is achieved by a manual drive. At the end of a drive, a trigger is given to the spectrophotometer which initiates the measurement. Reduction of cytochrome b was monitored at 562versus 575 nm on a DW2000 spectrophotometer at 4 °C. As a substrate 0.5 mm duroquinol was used (final concentration 0.25 mm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8; 250 mm NaCl; 0.1 mg/ml dodecyl maltoside. EPR spectra at X-band (9 GHz) were obtained with a Bruker ECS 106 EPR spectrometer at a field modulation frequency of 100 kHz. Cooling of the sample was performed with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 cryostat with an ITC4 temperature controller. The magnetic field was calibrated with an AEG Magnetic Field Meter. The X-band frequency was measured with an HP 5350B Microwave Frequency Counter. 1,10-Phenanthroline, 1,7-phenanthroline, 4,7-phenanthroline, and 1,10-phenanthroline-ferrous sulfate complex (standard reduction potential +1.08 V; specific extinctionE 1% = 180–200; pH 7; 510 nm) were from BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, U. K. We have found that when OP is added to lauryl maltoside-solubilized mitochondria, it acts as an inactivator of thebc 1 complex. This inactivation is time-dependent, increasing progressively over a period of 1–2 h. To quantitate this inactivation, solubilized mitochondria were incubated with 0.6 μmol of OP/mg of protein at 0, 25, and 30 °C (dilution experiments showed that not the concentration of inhibitor, but the ratio of inhibitor to bc 1 complex is the relevant factor). As can be seen in Fig. 1 inactivation is temperature-dependent, the complex being fully stable for up to 70 min at 0 °C. At 25 and 30 °C inactivation is rapid, activity being reduced by 50% within 40 min at 25 °C and within 25 min at 30 °C. In contrast, no inactivation occurs within 60 min when solubilized mitochondria are incubated at 25 °C in the absence of OP or when intact mitochondria are incubated with OP at 25 °C. This implies that the site of action of OP on the bc 1complex becomes exposed or at least more accessible after solubilization of the membrane. To determine whether the chelating activity of OP is responsible for the inactivation of bc 1 activity, we included the nonchelating isomers m-phenanthroline (MP) andp-phenanthroline (PP) (see Fig. 8). MP was found to inhibitbc 1 activity as well, with approximately the same rate as OP (Fig. 1). In contrast, PP did not have any (significant) effect on electron transfer activity of thebc 1 complex (data not shown). The fact that MP also inhibits bc 1 activity indicates that the chelating activity is not responsible for inactivation.Figure 1Inactivation of electron transfer activity of the bc 1 complex using OP and MP. Lauryl maltoside-solubilized mitochondria (for preparation, see “Experimental Procedures”) were incubated with 0.6 μmol of OP/mg of protein at 0 °C (□), 25 °C (○), and 30 °C (•) and with 0.6 μmol of MP/mg of protein at 25 °C (▪). As controls, intact mitochondria were incubated with OP (▴) and solubilized mitochondria without OP (▵), both at 25 °C. Electron transfer activity was first normalized to 100% and then monitored in time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Chemical structure of the phenanthroline compounds used.

The nitrogen and iron atoms are depicted in white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chelation of a metal ion by OP affects the structure of this compound and thus may affect its capacity to inactivate the bc 1complex. To test this, bc 1 complex was incubated with 0.6 μmol of OP/mg of protein in the presence of increasing amounts of FeSO4 at 25 °C. In the course of this experiment it was found that ferroin itself, which is formed when OP chelates iron, has an inhibitory effect on thebc 1 activity (see also below). The fact that a fraction of OP is converted into ferroin when FeSO4 is added may seem to complicate the analysis of the inhibitory effect of OP in response to increasing amounts of FeSO4. However, ferroin was found to affect bc 1 activity directly after addition, whereas OP requires a certain incubation time and does not show any (measurable) inhibition directly after addition (see Fig. 1, at 1 min). In other words, any inhibition observed directly after addition of OP + FeSO4 is directly attributable to the ferroin that is formed, whereas the inhibition observed after 1 h of incubation is a summation of the effects of ferroin and OP (Fig. 2 A). The difference between the amount of inhibition after 1 h and directly after addition provides the net inhibitory effect of OP. It can be seen that FeSO4 reduces the inhibitory effect of OP, which can be completely abolished when sufficient amounts of FeSO4 are added (Fig. 2 B). To examine further the effect of ferroin, solubilizedbc 1 complex was titrated with this agent. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that increasing amounts of ferroin linearly inhibit the electron transfer activity to around 50% at 1 μmol of ferroin/mg of protein. Surprisingly, a further increase of the amount of ferroin did not result in a further inhibition. It was found that the inhibitory effect of ferroin is not dependent on the incubation temperature. Ferroin thus also inhibits solubilized bc 1complex, but in a different manner than OP. The inhibition by ferroin is instantaneous, in contrast to that by OP, and ferroin can only reduce the bc 1 activity by 50%. Although inactivation of the bc 1complex by OP is not the result of its chelating activity, we noticed that after a certain time of incubation of bc 1complex with OP the sample turned red. This red stain was identified as ferroin, based on its absorption maximum at 510 nm. The formation of ferroin in the sample can be explained in two ways: either iron was present in the sample which is not related to thebc 1 complex, or OP first binds to thebc 1 complex, thereby causing inactivation, and in a second stage chelates one of the iron atoms of the complex. To test this second possibility, the integrity of the prosthetic groups of the bc 1 complex after OP inactivation was examined. The cytochromes of the bc 1 complex, theb and the c 1, contain an iron atom and are putative targets for OP. The upper trace of Fig.4 shows the absorption spectrum of the cytochromes of fully active bc 1 complex and cytochromec oxidase. For the lower trace, solubilized mitochondria were incubated with OP until complete inactivation ofbc 1 activity was achieved. The sample was subsequently divided into a sample and a reference cuvette, and the sample cuvette was reduced with dithionite. It can be seen from the spectrum that the bc 1 cytochromes are still fully reducible, thus indicating that the hemes are not disrupted by OP. The peak at 510 nm in the lower trace is because of ferroin present in higher amounts in the sample cuvette than in the reference cuvette. This is because dithionite reduces additional iron not related to the bc 1 complex present in the mitochondria, which is subsequently bound by OP. Having excluded that OP chelates an iron of one of the cytochromes, the remaining prosthetic group, that of the Rieske Fe-S protein, may be the target of OP. The effect of OP on the Rieske Fe-S cluster was analyzed by EPR after reduction of solubilized bc 1 complex with ascorbate/CN−. First, wild type mitochondria were solubilized and incubated with OP. The decrease inbc 1 activity in time was followed, and an EPR sample was prepared at 100, 50, and 10% of enzyme activity by immediately freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen. Fig.5 shows EPR spectra of the Rieske Fe-S cluster of the three samples. Comparison of the traces corresponding to 100 and 10% enzyme activity indicates that the components of the spectrum of the Fe-S cluster (at g = 1.75, 1.90, and 2.02) all are strongly decreased. The spectrum at 50% enzyme activity, however, is more complicated: the signal at g = 1.75 clearly is reduced, while the other two components are not. The signal atg = 1.90 may even be slightly more intense than for the fully active sample. Note that the signal of the radical atg = 2.00, attributable to the semiquinone form of the covalently bound flavin of the succinate dehydrogenase, is not affected by OP. It can be concluded from this experiment that OP binds an iron atom from the Rieske Fe-S cluster but that this does not parallel the inactivation rate. It thus seems that OP binds to thebc 1 complex in close vicinity of the Rieske Fe-S cluster, thereby possibly affecting the midpoint potential of the cluster, which causes inactivation of electron transfer activity. Furthermore, binding seems to cause an alteration of the EPR line shape, implied by the differences between the EPR spectra corresponding to 100 and 50% electron transfer activity. In a later stage, the Rieske Fe-S cluster disintegrates when OP chelates an iron atom. This view is consistent with the bottom trace in Fig. 5 where the signal at g = 1.90 is 30% of that of the top trace while electron transfer activity is only 10%. Interpretation of the dual effect of OP, first binding to thebc 1 complex causing inactivation and then chelation of an iron atom from the Rieske Fe-S cluster, is slightly hampered by the fact that the two effects partially overlap. As a control, EPR spectra were taken before and after inactivation using MP, the nonchelating isomer of OP. The EPR spectrum after inactivation was identical to that before inactivation (data not shown), thereby confirming that inactivation of bc 1 activity and disruption of the Rieske Fe-S cluster are two distinct processes. Since OP can only chelate an iron atom in its reduced state, we tested whether the inactivation rate is increased when the Rieske Fe-S cluster is kept in its reduced state. The incubation with OP was performed in the presence of 10 mm succinate + KCN. The inactivation rate, however, was found to be virtually the same as for thebc 1 complex in the oxidized state. This result further indicates that the chelation of an iron atom of the Rieske Fe-S cluster is not the step determining the inactivation rate. The different mechanisms by which ferroin and OP inactivate the bc 1 complex have been studied in more detail by analyzing the pre-steady-state reduction kinetics of cytochrome b. Under normal conditions there are two pathways for reduction of cytochrome b, as described by the proton motive Q-cycle (19Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 20Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction can either be achieved via center P, on the positive side of the membrane, and center N on the negative side of the membrane. At center P ubiquinol, or in this case the artificial substrate duroquinol, is oxidized by the Rieske Fe-S protein, thereby generating a ubisemiquinone anion, which in turn reduces cytochromeb 566. In the other pathway, via center N, electrons are transferred to cytochrome b 562. Since both b cytochromes are electronically connected, both can be reduced via either pathway. By using specific inhibitors for either reaction center, reduction of cytochrome b can be restricted to only one pathway. Antimycin blocks reduction via center N, thus only allowing reduction of cytochrome b via the center P pathway (21Bowyer J.R. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1980; 126: 93-97Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Myxothiazol functions in the opposite way, blocking the center P pathway and only allowing reduction via the center N pathway (22Brand U. Schägger H. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome b without inhibitors added and without inactivation of any kind is biphasic when duroquinol is used as electron donor, the fast phase having a half-time (t 1/2) of 40 ms (see Fig.6 A). Note that the experiment was carried out at 4 °C, thereby reducing the reaction rate by a factor of 8–10 compared with the in vivo conditions at 28 °C. The addition of KCN had no effect on the reduction of cytochromeb. Spectral analysis indicated that cytochrome ccontent was strongly diminished in the preparation used. Furthermore, solubilization causes a strong “dilution” of cytochromec, thereby virtually blocking electron transfer from thebc 1 complex to cytochrome c. Spectral analysis further indicated that all cytochrome b in the presence of duroquinol in the pre-steady-state measurements gets reduced. Reduction of cytochrome b via center N in the presence of myxothiazol is monophasic and rapid (Fig. 6 C). Binding of myxothiazol is known to increase the rate of reduction of cytochrome b via center N (23Marres C.A.M. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thereby explaining the monophasic reduction behavior, in contrast to the biphasic reduction kinetics observed when no inhibitor is present. Reduction via the other side of the complex in the presence of antimycin, via center P, is also monophasic, but is much slower, having a t 1/2 of 200 ms. When ferroin is added, thereby inhibiting steady-state activity to 50%, pre-steady-state reduction of cytochrome b in the absence of any inhibitor is also biphasic. The first, rapid phase is not changed, but the second phase is much slower than obtained with the fully active enzyme. Analysis of the reduction kinetics using inhibitors indicates that reduction in the presence of myxothiazol is unaltered, whereas in the presence of antimycin the reduction rate is reduced compared with the fully active enzyme. In the time course of the measurement (1 s) b reduction does not run to completion. The experiment was therefore repeated on a larger time scale (5 s), which indicates that all cytochrome b still is reducible under these conditions (data not shown). This trace also makes it possible to determine the half-time of b reduction in the presence of antimycin, which was found to be ∼450 ms. However, the 1-s experiment implies that reduction of cytochrome b in the presence of antimycin after inhibition by ferroin is biphasic, which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the mechanism of inactivation by ferroin (see “Discussion”). This experiment nevertheless shows that the reaction rate via center P is roughly half of that for the fully active enzyme. It can thus be concluded that ferroin acts on the outside of the bc 1 complex, leaving reduction of cytochrome b via center N unaltered while reducing the reaction rate via center P by 50%. To study the effect of inactivation by OP on the reduction kinetics of cytochrome b, solubilized bc 1 complex was incubated with OP under the same conditions as used in Fig. 1. When steady-state electron transfer activity was reduced to 30%, pre-steady-state reduction of cytochrome b in the presence of antimycin was determined. As can be seen in Fig. 6, only a fraction of cytochrome b is still reducible, corresponding to the 30% residual steady-state activity. After this, using the same sample, cytochrome b reduction in the presence of myxothiazol was measured. Meanwhile, steady-state reduction was reduced to 20%. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that also via center N not all cytochromeb can be reduced. However, the 50% of cytochromeb which is reduced via this pathway does not correspond to the residual fraction of steady-state activity. Thus, a part of thebc 1 complex which can still be reduced via center N is already inactivated, indicating a time lag between inactivation and loss of reducibility of the b cytochromes via center N. We conclude that these results are in agreement with the outcome of the EPR analysis of the Rieske Fe-S cluster. OP binds at the outside of thebc 1 complex thereby blocking reduction of cytochrome b via center P. In a later stage, the Rieske Fe-S cluster is disrupted, resulting in destruction of the entire complex, thereby also abolishing reduction of cytochrome b via center N. Similar to the outcome of the EPR analysis, the pre-steady-state analysis indicates that the two effects of OP partially overlap. Therefore, again MP was included as a control to make a clear distinction between inactivation and distortion of the complex. Solubilized bc 1 complex was incubated with MP under the same conditions as used in Fig. 1. When steady-state electron transfer activity was reduced to 20%, pre-steady-state reduction of cytochrome b was measured (Fig. 7). Note that the time scale in Fig. 7 is different from that in Fig. 6. After inactivation by MP, cytochrome b can still be reduced in the presence of myxothiazol, whereas in the presence of antimycin only a fraction of b is reducible, which corresponds to the residual steady-state activity. Thus, after inactivation center P is blocked, but reduction via center N can still occur. We have shown that OP and MP both inhibit the electron transfer activity of the yeast bc 1 complex. The inhibitory effect is time- and temperature-dependent and is only observed with solubilized mitochondria. The implication of this second observation is that the site of interaction of OP and MP with the bc 1 complex is normally buried in the lipid bilayer and only becomes accessible upon solubilization. This site of action is subsequently identified as the Rieske Fe-S cluster on the basis of experiments performed with OP- and MP-inactivatedbc 1 complex. It has been reported by Finel and Majander that complex I is the main site of action of OP in the inner mitochondrial membrane (9Finel M. Majander A.
