https://openalex.org/W2037511789,"Extensive experiments indicate that the application of heat to flint materials may have conferred an advantage to primitive man in the manufacture of chipped-stone implements. When Florida cherts are slowly heated to between 350 degrees and 400 degrees C and maintained at this temperature for sustained periods, a desirable change occurs in the fracture properties. This alteration takes place when the melting point of the impurities within the intercrystalline spaces is reached; thus the microcrystals of quartz are fitted closer together when materials other than quartz serve as fluxes."

Since the present channel is much wider and deeper than it was when newly dredged, there have been bridge repairs and loss of farmland. Downstream reduction in channel capacity due to termination of dredging has caused channel sedimentation and increased flooding."

https://openalex.org/W1973069799,"A glycogen-containing plastid has been found in the cells of Müllerian bodies on Cecropia peltata (Moraceae) trees. Plastids in cells of the leaf blade, petiole, and stem are of the usual chloroplast type and contain starch grains only. Müllerian bodies exist for the purpose of providing a food supply for a protective, mutualistically inhabiting ant population. A series of chemical tests and observations indicates that this glycogen is identical to animal glycogen."
https://openalex.org/W2090601864,"The theory of models is employed for calculating the speed of geometrically similar racing shells. The theoretical prediction, that shells should have a speed proportional to the number of oarsmen raised to the 1/9 power, is in excellent agreement with observations. A significant implication for the proportions of lightweight and heavyweight eight-oared shells, indicating how both might attain the same speed, is developed."
https://openalex.org/W2155227169,Two phases of the feeding response in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima are controlled by different chemical activators. Asparagine controls the contraction and bending of tentacles which bring food to the mouth; reduced glutathione controls ingestion of food once it has contacted the mouth. A complete feeding response occurs only when both chemical activators are present.

https://openalex.org/W2006631915,"Xenon extracted from natural iodyrite (silver iodide) from Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia, contains excess xenon-129 from the in situ decay of naturally occurring iodine-129 and excess xenon-128 from neutron capture on iodine-127. On the basis of the amount of radiogenic xenon-129, it is estimated that, prior to the nuclear age, terrestrial iodine contained an equilibrium ratio of iodine-129 to iodine-127 of between 3.3 x 10(-15) and 2.2 x 10(-15)."

https://openalex.org/W1985485628,"The use of polyester fibers has grown more rapidly than that of any other man-made fiber. Many factors have contributed to this growth. Polyester's unique physical properties of strength, high modulus, elasticity, and durability are the basis for its success. The tailorability of the fiber makes it possible to generate a whole family of property variants for a wide variety of end uses. The ready availability and low cost of the raw materials, the continuing advances in polymerization technology, and the versatility of the melt spinning process have also been major factors in establishing polyester as the leading man-made fiber. New end uses have had a major impact on the growth of polyester. Most notable was the introduction of durable press fabrics for clothing and home furnishings. The consumer preference for easy-care fabrics and garments makes the durable press area one of continuing growth. Two relatively new areas where growth is expected to continue at a rapid rate are tire cord and textured knits for women's and men's outerwear."
https://openalex.org/W2067598454,Microearthquakes occur on a steeply dipping plane interpreted here as the fault that allows hot water to circulate to the surface in the geothermal region. These small earthquakes are common in many geothermal areas and may occur because of the physical or chemical effects of fluids and fluid pressure.

https://openalex.org/W1984079667,"Heat and steam from the crater fumaroles have melted over 5700 feet (1737 meters) of cave passage in the ice-filled east crater of Mount Rainier. The caves are in approximate balance with the present geothermal heat release. Future changes in the thermal activity of the summit cone will cause corresponding changes in cave passage dimensions, location, and ceiling and wall ablation features."

https://openalex.org/W4245468815,"In its third anlnual report to Congress, entitled ""Environmental Science: Challenge for the Seventies,"" the National Science Board urged ""A Federal Mechanism . . . to provide for the promotion and support of environmental science as a whole."" The Board defined ""environmental science"" as ""the study of all the systems of air, land, water, energy, and life that surround man. It includes all science directed to the system-level of understanding of the environment, drawing especially on such disciplines as meteorology, geophysics, oceanography, and ecology, and utilizing to the fullest the knowledge and techniques developed in such fields as physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and engineering.""
