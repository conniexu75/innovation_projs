https://openalex.org/W2039872800,"Receptors for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) are involved in many plastic and pathological processes in the brain. Glycine has been reported to potentiate NMDA responses in neurons and in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain messenger RNA. Glycine is now shown to be absolutely required for activation of NMDA receptors in oocytes. In voltage-clamped oocytes, neither perfusion nor rapid pressure application of NMDA onto messenger RNA-injected oocytes caused a distinct ionic current without added glycine. When glycine was added, however, NMDA evoked large inward currents. The concentration of glycine required to produce a half-maximal response was 670 nanomolar, and the glycine dose-response curve extrapolated to zero in the absence of glycine. Several analogs of glycine could substitute for glycine, among which D-serine and D-alanine were the most effective. The observation that D-amino acids are effective will be important in developing drugs targeted at the glycine site."

https://openalex.org/W2035562855,"We report the discovery of two genes from Rhizobium meliloti, fixL and fixJ, which are positive regulators of symbiotic expression of diverse nitrogen fixation (nif and fix) genes. nif gene regulation is shown to consist of a cascade: the fixLJ genes activate nifA, which in turn activates nifHDK and fixABCX. Like nifA, fixN can be induced in free-living microaerobic cultures of R. meliloti, indicating a major physiological role for oxygen in nif and fix gene regulation. Microaerobic expression of fixN and nifA depends on fixL and fixJ. The FixL and FixJ proteins belong to a family of two-component regulatory systems widely spread among prokaryotes and responsive to the cell environment. We propose that FixL, which has features of a transmembrane protein, senses an environmental signal and transduces it to FixJ, a transcriptional activator of nif and fix genes."
https://openalex.org/W2162540931,"Normal hematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate in the presence of growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3). Transformation can alter their growth factor requirements, the ability of the cells to differentiate, or both. To identify genes that are capable of transforming hematopoietic cells, IL-3-dependent cell lines, isolated from retrovirus induced myeloid leukemias, were examined for viral insertions in proto-oncogenes and in common sites of viral integration. Five of 37 cell lines contained proviruses in a common viral integration site termed the ecotropic virus integration 1 site (Evi-1). The integrations were correlated with the activation of transcription from the locus. Sequencing of cDNA clones and genomic clones demonstrated that the integrations had occurred near or in 5' noncoding exons of a novel gene. The sequence of the cDNA clones predicts that the gene product is a 120 kd protein that contains two domains with seven and three repeats of a DNA binding consensus sequence (zinc finger) initially described in the Xenopus transcription factor III A (TFIIIA). This represents the first demonstration of the retroviral activation of a gene encoding a zinc finger protein and the first implication for a member of this gene family in the transformation of hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086608701,"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), phencyclidine (PCP), and quisqualate receptor binding were compared to benzodiazepine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in the putamen and cerebral cortex of individuals with Huntington's disease (HD). NMDA receptor binding was reduced by 93 percent in putamen from HD brains compared to binding in normal brains. Quisqualate and PCP receptor binding were reduced by 67 percent, and the binding to other receptors was reduced by 55 percent or less. Binding to these receptors in the cerebral cortex was unchanged in HD brains. The results support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity plays a role in the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2015707895,"Tyrosyl phosphorylation is implicated in the mechanism of insulin action. Mutation of the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor by substitution of tyrosyl residue 960 with phenylalanine had no effect on insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation or phosphotransferase activity of the purified receptor. However, unlike the normal receptor, this mutant was not biologically active in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of at least one endogenous substrate (pp185) was increased significantly in cells expressing the normal receptor but was barely detected in cells expressing the mutant. Therefore, beta-subunit autophosphorylation was not sufficient for the insulin response, and a region of the insulin receptor around Tyr-960 may facilitate phosphorylation of cellular substrates required for transmission of the insulin signal."

https://openalex.org/W1511031451,"A protein kinase, termed microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase, which phosphorylates microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in vitro and is stimulated 1.5-3-fold in extracts from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 cells has been identified (Ray, L.B., and Sturgill, T.W. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 1502-1506). Here, we describe chromatographic properties of MAP kinase and provide biochemical characterization of the partially purified enzyme. Isolation of the enzyme is facilitated by its unusually high affinity for hydrophobic interaction chromatography matrices. The molecular weight of the partially purified enzyme was determined to be 35,000 by gel filtration chromatography and 37,000 by glycerol gradient centrifugation. MAP kinase activity of chromatographic fractions correlated precisely with the presence of a 40-kDa phosphoprotein detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MAP kinase has a Km of 7 microM for ATP and does not utilize GTP. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, ATP citrate-lyase, casein, histones, phosvitin, protamine, and ribosomal protein S6 were all poor substrates relative to MAP-2. The enzyme is inhibited by fluoride and beta-glycerol phosphate but not by heparin. These properties of MAP kinase distinguish it from protein kinases previously described in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W1563828822,"A series of transgenic mice was produced by microinjection of a segment of DNA, containing 460 base pairs of the phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate) carboxykinase promoter-regulatory region ligated to the bovine growth hormone structural gene, into the male pronucleus of fertilized mouse eggs. Founder animals which contained the gene were selected for further analysis and for breeding. The concentration of bovine growth hormone in the serum of animals which were shown to contain the gene ranged from a low of 5 ng/ml serum to approximately 2300 ng/ml serum. Mice with high levels of bovine growth hormone had growth rates double that of their litter mates which did not contain the transgene. The transgene was expressed only in the liver and kidney of the animals studied, and the level of specific mRNA for bovine growth hormone in these tissues could be regulated by diet in a manner similar to the endogenous P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. Feeding the animals a diet high in carbohydrate for 1 week caused a 90% decrease in the concentration of bovine growth hormone in the blood, suggesting that the expression of the chimeric P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase/bovine growth hormone gene is sensitive to insulin. When the same animals were then refed a diet high in protein, but devoid of carbohydrate, the concentration of bovine growth hormone in their blood was induced 30-fold within a week. The administration of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to the transgenic mice caused a 2-fold induction in the level of bovine growth hormone in the serum within 90 min. Thus the region between -460/+73 in the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter-regulatory region contains sequences which can direct the tissue-specific expression, as well as hormonal and dietary responsiveness, of a linked structural gene."
https://openalex.org/W2031249741,"Mismatches arise during recombination, as errors of DNA replication, and from deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine. We determined the efficiency and specificity of mismatch correction in simian cells. Analysis of plaques, obtained after transfection with SV40 DNA molecules harboring a single mispair in a defined orientation within the intron of the large T antigen gene, revealed that all types of base/base mispairs were corrected, albeit with different efficiencies and specificities. Heterogeneous mispairs G/T, A/C, C/T, and A/G, corrected with 96%, 78%, 72%, and 39% efficiencies, respectively, tended to be corrected to G/C. Homogeneous mispairs G/C, C/C, A/A, and T/T were corrected with 92%, 66%, 58%, and 39% efficiencies, respectively, and repair bias was influenced by mismatch flanking sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2017849731,"STE2 encodes a component of the S. cerevisiae α-pheromone receptor that is essential for induction of physiological changes associated with mating. Analysis of C-terminal truncation mutants of STE2 demonstrated that the essential sequences for ligand binding and signal transduction are included within a region containing seven putative transmembrane domains. However, truncation of the C-terminal 105 amino acids of the receptor resulted in a 4- to 5-fold increase in cell-surface pheromone binding sites, a 10-fold increase in pheromone sensitivity, a defect in recovery of cell division after pheromone treatment, and a defect in pheromone-induced morphogenesis. Overproduction of STE2 resulted in about a 6-fold increase in α-pheromone binding capacity but did not produce the other phenotypes associated with the ste2-T326 mutant receptor. We conclude that the C-terminus of the receptor is responsible for one aspect of cellular adaptation to pheromone that is distinct from adaptation controlled by the SST2 gene, for decreasing the stability of the receptor, and for some aspect of cellular morphogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2072363079,"We have separated and purified three factors from HeLa cell nuclear extracts that together can accurately cleave and polyadenylate pre-mRNAs containing the adenovirus L3 polyadenylation site. One of the factors is a poly(A) polymerase with a molecular weight of approximately 50-60 kd. The second activity is a cleavage factor with a native molecular weight in the range of 70-120 kd. The third component is a factor (cleavage and polyadenylation factor, CPF) that is needed for the cleavage reaction and, in addition, confers specificity to the poly(A) polymerase activity; the native molecular weight of CPF is approximately 200 kd. Poly(A) polymerase together with CPF is sufficient to specifically polyadenylate pre-mRNA substrates that have been precleaved at the poly(A) addition site. In contrast, all three components are required for accurate cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA substrates. Further purification of CPF by buoyant density centrifugation, ion exchange, and affinity column chromatography or by gel filtration demonstrates that CPF activity resides in a ribonucleoprotein and copurifies with U11 snRNP."

https://openalex.org/W1559508265,"We have developed a system for studying the proteinase activity of a collagenase family member, transin. Cos cells transfected with a vector designed to direct synthesis of a secretable fusion protein between staphylococcal protein A and transin secrete a latent proteinase, activable by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, which binds to IgG-Sepharose. Treatment with 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate leads to cleavage of the fusion protein and elution of the active proteinase transin. Based on results obtained with this system we propose that transin comprises an N-terminal proteinase domain and an independent C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. The latter domain is not required for binding of inhibitors or for maintenance of transin in its inactive form. The sequence PRCGVPDV is present in the proenzyme forms of collagenase family proteinases just upstream from the N termini of the active enzymes. We show that mutations within this sequence lead to transin variants with a much increased tendency to undergo spontaneous activation. Finally, we show that mutations within a region of transin having sequence similarity to the zinc-binding site of bacterial metalloproteinases inactivate the proteinase activity of transin, lending support to the notion that this region represents part of transin's active site."
https://openalex.org/W1646203193,"It was found previously that proteins conjugated to ubiquitin are degraded by an ATP-dependent enzyme system, but the mode of action of this system was unknown. We have resolved from reticulocyte extracts three factors that are required for the ATP-dependent breakdown of 125I-lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates. Two of the factors interact with ATP, as shown by their protection against heat inactivation by the nucleotide. When the three factors are incubated with 125I-lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates and ATP, there is a lag of 4-6 min in the formation of acid-soluble products before the onset of rapid proteolysis. The lag can be abolished by incubation of the three factors with MgATP prior to the addition of the substrate. This process does not take place if any of the three factors is omitted from preincubation (and added subsequently) or when ATP is replaced by a nonhydrolyzable analog. Analysis of size distribution by glycerol density gradient centrifugation showed that following incubation of the three factors with MgATP, a high molecular mass (greater than 1000 kDa) activity is formed. That the high molecular weight form is a complex of the three factors is indicated by the finding that its formation is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the levels of the free forms of all three factors. Complex formation seems to be similar to the activation process with regard to time course, requirements for ATP and Mg2+, partial effect of CTP, and lack of effect of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. It is suggested that one role of ATP in conjugate breakdown is the formation of an active multienzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1531755510,"In cells transformed by either v-sis or c-sis, the majority of the newly synthesized platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors fail to reach the cell surface and are rapidly degraded. This rapid turnover (t1/2 less than 30 min) appears to result from interaction of the sis gene product with the PDGF receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus during their intracellular routing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane or extracellular compartment. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. 1) Both the 160-kDa precursor and the intracellular 180-kDa mature form of the PDGF receptor possessed ligand binding activity for PDGF; 2) both the 160-kDa precursor and the 180-kDa mature form of the receptor in sis-transformed cells were found to be activated (phosphorylated); 3) protamine, a competitive inhibitor for PDGF or v-sis gene product binding to the cell-surface receptor, did not affect the rapid turnover of the PDGF receptor in sis-transformed cells; 4) suramin, an inhibitor for PDGF or v-sis gene product binding to the PDGF receptor, not only reversed the rapid turnover of the PDGF receptor in sis-transformed cells, but also increased the secretion of sis gene products; and 5) rapid turnover of the PDGF receptor was only observed in sis-transformed cells but not in cells transformed by other oncogenes. We suggest that the persistence of a mitogenic signal from cellular organelles, arising from the intracellular interaction of sis gene products with newly synthesized PDGF receptors, is the mechanism for autocrine transformation by sis."
https://openalex.org/W1993125488,"Familial polyposis coli (FPC) is caused by an autosomal dominant gene on chromosome 5, and it has been proposed that colorectal cancer in the general population arises from loss or inactivation of the FPC gene, analogous to recessive tumor genes in retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor. Since allelic loss can be erroneously scored in nonhomogeneous samples, tumor cell populations were first microdissected from 24 colorectal carcinomas, an additional nine cancers were engrafted in nude mice, and nuclei were flow-sorted from an additional two. Of 31 cancers informative for chromosome 5 markers, only 6 (19%) showed loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 5 alleles, compared to 19 of 34 (56%) on chromosome 17, and 17 of 33 (52%) on chromosome 18. Therefore, it appears that (i) FPC is a true dominant for adenomatosis but not a common recessive gene for colon cancer; and (ii) simple Mendelian models involving loss of alleles at a single locus may be inappropriate for understanding common human solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1995399992,"Marmoset T lymphocytes transformed by herpesvirus saimiri contain the first virally encoded U RNAs (called HSURs) to be identified. HSURs assemble into small nuclear ribonucleoproteins of low abundance (less than or equal to 2 x 10(4) copies/cell). They bind proteins with Sm determinants and acquire a 5' trimethylguanosine cap structure. The sequences of HSUR 1 (143 nucleotides), HSUR 2 (115 nucleotides), HSUR 3 (76 nucleotides), and HSUR 4 (106 nucleotides) are related to each other but are distinct from any previously characterized cellular U RNA. The viral genes encoding the HSURs possess conserved enhancer, promoter, and 3' end formation signals unique to U RNA genes. HSUR 1 and HSUR 2 have a similar 5' end sequence that exhibits perfect complementarity to the highly conserved AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. Oligonucleotide directed RNAase H degradation indicates that this 5' end region is available for base pairing interactions within the HSUR 1 and HSUR 2 snRNP particles."
https://openalex.org/W1539730013,"Hydrolysis of phosphoinositides can lead to mobilization of calcium and production of diacylglycerol, which together are proposed to activate protein kinase C. We have shown that phosphoinositide hydrolysis mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK-D1) occurred with an early lag and increased over a prolonged time course (Slivka, S.R., and Insel, P.A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4200-4207). In this study we characterize another type of receptor-mediated phospholipid hydrolysis in MDCK-D1 cells, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. The predicted products of this hydrolysis, phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol, were detectable as early as 0.5 min after alpha 1-adrenergic receptor stimulation by epinephrine. This hydrolysis appears to be a primary event after receptor occupancy because it occurred in the presence of neomycin, an inhibitor of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, and the protein kinase C inhibitors, sphingosine and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7). In addition, we demonstrate alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase C in MDCK-D1 cells. This activation was measured as a rapid translocation (0.5 min) of protein kinase C activity from the cytosolic fraction to the membrane fraction. This translocation also was not inhibited by neomycin. The time course and agonist concentration dependence of both phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis and protein kinase C activation by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors were similar. Thus, we propose that agonists acting at alpha 1-adrenergic receptors promote hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine which results in rapid generation of diacylglycerol for the activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1646839758,"We have previously described a method for the solubilization and reconstitution of the cGMP-gated cation channel from the membranes of bovine rod outer segments (Cook, N. J., Zeilinger, C., Koch, K.-W., and Kaupp, U. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 17033-17039). Here we report that not only cGMP but also sodium is capable of releasing entrapped calcium from liposomes reconstituted with total rod outer segment membrane proteins. Other alkali cations tested were unable to induce calcium efflux; therefore, we concluded that the sodium-induced calcium efflux was due to the sodium-calcium exchanger. Sodium was found to activate calcium efflux from these liposomes with an EC50 of approximately equal to 35 mM, comparable to values reported for the sodium-calcium exchanger in native rod outer segment membranes. We found that reconstitution of the sodium-calcium exchanger is quantitative and used this method to assay the exchange protein during purification using conventional protein chromatographic techniques. In this way, we were able to purify and identify as the rod outer segment sodium-calcium exchanger a glycoprotein of apparent Mr = 220,000 to greater than 90% homogeneity. The specific activity of the purified protein at room temperature was 8.2 mumol of Ca2+ exchanged min-1 mg-1 of protein at 50 mM Na+, corresponding to a turnover number of approximately equal to 30 Ca2+ (or 90 Na+) s-1 exchanger-1. The Mr = 220,000 protein reported here appears to be distinct from another protein (rim protein) with an identical Mr known to exist in these membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1997910286,"A low activity form of DNA polymerase alpha immunoaffinity-purified from adult-derived human fibroblasts was activated by interaction with phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate, while a high activity form of the enzyme did not interact with phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate or its derivatives. Phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate was apparently hydrolyzed in the presence of a highly purified low activity form of DNA polymerase alpha, effecting the release of diacylglycerol and the retention of inositol-1,4-bisphosphate by the enzyme complex. The resulting inositol-1,4-bisphosphate/protein complex exhibited increased affinity of binding to DNA template/primer and increased deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity. These data indicate that inositol-1,4-bisphosphate may function as an effector molecule in the activation of a low activity form of human DNA polymerase alpha and suggest that it may function as a second messenger during the initiation of mitosis in stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1559671199,"We have investigated the post-translational modification of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for membrane-anchoring in QGP-1 cells derived from a human pancreatic carcinoma. Pulse-chase experiments with [3H]leucine demonstrated that CEA was initially synthesized as a precursor form with Mr 150,000 having N-linked high-mannose-type oligosaccharides, which was then converted to a mature form with Mr 200,000 containing the complex type sugar chains. The mature protein thus labeled was found to be released from the cell surface by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, suggesting that CEA is a phosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein. This was confirmed by metabolic incorporation into CEA of 3H-labeled compounds such as ethanolamine, myo-inositol, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. The 3H-labeled fatty acids incorporated were specifically removed from the protein by nitrous acid deamination as well as by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment. Since the available cDNA sequence predicts that CEA contains a single methionine residue only in its carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, processing of the carboxyl terminus was examined by pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine. It was found that CEA with Mr 150,000 was initially labeled with [35S]methionine but its radioactivity was immediately lost with chase. Taken together, these results suggest that CEA is anchored to the membrane by simultaneously occurring proteolysis of the carboxyl terminus and replacement by the glycophospholipid immediately after the synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1481167131,"Two peaks (mPLC-I and mPLC-II) of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-hydrolyzing activity were resolved when 1% sodium cholate extract from particulate fractions of human platelet was chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose column. The major peak of enzyme activity (mPLC-II) was purified to homogeneity by a combination of Fast Q-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, Ultrogel AcA-44, Mono Q, Superose 6-12 combination column, and Superose 12 column chromatographies. The specific activity increased 2,700-fold as compared with that of the starting particulate fraction. The purified mPLC-II had an estimated molecular weight of 61,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The minor peak of enzyme activity (mPLC-I) was partially purified to 430-fold. Both enzymes hydrolyzed PIP2 at low Ca2+ concentration (0.1-10 microM) and exhibited higher Vmax for PIP2 than for phosphatidylinositol. PIP2-hydrolyzing activities of both enzymes were enhanced by various detergents and lipids, such as deoxycholate, cholate, phosphatidylethanolamine, and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. The mPLC-I and mPLC-II activities were increased by Ca2+, but not by Mg2+, while Hg2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, and La3+ were inhibitory. GTP-binding proteins (Gi, Go, and Ki-ras protein) had no significant effects on the mPLC-II activity."
https://openalex.org/W1526906553,"The 3-A crystal structure of calmodulin indicates that it has a polarized tertiary arrangement in which calcium binding domains I and II are separated from domains III and IV by a long central helix consisting of residues 65-92. To investigate the functional significance of the central helix, mutated calmodulins were engineered with alterations in this region. Using oligonucleotide-primed site-directed mutagenesis, Thr-79 was converted to Pro-79 to generate CaMPM. CaMPM was further mutated by insertion of Pro-Ser-Thr-Asp between Asp-78 and Pro-79 to yield CaMIM. Calmodulin, CaMPM, and CaMIM were indistinguishable in their ability to activate calcineurin and Ca2+-ATPase. All mutated calmodulins would also maximally activate cGMP-phosphodiesterase and myosin light chain kinase, however, the concentrations of CaMPM and CaMIM necessary for half-maximal activation (Kact) were 2- and 9-fold greater, respectively, than CaM23. Conversion of the 2 Pro residues in CaMIM to amino acids that predict retention of helical secondary structure did not restore normal calmodulin activity. To investigate the nature of the interaction between mutated calmodulins and target enzymes, synthetic peptides modeled after the calmodulin binding region of smooth and skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase were prepared and used as inhibitors of calmodulin-dependent cGMP-phosphodiesterase. The data suggest that the different kinetics of activation of myosin light chain kinase by CaM23 and CaMIM are not due to differences in the ability of the activators to bind to the calmodulin binding site of this enzyme. These observations are consistent with a model in which the length but not composition of the central helix is more important for the activation of certain enzymes. The data also support the hypothesis that calmodulin contains multiple sites for protein-protein interaction that are differentially recognized by its multiple target proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1607009526,"The growth of transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T6 cells) in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum was inhibited after treatment with concentrations greater than 50 microM ATP, ADP, or AMP. Adenosine, the common catabolite of the nucleotides, had no effect on cell growth at concentrations below 1 mM. However, the following results indicate that the toxicity of ATP, ADP, and AMP is mediated by serum- and cell-associated hydrolysis of the nucleotides to adenosine. 1) ADP and AMP, but not ATP, were toxic to 3T6 cells grown in serum-free medium or medium in which phosphohydrolase activity of serum was inactivated. Under these conditions, the cells exhibited cell-associated ADPase and 5'-nucleotidase activity, but little ecto-ATPase activity. 2) Inhibition of adenosine transport in 3T6 cells by dipyridamole or S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine prevented the toxicity of ATP in serum-containing medium and of ADP and AMP in serum-free medium. 3) A 16-24-h exposure to 125 microM AMP or ATP was needed to inhibit cell growth under conditions where serum- and cell-associated hydrolysis of the nucleotides generated adenosine in the medium continuously over the same time period. In contrast, 125 microM adenosine was completely degraded to inosine and hypoxanthine within 8-10 h. Furthermore, multiple doses of adenosine added to the cells at regular intervals over a 16-h period were significantly more toxic than an equivalent amount of adenosine added in one dose. Treatment of 3T6 cells with AMP elevated intracellular ATP and ADP levels and reduced intracellular UTP levels, effects which were inhibited by extracellular uridine. Uridine also prevented growth inhibition by ATP, ADP, and AMP. These and other results indicate that serum- and cell-associated hydrolysis of adenine nucleotides to adenosine suppresses growth by adenosine-dependent pyrimidine starvation."
https://openalex.org/W1520082587,"The peptide comprising residues 62-73 of the B-chain of human alpha-thrombin was synthesized and polyclonal antibodies raised against it. These antibodies were found to bind to the synthetic peptide, a CNBr fragment, and a proteolytic subfragment containing this sequence, as well as the entire thrombin molecule. The purified antibodies had no effect on the hydrolysis by thrombin of D-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide and caused only a minimal decrease (20%) in the second-order rate constant for inactivation by antithrombin III. On the other hand, the antibodies competitively inhibited the binding of hirudin over the concentration range tested (0-43 nM), and a dissociation constant of 3.4 +/- 0.5 nM was found for the antibodies. The release of fibrinopeptide A from the A alpha-chain of fibrinogen by thrombin was competitively inhibited with an inhibition constant of 11.7 +/- 0.4 nM. The activation of protein C by thrombin in the presence of thrombomodulin was also inhibited by the antibodies, and an apparent inhibition constant of 10.7 +/- 1.5 nM was found. In contrast, the antibodies had no effect on the activation of protein C in the absence of thrombomodulin. These results are discussed in relation to data obtained recently on the interaction of well defined proteolytic derivatives of human alpha-thrombin with the ligands described above."
https://openalex.org/W1574806752,"Mammalian cardiac muscle contains two myosin alkali light chains which are the major isoforms present in either atrial (MLC1A) or ventricular (MLC1V) muscle, and which are different from the fast skeletal muscle isoforms (MLC1F and MLC3F). The atrial isoform is also expressed in fetal skeletal and fetal ventricular muscle, where this isoform is also described as the fetal isoform MLC1emb. We have previously isolated a cDNA clone encoding part of the mouse MLC1A/MLC1emb isoform and have used this clone to demonstrate the identity of MLC1A and MLC1emb in the mouse. To date no information on the amino acid sequence of this mammalian atrial/fetal isoform has been available. Here we present the complete structure and sequence of the mouse MLC1A/MLC1emb gene, together with the predicted amino acid sequence of this isoform. Comparison of the MLC1A/MLC1emb gene and polypeptide with those of MLC1F and MLC1V suggests that MLC1A/MLC1emb and MLC1V were generated from a common ancestral gene. The NH2-terminal region of MLC1A/MLC1emb, thought to be involved in the actomyosin interaction, shows conservation with MLC1V but not with MLC1F suggesting a shared functional domain in these cardiac isoforms. Comparison with the chicken embryonic MLC (L23) suggests that although MLC1A/MLC1emb and L23 show very different patterns of expression, both during development and in the adult, they probably represent the homologous gene in these two species."
https://openalex.org/W1565947507,"Abstract In order to analyze the cellular determinants that mediate the action of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine, the growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects and the metabolism of the dideoxynucleoside were examined in wild type human CEM T lymphoblasts and in mutant populations of CEM cells that were genetically deficient in either nucleoside transport or deoxycytidine kinase activity. Whereas 2',3'-dideoxycytidine at a concentration of 5 microM inhibited growth of the wild type CEM parental strain by 50%, two nucleoside transport-deficient clones were 4-fold resistant to the pyrimidine analog. The deoxycytidine kinase-deficient cell line was virtually completely resistant to growth inhibition by the dideoxynucleoside at a concentration of 1024 microM. An 80% diminished rate of 2',3'-[5,6-3H]dideoxycytidine influx into the two nucleoside transport-deficient lines could account for their resistance to the dideoxynucleoside, while the resistance of the deoxycytidine kinase-deficient cells to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine toxicity could be explained by a virtually complete failure to incorporate 2',3'-[5,6-3H]dideoxycytidine in situ. Two potent inhibitors of mammalian nucleoside transport, 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine and dipyridamole, mimicked the effects of a genetic deficiency in nucleoside transport with respect to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine toxicity and incorporation. These data indicate that the intracellular metabolism of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine in CEM cells is initiated by the nucleoside transport system and the cellular deoxycytidine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1485442163,"Abstract Two overlapping clones spanning 19 kilobase pairs (kb) of the 5' end of the alpha 1 (IV) collagen gene were isolated and found to contain a single exon which encoded the 5'-untranslated sequence and 84 base pairs of the signal peptide. The 5' end of this exon was determined to be the 5' end of the transcript by S1 nuclease protection and primer extension. The nucleotide sequence of 1 kb of the 5'-flanking DNA was extremely G + C-rich (greater than 70%) and contained two GC boxes and a putative cAMP regulatory sequence. The transcriptional regulation of the alpha 1 (IV) gene was studied with chimeric gene constructs utilizing 2.5 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence coupled to the gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Transfection of this construct into differentiating F9 cells resulted in low chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity compared to beta-actin or Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoters, although these cells produce large amounts of collagen IV. Inclusion of a 2.7-kb sequence 2.3 kb downstream from the first exon in either orientation increased the transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct approximately 10-fold in F9 cells, but was not active in NIH 3T3 cells, which synthesize little collagen IV. These results indicate the presence of an enhancer within the first intron, which increases the expression of this gene."
https://openalex.org/W2072686560,"The association of Wilms' tumor with aniridia (the WAGR complex) in children with 11p13 chromosomal abnormalities has been established, but the paucity of molecular probes in 11p13 has hampered identification of the responsible genes. Two new anonymous DNA segments have been identified that map to the WAGR region of 11p13. Both DNA probes identify a cytologically undetectable deletion associated with a balanced chromosome translocation inherited by a patient with familial aniridia, but not Wilms' tumor. The same two DNA segments are also included in the distal p13-p14.1 deletion of another patient, who has aniridia, Wilms' tumor, and hypogonadism, but they are not included in the p12-p13 deletion of a third patient, who does not have aniridia but has had a Wilms' tumor. The discovery of this aniridia deletion and these two DNA segments that physically separate the Wilms' tumor and aniridia loci should facilitate identification of the genes in the WAGR locus, beginning with the aniridia gene."
https://openalex.org/W1507924238,"Activation of phosphoinositide breakdown is thought to be an important signaling pathway involved in the mitogenic effects of alpha-thrombin in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. We have previously shown that the initial strong stimulation of inositol phosphate formation induced by thrombin in quiescent hamster cells (CCL39 line) is rapidly attenuated. We now report that this desensitization of phospholipase C to thrombin 1) is independent of protein kinase C activation, because thrombin-induced desensitization normally occurs in cells that have been depleted in protein kinase C by a prolonged treatment with a phorbol ester, and 2) is even independent of phosphoinositide hydrolysis because the desensitization still occurs, although at a lesser degree, at 4 degrees C, in the absence of any phospholipase C activity. Furthermore, phospholipase C desensitization to thrombin is homologous. It does not affect the response to thrombin-free serum or the direct activation by A1F-4 of the GTP-binding protein (G-protein) coupled to phospholipase C. We therefore conclude that the desensitization of phospholipase C to thrombin does not result from an impairment of the G-protein-phospholipase C complex, or from a depletion in phosphoinositides, but rather from a modification of thrombin receptors leading to their uncoupling from G-protein. This modification is slowly reversible because, upon thrombin removal, a prolonged incubation (approximately 2 h) restores responsiveness of the cells to thrombin. Although the desensitization seems to depend on thrombin receptor occupancy, it cannot be accounted for by an internalization of the occupied receptors, because it is not blocked at 4 degrees C. The exact mechanism underlying this homologous desensitization of thrombin receptors remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1535892176,"PM2 duplex DNA substrates containing small gaps were utilized to study DNA repair reactions of extensively purified HeLa DNase V (a bidirectional double strand DNA exonuclease) and DNA polymerases beta, gamma (mitochondrial and extramitochondrial), and alpha holoenzyme, and delta as a function of ionic strength. At 50 mM NaCl, DNase V carried out extensive exonucleolytic degradation, and beta-polymerase exhibited strand displacement synthesis. However, at 150 mM NaCl, the DNase appeared only to remove damaged nucleotides from DNA termini while beta-polymerase catalyzed only gap-filling synthesis. When present in equimolar amounts, beta-polymerase and DNase V (which can be isolated as a 1:1 complex) catalyzed more degradation than synthesis at 50 mM NaCl; however, at 150 mM NaCl a coupled very limited nick translation reaction ensued. At physiological ionic strength DNA polymerase alpha holoenzyme was not active upon these substrates. In 15 mM KCl it could fill small gaps and carry out limited nick translation with undamaged DNA, but it could not create a ligatable substrate from UV-irradiated DNA incised with T4 UV endonuclease. Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma was more active at 150 mM NaCl than at lower ionic strengths. It readily filled small gaps but was only marginally capable of strand-displacement synthesis. The extramitochondrial form of gamma-polymerase, conversely, was less sensitive to ionic strength; it too easily filled small gaps but was not effective in catalyzing strand displacement synthesis. Finally, DNA polymerase delta was able to fill gaps of several to 20 nucleotides in 0.05 M NaCl, but at higher NaCl concentrations there was little activity. DNA polymerases delta did not demonstrate strand displacement synthesis. Therefore, at physiological ionic strength, it appears that either DNA polymerase beta or extramitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma might aid in short patch DNA repair of nuclear (or transfecting) DNAs, whereas mitochondrial gamma-polymerase might fill small gaps in mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1502068659,"The kinetics of the reaction of cyanide with free aquocobalamin (H2OCbl) and with aquocobalamin bound to a vitamin B12-binding protein (haptocorrin) from chicken serum (HC-H2OCbl) have been investigated as a function of temperature and pH. The mechanism of replacement of H2O from protein-bound and free H2OCbl is apparently the same and involves attack of both CN- (k1) and HCN (k2). The reactions with HC-H2OCbl are somewhat slower than those with free H2OCbl, k1 being 22-fold smaller and k2 7-fold smaller at 25 degrees C. The relatively small effect of the protein on the rate constants supports the view that the metal in HC-H2OCbl is readily accessible to solvent. Activation parameters suggest that the transition states for ligand substitution are stabilized by nucleophilic participation (at least by CN-) and that ligand substitution on the protein-bound cobalamin proceeds through more ordered, concerted transition states. The latter effect suggests that the Co-O bond of H2OCbl is strengthened upon binding to the haptocorrin."
https://openalex.org/W32512514,"The regulation of ovarian granulosa cell angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptor formation and progesterone secretion by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and Ang-II was studied in cultured cells prepared from hypophysectomized, diethylstilbestrol-treated immature rats. Ang-II receptors (estimated by the specific cell binding of the Ang-II receptor antagonist 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang-II) were present on freshly prepared granulosa cells and increased by over 2-fold (to 2150 binding sites/cell; KD = 0.5 nM) when cultured in serum-free medium for 48 h. FSH prevented the normal increase in Ang-II receptor expression. Maximal FSH-dependent decrease in Ang-II receptors and increase in progesterone secretion occurred at 100 ng/ml FSH. The inhibitory effect of FSH on granulosa cell Ang-II receptor content was partially mimicked by the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cAMP, since 8-bromo-cAMP suppressed (by 96%) Ang-II receptor content to a greater extent than FSH (by 60%). Granulosa cell Ang-II receptor content was not modified by progesterone or 17 beta-estradiol, but was decreased by testosterone (by 35%). Ang-II also produced a decrease in granulosa cell Ang-II receptor content, but did not modify progesterone secretion or aromatase activity. The effect of Ang-II on granulosa cell Ang-II receptor content was mimicked by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, but not by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, suggesting that an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ may be important for the homologous down-regulation of the Ang-II receptor. These data show homologous and heterologous down-regulation of granulosa cell Ang-II receptors. If these regulatory mechanisms exist in the FSH-sensitive healthy follicle, our findings suggest that in the process of maturation, healthy and dominant follicles may become decoupled from angiotensinergic influences."
https://openalex.org/W2155996378,"The DNA sequence specificity for 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen cross-linking of DNA has been examined using chemically synthesized DNA fragments containing all possible pyrimidine and purine base pair combinations. We confirm our previous findings that the 5'-TA dinucleotide represents a preferred cross-link site. Other dinucleotides that form cross-links are 5'-AT much greater than 5'-TG greater than 5'-GT. Although 5'-TA represents a preferred cross-link site, the rate of cross-linking can vary 3-4-fold depending on the base composition flanking the cross-linkable 5'-TA dinucleotide. In some cases, changes in DNA sequence 3 base pairs (bp) away from 5'-TA resulted in significant changes in the rate of cross-linking. We also see evidence for a long-range sequence context effect on the rate of cross-linking. A 30-bp fragment cross-linked at a relative rate of 2.9 compared to the rate of cross-linking of a 20-bp fragment when cloned contiguously in plasmid DNA. When cross-linked as separate fragments, the 30-bp fragment cross-linked at a relative rate of 1.9 compared to the 20-bp fragment. The results suggest that the reactivity of DNA to psoralens, and perhaps other intercalating drugs, is dependent on the dinucleotide sequence, the bases flanking the dinucleotide, and the long-range sequence context of the DNA."

Transfected COS cells secreted an immunoreactive protein of Mr approximately 110,000 that appeared to be functionally equivalent to the plasma-derived protein as established by the following criteria: 1) ability to form sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with C1s, factor XIIa, and kallikrein; 2) inhibition of C1s-mediated C4 consumption; and 3) susceptibility to inactivation by the nontarget proteinase elastase. Quantitation of secreted recombinant C1 inhibitor by radioimmunoassay indicated that 72 h after transfection the level was approximately 2.2 micrograms/ml. Treatment of transfected cells with tunicamycin resulted in secretion of a protein of Mr approximately 90,000 that was also capable of complex formation with C1s."
https://openalex.org/W251024383,"Harvey sarcoma virus induces a number of neuron-associated properties in a nerve growth factor-responsive cell line, PC12 (Noda, M., Ko, M., Ogura, A., Liu, D., Amano, T., Takano, T., and Ikawa, Y. (1985) Nature 318, 73-75). We investigated the mechanism of this phenomenon using PC12 sublines cotransfected with a plasmid containing v-Ha-ras gene under control of a hormone-responsive enhancer/promoter element of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (pM14-1) and a plasmid encoding G418 resistance (pSV2neo). Extent of the expression of neuron-associated properties in several cell clones after the addition of dexamethazone (DEX) seems to correlate well with the levels of the v-Ha-ras gene expression. After the induction of v-Ha-ras expression with DEX in these cell lines, sustained elevation of the levels of cAMP as well as of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) metabolites, inositol trisphosphate, and diacylglycerol, is observed. Physiological significance of this phenomenon is confirmed by the observation that dibutyryl cAMP and phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate synergistically induces the expression of neuron-associated properties in PC12 cells. In control PC12 sublines transfected with pSV2neo alone, DEX shows no effects on their cell morphology and the levels of cAMP and the PtdIns metabolites, although these control cell lines are competent to the effects of dibutyryl cAMP and phorbol ester. The priming activity known to be associated with nerve growth factor is also observed with v-Ha-ras as well as with dibutyryl cAMP plus phorbol ester but not with dibutyryl cAMP or phorbol ester alone. The observations suggest that the role of v-Ha-ras gene product in this system may involved simultaneous activation of the two signaling pathways, those mediated by cAMP and by PtdIns turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1580564667,"Previous studies from other laboratories, using rabbit reticulocyte lysate filtered through Sephadex G-25 or G-50, have demonstrated that glucose 6-phosphate is required to maintain active rates of translation, but its mechanism of action is currently unsettled. We have tested whether glucose 6-phosphate is required to prevent activation of the hemin-controlled translational repressor and the phosphorylation of the smallest or alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2). We have found that antibody to the hemin-controlled translational repressor can completely restore protein synthesis in reticulocyte lysate, filtered through Sephadex G-25, that is incubated in the absence of hemin and presence of glucose 6-phosphate, but cannot restore protein synthesis in such lysate incubated in the presence of hemin and absence of glucose 6-phosphate. We have also found, using a modification of the method of Matts and London [1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6708-6711) to measure the ability of gel-filtered lysate to dissociate and exchange GDP from eIF-2.GDP, that this endogenous eIF-2B activity is reduced to the same low level in the presence of hemin and absence of glucose 6-phosphate as it is in the absence of hemin and presence of glucose 6-phosphate. Although there is a low level of phosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha in gel-filtered lysate given hemin but no glucose 6-phosphate, it cannot account for the loss of eIF-2B activity, since this phosphorylation is removed by antibody to the hemin-controlled translational repressor or isocitrate, which do not restore protein synthesis or eIF-2B activity, and not by fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which does partially restore protein synthesis and eIF-2B activity. These findings suggest that sugar phosphates may exert a direct effect on eIF-2B and may be required for its proper function. Additional support for this conclusion is our finding that protein synthesis and eIF-2B activity in partially hemin-deficient lysate can be restored by high levels of glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 1,6-diphosphate without a reduction in the level of phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha, suggesting that such levels of sugar phosphate may permit restoration of normal function with a limiting amount of eIF-2B."
https://openalex.org/W1507749814,"We described a protocol for purification of bovine brain membranes suitable to study the binding of iodinated basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to bovine brain membrane preparation. The binding of 125I basic FGF to brain membranes reached equilibrium within 30 min at 20 degrees C, was reversible, and displaced by an excess of unlabeled basic FGF. Scatchard analysis of the data revealed that two classes of binding sites could be detected with an apparent Kd of 30 pM and a capacity of 0.24 pmol/mg of membrane proteins for the high affinity binding site and Kd of 3 nM with a capacity of 51 pmol/mg of membrane proteins for the low affinity binding site. Cross-linking experiments of labeled basic FGF to brain membrane receptor yield the formation of a single major complex with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa which is similar to the value obtained for the high affinity binding site for basic FGF on target cells in tissue culture. Hence these data present the first biochemical evidence suggesting that membrane purified from bovine brain contain two classes of specific binding sites for basic FGF and confirm results described with cells grown in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1593506705,"The dnaN gene of Escherichia coli determines the beta subunit of DNA polymerase III, a multisubunit enzyme responsible for most of the replicative DNA synthesis. The dnaN gene maps between the dnaA and recF genes. We have characterized the regulatory region of the dnaN gene by screening DNA restriction fragments for promoter activity, S1 mapping of mRNAs, deletion analysis, and in vivo dnaN complementation tests. There are at least three dnaN promoters located in the second half of the dnaA coding region. The one closest to the dnaN structural gene is the weakest, but it provides sufficient dnaN expression for complementation when the gene is present on a multicopy plasmid. Deletion of sequences needed for initiation of dnaN translation or introduction of nonsense codons into dnaN causes reduction of recF expression. However, a deletion inactivating dnaN without changing the reading frame of the gene does not affect expression of the recF gene. These results indicate that the dnaN and recF genes are organized in an operon. We have previously shown the presence of termination signals within the dnaN coding region (Armengod, M.E., and Lambies, E. (1986) Gene (Amst.) 43, 183-196). Therefore, we propose that the polarity produced by nonsense mutations in dnaN is primarily transcriptional. The uncoupling of transcription and translation of the dnaN gene (when translation is interrupted by premature nonsense codons or by other mechanisms) probably results in transcription termination at termination signals in dnaN."
https://openalex.org/W1606228803,The regulatory mechanism for the hormonal control of prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH) gene expression in rat pituitary gland during gestation and lactation is verified in this study. The level of PRL-specific mRNA (mRNAPRL) sequences in the pituitary gland is elevated in the later part of gestation and more prominently so in lactation. In contrast the expression of GH gene is inhibited in the same tissue during gestation and lactation resulting in the dramatic decrease in the level of GH-specific mRNA (mRNAGH) sequences. We now demonstrate the influence of a tissue-specific altered DNA methylation pattern on the temporal modulation of expression of PRL and GH genes in the pituitary gland during alternate physiological states. An altered methylation pattern of specific residues only in the coding region of PRL and GH gene can be detected concurrently with the altered level of expression of these genes in the pituitary gland during gestation and lactation. These results also demonstrate the dynamic state of methylation of specific -C- residues during the transition of these two genes from one state of expression to another in the same tissue. A correlation between site-specific DNA methylation and tissue-specific expression of PRL and GH gene in pituitary gland is reported. Thus a role of DNA methylation in the hormonal control of PRL and GH gene expression in physiological states such as pregnancy and lactation is proposed.
https://openalex.org/W1541840089,"The role of zinc in beef heart cytochrome c oxidase has been studied by using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, zinc depletion and secondary structure predictions of subunits of beef heart cytochrome c oxidase. The stoichiometry of zinc in cytochrome oxidase has been determined in 35 different preparations and found to be one-half of copper (Cu:Zu = 2:1). Zinc is tightly bound to this enzyme and cannot be removed by dialysis against EDTA. However, zinc could be partially (up to 50%) depleted by treating the enzyme with either dipicolinic acid or by trypsin digestion. This partial depletion of zinc does not change the O2 uptake rate. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the atom is in a distorted tetrahedral environment with mostly sulfur ligands. Since subunit VIa removed by the digestion removes about one-half the zinc, a possible binding site involves the two S sites present in that subunit with an appropriate folding in a structural role."
https://openalex.org/W1508189433,"Radiation inactivation is a method to determine the apparent target size of molecules. In this report we examined whether radiation inactivation of various enzymes and brain receptors is influenced by the preparation of samples preceding irradiation. The apparent target sizes of endogenous acetylcholinesterase and pyruvate kinase from rat brain and from rabbit muscle and benzodiazepine receptor from rat brain were investigated in some detail. In addition the target sizes of alcohol dehydrogenase (from yeast and horse liver), beta-galactosidase (from Escherichia coli), lactate dehydrogenase (endogenous from rat brain), and 5-HT2 receptors, acetylcholine muscarine receptors, and [35S] butyl bicyclophosphorothionate tertiary binding sites from rat brain were determined. The results show that apparent target sizes are highly influenced by the procedure applied for sample preparation before irradiation. The data indicate that irradiation of frozen whole tissue as opposed to lyophilized tissue or frozen tissue homogenates will estimate the smallest and most relevant functional target size of a receptor or an enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1510629237,"The effect of inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and the resultant lowering of polyamine levels upon human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) production in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells was investigated. DFMO (10 mM) totally inhibited ornithine decarboxylase activity. In DFMO-treated cells, cellular spermidine concentrations fell to nondetectable levels (less than 1% of control values) within 24 h and spermine concentrations were reduced to 41.9% of controls over 6 days. DFMO caused a 70-80% inhibition of hCG production. Levels of mRNA for both the alpha and beta subunits of hCG were also inhibited relative to mRNA for tubulin. Exogenous putrescine normalized hCG production in a dose-dependent manner. Other diamines, including cadaverine, 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,6-diaminohexane, and 1,7-diaminoheptane, were ineffective in reestablishing hCG production in DFMO-treated cells. Dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM) stimulated hCG production and increased levels of mRNA for the alpha and beta subunit 5-40-fold in both DFMO-treated and control cells. Polyamines appear to have a fundamental role in hCG production in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. However, dibutyryl cAMP can partially overcome or circumvent the requirement for polyamines in hCG biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1492756809,"The effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and paraquat on the growth of Escherichia coli were investigated. Paraquat at 10 mM caused some inhibition of growth of E. coli in trypticase-soy-yeast extract medium. CCl4 enhanced growth inhibition by paraquat in a concentration-dependent manner. In the absence of paraquat, CCl4 had no effect on growth rate or on surviving cell numbers at stationary phase. CCl4 did not prevent the induction of manganese-superoxide dismutase by paraquat. Under anaerobic conditions, CCl4 and paraquat exhibited no effect on E. coli. In the presence of Mn(II) and paraquat, intracellular superoxide dismutase was markedly induced and protected E. coli against the toxicity of CCl4 and paraquat. The reactive free radical CCl3OO-, which can be formed from the reaction of O2- with CCl4, may cause cell damage. The growth-inhibiting effects of polyhalides in the presence of paraquat followed the order CBrCl3 greater than CCl4 greater than CHCl3 greater than CH2Cl2, which is in accord with that of the reaction rates of these compounds with O2- and with their hepatotoxicities. These results suggest that O2- plays a role in the hepatotoxicity of polyhalides."
https://openalex.org/W1589771868,"The addition of hydralazine (1-hydrazinophthalazine) to rat liver mitochondria metabolizing malate/glutamate causes formation of a carbon-centered free radical which was spin-trapped with phenyl-t-butylnitrone (PBN) or dimethylpyrrolidine-N-oxide (DMPO). The coupling constants of the spin-trapped free radical were AN = 16.1, AH beta = 4.6 G for PBN and AN = 15.9, AH beta = 18.9 G for DMPO-trapped radical in aqueous solution. The spin-trapped free radical was shown to be the carbon dioxide anion free radical by independent synthesis, high pressure liquid chromatography separation, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. The amount of carbon dioxide anion free radical produced was absolutely dependent upon the presence of hydralazine and varied depending on mitochondrial substrate, with by far the highest amount produced by pyruvate. Studies with 13C-labeled pyruvate demonstrated that the carbon dioxide free radical came from C-1 of this compound."

Incubation of transcripts prepared with adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) in a HeLa cell nuclear extract showed that the presence of the thionucleotide in a transcript inhibited splicing, but a novel product was formed by cleavage three nucleotides upstream of the 3' splice site. This product was formed with the same kinetics as the intermediates of a normal splicing reaction, and its formation depended on the presence of intact small nuclear RNAs U1, U2, and U6. We conclude that activation of 3' splice site-proximal sequences need not be linked to exon ligation."
