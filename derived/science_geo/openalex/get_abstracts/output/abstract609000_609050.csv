https://openalex.org/W2800305992,"Metabarcoding of lake sediments have been shown to reveal current and past biodiversity, but little is known about the degree to which taxa growing in the vegetation are represented in environmental DNA (eDNA) records. We analysed composition of lake and catchment vegetation and vascular plant eDNA at 11 lakes in northern Norway. Out of 489 records of taxa growing within 2 m from the lake shore, 17–49% (mean 31%) of the identifiable taxa recorded were detected with eDNA. Of the 217 eDNA records of 47 plant taxa in the 11 lakes, 73% and 12% matched taxa recorded in vegetation surveys within 2 m and up to about 50 m away from the lakeshore, respectively, whereas 16% were not recorded in the vegetation surveys of the same lake. The latter include taxa likely overlooked in the vegetation surveys or growing outside the survey area. The percentages detected were 61, 47, 25, and 15 for dominant, common, scattered, and rare taxa, respectively. Similar numbers for aquatic plants were 88, 88, 33 and 62%, respectively. Detection rate and taxonomic resolution varied among plant families and functional groups with good detection of e.g. Ericaceae, Roseaceae, deciduous trees, ferns, club mosses and aquatics. The representation of terrestrial taxa in eDNA depends on both their distance from the sampling site and their abundance and is sufficient for recording vegetation types. For aquatic vegetation, eDNA may be comparable with, or even superior to, in-lake vegetation surveys and may therefore be used as an tool for biomonitoring. For reconstruction of terrestrial vegetation, technical improvements and more intensive sampling is needed to detect a higher proportion of rare taxa although DNA of some taxa may never reach the lake sediments due to taphonomical constrains. Nevertheless, eDNA performs similar to conventional methods of pollen and macrofossil analyses and may therefore be an important tool for reconstruction of past vegetation."

In the present study, we use Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling approach to predict the potential of distribution of eleven IAPS under future climatic conditions under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 in part of Kailash sacred landscape region in Western Himalaya. Based on the model predictions, distribution of most of these invasive plants is expected to expand under future climatic scenarios, which might pose a serious threat to the native ecosystems through competition for resources in the study area. Native scrublands and subtropical needle-leaved forests will be the most affected ecosystems by the expansion of these IAPS. The present study is first of its kind in the Kailash Sacred Landscape in the field of invasive plants and the predictions of potential distribution under future climatic conditions from our study could help decision makers in planning and managing these forest ecosystems effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2801929954,"Collagen hydrogels are widely used for in-vitro experiments and tissue engineering applications. Their use has been extended due to their biocompatibility with cells and their capacity to mimic biological tissues; nevertheless their mechanical properties are not always optimal for these purposes. Hydrogels are formed by a network of polymer filaments embedded on an aqueous substrate and their mechanical properties are mainly defined by the filament network architecture and the individual filament properties. To increase properties of native collagen, such as stiffness or strain-stiffening, these networks can be modified by adding crosslinking agents that alter the network architecture, increasing the unions between filaments. In this work, we have investigated the effect of one crosslinking agent, transglutaminase, in collagen hydrogels with varying collagen concentration. We have observed a linear dependency of the gel rigidity on the collagen concentration. Moreover, the addition of transglutaminase has induced an earlier strain-stiffening of the collagen gels. In addition, to better understand the mechanical implications of collagen concentration and crosslinkers inclusion, we have adapted an existing computational model, based on the worm-like chain model (WLC), to reproduce the mechanical behavior of the collagen gels. With this model we can estimate the parameters of the biopolymer networks without more sophisticated techniques, such as image processing or network reconstruction, or, inversely, predict the mechanical properties of a defined collagen network."
https://openalex.org/W2801397054,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can cause arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac death. Here, we functionally characterized the motor domains of five DCM-causing mutations in human β-cardiac myosin. Kinetic analyses of the individual events in the ATPase cycle revealed that each mutation alters different steps in this cycle. For example, different mutations gave enhanced or reduced rate constants of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, or ADP release or exhibited altered ATP, ADP, or actin affinity. Local effects dominated, no common pattern accounted for the similar mutant phenotype, and there was no distinct set of changes that distinguished DCM mutations from previously analyzed HCM myosin mutations. That said, using our data to model the complete ATPase contraction cycle revealed additional critical insights. Four of the DCM mutations lowered the duty ratio (the ATPase cycle portion when myosin strongly binds actin) because of reduced occupancy of the force-holding A·M·D complex in the steady state. Under load, the A·M·D state is predicted to increase owing to a reduced rate constant for ADP release, and this effect was blunted for all five DCM mutations. We observed the opposite effects for two HCM mutations, namely R403Q and R453C. Moreover, the analysis predicted more economical use of ATP by the DCM mutants than by WT and the HCM mutants. Our findings indicate that DCM mutants have a deficit in force generation and force-holding capacity due to the reduced occupancy of the force-holding state."
https://openalex.org/W2801531600,"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for cognitive flexibility, the ability to switch between two task-relevant dimensions. Changes in neuronal oscillations and alterations in the coupling across frequency ranges have been correlated with attention and cognitive flexibility. Here we show that astrocytes in the mPFC of adult male Sprague Dawley rats, participate in cognitive flexibility through the astrocyte-specific Ca2+ binding protein S100β, which improves cognitive flexibility and increases phase amplitude coupling between theta and gamma oscillations. We further show that reduction of astrocyte number in the mPFC impairs cognitive flexibility and diminishes delta, alpha and gamma power. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the mPFC enhances cognitive flexibility, while inactivation of endogenous S100β among chemogenetically activated astrocytes in the mPFC prevents this improvement. Collectively, our work suggests that astrocytes make important contributions to cognitive flexibility and that they do so by releasing a Ca2+ binding protein which in turn enhances coordinated neuronal oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W2800955969,"Background Patients with mild degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) are often managed non-operatively, and surgery is recommended if neurological progression occurs. However, detection of progression is often subjective. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) directly measures spinal cord (SC) tissue changes, detecting axonal injury, demyelination, and atrophy. This longitudinal study compared multiparametric qMRI with clinical measures of progression in non-operative DCM patients. Methods 26 DCM patients were followed. Clinical data included modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) and additional assessments. 3T qMRI data included cross sectional area, diffusion fractional anisotropy, magnetization transfer ratio, and T2*-weighted white/grey matter signal ratio, extracted from the compressed SC and above/below. Progression was defined as 1) patients’ subjective impression, 2) 2-point mJOA decrease, 3) ≥3 clinical measures worsening ≥5%, 4) increased compression on MRI, or 5) ≥1 of 10 qMRI measures or composite score worsening (p < 0.004, corrected). Results Follow-up (13.5 ± 4.9 months) included mJOA in all 26 patients, MRI in 25, and clinical/qMRI in 22. 42.3% reported subjective worsening, compared with mJOA (11.5%), MRI (20%), comprehensive assessments (54.6%), and qMRI (68.2%). Relative to subjective worsening, qMRI showed 100% sensitivity and 53.3% specificity compared with comprehensive assessments (75%, 60%), mJOA (27.3%, 100%), and MRI (18.2%, 81.3%). A decision-making algorithm incorporating qMRI identified progression and recommended surgery for 11 subjects (42.3%). Conclusions Quantitative MRI shows high sensitivity to detect myelopathic progression. Our results suggest that neuroplasticity and behavioural adaptation may mask progressive SC tissue injury. qMRI appears to be a useful method to confirm subtle myelopathic progression in individual patients, representing an advance toward clinical translation of qMRI."
https://openalex.org/W2802226246,"Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca2+ influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2800727099,"The mammary gland is very intricately and well organized into distinct tissues, including epithelia, endothelia, adipocytes, and stromal and immune cells. Many mammary gland diseases, such as breast cancer, arise from abnormalities in the mammary epithelium, which is mainly composed of two distinct lineages, the basal and luminal cells. Because of the limitation of traditional transcriptome analysis of bulk mammary cells, the hierarchy and heterogeneity of mammary cells within these two lineages remain unclear. To this end, using single-cell RNA-Seq coupled with FACS analysis and principal component analysis, we determined gene expression profiles of mammary epithelial cells of virgin and pregnant mice. These analyses revealed a much higher heterogeneity among the mammary cells than has been previously reported and enabled cell classification into distinct subgroups according to signature gene markers present in each group. We also identified and verified a rare CDH5+ cell subpopulation within a basal cell lineage as quiescent mammary stem cells (MaSCs). Moreover, using pseudo-temporal analysis, we reconstructed the developmental trajectory of mammary epithelia and uncovered distinct changes in gene expression and in biological functions of mammary cells along the developmental process. In conclusion, our work greatly refines the resolution of the cellular hierarchy in developing mammary tissues. The discovery of CDH5+ cells as MaSCs in these tissues may have implications for our understanding of the initiation, development, and pathogenesis of mammary tumors.

The mammary gland is one of the most typical characteristics of mammals. This milk-producing organ is very intricate and exactly organized, composed of variable cell types, such as epithelia, endothelia, adipocytes, and stromal and immune cells. During puberty, the mammary gland quickly develops and becomes functionally mature in response to sexual hormones; it undergoes particularly dramatic structural and functional changes in pregnancy. So, the mammary gland serves for decades as a perfect example to study the self-renewal and differentiation of adult stem cells, as well as interplaying among distinct types of cells with different functions and differentiation potentials, and also the regulations of cells from other factors of the microenvironment, such as sexual hormones (1Hennighausen L.

The human and mouse mammary epithelia share the similar tree-like ductal and lobular structures and consist of two main cellular lineages, termed the basal (or myoepithelial) cells and luminal cells. Previous studies indicate that the mammary stem cells (MaSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: MaSCmammary stem cellP12pregnant day 12VBbasal cells from virgin female miceVLluminal cells from virgin female micePBbasal cells from P12 micePLluminal cells from P12 micePCAprincipal component analysistSNEt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor EmbeddingGOGene OntologyLBLClipid biosynthetic luminal cellKLCkeratinized luminal cellsSRLCstimuli-responsive luminal cellsPBCproliferative basal cellsWRBCWnt signaling–responsive basal cellsPLCproliferative luminal cellEMTepithelial–mesenchymal transitionFPKMfragments per kb of exon per million reads mappedDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serum. are enriched in the basal population and show a similar gene expression profile as basal cells and can further differentiate into basal/luminal cells via the progenitor (unipotent stem cells) stage (2Prater M.D. Petit V.

From a human health perspective, many mammary gland diseases, in particular breast cancer, are closely related to the abnormality of mammary epithelia, especially the MaSCs and/or progenitors (7Prat A.

Moreover, the characteristics, aggressiveness, prognosis, and treatment strategies of breast cancer are highly relevant to the heterogeneity and hierarchy of mammary epithelia, whose complexity has not been well revealed. Single cell RNA-seq is a recently devised and continuously developing technology, which achieves the refinement of gene expression analysis from the bulk of cells deep into the single cell level, and so it greatly facilitates the studies in the stem cell, embryonic and adult development, cancer research, and many other fields (9Kolodziejczyk A.A.

The valuable information harbored in gene-expression profiles contributes greatly to elucidating the previously imperceptible but quite significant differences of seemingly identical single cells.

In this study, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to uncover the heterogeneity and differentiation trajectory of mouse mammary epithelia as well as the novel markers for the MaSCs and other subgroups and also the molecular changes, especially pathway regulation during the MaSCs differentiation in virgin and pregnant states. We identified a rare basal population with exclusive expression of Cdh5 and other genes as quiescent MaSCs. As parts of these candidate markers for MaSCs, including Cdh5, which have been previously reported to be specifically expressed in the endothelial precursors and progeny, play important roles in cell adhesion and other cellular functions, we hypothesize that these lineages of adult stem cells might share similar gene expression features, biological functions, and differentiation processes at given developmental stages. To obtain gene expression profiles of single mouse mammary epithelial cells, we devised a workflow, including isolation and sorting of single cells, automated capture and reverse transcription on a Fluidigm C1 platform (24Pollen A.A.

As pregnancy greatly stimulates mammary gland development, we aimed to assess the effect of pregnancy on the heterogeneity of the mammary cells, and so we isolated the mammary cells from both mature virgin (3–4 months old) and age-matched pregnant day 12 (P12) female mice. To facilitate the data analysis, we pre-classified the mouse mammary epithelia via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) into basal and luminal lineages separately based on the distinct expression pattern of cell-surface markers CD24 and CD29 (encoded by Cd24a and Itgb1, respectively). The CD24MidCD29Hi signature marks for basal cells and the CD24HiCD29Lo characters for luminal cells, regardless of the virgin or pregnant status (Fig. 1B). In line with a previous report (25Asselin-Labat M.L. Vaillant F. Sheridan J.M. Pal B. Wu D. Simpson E.R. Yasuda H. Smyth G.K. Martin T.J. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Control of mammary stem cell function by steroid hormone signalling.Nature. 2010; 465 (20383121): 798-80210.1038/nature09027Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), pregnancy increases the population of mouse mammary epithelium compared with the virgin stage (Fig. 1C). In total, we obtained 239 high-quality samples, including 34 basal and 54 luminal cells from virgin female mice as well as 102 basal and 49 luminal cells from P12 mice (termed as VB, VL, PB, and PL cells in this study), which were selected from a total of 404 captured single cells via rigorous quality control (Fig. S1 and “Materials and methods”). By comparing the single cell RNA-seq samples, we noticed that the overall gene expression level (number of genes with FPKM >1 or >10) of the basal cells from virgin mice was much less than those from pregnant mice; although the luminal cells showed little difference with or without pregnancy (Fig. 1D). Notably, we totally captured 103 single basal cells from virgin mice, but 69 cells failed to pass the quality control mainly due to low gene–expression levels (Fig. S1). In addition, the 34 VB samples had fewer expressed genes than the VL samples (Fig. 1D), indicating an inactive status of gene expression in basal cells of virgin mice. To evaluate the heterogeneity among the single mammary cells, after collection of the high-resolution RNA-seq data (Table S1), we first performed the principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). The result showed that the basal and luminal cells were distinctly separated mostly by the PC1 dimension, regardless of the pregnancy status. Moreover, the PC2 dimension to some extent reflected the effect of pregnancy on the basal mammary cells; and in the PC3 dimension, the luminal cells from virgin and P12 mice showed distinct patterns (Fig. S2A). To figure out which genes and related pathways mainly contribute to classification of the cells, we checked the top 1000 genes of PC1, PC2, and PC3. Further analysis indicated these gene sets are enriched for distinct biological functions, such as PC1 for transport and oxidation-reduction process; PC2 for translation and cell adhesion; and PC3 for lipid metabolism process and innate immune response, etc. (Table S2 and Fig. S2B), implying such functions might be closely related to and highly affected by cell lineages and pregnancy. Next, we examined the co-relationship of the single cells within the four groups based on overall gene expression patterns and found the basal cells showed much higher heterogeneity compared with the luminal cells, and pregnancy reduced the heterogeneity of both basal and luminal cells (Fig. 2B). Then, to reconstruct the hierarchy of the mammary epithelia, we unbiasedly clustered the single cells into six subgroups (C1–C6) based on overall gene-expression profiles (hierarchy clustering analysis) and checked the expression patterns of some housekeeping genes, basal, luminal, and MaSC markers in distinct subgroups at single cell levels (Fig. 2C). In detail, the single basal cells and only a few luminal cells were clustered into subgroups C1–C3, and subgroups C4–C6 consisted of the rest of the luminal cells. Based on hierarchy-clustering analysis, we further divided C2 into two subclusters C2A and C2B, where C2A only included PB cells except for two PL cells, and most members of C2B were from the VB group (Fig. 2C). Studying expression levels of several selected genes, we found the expression of housekeeping genes Actb, Actg1, and B2m was roughly even among all the single cells, confirming there is no obvious technical bias among the RNA-seq libraries (Fig. 2C). In accordance with our FACS setting, the basal cells had high expression of lineage markers Itgb1, Itga6, Krt5, Krt14, and krt17, whereas the luminal cells had high expression of Cd24a, Krt8, and Krt18. Notably, the Esr1, Pgr, and Erbb2, which play significant roles in mammary development and breast cancer formation, were exclusively expressed in subgroups C5 and C6 of luminal cells mainly from virgin mice instead of the P12 mice (Fig. 2C). In line with previous reports (26Saji S. Jensen E.V. Nilsson S. Rylander T. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Estrogen receptors α and β in the rodent mammary gland.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In addition, previously described MaSC markers showed distinct expression patterns in our results, for example, about 70% of all the cells (168/239) expressed Lgr5, and eight cells expressed the Procr (six basal and two luminal cells). Although expression of Axin2 and Inpp5d (also termed as s-ship) could only be detected in one VL cell and one VB cell, respectively, six of the 136 basal cells showed the expression of Bcl11b, a recently identified quiescent MaSC marker (29Cai S.

Meanwhile, no luminal cell expressed this gene. Another new marker for quiescent MaSCs, Tspan8, was found randomly expressed in 7/136 basal and 12/103 luminal cells (Fig. 2C) (30Fu N.Y. Rios A.C. Pal B. Law C.W. Jamieson P. Liu R. Vaillant F. Jackling F. Liu K.H. Smyth G.K. Lindeman G.J. Ritchie M.E. Visvader J.E.

Cell Biol. 2017; 19 (28192422): 164-17610.1038/ncb3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Together, the inconsistent expression patterns of previously identified MaSC markers in our single-cell analysis raise the possibility that there might be multiple subpopulations within the mouse mammary gland that behave as stem cells to drive mammary development. To reveal the relationship of the single mammary cells from each subgroup, we performed the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) analysis and found similarity with the PCA results, i.e. the basal and luminal cells were separately clustered (Fig. 3A). Here, we noticed the single cells from the same subgroups mainly grouped together with only a few exceptions. The relative location of these subgroups, to some extent, reflected their similarity of gene expression profiling and biological functions. Notably, subgroup C3 of basal cells showed a close relationship with the luminal cells, indicating their potential for bi-lineage differentiation (Fig. 3A). Additionally, the transcription activity was quite low in subgroup C3 as fewer genes were expressed in this subgroup (Fig. 3B), which is a typical characteristic of some adult stem cells (31Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Tie2/angiopoietin-1 signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell quiescence in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2004; 118 (15260986): 149-16110.1016/j.cell.2004.07.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 32Cheshier S.H.

Besides, several C3 basal cells highly expressed the supposed MaSC markers Procr and Inpp5d and only showed low-level expression of basal or luminal lineages markers like Krt14 or Krt18, strongly suggesting their multiplasticity (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3). Taken together, the above features indicate that C3 cells might serve as bipotent MaSCs. Next, we focused on these cells and checked the exclusively expressed genes and enriched pathways and functions of the C3 cells, which can be further divided into two subgroups, C3A and C3B (Fig. S4). Although the overall gene expression level is quite low for C3B cells (data not shown), about 90 genes were highly expressed in C3A cells, including some previously reported candidate MaSC markers, such as Cd93 (33dos Santos C.O.

We then analyzed the protein–protein interactions (Fig. 3D) and enriched biological functions (Fig. 3E) of these signature genes. These results demonstrate a cluster of proteins formed a close-knit interactions network and suggest they might be integrally involved in some signaling pathways or biological functions. Furthermore, the following Gene Ontology (GO) analysis pinpointed that C3 cell signature genes might contribute to vasculature development, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, as well as other cellular processes, some of which are closely relevant to features of adult stem cells. Moreover, we noticed that G1 (like Ppp3ca and Itgb1) but not S or M phase-related genes (like Rad21, Cdk2 and Rad51, and Mki67, respectively) were expressed in C3 cells (Fig. S5), indicating a quiescent status of C3 cells. As the C3 cells showed the greatest possibility to behave as MaSCs among all the subgroups via transcriptome analysis, we carefully checked the genes exclusively expressed in C3 and mainly focused on some receptor-encoding genes to see whether any could serve as MaSC markers. Among several candidates, Cdh5 (Fig. 4A), encoding the VE-cadherin, a previously identified endothelial-specific adhesion molecule located at junctions between endothelial cells (36Lampugnani M.G. Resnati M. Raiteri M. Pigott R. Pisacane A. Houen G. Ruco L.P. Dejana E. A novel endothelial-specific membrane protein is a marker of cell-cell contacts.J.

Because cellular adhesion proteins, such as several cadherin and integrin family members, play very significant roles in stem cell maintenance and differentiation, such as E-cadherin (CDH1), N-cadherin (CDH2), CD24, CD29, and CD49f (37Prowse A.B.

To confirm the Cdh5+ cells mainly reside in the basal lineage of mouse mammary epithelia and behave as MaSCs, we next detected the mRNA expression pattern of Cdh5 in mouse mammary glands and found it was indeed mainly expressed in the basal cells instead of the luminal cells (Fig. 4B). Besides, flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that about one-third of basal cells were CDH5+ in the basal lineage of 3-month-old virgin female mice, whereas this ratio was reduced to one-fifth in P12 mice (Fig. 4C and Fig. S6). Notably, the total CDH5+ basal cell percentage of all mammary epithelia stays roughly equivalent in the two developmental"

However, the reliability of these recommended parameter sets has not been studied in the literature or not in every stance type used in stabilometry assessments, for example, single leg stances. The goal of this study is to evaluate the test-retest reliability of different time-based and frequency-based parameters that are calculated from the center of pressure (CoP) during bipedal and single leg stance for 30- and 60-second measurement intervals. Thirty healthy subjects performed repeated standing trials in a bipedal stance with eyes open and eyes closed conditions and in a single leg stance with eyes open for 60 seconds. A force distribution measuring plate was used to record the CoP. The reliability of the CoP parameters was characterized by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), coefficient of variation (CV) and CV compliance rate (CVCR). Based on the ICC, SEM and MDC results, many parameters yielded fair to good reliability values, while the CoP path length yielded the highest reliability (smallest ICC > 0.67 (0.54-0.79), largest SEM% = 19.2%). Usually, frequency type parameters and extreme value parameters yielded poor reliability values. There were differences in the reliability of the maximum CoP velocity (better with 30 seconds) and mean power frequency (better with 60 seconds) parameters between the different sampling intervals."

We developed an exercise program from yoga postures with a minimal knee adduction moment for knee osteoarthritis. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of this biomechanically-based yoga exercise (YE), with traditional exercise (TE), and a no-exercise attention-equivalent control (NE) for improving pain, self-reported physical function and mobility performance in women with knee osteoarthritis.Single-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial.Community in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.A convenience sample of 31 women with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis was recruited through rheumatology, orthopaedic and physiotherapy clinics, newspapers and word-of-mouth.Participants were stratified by disease severity and randomly allocated to one of three 12-week, supervised interventions. YE included biomechanically-based yoga exercises; TE included traditional leg strengthening on machines; and NE included meditation with no exercise. Participants were asked to attend three 1-hour group classes/sessions each week.Primary outcomes were pain, self-reported physical function and mobility performance. Secondary outcomes were knee strength, depression, and health-related quality of life. All were assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline and immediately following the intervention.The YE group demonstrated greater improvements in KOOS pain (mean difference of 22.9 [95% CI, 6.9 to 38.8; p = 0.003]), intermittent pain (mean difference of -19.6 [95% CI, -34.8 to -4.4; p = 0.009]) and self-reported physical function (mean difference of 17.2 [95% CI, 5.2 to 29.2; p = 0.003]) compared to NE. Improvements in these outcomes were similar between YE and TE. However, TE demonstrated a greater improvement in knee flexor strength compared to YE (mean difference of 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.2]. Improvements from baseline to follow-up were present in quality of life score for YE and knee flexor strength for TE, while both also demonstrated improvements in mobility. No improvement in any outcome was present in NE.The biomechanically-based yoga exercise program produced clinically meaningful improvements in pain, self-reported physical function and mobility in women with clinical knee OA compared to no exercise. While not statistically significant, improvements in these outcomes were larger than those elicited from the traditional exercise-based program. Though this may suggest that the yoga program may be more efficacious for knee OA, future research studying a larger sample is required.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02370667)."

Although this system is highly expressed in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–treated cells and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)–expressing cells, its identity remains incompletely understood. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is also highly expressed in IFN-γ–treated cells and also has high affinity and selectivity for Trp. Here, we investigated the effects of human TrpRS expression on Trp uptake into IFN-γ–treated human THP-1 monocytes or HeLa cells. Inhibition of human TrpRS expression by TrpRS-specific siRNAs decreased and overexpression of TrpRS increased Trp uptake into the cells. Of note, the TrpRS-mediated uptake system had more than hundred-fold higher affinity for Trp than the known System L amino acid transporter, promoted uptake of low Trp concentrations, and had very high Trp selectivity. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that Trp- and ATP-binding sites, but not tRNA-binding sites, in TrpRS are essential for TrpRS-mediated Trp uptake into the human cells. We further demonstrate that the addition of purified TrpRS to cell culture medium increases Trp uptake into cells. Taken together, our results reveal that TrpRS plays an important role in high-affinity Trp uptake into human cells."

They are lethal to a restricted range of insects via specific interactions with insect receptors such as the ABC transporter subfamily members C2 (ABCC2) and C3 (ABCC3). However, it is still unclear how these different receptors contribute to insect susceptibility to Cry1A toxins. Here, we investigated the differences between the silkworm (Bombyx mori) ABCC2 (BmABCC2_S) and ABCC3 (BmABCC3) receptors in mediating Cry toxicity. Compared with BmABCC2_S, BmABCC3 exhibited 80- and 267-fold lower binding affinities to Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab, respectively, and these decreased affinities correlated well with the lower receptor activities of BmABCC3 for these Cry1A toxins. To identify the amino acid residues responsible for these differences, we constructed BmABCC3 variants containing a partial amino acid replacement with extracellular loops (ECLs) from BmABCC2_S. Replacing three amino acids from ECL 1 or 3 increased BmABCC3 activity toward Cry1Aa and enabled its activity toward Cry1Ab. Meanwhile, BmABCC2_S and BmABCC3 exhibited no receptor activities for Cry1Ca, Cry1Da, and Cry3Bb, correlating with markedly lower binding affinities for these Cry toxins. ABCC2 from a Cry1Ab-resistant B. mori strain (BmABCC2_R), which has a tyrosine insertion in ECL 2, displayed 93-fold lower binding affinity to Cry1Ab compared with BmABCC2_S but maintained high binding affinity to Cry1Aa.

Nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (Nr0b2, SHP) is a transcriptional regulator critical for the regulation of bile acid, glucose, and lipid metabolism. Here, we show that SHP levels are decreased in the livers of patients with NASH and in diet-induced mouse NASH. Exposing primary mouse hepatocytes to palmitic acid and lipopolysaccharide in vitro, we demonstrated that the suppression of Shp expression in hepatocytes is due to c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, which stimulates c-Jun–mediated transcriptional repression of Shp. Interestingly, in vivo induction of hepatocyte-specific SHP in steatotic mouse liver ameliorated NASH progression by attenuating liver inflammation and fibrosis, but not steatosis.

Now, hepatocytes are gradually being recognized as important players involved in the initiation of inflammation in NASH (6Ibrahim S.H. Hirsova P. Tomita K. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Harrison S.A.

However, whether hepatocyte SHP plays a role in this process remains unexplored. Inflammatory chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2; or monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1)) is responsible for attracting monocytes and T cells during liver injury (12Ansari A.W. Heiken H. Meyer-Olson D. Schmidt R.E. CCL2: A potential prognostic marker and target of anti-inflammatory strategy in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis.Eur. J. Immunol. 2011; 41 (22076814): 3412-341810.1002/eji.201141676Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There are many types of liver cells that produce CCL2, including hepatocytes, stellate cells, and Kupffer cells (13Saiman Y. Friedman S.L. The role of chemokines in acute liver injury.Front. Physiol. 2012; 3 (22723782): 213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Weiskirchen R. Tacke F. Cellular and molecular functions of hepatic stellate cells in inflammatory responses and liver immunology.Hepatobiliary Surg. Nutr. 2014; 3 (25568859): 344-363PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have shown that high levels of CCL2 in NAFLD contribute to the conversion of NAFL to NASH (15Haukeland J.W. Damås J.K. Konopski Z. Løberg E.M. Haaland T. Goverud I. Torjesen P.A. Birkeland K. Bjøro K. Aukrust P. Systemic inflammation in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by elevated levels of CCL2.J.

Wehr A. Karlmark K.R. Heymann F. Vucur M. Gassler N. Huss S. Klussmann S. Eulberg D. Luedde T. Trautwein C. Tacke F. Pharmacological inhibition of the chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) diminishes liver macrophage infiltration and steatohepatitis in chronic hepatic injury.Gut. 2012; 61 (21813474): 416-42610.1136/gutjnl-2011-300304Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), which makes CCL2 a good therapeutic target for NASH prevention and treatment. However, how CCL2 is produced during the disease progression from NAFL to NASH is incompletely understood. A recent study has demonstrated that the activation of SHP by a small-molecule activator inhibits liver cancer cell migration by blocking CCL2 signaling (17Yang Z. Koehler A.N. Wang L. A novel small molecule activator of nuclear receptor SHP inhibits HCC cell migration via suppressing Ccl2.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2016; 15 (27486225): 2294-230110.1158/1535-7163.MCT-16-0153Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which potentially links SHP to CCL2 production. Here, we show that SHP was markedly decreased in the livers of patients with NASH and in diet-induced mouse NASH. The loss of SHP in hepatocytes resulted in NF-κB p65-mediated induction of CCL2, leading to macrophage activation. Meanwhile, overexpressing SHP in hepatocytes prevented NAFL progression to NASH by attenuating liver Inflammation and fibrosis. Taken together, our study has uncovered a novel regulatory network in hepatocytes consisting of JNK/SHP/NF-κB/CCL2, which controls macrophage recruitment during the disease progression from NAFL to NASH. The findings from our study may benefit the development of new management or prevention strategies for NASH. To determine whether the expression of SHP is associated with NAFLD pathogenesis, we examined SHP mRNA levels in two sets of human liver specimens. The first set was obtained through the University of Kansas Liver Center. The liver histology of human NAFL and NASH is shown in Fig. 1A. NAFL is characterized by the deposition of triglycerides as lipid droplets in hepatocytes. NASH is distinguished from NAFL by the presence of hepatocyte injury (hepatocyte ballooning and cell death), inflammation, and/or collagen deposition (fibrosis). Perisinusoidal/pericellular (chicken wire) fibrosis is the characteristic pattern of liver fibrosis in NASH, which typically begins in zone 3 due to the deposition of collagen along the sinusoids and around the hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 1A, picrosirius red staining showed the chicken-wire pattern of perisinusoidal/pericellular fibrosis and periportal fibrosis in human NASH. Although there were similar SHP mRNA levels in the liver of normal and NAFL samples, a significant decrease in SHP mRNA was observed in NASH samples compared with NAFL samples (Fig. 1A). Consistently, the analysis of microarray data set GSE48452 also revealed a significant decrease in SHP mRNA levels in patients with NASH compared with NAFL and normal controls (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis confirmed the decrease in SHP protein in NASH samples compared with NAFL and normal livers (Fig. 1C). Collectively, our results strongly suggest the biological relevance of SHP down-regulation during the disease progression from NAFL to NASH in humans. To more precisely examine SHP expression during the development of NAFLD, we developed a mouse model that carries the disease progression from NAFL to NASH with obesity and insulin resistance, the two common features of NAFLD in humans. Diet enriched in high fat and fructose has been implicated in the development of obesity and NASH in humans (18Ouyang X. Cirillo P. Sautin Y. McCall S. Bruchette J.L. Diehl A.M. Johnson R.J. Abdelmalek M.F. Fructose consumption as a risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.J.

Recently, a diet enriched in high fat, cholesterol, and fructose (research diet D09100301: 40 kcal% fat, 2% cholesterol, 20 kcal% fructose; hereafter referred to as HFCF diet) was utilized to induce mouse NASH (20Trevaskis J.L.

In this diet, excess fat alone contributes to the development of mild steatosis, whereas the addition of elevated fructose and cholesterol levels increases hepatic oxidative stress; combined, these dietary components predispose animals to necroinflammation and fibrogenesis (22Kohli R. Kirby M. Xanthakos S.A. Softic S. Feldstein A.E. Saxena V. Tang P.H. Miles L. Miles M.V. Balistreri W.F. Woods S.C. Seeley R.J.

We fed 2-month-old C57Bl/6J male mice with either a chow or HFCF diet for 1 and 5 months. We chose to study male mice based on our previous observation that male but not female mice developed NASH after 5 months of HFCF diet, 4A. Zou, N. Magee, F. Deng, S. Lehn, C. Zhong, and Y. Zhang, unpublished data. which also has been reported by another group (23Ganz M. Bukong T.N. Csak T. Saha B. Park J.K. Ambade A. Kodys K. Szabo G. Progression of non-alcoholic steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis parallels cumulative accumulation of danger signals that promote inflammation and liver tumors in a high fat-cholesterol-sugar diet model in mice.J. Transl. Med. 2015; 13 (26077675): 19310.1186/s12967-015-0552-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The observation that males are more susceptible to NASH is supported by human epidemiology studies showing that NAFLD cases more commonly arise and frequently progress in males, as females possess a resistance to NAFLD attributed to higher levels of estrogen (24Suzuki A. Abdelmalek M.F. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in women.Women's Health (Lond.). 2009; 5 (19245356): 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mice on the HFCF diet developed rapid weight gain and obesity compared with chow-fed controls (Fig. 2A). Although 1 month of HFCF feeding did not significantly change the liver weight compared with controls, the liver weight was significantly increased in mice on the HFCF diet for 5 months (Fig. 2B). This was accompanied by an increase in the liver to body weight ratio (Fig. 2B). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), two markers of liver injury, both increased after mice were fed the HFCF diet for 5 months (Fig. 2C). Additionally, 5 months of HFCF feeding led to a significant increase in fasting glucose levels and total cholesterol levels (Fig. 2D). Meanwhile, mice fed for 1 month on the HFCF diet developed hypertriglyceridemia, but the levels of serum triglycerides (TG) at the 5-month time point declined to levels that were similar to those noted in chow-fed controls (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the mice displayed glucose intolerance after 5 months on the HFCF diet (Fig. 2E). Collectively, these results indicated that mice fed a HFCF diet developed liver injury with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia with impaired glucose tolerance. We next examined the extent of steatosis, cell death, inflammation, and fibrosis in the livers of mice fed chow or HFCF diets. Liver sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and oil red O revealed liver steatosis in mice fed a HFCF diet for 1 and 5 months, which was not observed in chow-fed controls (Fig. 2F). However, the cell death detected by TUNEL staining was only observed in the livers of mice fed a HFCF diet for 5 months (Fig. 2F). Consistently, immunohistochemistry staining with the macrophage-specific antibody F4/80 showed a dramatic increase in macrophage infiltration in the livers of mice on the HFCF diet for 5 months (Fig. 2F). Moreover, liver sections stained with Picosirius red detected an apparent collagen deposition in 5-month HFCF diet-fed mice, indicative of fibrosis development (Fig. 2F). The summary in Fig. 2G shows that the grades of steatosis, inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis became apparent in the livers of mice fed the HFCF diet for 5 months. At the mRNA levels, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), a master control of lipid synthesis, sustained an increase in the livers of mice fed a HFCF diet (Fig. 3A). However, the expression of both apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp), two genes involved in the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis that carries TG in the plasma, was decreased in mice fed the HFCF diet for 5 months (Fig. 3A), consistent with the changes in serum TG levels shown in Fig. 2D. Tumor necrosis factor α (Tnfα) and chemokine Ccl2, two important inflammatory mediators contributing to the inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver, were both significantly increased over time in mice on the HFCF diet (Fig. 3A). In addition, a progressive increase in the expression of macrophage M1 marker nitric-oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) and a decrease in the expression of M2 markers arginase-1 (Agr1) and CD163 were observed in the livers of mice on the HFCF diet for 5 months (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the liver expression of collagen 1α1 (Col1A1) increased in 5-month HFCF diet-fed animals (Fig. 3A), supporting the increase in collagen deposition shown in Fig. 2F. Additionally, the serum levels of CCL2 were markedly elevated in the 5-month HFCF diet-fed mice (Fig. 3B). Overall, these results indicate the progression of NAFL to NASH in mice on the HFCF diet for 1 and 5 months as evidenced by increases in hepatic cell death, macrophage infiltration, and liver fibrosis. We next examined SHP expression in the liver of the HFCF-dietary mouse model. As shown in Fig. 3C, 1 month of HFCF feeding did not change liver Shp mRNA levels compared with those of the chow-fed controls. However, a significant decrease in Shp mRNA was observed after mice were on the HFCF diet for 5 months. SHP protein is a rapidly degraded protein with a very short half-life (25Miao J. Xiao Z. Kanamaluru D. Min G. Yau P.M. Veenstra T.D. Ellis E. Strom S. Suino-Powell K. Xu H.E. Kemper J.K. Bile acid signaling pathways increase stability of small heterodimer partner (SHP) by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.Genes Dev. 2009; 23 (19390091): 986-99610.1101/gad.1773909Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We employed two anti-SHP antibodies in Western blotting to determine SHP protein levels in the liver. SHP (H-160) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody, whereas SHP (H-5) is a mouse mAb. Both antibodies recognized the epitope corresponding to amino acids 1–160 mapping at the N terminus of SHP protein. As shown in Fig. 3D, both antibodies detected a significant decrease in SHP protein expression in the livers of mice fed a HFCF diet for 5 months. A methionine/choline–deficient (MCD) diet induces NASH-like liver pathology including liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, despite weight loss and insulin sensitivity (26Hebbard L. George J. Animal models of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2011; 8 (21119613): 35-4410.1038/nrgastro.2010.191Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Next, we explored SHP expression in the livers of mice fed an MCD diet. As shown in Fig. 3E, the liver morphology indicated the development of liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice fed an MCD diet for 1 month. Consistently, the expression of genes involved in liver inflammation and fibrosis such as F4/80, Tnfα, Ccl2, IL-1β, and Col1A1 was increased in mice fed an MCD diet (Fig. 3F). Importantly, we observed a significant decrease in Shp mRNA level in the livers of mice fed an MCD diet compared with chow-fed controls (Fig. 3F). Collectively, our results indicate that the expression of Shp is decreased dramatically in the liver of mouse NASH. Moreover, our HFCF dietary mouse studies provide convincing evidence that SHP is suppressed during NAFL progression to NASH. Because SHP is highly expressed in hepatocytes (27Suh J.H. Huang J. Park Y.Y. Seong H.A. Kim D. Shong M. Ha H. Lee I.K. Lee K. Wang L. Choi H.S. Orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner inhibits transforming growth factor-β signaling by repressing SMAD3 transactivation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 (17074765): 39169-3917810.1074/jbc.M605947200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we speculated that SHP suppression during NAFL transition to NASH results mainly from the decrease of SHP in hepatocytes. To begin to test our hypothesis, we isolated hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSC), and resident macrophage cells (KC) from mouse liver and compared Shp expression among these cells. Cell purification was confirmed by the detection of various cell-specific markers by quantitative PCR (qPCR), including hepatocyte marker albumin (Alb), quiescent HSC marker Hh-interacting protein (Hhip), and KC marker F4/80. As expected, Shp mRNA is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes and low is in KCs and HSCs (Fig. 4A). We next sought to investigate the potential mechanisms of SHP suppression in NASH. Lipotoxicity, the major mechanism underlying hepatocyte dysfunction in NAFLD, occurs in the setting of excessive free fatty acid traffic in hepatocytes, especially saturated fatty acids (28Leamy A.K. Egnatchik R.A. Young J.D. Molecular mechanisms and the role of saturated fatty acids in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Prog. Lipid Res. 2013; 52 (23178552): 165-17410.1016/j.plipres.2012.10.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Palmitic acid (PA) is one of the most abundant of the saturated fatty acids presented in diets and in serum (29Baylin A. Kabagambe E.K. Siles X. Campos H. Adipose tissue biomarkers of fatty acid intake.Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76 (12324287): 750-75710.1093/ajcn/76.4.750Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). PA binds to TLR4 leading to JNK activation (30Huang S. Rutkowsky J.M. Snodgrass R.G. Ono-Moore K.D. Schneider D.A. Newman J.W. Adams S.H. Hwang D.H. Saturated fatty acids activate TLR-mediated proinflammatory signaling pathways.J Lipid Res. 2012; 53 (22766885): 2002-201310.1194/jlr.D029546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 31Win S.

We next employed a primary mouse hepatocyte culture as an in vitro model and explored whether PA or TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could alter SHP expression. Treatment with PA (0.5 mm) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 h significantly decreased Shp mRNA expression (Fig. 4B). To further investigate the potential mechanisms of SHP suppression by PA and LPS, we superimposed various signaling pathway inhibitors, including JNK inhibitor SP600125 (50 μm), NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (5 μm), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) on a PA or LPS treatment regimen. Interestingly, co-treatment with the JNK inhibitor completely obviated the decrease of Shp mRNA by PA or LPS (Fig. 4B). Thus, our results indicate that JNK activation mediates the suppression of SHP by PA and LPS in hepatocytes. Moreover, JNK activation was observed in the livers of mice fed a HFCF diet for 5 months as evidenced by the induction of phosphorylated JNK (Fig. 4C, p-JNK, activated form of JNK). Importantly, the activation of JNK correlated positively with SHP suppression in the livers of 5-month HFCF diet-fed mice (Fig. 3D). Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo results indicate, for the first time, that JNK activation suppresses Shp expression in NASH. JNK was originally identified because of its capability of specifically phosphorylating c-Jun on its N-terminal transactivation domain at two serine residues, Ser-63 and Ser-73 (32Hibi M. Lin A.

Significant challenges remain in the provision of surgical care in low-resource settings. Uganda is no exception. Methods From September to November 2016, we conducted a mixed-methods countrywide surgical capacity assessment at 17 randomly selected public hospitals in Uganda. Researchers conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders to understand factors related to the provision of surgical care. The framework approach was used for thematic and explanatory data analysis. Results The Ugandan public health care sector continues to face significant challenges in the provision of safe, timely, and affordable surgical care. These challenges can be broadly grouped into preparedness and policy, service delivery, and the financial burden of surgical care. Hospital staff reported challenges including: (1) significant delays in accessing surgical care, compounded by a malfunctioning referral system; (2) critical workforce shortages; (3) operative capacity that is limited by inadequate infrastructure and overwhelmed by emergency and obstetric volume; (4) supply chain difficulties pertaining to provision of essential medications, equipment, supplies, and blood; (5) significant, variable, and sometimes catastrophic expenditures for surgical patients and their families; and (6) a lack of surgery-specific policies and priorities. Despite these challenges, innovative strategies are being used in the public to provide surgical care to those most in need. Conclusion Barriers to the provision of surgical care are cross-cutting and involve constraints in infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, and financing. Understanding current strengths and shortfalls of Uganda’s surgical system is a critical first step in developing effective, targeted policy and programming that will build and strengthen its surgical capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2801457640,"Along with the rapid development of Intelligent Transportation Systems, traffic data collection technologies have progressed fast. The emergence of innovative data collection technologies such as remote traffic microwave sensor, Bluetooth sensor, GPS-based floating car method, and automated license plate recognition, has significantly increased the variety and volume of traffic data. Despite the development of these technologies, the missing data issue is still a problem that poses great challenge for data based applications such as traffic forecasting, real-time incident detection, dynamic route guidance, and massive evacuation optimization. A thorough literature review suggests most current imputation models either focus on the temporal nature of the traffic data and fail to consider the spatial information of neighboring locations or assume the data follow a certain distribution. These two issues reduce the imputation accuracy and limit the use of the corresponding imputation methods respectively. As a result, this paper presents a Kriging based data imputation approach that is able to fully utilize the spatiotemporal correlation in the traffic data and that does not assume the data follow any distribution. A set of scenarios with different missing rates are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of two other widely used methods, historical average and K-nearest neighborhood. Comparison results indicate that the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy and is more flexible compared to other methods."

The development of automated DNA extraction methodologies and PCR systems is an important step toward the standardization of protocols in routine diagnosis. To date, there are only two commercially available Real-Time PCR assays for the routine laboratory detection of T. cruzi DNA in clinical samples: TCRUZIDNA.CE (Diagnostic Bioprobes Srl) and RealCycler CHAG (Progenie Molecular). Our aim was to evaluate the RealCycler CHAG assay taking into account the whole process. Methodology/Principal findings We assessed the usefulness of an automated DNA extraction system based on magnetic particles (EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0, Qiagen) combined with a commercially available Real-Time PCR assay targeting satellite DNA (SatDNA) of T. cruzi (RealCycler CHAG), a methodology used for routine diagnosis in our hospital. It was compared with a well-known strategy combining a commercial DNA isolation kit based on silica columns (High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit, Roche Diagnostics) with an in-house Real-Time PCR targeting SatDNA. The results of the two methodologies were in almost perfect agreement, indicating they can be used interchangeably. However, when variations in protocol factors were applied (sample treatment, extraction method and Real-Time PCR), the results were less convincing. A comprehensive fine-tuning of the whole procedure is the key to successful results. Guanidine EDTA-blood (GEB) samples are not suitable for DNA extraction based on magnetic particles due to inhibition, at least when samples are not processed immediately. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to evaluate the RealCycler CHAG assay taking into account the overall process, including three variables (sample treatment, extraction method and Real-Time PCR). Our findings may contribute to the harmonization of protocols between laboratories and to a wider application of Real-Time PCR in molecular diagnostic laboratories associated with health centers."

https://openalex.org/W2950191828,"Here I describe seedVicious, a versatile microRNA target site prediction software that can be easily fitted into annotation pipelines and run over custom datasets. SeedVicious finds microRNA canonical sites plus other, less efficient, target sites. Among other novel features, seedVicious can compute evolutionary gains/losses of target sites using maximum parsimony, and also detect near-target sites, which have one nucleotide different from a canonical site. Near-target sites are important to study population variation in microRNA regulation. Some analyses suggest that near-target sites may also be functional sites, although there is no conclusive evidence for that, and they may actually be target alleles segregating in a population. SeedVicious does not aim to outperform but to complement existing microRNA prediction tools.

https://openalex.org/W2801450635,"The understanding on the roles of obesity and lifestyle behaviors in predicting executive function of adolescents has been limited. Low executive function proficiency may have adverse effects on adolescents’ school academic performance. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between BMI-for-age and multiple lifestyle behaviors (operationalized as meal consumption, physical activity, and sleep quality) with executive function (operationalized as inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on a sample of Malaysian adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (N = 513). Participants were recruited from two randomly selected schools in the state of Selangor in Malaysia. Using a self-administered questionnaire, parent participants provided information concerning their sociodemographic data, whereas adolescent participants provided information regarding their meal consumptions, physical activity, and sleep quality. The modified Harvard step test was used to assess adolescents’ aerobic fitness, while Stroop color-word, digit span, and trail-making tests were used to assess adolescents’ inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, respectively. Three separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for each outcome namely, inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. After adjusted for sociodemographic factors and BMI-for-age, differential predictors of inhibition and working memory were found. Habitual sleep efficiency significantly and positively predicted inhibition. Regular dinner intakes, physical activity levels, and sleep quality significantly and positively predicted working memory. Household income emerged as a consistent predictor for all executive function domains. In conclusion, an increased trend of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles among adolescents were found to be associated with poorer executive function. Regular dinner intakes, higher physical activity levels and better sleep quality predicted better executive function despite the inverse relationship between obesity and executive function. Future studies may explore how lifestyle modifications can optimize the development of executive function in adolescents as well as relieve the burden of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2799531106,"ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) contribute to membrane currents in many tissues, are responsive to intracellular metabolism, and open as ATP falls and ADP rises. KATP channels are widely distributed in tissues and are prominently expressed in the heart. They have generally been observed in ventricular tissue, but they are also expressed in the atria and conduction tissues. In this study, we focused on the contribution and role of the inwardly rectifying KATP channel subunit, Kir6.1, in the sinoatrial node (SAN). To develop a murine, conduction-specific Kir6.1 KO model, we selectively deleted Kir6.1 in the conduction system in adult mice (cKO). Electrophysiological data in single SAN cells indicated that Kir6.1 underlies a KATP current in a significant proportion of cells and influences early repolarization during pacemaking, resulting in prolonged cycle length. Implanted telemetry probes to measure heart rate and electrocardiographic characteristics revealed that the cKO mice have a slow heart rate, with episodes of sinus arrest in some mice. The PR interval (time between the onset of the P wave to the beginning of QRS complex) was increased, suggesting effects on the atrioventricular node. Ex vivo studies of whole heart or dissected heart regions disclosed impaired adaptive responses of the SAN to hypoxia, and this may have had long-term pathological consequences in the cKO mice.

Substantial KATP currents were first described in cardiomyocytes and then subsequently in pancreatic β cells, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle cells, and neurons (2Noma A.

KATP channels are critical in mediating a number of physiological processes. For example, they are central in stimulus secretion coupling underlying insulin release from the endocrine pancreas (4Rorsman P. Braun M. Regulation of insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75 (22974438): 155-17910.1146/annurev-physiol-030212-183754Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). At the molecular level the channel is a heterooctamer of four sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1, SUR2A) and four pore-forming inwardly rectifying Kir6.0 subunits (Kir6.1, Kir6.2) (5Inagaki N. Gonoi T.

Ironically, despite the initial description of the KATP current in cardiomyocytes and the substantial current density in ventricular cells, it is less clear as to the physiological role this channel plays in cardiac function (1Tinker A. Aziz Q. Thomas A. The role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in cellular function and protection in the cardiovascular system.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171 (24102106): 12-2310.1111/bph.12407Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mice with global genetic deletion of Kir6.2, which is thought to underlie ventricular cardiac KATP currents, have impaired exercise tolerance and cardiac performance under sympathetic stimulation, suggesting a role in adaptation of the myocyte to the metabolic demands of exercise (10Zingman L.V. Hodgson D.M. Bast P.H. Kane G.C. Perez-Terzic C. Gumina R.J. Pucar D. Bienengraeber M. Dzeja P.P. Miki T. Seino S. Alekseev A.E. Terzic A. Kir6.2 is required for adaptation to stress.Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, KATP currents are present in other chambers in the heart, including the atria and conduction system (11Bao L. Kefaloyianni E. Lader J. Hong M. Morley G. Fishman G.I. Sobie E.A. Coetzee W.A. Unique properties of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel in the mouse ventricular cardiac conduction system.Circ. Arrhythm.

The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the dominant pacemaker in the mammalian heart and has unique electrophysiological characteristics underlying this role. There have been few studies on KATP currents in these cells, but it is clear they exist and may at least partially be based upon Kir6.2 subunit expression (13Fukuzaki K. Sato T. Miki T. Seino S. Nakaya H. Role of sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the regulation of sinoatrial node automaticity: an evaluation using Kir6.2-deficient mice.J.

Global Kir6.1 knockout mice die prematurely from SAN failure and heart block. Initially this was attributed to loss of KATP channels in coronary vascular smooth muscle leading to vasospasm and cardiac ischemia (14Miki T. Suzuki M. Shibasaki T. Uemura H. Sato T. Yamaguchi K. Koseki H. Iwanaga T. Nakaya H. Seino S. Mouse model of Prinzmetal angina by disruption of the inward rectifier Kir6.1.Nat. Med. 2002; 8 (11984590): 466-47210.1038/nm0502-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, we have generated mice in which it is possible to selectively delete Kir6.1 in various tissues and at various times using cre/loxP technology (15Aziz Q. Thomas A.M. Gomes J. Ang R.

Mice with deletion in vascular smooth muscle or endothelium do not recapitulate this phenotype, suggesting there may be a direct role for Kir6.1-containing KATP channels in the conduction system (15Aziz Q.

In this study we explore this idea by using cre/loxP technology using our previously described mice and crossing them with a Cre recombinase murine line that allows selective deletion in the cardiac conduction system after the administration of tamoxifen (17Hoesl E. Stieber J. Herrmann S. Feil S. Tybl E. Hofmann F. Feil R. Ludwig A. Tamoxifen-inducible gene deletion in the cardiac conduction system.J. Mol.

HCN4cre+ Kir6.1(flx/flx) (cKO) mice were generated by crossing Kir6.1(flx/flx) mice with a conduction system–specific Cre into which the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ERT2 had been “knocked in” into the HCN4 locus (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1A) (15Aziz Q.

The ATP-sensitive potassium channel subunit, Kir6.1, in vascular smooth muscle plays a major role in blood pressure control.Hypertension. 2014; 64 (24914196): 523-52910.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.114.03116Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Aziz Q.

PCR confirms the presence of cre recombinase (900 bp) at the genomic level in ear tissue from HCN4cre+ Kir6.1(flx/flx) mice but not in that of control animals (WT) (Fig. 1B). The “floxed” allele is recognized by a PCR-spanning exon 1, the 5′ loxP site, and the recombined flippase recognition target (FRT) site and associated sequence. In the “floxed” mouse this leads to a 600-bp product, whereas it generates a 474-bp product in the WT allele (which does not include these additional sequence elements) (Fig. 1B). The occurrence of the recombination event in HCN4cre+ Kir6.1(flx/flx) mice selectively in the SAN following tamoxifen induction was confirmed using PCR on genomic DNA isolated from SAN, atria, and ventricles (Fig. 1B). To confirm the reduced expression of Kir6.1 (Kcnj8) in the SAN of cKO mice, quantitative real-time PCR was used on RNA isolated from SAN, atria, and ventricles from cKO and littermate controls after tamoxifen administration (Fig. 1C). Kir6.1 expression was reduced by ∼50% in SAN of cKO mice compared with WT SAN (n = 5, p < 0.01). Expression of Kir6.1 was unaffected in both atria and ventricles, confirming conduction system–specific deletion (p > 0.05). Interestingly, expression of Kir6.2 (Kcnj11) in SAN was increased by ∼50%, suggesting possible compensation for Kir6.1 deletion (n = 5, p < 0.01). SUR1 (Abcc8) and SUR2 (Abcc9) expression was unchanged in any of the cKO tissues assayed compared with WT (n = 5, p > 0.05). To investigate whether the deletion of Kir6.1 in the SAN has functional consequences, we subjected acutely isolated SAN cells from cKO and WT mice to whole-cell patch clamping (Fig. 2). The KATP current in the SAN has not been extensively characterized, so some basic pharmacological experiments were first performed. Not all SAN cells were found to express a pinacidil/diazoxide-sensitive current (15/29 cells, n = 29 cells from 6 mice). Of the WT cells that did express a KATP current, ∼7% were responsive to pinacidil, whereas ∼41% were activated by diazoxide (Fig. 2). In cells from cKO mice, ∼4 and ∼11% responded to pinacidil and diazoxide, respectively, (n = 28 cells from 4 mice, p = 0.015 for diazoxide sensitivity when compared with WT). Both pinacidil- and diazoxide-sensitive currents were inhibited by tolbutamide. These data suggest that a KATP channel comprising Kir6.1 is present in a proportion of SAN cells and that it is predominantly activated by diazoxide and inhibited by tolbutamide. The potential physiological consequences of Kir6.1 deletion in SAN on heart rate and rhythm were then studied. ECG radiotelemetry was used in conscious freely moving WT and cKO mice (Fig. 3). Both WT and cKO mice showed a diurnal variation in heart rate before and after tamoxifen induction (p < 0.01 compared night to day). HR, RR (the time between 2 consecutive R waves on an ECG), and PR intervals (times between the onset of the P wave to the beginning of QRS complex) were not significantly different before and after tamoxifen administration in ECG recordings from littermate control mice (n = 5, p > 0.05). Conversely, cKO mice developed a bradycardic phenotype following administration of tamoxifen with significant changes in HR, PR, and RR interval both during the day and night (n = 8, p > 0.05). HR decreased by ∼50 bpm during the day and at night, and this was reflected in an increase in both RR and PR intervals. A closer investigation of the ECG recordings revealed a much more severe bradycardic phenotype in 3 of 8 cKO mice (Fig. 3E). In these mice, there were pronounced bradycardic episodes with evidence of sinus pauses reflected in RR intervals of greater than 1 s in some instances. We quantified these episodes by counting the number of RR intervals greater than 200 ms in all mice following tamoxifen induction (Fig. 3F). cKO mice had a greater frequency of prolonged beats compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). The change in heart rate in cKO mice was further investigated by carrying out heart rate variability (HRV) analysis (Fig. 4). We looked at ECG recordings during a period of low activity (12–2 p.m.) to analyze possible changes in autonomic influence in HRV. Frequency domain analysis showed no change in HRV in WT and cKO mice following tamoxifen induction (n = 5, p > 0.05). There was no change in the power of both low (0.4–1.5 Hz) and high (1.5–4 Hz) frequency spectra or the total power, suggesting that the deletion of Kir6.1 from the conduction system does not grossly affect autonomic control of heart rate. The effects of conduction-specific Kir6.1 deletion on spontaneous SAN action potentials were investigated using current-clamp (Fig. 5). Deletion of Kir6.1 reduced the firing rate of spontaneous action potentials in cKO SAN cells but did not change SAN cell resting membrane and maximum diastolic potential (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Initial upstroke velocity was unchanged, but the time to peak was increased in cKO mice (n = 11–15 cells from 7–9 mice, p < 0.05). Repolarization was delayed throughout the action potential but particularly during early repolarization (Fig. 5). This was reflected in a ∼50% decrease in the action potential duration (APD) ratio, APD90/50 (p < 0.005) and an increase in the APD30–40/APD70–80 ratio (p < 0.05) in SAN cells from cKO mice (Fig. 5, F and G). These data suggest that deletion of Kir6.1 changes the duration and shape of the SAN action potential but does not contribute significantly to resting membrane potential in these cells.Table 1Action potential parameters recorded from isolated SAN cellsAP parametersWT (n = 15/9)cKO (n = 11/7)RMP (mV)−48.7 ± 2.2−51.8 ± 2.3MDP (mV)−52.6 ± 1.5−54.1 ± 2.3Time to peak (ms)140.1 ± 12.0186.6 ± 14.2ap < 0.05 compared to WT.Amplitude (mV)65.9 ± 6.978.2 ± 8.4ap < 0.05 compared to WT.Peak amplitude (mV)15.6 ± 5.526.6 ± 6.5dV/dt (mV/ms)0.4 ± 0.00.4 ± 0.1a p < 0.05 compared to WT. Open table in a new tab To investigate the phenotype further in vitro, multielectrode arrays (MEAs) were used to measure spontaneous field potentials in SAN/atrial preparations from WT and cKO mice (Fig. 6, A and B). MEA recordings showed a significantly reduced beating frequency in preparations from cKO mice compared with WT mice (n = 12, p < 0.05). In support of these observations, SAN cells acutely isolated from cKO mice after tamoxifen administration have a lower beat frequency (Fig. 5B). Both these ex vivo studies indicate that the observed bradycardia in in-vivo experiments results from properties intrinsic to the SAN myocytes following deletion of Kir6.1. To analyze SAN function in the intact heart, we used a flexMEA to measure the SNRT in the Langendorff-perfused heart (Fig. 6, C–E). SNRT, following pacing with S1– intervals of 100 ms, was significantly increased in cKO mouse hearts compared with WT hearts (n = 10–12, p < 0.05), suggesting potential SAN dysfunction in cKO mice. KATP channels are known to be protective against metabolic challenge (1Tinker A. Aziz Q. Thomas A. The role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in cellular function and protection in the cardiovascular system.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171 (24102106): 12-2310.1111/bph.12407Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate whether deletion of Kir6.1 in the SAN changes adaptation to stress, we challenged WT and cKO hearts with hypoxia (Krebs bubbled with 95% N2, 5% CO2) and measured the SNRT. In WT hearts SNRT was increased following 10 min of hypoxia (Fig. 6E, p < 0.05 compared with control). Interestingly, hypoxia had no effect on SNRT in cKO hearts (p > 0.05). SNRT of WT hearts returned close but not completely to basal levels following 10 min of reperfusion. We examined whether deletion of Kir6.1 in the SAN had long-term consequences for SA node morphology and pathology. Masson’s trichrome staining was used to investigate whether Kir6.1 deletion increases fibrosis and changes the morphology of the SAN in cKO mice (Fig. 7). The SA node appeared smaller and thinner in SAN sections from cKO mice, with fewer viable myocytes. There was more fibrous tissue compared with WT SANs. To quantify these observations, RT-qPCR was performed for known fibrosis-related genes. An increase in expression of a number of pro-fibrotic markers within cKO SANs was observed (Fig. 7C). Specifically, the expression of genes for collagen (Col1a3), Tgf-b1, and Tgf-b2 were significantly increased by ∼50% (n = 5, p < 0.05). These data suggest that deletion of Kir6.1 in the SAN can lead to an increase in pro-fibrotic markers and fibrosis. We also examined whether there were any changes in expression of ion channels other than Kir6.1 in the cKO mice indicative of a remodeling process. We used RT-qPCR (n = 4 mice, means from triplicate measurements of ΔCT) to measure the expression of Hcn4 (WT, 7.73 ± 0.46; cKO, 7.52 ± 0.16), Hcn1 (WT, 8.77 ± 0.28; cKO, 7.70 ± 0.62), Kcnj3 (WT, 4.37 ± 0.23; cKO, 3.93 ± 0.43), Kcnj5 (WT, 5.68 ± 0.29; cKO, 4.75 ± 0.42), Cacna1c (WT, 8.09 ± 0.17; cKO, 7.66 ± 0.25), Cacna1g (WT, 7.16 ± 0.19; cKO, 7.09 ± 0.41), and Cacna1h (cWT, 5.79 ± 0.15; cKO, 6.03 ± 0.32). There are no significant differences between the expression values for the ion channel transcripts (p > 0.05, one-way analysis of variance with a Sidak’s multiple comparison test). Using a novel murine model, we have deleted the KATP channel subunit Kir6.1 in the SAN. Uniquely, our data indicate that Kir6.1 underlies a KATP current in a proportion of SAN cells and influences repolarization during the spontaneous action potential. This leads to mice having a bradycardic phenotype with episodes of sinus arrest in some mice, changes intrinsic to the SAN. Furthermore, the impaired adaptive responses of the SAN to hypoxia suggest that the KATP channel promotes protection in these conditions. Our studies define a novel and little appreciated contributor to mammalian pacemaking. Comparatively little literature exists on the nature of KATP channels in the SAN. In rabbit SAN cells, the potassium channel openers pinacidil and cromakalim abolished pacemaker activity through membrane hyperpolarization (18Han X. Light P.E. Giles W.R. French R.J. Identification and properties of an ATP-sensitive K+ current in rabbit sino-atrial node pacemaker cells.J. Physiol. 1996; 490 (8821133): 337-35010.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies identified an ATP-sensitive current with a unique single channel conductance of ∼50 pS rather than one closer to the 80 pS found for channels in ventricular cells (18Han X. Light P.E. Giles W.R. French R.J. Identification and properties of an ATP-sensitive K+ current in rabbit sino-atrial node pacemaker cells.J. Physiol. 1996; 490 (8821133): 337-35010.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In mice with global genetic deletion of Kir6.2, the SAN in the intact perfused heart no longer responded to hypoxia with an increase in coupling length (13Fukuzaki K. Sato T. Miki T. Seino S. Nakaya H. Role of sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the regulation of sinoatrial node automaticity: an evaluation using Kir6.2-deficient mice.J.

Our data show that a prominent KATP current could be demonstrated in ∼50% of murine SAN myocytes. This is perhaps not surprising because the SAN is a heterogeneous structure, and a number of different cell types and regions can be distinguished (19Boyett M.R. Dobrzynski H. Lancaster M.K.

In these studies, the number of cells containing KATP currents was significantly reduced (yet not wholly abolished) in cKO mice, indicating that Kir6.1 is a major contributor to these membrane currents. The single-channel conductance observed by Han et al. (18Han X. Light P.E. Giles W.R. French R.J. Identification and properties of an ATP-sensitive K+ current in rabbit sino-atrial node pacemaker cells.J. Physiol. 1996; 490 (8821133): 337-35010.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is closer to that reported for Kir6.1 containing complexes or that for various heteromultimers between Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (21Cui Y. Giblin J.P. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. A mechanism for ATP-sensitive potassium channel diversity: functional coassembly of two pore forming subunits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11136227): 729-73410.1073/pnas.98.2.729Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The pharmacology is also interesting with diazoxide more frequently activating these currents, whereas tolbutamide as well as glibenclamide can inhibit the responses. This is more representative of SUR1-containing KATP channel complexes than SUR2, although diazoxide can act on SUR2B-containing heterooctamers (22Giblin J.P. Cui Y. Clapp L.H. Tinker A. Assembly limits the pharmacological complexity of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.J. Biol.

SUR1-containing KATP channels are already known to be present in murine atrial myocytes (23Glukhov A.V. Flagg T.P. Fedorov V.V. Efimov I.R. Nichols C.G. Differential KATP channel pharmacology in intact mouse heart.J. Mol.

In cKO mice there was an increase in Kir6.2 expression as assessed by RT-qPCR but not in SUR1 or SUR2 expression. Furthermore, KATP currents were essentially abolished with no response to diazoxide and only a very few cells, comparable with controls, responding to pinacidil. Thus the increased expression of Kir6.2 mRNA does not have prominent functional sequelae. The cKO mice are clearly bradycardic when assayed by three independent assays: single cell, ex vivo and in vivo studies. In the latter studies, no evidence was found supporting changes in autonomic or hormonal influences on heart rate in the cKO mice. In other words, the process observed was solely intrinsic to the SA node, as would be expected from the specificity of expression of the cre recombinase. Our action potential recordings demonstrate an increase in action potential duration particularly prominent during the early stages of repolarization. Thus, even under resting conditions and without metabolic challenge, Kir6.1-containing KATP channels are active and contribute to potassium currents involved in shaping the SAN action potential. Furthermore, the maximum diastolic depolarization and resting membrane potential were not prominently changed in knockout animals. The time-to-peak depolarization was also delayed in the cKO mice. The net upshot of these cumulative effects is a prolongation of the action potential. Given an equivalent or unchanged time period for diastolic depolarization, a consequence would be to increase the SAN cycle length and thus decrease heart rate. KATP currents generated by Kir6.1-containing subunits are actually outwardly rectifying (see Fig. 2). However, currents do not deactivate with hyperpolarization, as would a classic voltage-gated potassium channel, and it is surprising that they do not have a significant influence on the pacemaker depolarization. It is known that cAMP signaling is highly developed in the SAN (24Lakatta E.G. Maltsev V.A. Vinogradova T.M. A coupled SYSTEM of intracellular Ca2+ clocks and surface membrane voltage clocks controls the timekeeping mechanism of the heart's pacemaker.Circ.

PKA is known to prominently regulate Kir6.1-containing channel complexes (25Quinn K.V. Giblin J.P. Tinker A.

https://openalex.org/W2800494880,"In planar cell polarity (PCP), the epithelial cells are polarized along the plane of the cell surface perpendicular to the classical apical–basal axis, a process mediated by several conserved signaling receptors. Two PCP-signaling proteins, VANGL planar cell polarity protein 2 (Vangl2) and Frizzled6 (Fzd6), are located asymmetrically on opposite boundaries of the cell. Examining sorting of these two proteins at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), we demonstrated previously that the GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factor–related protein 1 (Arfrp1) and the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) are required for Vangl2 transport from the TGN. In contrast, TGN export of Frizzled6 does not depend on Arfrp1 or AP-1. Here, to further investigate the TGN sorting process in mammalian cells, we reconstituted release of Vangl2 and Frizzled6 from the TGN into vesicles in vitro. Immunoblotting of released vesicles indicated that Vangl2 and Frizzled6 exit the TGN in separate compartments. Knockdown analysis revealed that a clathrin adaptor, epsinR, regulates TGN export of Frizzled6 but not of Vangl2. Protein interaction analysis suggested that epsinR forms a stable complex with clathrin and that this complex interacts with a conserved polybasic motif in the Frizzled6 cytosolic domain to package Frizzled6 into transport vesicles. Moreover, we found that Frizzled6–epsinR binding dissociates epsinR from AP-1, which may separate these two cargo adaptors from each other to perform distinct cargo-sorting functions. Our results suggest that Vangl2 and Frizzled6 are packaged into separate vesicles that are regulated by different clathrin adaptors at the TGN, which may contribute to their asymmetric localizations.

Epithelial tissues are polarized along the apical–basal axis such that the apical plasma membrane and the basolateral plasma membrane are enriched with distinct groups of proteins to perform different physiological functions. In addition to the apical–basal polarity, many epithelial tissues are polarized along the tissue plane on an axis perpendicular to the classical apical–basal axis, a phenomenon referred to as planar cell polarity (PCP). 5The abbreviations used are: PCPplanar cell polarityFzd6Frizzled6ERendoplasmic reticulumTGNtrans-Golgi networkAP-1adaptor complex 1GMPPNP5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphateendo Hendoglycosidase HCHCclathrin heavy chainPNG-Fpeptide:N-glycosidase FCCVclathrin-coated vesicleLdl2lethal giant larvae 2aaamino acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseSNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor.

During PCP signaling, Vangl2 and Frizzleds are asymmetrically localized on opposing cell boundaries (1Klein T.J. Mlodzik M. Planar cell polarization: an emerging model points in the right direction.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21 (16212491): 155-17610.1146/annurev.cellbio.21.012704.132806Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The asymmetrically localized PCP proteins are proposed to recruit distinct downstream effectors to drive PCP-mediated processes (9Devenport D. The cell biology of planar cell polarity.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207 (25349257): 171-17910.1083/jcb.201408039Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mechanisms mediating this asymmetric distribution are poorly understood. One view is that the PCP asymmetry is regulated by intercellular interactions between PCP proteins across cellular boundaries (1Klein T.J. Mlodzik M. Planar cell polarization: an emerging model points in the right direction.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21 (16212491): 155-17610.1146/annurev.cellbio.21.012704.132806Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10Chen W.S. Antic D. Matis M. Logan C.Y. Povelones M. Anderson G.A. Nusse R.

Additional signaling pathways, including the Wg/Wnt4 pathway and the Dachsous/Fat/Four-jointed pathway, are proposed to provide long-range directional information for establishing the PCP asymmetry (11Wu J.

Besides these, evidence from live imaging analysis demonstrates that vesicles containing Frizzled and vesicles containing Dishevelled, another PCP protein, are preferentially transported to the distal boundaries in Drosophila wing (13Shimada Y. Yonemura S. Ohkura H. Strutt D. Uemura T. Polarized transport of Frizzled along the planar microtubule arrays in Drosophila wing epithelium.Dev.

Although PCP and apical–basal polarity are controlled by distinct molecular mechanisms, studies in Drosophila indicate that PCP proteins localize to the cell junctions just apical to the adherence junction (15Peng Y. Axelrod J.D. Asymmetric protein localization in planar cell polarity: mechanisms, puzzles, and challenges.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2012; 101 (23140624): 33-5310.1016/B978-0-12-394592-1.00002-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PCP proteins are initially uniformly distributed around subapical plasma membranes and their asymmetrical localizations precede all other signs of PCP during wing development in Drosophila (16Yang Y. Mlodzik M. Wnt-Frizzled/planar cell polarity signaling: cellular orientation by facing the wind (Wnt).Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Corresponding to this, the alignment of noncentrosomal microtubules are reorganized so that the majority of noncentrosomal microtubules are aligned along the proximal–distal axis with an excess of the plus ends oriented distally prior to the onset of the PCP signaling events (13Shimada Y. Yonemura S. Ohkura H. Strutt D. Uemura T. Polarized transport of Frizzled along the planar microtubule arrays in Drosophila wing epithelium.Dev.

This microtubule dynamics are controlled by Dachsous and Fat implicating that the Dachsous/Fat/Four-jointed pathway may provide long-range directional information to reorganize the microtubule cytoskeleton for polarized delivery of PCP proteins (17Harumoto T. Ito M. Shimada Y. Kobayashi T.J. Ueda H.R. Lu B. Uemura T. Atypical cadherins Dachsous and Fat control dynamics of noncentrosomal microtubules in planar cell polarity.Dev.

Newly synthesized integral PCP proteins are delivered along the secretory transport pathway to the plasma membrane where they perform their physiological functions. Packaging of Vangl2 into vesicles at the ER, the first step of the secretory transport pathway, depends on one of the COPII subunits, Sec24B (18Merte J. Jensen D. Wright K. Sarsfield S. Wang Y. Schekman R. Ginty D.D. Sec24b selectively sorts Vangl2 to regulate planar cell polarity during neural tube closure.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 (19966784, sup pp 1–8): 41-4610.1038/ncb2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The selectivity of this sorting is illustrated by the behavior of the Vangl2 cytosolic, C-terminal looptail mutant protein, which is unable to be packaged into COPII vesicles and thus cannot be exported out of the ER (18Merte J. Jensen D. Wright K. Sarsfield S. Wang Y. Schekman R. Ginty D.D. Sec24b selectively sorts Vangl2 to regulate planar cell polarity during neural tube closure.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 (19966784, sup pp 1–8): 41-4610.1038/ncb2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the looptail mutation of Vangl2 or a mutation in Sec24B causes severe defects in neural tube closure during mouse embryonic development (18Merte J. Jensen D. Wright K. Sarsfield S. Wang Y. Schekman R. Ginty D.D. Sec24b selectively sorts Vangl2 to regulate planar cell polarity during neural tube closure.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 (19966784, sup pp 1–8): 41-4610.1038/ncb2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is another important station in the secretory transport pathway. At the TGN, elaborate cargo sorting machineries are employed to accurately package the correct cargo molecules into the corresponding transport carriers that are targeted to specific destinations (19Guo Y. Sirkis D.W. Schekman R. Protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 (25150009): 169-20610.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013012Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Defects in protein sorting at the TGN cause mistargeting of a variety of cargo molecules and induce various physiological defects (19Guo Y. Sirkis D.W. Schekman R. Protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 (25150009): 169-20610.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013012Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Understanding how PCP proteins are sorted into transport vesicles at the TGN will not only provide important information to explore how they are delivered to the plasma membrane but also reveal novel insights into how their asymmetric localizations are established. Several key participants in TGN sorting have been identified, and these include small GTPases of the Arf family and cargo adaptors. Upon GTP binding, the Arf proteins undergo conformational changes in which the N-terminal lipid-binding motif is exposed to bind TGN membranes and the switch domains change the orientation to recruit various cytosolic cargo adaptors (20Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. ARF family G proteins and their regulators: roles in membrane transport, development and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Once recruited on the TGN membranes, cargo adaptors bind cargo molecules thereby enriching them into transport vesicles (19Guo Y. Sirkis D.W. Schekman R. Protein sorting at the trans-Golgi network.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30 (25150009): 169-20610.1146/annurev-cellbio-100913-013012Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Sorting of a subset of soluble cargo proteins at the TGN is regulated by the actin-severing proteins ADF/cofilin, the lumenal Golgi-resident protein (Cab45), and the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase isoform 1 (SPCA1) (22Curwin A.J. von Blume J. Malhotra V. Cofilin-mediated sorting and export of specific cargo from the Golgi apparatus in yeast.Mol. Biol.

We have used mammalian cells as a model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PCP sorting. This system allowed us to perform not only microscopy and biochemical assays, but also the in vitro assay combined with biochemical manipulations, and thus to define the sorting signals and binding sites. Our previous analysis indicates that sorting of Vangl2 at the TGN depends on one of the Arf family proteins, Arfrp1, and the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) (26Guo Y. Zanetti G. Schekman R. A novel GTP-binding protein-adaptor protein complex responsible for export of Vangl2 from the trans Golgi network.Elife. 2013; 2 (23326640): e00160PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis indicates that Arfrp1–AP-1 interaction opens the cargo-binding pocket of AP-1 to allow AP-1 to directly interact with the tyrosine sorting motif on the Vangl2 cytosolic domain (26Guo Y. Zanetti G. Schekman R. A novel GTP-binding protein-adaptor protein complex responsible for export of Vangl2 from the trans Golgi network.Elife. 2013; 2 (23326640): e00160PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike Vangl2, TGN export of Fzd6 is independent of Arfrp1 and AP-1 suggesting that TGN export of Vangl2 and Fzd6 are mediated by different cargo sorting machineries (26Guo Y. Zanetti G. Schekman R. A novel GTP-binding protein-adaptor protein complex responsible for export of Vangl2 from the trans Golgi network.Elife. 2013; 2 (23326640): e00160PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to utilize mammalian cells to analyze whether Vangl2 and Fzd6 are packaged into different vesicles at the TGN and to investigate the molecular mechanism that mediates TGN export of Fzd6. We previously demonstrated that TGN export of Vangl2 and Fzd6 depends on distinct cargo sorting machineries. One possible consequence of this behavior is that Vangl2 and Fzd6 may be sorted into separate vesicles. To test this, we reconstituted release of Vangl2 and Fzd6 into vesicles from the TGN in vitro and then tested whether the two proteins were packaged together or separately. A TGN vesicle-budding reaction using digitonin-permeablized cells has been reported (27Wakana Y. van Galen J. Meissner F. Scarpa M. Polishchuk R.S. Mann M. Malhotra V. A new class of carriers that transport selective cargo from the trans Golgi network to the cell surface.EMBO J. 2012; 31 (22909819): 3976-399010.1038/emboj.2012.235Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We performed the TGN vesicle-budding assay using COS7 cells transfected with HA-Fzd6 or HA-Vangl2 (Fig. 1A). After a 20 °C incubation, HA-Fzd6 showed a strong TGN-accumulated pattern with no detectable surface-localized pattern in over 80% of the expressing cells (Fig. S1, A–C, and quantification in G). When cells were shifted to 32 °C, the percentage of cells showing TGN-accumulated Fzd6 dropped to below 5% and the majority of cells showed a clear surface-localized pattern of Fzd6 (Fig. S1, D-F, and quantification in G). To reconstitute packaging of Fzd6 into vesicles at the TGN, COS7 cells were incubated at 20 °C to accumulate newly synthesized HA-Fzd6 at the TGN, then permeablized by digitonin, and incubated at 30 °C with rat liver cytosol, GTP, and an ATP regeneration system in the presence of a GTPase-defective form for Sar1A, Sar1A(H79G), to inhibit vesicle budding from the ER. After incubation, the released vesicles were separated from the donor membranes by centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against TGN46, Sec22, and the HA tag. TGN46 is an integral membrane protein that is transported from the TGN to the cell surface (28Ponnambalam S. Girotti M. Yaspo M.L. Owen C.E. Perry A.C. Suganuma T. Nilsson T. Fried M. Banting G. Warren G. Primate homologues of rat TGN38: primary structure, expression and functional implications.J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109 (8907712): 675-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Sec22 is a soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) that directly binds COPII and regulates ER-to-Golgi trafficking (29Miller E.A. Beilharz T.H. Malkus P.N. Lee M.C. Hamamoto S. Orci L. Schekman R. Multiple cargo binding sites on the COPII subunit Sec24p ensure capture of diverse membrane proteins into transport vesicles.Cell. 2003; 114 (12941277): 497-50910.1016/S0092-8674(03)00609-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Thus TGN46 and Sec22 can be used to monitor TGN export and ER export respectively. Using this assay, we reproducibly detected release of TGN46, Sec22, and HA-Fzd6 into vesicles when permeabilized cells were incubated in the absence of Sar1A(H79G) (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Addition of Sar1A(H79G) to the reaction inhibited the vesicular release of Sec22 but not TGN46 and HA-Fzd6, which were packaged dependent on the concentration of cytosol (Fig. 1, B, lanes 2–4, and C). Export of Fzd6 depended on GTP and ATP (Fig. 1, D, lane 1, and E). A nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMPPNP, significantly reduced packaging of Fzd6 into vesicles (Fig. 1, D, lane 4, and E). HA-Fzd6 (WT) in the vesicle fraction in the presence of Sar1A(H79G) was resistant to endoglycosidase H (endo H) digestion (Fig. 1F, lanes 1 and 2) but sensitive to peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNG-F) digestion (Fig. 1F, lanes 3 and 4, asterisk), whereas TGN46, which is highly O-glycosylated, was resistant to both endo H digestion and PNG-F digestion (Fig. 1F), suggesting that HA-Fzd6 in the vesicle fraction contains glycans consistent with modifications in the Golgi. Based on these data, we propose that the discharge of WT Fzd6 in vesicles originates primarily at the TGN. Using the same assay, we detected cytosol-dependent release of WT HA-Vangl2 (Fig. 1G) but not the tyrosine mutant (HA-Vangl2Y279A,Y280A) into the vesicle fraction (Fig. 1, K–L). Export of Vangl2 and TGN46 into vesicles was significantly reduced by GMPPNP (Fig. 1G, lane 6). The GTPase-defective form for Arfrp1, Arfrp1(Q79L), inhibited Vangl2 release into vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, G, lanes 4 and 5, and H), whereas packaging of TGN46 into vesicles was only slightly inhibited by Arfrp1(Q79L) (Fig. 1G) indicating that the sorting of Vangl2 in vesicles originates primarily at the TGN. We then analyzed the effects of the Arfrp1(Q79L) mutant on Fzd6 release into vesicles. The result indicates that, at the lower concentration, Arfrp1(Q79L) did not affect Fzd6 release into vesicles (Fig. 1, I, lane 3, and J). At the higher concentration, Arfrp1(Q79L) partially inhibited release of Fzd6 in the vesicle fraction (Fig. 1, I, lane 4, and J). This analysis suggests that Arfrp1(Q79L) has a stronger inhibiting effect on vesicular release of Vangl2 than Fzd6. We then analyzed the effects of Arfrp1(Q79L) on release of Fzd6 and Vangl2 into vesicles in cells co-expressing these two cargo proteins. The result indicates that the Arfrp1(Q79L) mutant inhibited Vangl2 release into vesicles (Fig. 1M). In contrast, Arfrp1(Q79L) had a weaker inhibiting effect on Fzd6 release into vesicles than Vangl2 release into vesicles (Fig. 1M). Vangl2, Fzd6, and TGN46 were all packaged into buoyant membranes (Fig. 1N). We used negative stain EM to visualize the morphology of the buoyant membrane structures produced in the in vitro budding reaction. The digitonin-treated COS7 cells were visualized by negative stain EM (Fig. 2A). We detected numerous donut-shaped structures in the buoyant membrane fraction (Fig. 2, D–D′, and E). The average diameter and standard deviation of all of the structures seen on the grids is 47.15 ± 22.29 nm. The donut shape probably represented vesicles collapsed by the negative stain procedure. When we performed the vesicle-budding reaction in the absence of GTP and an ATP regeneration system or in the presence of the nonhydrolysable GTP analog, GMPPNP, the number of donut-shaped structures was significantly reduced (Fig. 2, B and E, C and E). These analyses indicate that the nonsedimenting membranes in the budding reaction are transport vesicles not fragments of the Golgi or reformed ministacks. To test whether Vangl2 and Fzd6 were packaged into vesicles together or separately, we performed the TGN vesicle-budding assay using COS7 cells co-transfected with FLAG-Vangl2 and HA-Fzd6 in which ∼80% of the transfected cells co-expressed both constructs. We then immunoisolated the vesicles containing FLAG-Vangl2 using an antibody against the FLAG tag. The immunoisolation approach robustly captured Vangl2-enriched vesicles (Fig. 3, A and B). Strikingly, the immunoisolated Vangl2-enriched vesicles did not contain Fzd6 or TGN46 (Fig. 3, A and C). Likewise, TGN46 was not detected in vesicles isolated using a Fzd6 construct containing a FLAG tag in the C-terminal cytosolic domain (Fig. 3, D–F). As a control for our vesicle isolation experiment, we performed the vesicle-formation assay using cells co-transfected with FLAG-Vangl2 and HA-Vangl2 and then immunoisolated the vesicles containing FLAG-Vangl2. We found a fraction of the vesicles enriched with HA-Vangl2 was co-isolated with FLAG-Vangl2 (Fig. 3, G–I), suggesting that the separation of Vangl2 and Fzd6 was not due to disruption of vesicles. The fraction of vesicles enriched with HA-Vangl2 that were not co-isolated with FLAG-Vangl2 may be derived from cells expressing HA-Vangl2 but not FLAG-Vangl2. We analyzed the morphology of the immunoisolated vesicles by negative stain EM. The structures in the immunoisolated vesicle fraction containing Fzd6-FLAG or FLAG-Vangl2 showed donut shapes (Fig. 3, J–K), which are similar to the morphology we observed in the buoyant membrane fraction from the vesicle-formation assay (Fig. 2D). We did not detect these donut-shaped structures in the control experimental group in which the budding assay was performed without cytosol. There were no clear vesicle coat structures surrounding the immunoisolated vesicles possibly due to the reason that vesicle coat proteins were released from the vesicles after a 2-day period to immunoisolate the vesicles. Another possibility is that the immunoisolation works only for uncoated vesicles as the coat may block the antibody–antigen interaction. These results indicate that Vangl2, Fzd6, and TGN46 are packaged into separate vesicles. An HA-Fzd6 mutant construct lacking the C-terminal cytosolic domain (HA-Fzd6-Δcyto) accumulated at the juxtanuclear area and colocalized with a TGN marker (Golgin97) (Fig. 4, A–F), suggesting that this domain of Fzd6 is important for export of Fzd6 from the TGN. HA-Fzd6-Δcyto mutant was incorporated into vesicles in a budding reaction conducted in the absence of Sar1A(H79G) (Fig. 4G, lane 2). However, in the presence of Sar1A(H79G), packaging of the HA-Fzd6-Δcyto mutant into vesicles was nearly completely blocked (Fig. 4, G, lane 3, and H), suggesting that HA-Fzd6-Δcyto folded well enough to be packaged into COPII vesicles at the ER but lacked information or a structure necessary for sorting into vesicles packaged at the Golgi membrane. Moreover, the N-terminal one-third region of the Fzd6 cytosolic domain was sufficient to restore Sar1A(H79G)-insensitive packaging of Fzd6 into vesicles (Fig. 4, I, lane 3, and J). To identify the molecular machinery that regulates sorting of Fzd6 at the TGN, we analyzed whether clathrin is an important regulator that interacts with Fzd6. We detected a weak interaction between clathrin heavy chain (CHC) and Fzd6 through an immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. S2A). The weak interaction was possibly due to the reason that clathrin interacts with Fzd6 indirectly through clathrin adaptors. As a second approach to test the interaction between Fzd6 and clathrin, we performed GST-pulldown experiments by incubating purified GST-tagged Fzd6 cytosolic domain fragments with cytosol prepared from COS7 cells. We found that clathrin from cell lysates was pulled down by the full-length Fzd6 C-terminal cytosolic domain (aa 497–709), Fzd6"
https://openalex.org/W2802239873,"Use of stem cell-based therapies in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is hindered by efficient means of directed differentiation. For pluripotent stem cells, an initial critical differentiation event is specification to one of three germ lineages: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Differentiation is known to be regulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular factors, but the role of the cytoskeleton during specification, or early differentiation, is still unknown. In these studies, we used agonists and antagonists to modulate actin polymerization and the actin-myosin molecular motor during spontaneous differentiation of embryonic stem cells in embryoid bodies. We found that inhibiting either actin polymerization or actin-myosin interactions led to a decrease in differentiation to the mesodermal lineage and an increase in differentiation to the endodermal lineage. Thus, targeting processes that regulate cytoskeletal tension may be effective in enhancing or inhibiting differentiation towards cells of the endodermal or mesodermal lineages, which include hepatocytes, islets, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and osteocytes. Therefore, these fundamental findings demonstrate that modulation of the cytoskeleton may be useful in production for a range of cell-based therapies, including for liver, pancreatic, cardiac, vascular, and orthopedic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2799633647,"A two-phase feeding study evaluating performance of rainbow trout and comparing luminal and mucosal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bacterial community compositions when fed two alternative protein diets in two rearing systems was conducted. Alternative protein diets (animal protein and plant protein diets) balanced with crystalline amino acids: lysine, methionine and threonine or unbalanced, were fed to rainbow trout in two separate water systems (recirculating (RR) and flow-through (FF)) for a period of 16 weeks. The four diets, each contained 38% digestible protein and 20% fats, were fed to rainbow trout with an average weight of 12.02 ± 0.61 g, and sorted at 30 fish/tank and 12 tanks per dietary treatment. Phase 1 lasted for 8 weeks after which fish from each tank were randomly divided, with one-half moved to new tanks of the opposing system (i.e. from RR to FF and vice versa). The remaining halves were retained in their initial tank and system, and fed their original diets for another 8 weeks (phase 2). After the 16th week, 3 fish/tank were sampled for each of proximate analysis, body indexes and 16S rRNA analysis of GIT microbiota. Fish weight (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0030, P<0.0010) and body fat (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0041, P = 0.0177) were significantly affected by diet, diet quality (balanced or unbalanced) and system, respectively. Feed intake (P = 0.0008) and body energy (P<0.0010) were altered by system. Body indexes were not affected by dietary treatment and water systems. Compositional dissimilarities existed between samples from the rearing water and GIT locations (ANOSIM: (R = 0.29, P = 0.0010), PERMANOVA: R = 0.39, P = 0.0010), but not in dietary samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.004, P = 0.3140, PERMANOVA: R = 0.008, P = 0.4540). Bacteria were predominantly from the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Their abundance differed with more dissimilarity in the luminal samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.40, P = 0.0010, PERMANOVA: R = 0.56, P = 0.0010) than those from the mucosal intestine (ANOSIM: R = 0.37, P = 0.0010, PERMANOVA: R = 0.41, P = 0.0010). Bacteria generally associated with carbohydrate and certain amino acids metabolism were observed in the mucosal intestine while rearing water appeared to serve as the main route of colonization of Aeromonas and Acinetobacter in the rainbow trout."

DC are known to produce a Th1-promoting cytokine, interleukin (IL)-12, in response to malaria and other pathogenic infections, but it is thought that DC do not produce Th2-promoting cytokine, IL-4. Here, we show that a protein factor of malaria parasites induces IL-4 responses by CD11chiMHCIIhiCD3ϵ−CD49b−CD19−FcϵRI− DC via PI3K–Akt–NF-κB signaling independent of TLR-MyD88/TRIF. Malaria parasite–activated DC induced IL-4 responses by T cells both in vitro and in vivo, favoring Th2, and il-4–deficient DC were unable to induce IL-4 expression by T cells. Interestingly, lethal parasites, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei ANKA, induced IL-4 response primarily by CD8α− DC, whereas nonlethal Plasmodium yoelii induced IL-4 by both CD8α+ and CD8α− DC. In both P. berghei ANKA- and P. yoelii-infected mice, IL-4–expressing CD8α− DC did not express IL-12, but a distinct CD8α− DC subset expressed IL-12.

https://openalex.org/W2800675461,"Mice bearing carcinogen-induced premalignant oral lesions were previously shown to have a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which is replaced with an immune inhibitory phenotype as lesions progress to cancer. Since Th17 cells are prominent at the premalignant lesion state and their levels are supported by IL-23, studies used mice that were IL-23 receptor deficient (IL-23R KO) to determine the requirement for IL-23 signaling in the immunological and clinical status of mice with premalignant oral lesions. The results showed a dependence on IL-23 signaling for the pro-inflammatory state of mice with oral lesions as levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α were elevated in wildtype mice with premalignant oral lesions, but not in IL-23R KO mice. In contrast, as lesions progressed to cancer, the pro-inflammatory phenotype subsided and was replaced with the inhibitory mediator IL-10 and with Treg cells in wildtype mice, although not in IL-23R KO mice. Clinically, early progression of premalignant oral lesions to cancer was enhanced in IL-23R KO mice compared to progression in wildtype mice. These results show the importance of IL-23 signaling in both the pro-inflammatory phenotype characteristic of premalignant oral lesions and the inhibitory phenotype as lesions progress to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2799532822,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features of lumbar disc herniation (LDH) with endplate degeneration and the association between cartilaginous fragments and inflammatory response to the herniated disc. Summary of background data LDH often involves hyaline cartilage fragments pulled from the vertebral endplates. Modic changes are closely associated with LDH that contains hyaline cartilage, and cartilaginous endplates seem to affect resorption of the herniated disc. Methods A total of 78 patients who underwent microscopic discectomy between 9 and 16 weeks after an occurrence of LDH were reviewed. Modic changes, disc degeneration, high-intensity zone, and vertebral corner defect were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histopathological observations of cartilaginous endplates and inflamed granulation tissue in the herniated disc were made. In cases with inflamed granulation tissue, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration were also evaluated using immunohistochemical analysis. Results Modic changes were observed in approximately one-third of the patients (26 cases: type 1, 7; type 2, 17; and type 3, 2). Cartilaginous endplates were observed in 32 cases (41%) and in the majority of cases with Modic changes compared with cases without Modic changes (65%, p = 0.001). Although inflamed granulation tissue was observed in 60 cases (77%), no significant differences were detected in patient age and the composition of the herniated material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that fewer CD34-positive capillaries and CD68-positive cells were found in cases with cartilaginous fragments compared with those without cartilaginous fragments (p < 0.001). In addition, a higher immunoreactivity to CD34 and CD68 was found in herniated discs <25% of whose area was occupied by cartilaginous endplates compared with discs whose area was occupied at 25% or more (p < 0.001). Conclusion There is an association between LDH with endplate degeneration and cartilaginous herniation, with Modic type 2 predominating. Furthermore, neovascularization and macrophage infiltration, especially if the amount of cartilage is high, are likely to be less frequent in cartilaginous herniation, leading to failure in the spontaneous remission of clinical symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2799528767,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and one of the leading causes of disability in young adults. Functional markers able to predict MS progression are still lacking. It is recognized that olfactory dysfunction may be an early symptom in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether alterations in olfactory event-related potentials could play a prognostic role in MS. Thirty patients affected by MS relapsing-remitting underwent an olfactory potential examination (T0). Three years after baseline (T1), 28 of 30 patients were clinically evaluated by expanded disability status scale. In addition, the number of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) and the total number of relapses occurred in the last 3 years were collected. At T1, we observed a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and expanded disability status scale scores (rpb = -0.48; p = 0.009). A significant trend for a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and disease duration (rpb = -0.36; p = 0.06) and total number of relapses (rpb = -0.34; p = 0.08) was found. Only patients with olfactory potential absence showed a significant trend in the difference of the disability status scale (p = 0.06) between T0 and T1. In the sub-group of patients with reduced olfactory potential amplitude, we detected a trend for a negative correlation between the disability status scale and the amplitude of N1-P2 components more marked at T1 (r = -0.52; p = 0.06) than T0 (r = -0.47; p = 0.09). This is the first study that evaluated the prognostic role of olfactory event-related potentials in MS. Our results highlighted that olfactory alterations of MS patients were related to disability progression and, to a lesser extent, disease activity. The analysis of olfactory potential parameters confirmed the involvement in olfactory network damage of inflammatory and/or neurodegeneration processes which could predict the progressive course of the disease."

Analysis followed the guidelines for inductive qualitative manifest content analysis. Results The survivors described distress experienced during and after the end of treatment. Five categories comprising 14 subcategories were generated. The categories included: A tough treatment, Marked and hindered, Not feeling good enough, Struggling with the fragility of life, and finally, An ongoing battle with emotions. Conclusion Young survivors of adolescent cancer reporting a need for psychological support described feeling physically, socially, and mentally marked by the cancer experience. They struggled with powerlessness, insecurity, social disconnection, loneliness, and feelings of being unimportant and a failure, and had difficulties understanding and managing their experiences. These concerns should be addressed in psychological treatments for the population irrespective of which approach or model is used to understand survivors’ difficulties.

Patients who were younger than three months of age, or with single ventricle following surgery were excluded. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were retrieved from the database. The survival analysis was performed at the end of 2016. Prognostic factors were identified using multivariate analysis.A total of 366 consecutive patients (24.5 ± 17.6 years of age, 40% male) with PAH-CHD were analyzed. Most had simple shunts (85 pre-tricuspid, 105 post-tricuspid, 102 combined shunts). Patients with pre-tricuspid shunts were significantly older at diagnosis in comparison to post-tricuspid, combined, and complex shunts. Clinical classifications identified patients as having Eisenmenger syndrome (ES, 26.8%), prevalent left to right shunt (66.7%), PAH with small defect (3%), or PAH following defect correction (3.5%). At follow-up (median = 5.9 years; 0.1-20.7 years), no statistically significant differences in survival rate were seen among the anatomical-pathophysiological shunts (p = 0.1). Conversely, the clinical classifications revealed that patients with PAH-small defect had inferior survival compared to patients with ES, PAH post-corrective surgery, or PAH with prevalent left to right shunt (p = 0.01). Significant mortality risks were functional class III, age < 10 years, PAH-small defect, elevated right atrial pressure > 15 mmHg, and baseline PVR > 8 WU•m.2.Patients with PAH-CHD had a modest long-term survival. Different anatomical-pathophysiological shunts affect the natural presentation, while clinical classifications indicate treatment strategies and survival.

Total 171 subjects were recruited in the study with all demographic details by administering a standard questionnaire. SNP analysis was performed with TaqMan assay. Linear univariate and ANCOVA modeling was performed to show the interaction of rs1024611 with another SNP variant of CCL-2/CCR-2 (rs4586 and rs1799865) and impact of individual genotypes on CCL-2 expression in the context of AMD pathology.Results showed that both heterozygous (AG, p = 0.01) and homozygous (GG, p = 0.0001) genotypes are associated with AMD pathology. Allele frequency analysis showed that 'G' allele is frequent in AMD patients as compared to controls (p = 0.0001). Moreover, AMD patients who smoke were found to be associated with 'AG' genotype (p = 0.0145). Although, we did not find any significant interaction between the SNP variants by linear univariate analysis but results show the effect of 'CT' genotype on 'TT' genotype in rs4586 by considering rs1024611 as covariate.Based on these results it is imperative that CCL2 mediated pathology may be associated with AMD."

The following data were collected from medical records: age, sex, activities of daily life, hospital they were admitted in at the time of earthquake, distance between the facility and the nuclear power plant, reasons of evacuation and number of transfers. The patient outcomes were collected from medical records and/or investigated on the telephone in January 2012.A total of 97 patients (28 men and 69 women) were transferred from 10 hospitals via ambulances or buses. No patients died or experienced exacerbation during transfer. Median age of the patients was 86 years. Of the total, 36 patients were not able to obey commands, 44 were bed-ridden and 61 were unable to sustain themselves via oral intake of food. Among 86 patients who were followed-up, 41 (48%) died at the end of 2011. Multiple-regression analysis showed that non-oral intake [Hazard Ratio (HR): 6.07, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.94-19.0] and male sex [HR: 8.35, 95% CI: 2.14-32.5] had significant impact on mortality.This study found that 48% of the evacuated patients died 9 months after the earthquake and they had significantly higher mortality rate than the nursing home residents. Non-oral intake and male sex had significant impact on mortality. These patients should be considered as especially vulnerable in case of hospital evacuation."

T. brucei uses a flagellum for motility, cell division, and cell–cell communication. Proper positioning and attachment of the newly assembled flagellum rely on the faithful duplication and segregation of flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures. These processes are regulated by the polo-like kinase homolog TbPLK, whose activity and abundance are under stringent control to ensure spatiotemporally regulated phosphorylation of its substrates. However, it remains unclear whether a protein phosphatase that counteracts TbPLK activity is also involved in this regulation. Here, we report that a putative kinetoplastid-specific protein phosphatase, named KPP1, has essential roles in regulating flagellum positioning and attachment in T. brucei. KPP1 localized to multiple flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures and co-localized with TbPLK in several cytoskeletal structures at different cell-cycle stages. KPP1 depletion abolished basal body segregation, inhibited the duplication of the centrin arm and the hook complex of the bilobe structure, and disrupted the elongation of the flagellum attachment zone, leading to flagellum misplacement and detachment and cytokinesis arrest. Importantly, KPP1-depleted cells lacked dephosphorylation of TbCentrin2, a TbPLK substrate, at late cell-cycle stages. Together, these results suggest that KPP1-mediated protein dephosphorylation regulates the duplication and segregation of flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures, thereby promoting flagellum positioning and attachment. These findings highlight the requirement of reversible protein phosphorylation, mediated by TbPLK and KPP1, in regulating flagellum inheritance in T. brucei.

However, it remains unclear whether a protein phosphatase that counteracts TbPLK activity is also involved in this regulation. Here, we report that a putative kinetoplastid-specific protein phosphatase, named KPP1, has essential roles in regulating flagellum positioning and attachment in T. brucei. KPP1 localized to multiple flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures and co-localized with TbPLK in several cytoskeletal structures at different cell-cycle stages. KPP1 depletion abolished basal body segregation, inhibited the duplication of the centrin arm and the hook complex of the bilobe structure, and disrupted the elongation of the flagellum attachment zone, leading to flagellum misplacement and detachment and cytokinesis arrest. Importantly, KPP1-depleted cells lacked dephosphorylation of TbCentrin2, a TbPLK substrate, at late cell-cycle stages. Together, these results suggest that KPP1-mediated protein dephosphorylation regulates the duplication and segregation of flagellum-associated cytoskeletal structures, thereby promoting flagellum positioning and attachment. These findings highlight the requirement of reversible protein phosphorylation, mediated by TbPLK and KPP1, in regulating flagellum inheritance in T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W2800516566,"Functional mapping of the 5'LTR has shown that the U3 and the R regions (U3R) contain a cluster of regulatory elements involved in the control of HIV-1 transcription and expression. As the HIV-1 genome is characterized by extensive variability, here we aimed to describe mutations in the U3R from various HIV-1 clades and CRFs in order to highlight strain specific differences that may impact the biological properties of diverse HIV-1 strains. To achieve our purpose, the U3R sequence of plasma derived virus belonging to different clades (A1, B, C, D, F2) and recombinants (CRF02_AG, CRF01_AE and CRF22_01A1) was obtained using Illumina technology. Overall, the R region was very well conserved among and across different strains, while in the U3 region the average inter-strains nucleotide dissimilarity was up to 25%. The TAR hairpin displayed a strain-distinctive cluster of mutations affecting the bulge and the loop, but mostly the stem. Like in previous studies we found a TATAA motif in U3 promoter region from the majority of HIV-1 strains and a TAAAA motif in CRF01_AE; but also in LTRs from CRF22_01A1 isolates. Although LTRs from CRF22_01A1 specimens were assigned CRF01_AE, they contained two NF-kB sites instead of the single TFBS described in CRF01_AE. Also, as previously describe in clade C isolates, we found no C/EBP binding site directly upstream of the enhancer region in CRF22_01A1 specimens. In our study, one-third of CRF02_AG LTRs displayed three NF-kB sites which have been mainly described in clade C isolates. Overall, the number, location and binding patterns of potential regulatory elements found along the U3R might be specific to some HIV-1 strains such as clade F2, CRF02_AG, CRF01_AE and CRF22_01A1. These features may be worth consideration as they may be involved in distinctive regulation of HIV-1 transcription and replication by different and diverse infecting strains."
https://openalex.org/W2799722232,"Visual assessments are used for evaluating the quality of food products, such as fresh-cut lettuce packaged in bags with modified atmosphere. We have compared the accuracy and the reliability of visual evaluations of decay on fresh-cut lettuce performed with experienced and inexperienced raters. In addition, we have analyzed decay data from over 4.5 thousand bags to determine the optimum timing for evaluations to detect differences among accessions. Lin's concordance coefficient (ρc) that takes into consideration both the closeness of the data and the conformance to the identity line showed high repeatability (intra-rater reliability, ρc = 0.97), reproducibility (inter-rater reliability, ρc = 0.92), and accuracy (ρc = 0.96) for experienced raters. Inexperienced raters did not perform as well and their ratings showed decreased repeatability (ρc = 0.93), but even larger reduction in reproducibility (ρc = 0.80) and accuracy (ρc = 0.90). We have detected that 5.3% of ratings were outside of the 95% limits of agreement. These under- or overestimates were predominantly found for bags with intermediate levels of decay, which corresponds to the middle of the rating scale. This occurs because intermediate amounts of decay are more difficult to discriminate than extremes. The frequencies of aberrant ratings for experienced raters ranged from 0.6% to 4.4% (mean = 2.1%), for inexperienced raters the frequencies were substantially higher, ranging from 6.1% to 15.6% (mean = 9.4%). Therefore, we recommend that new raters receive training that includes practical examples in this range of decay, use of standard area diagrams, and continuing interaction with experienced raters (consultation during actual rating). Very high agreement among experienced raters indicate that visual ratings can be successfully used for evaluations of decay, until a more objective, rapid, and affordable method is developed. We recommend evaluating samples at multiple time points until 42 days after processing (about 80% decay on average) and then combining these individual ratings into the area under the decay progress stairs (AUDePS) score. Applying this approach, experienced evaluators can accurately detect difference among lettuce accessions and identify lettuce cultivars with reduced decay."
https://openalex.org/W2800192213,"Background The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project systematically assesses mortality, healthy life expectancy, and disability across 195 countries and territories, using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Disability weights in the DALY are based upon surveys that ask users to rate health states based on lay descriptions. We conducted an experimental study to examine whether the inclusion or removal of psychological, social, or familial implications from a health state description might affect individual judgments about disease severity, and thus relative disability weights. Methods We designed a survey consisting of 36 paired descriptions in which information about plausible psychological, social, or familial implications of a health condition was either present or absent. Using a Web-based platform, we recruited 1,592 participants, who were assigned to one of two experimental groups, each of which were asked to assign a value to the health state description from 0 to 100 using a slider, with 0 as the “worst possible health” and 100 as the “best possible health.” We tested five hypotheses: (1) the inclusion of psychological, social, or familial consequences in health state descriptions will reduce the average rating of a health state; (2) the effect will be stronger for diseases with lower disability weights (i.e., less severe diseases); (3) the effect will vary across the type of additional information added to the health state description; (4) the impact of adding information on familial consequences will be stronger for female than male; (5) the effect of additional consequences on ratings of health state descriptions will not differ by levels of completed education and age. Results On average, adding social, psychological, or familial consequences to the health state description lowered individual ratings of that description by 0.78 points. The impact of adding information had a stronger impact on ratings of the least severe conditions, reducing average ratings in this category by 1.67 points. Addition of information about child-rearing had the strongest impact, reducing average ratings by 2.09 points. We found little evidence that the effect of adding information on ratings of health descriptions varied by gender, education, or age. Conclusions Including information about health states not directly related to major functional consequences or symptoms, particularly with respect to child-rearing and specifically for descriptions of less severe conditions, can lead to lower ratings of health. However, this impact was not consistent across all conditions or types of information, and was most pronounced for inclusion of information about child-rearing, and among the least severe conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2800060065,"A strain (ARP14) of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin was isolated from field-collected Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae). The lethal median concentration of the ARP14 strain was compared with that of a commercialized strain (GHA) of the same fungus against R. pedestris and its two egg parasitoids, Ooencyrtus nezarae Ishii (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and Gryon japonicum (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). Mortality and mycosis rates were evaluated after exposure to five concentrations of the fungus, i.e., 1×109, 1×108, 1×107, 1×106, and 1×105 conidia/mL, using a glass scintillation vial as an exposure arena in 25.0 ± 0.5°C and 93.7 ± 2.9% RH. The lethal median concentrations (LC50) for 2nd and 4th instar nymphs, and adults of R. pedestris were not significantly different between the two strains of B. bassiana. However, the mycosis rate of ARP14 was 1.3 and 1.8 times higher than that of the GHA strain in 4th instar nymphs and adult females of R. pedestris, respectively, at the 1×108 conidia/mL concentration. More interestingly, the mycosis rates at 1×108 conidia/mL concentration in the parasitoids G. japonicum and O. nezarae were much lower in the ARP14 strain (15.0 and 0%) than in the GHA strain (73.3 and 66.0%), respectively, suggesting that the B. bassiana strain ARP14 is less virulent to these parasitoids than the commercially available strain. Our results suggest that B. bassiana ARP14 may be a potential new biopesticide against R. pedestris with fewer negative effects on beneficial parasitoids than currently available options."
https://openalex.org/W2800299334,"Background The HIV pandemic remains the most serious challenge to public health worldwide. The hallmark characteristics of the disease is the eventual failure of the immune system to control opportunistic infections and death. However not everyone who has HIV develops the disease at the same rate and so we are studying how the immune system works to control the virus in those who have been infected for decades and remain relatively healthy without the need of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Methods Genomic DNA samples from 513 Chinese Han individuals from Henan province were typed for 15 KIR and 3 HLA class I genes. Genotype frequencies were compared between a village cohort of 261 former plasma donors (SM cohort) infected with HIV-1 through an illegal plasma donor scheme who survived more than 10 years of infection without ART and 252 ethnically-matched healthy controls from a nearby village. KIR and HLA were molecularly typed using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) and sequence based techniques. Results All 15 KIR genes were observed in the study population at various frequencies. KIR2DL3 was significantly less common in the HIV-1 infected group (95.8% vs 99.2%, p = 0.021). The combination of KIR3DS1 with homozygosity for HLA-Bw4 alleles (the putative ligand for KIR3DS1) was significantly less frequent in the HIV-1 infected group than in the control group (6.0% vs 12.0% respectively, p = 0.023). Conclusion Specific KIR-HLA compound genotypes associate with differential outcomes to infection and disease progression following exposure to a narrow-source HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2800343280,"Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of listeriosis, a rare but fatal disease. During infection, Lm can traverse several physiological barriers; it can cross the intestine and placenta barrier and, in immunocompromised individuals, the blood–brain barrier. With the recent plethora of sequenced genomes available for Lm, it is clear that the complete repertoire of genes used by Lm to interact with its host remains to be fully explored. Recently, we focused on secreted Lm proteins because they are likely to interact with host cell components. Here, we investigated a putatively secreted protein of Lm, Lmo1656, that is present in most sequenced strains of Lm but absent in the nonpathogenic species Listeria innocua. lmo1656 gene is predicted to encode a small, positively charged protein. We show that Lmo1656 is secreted by Lm. Furthermore, deletion of the lmo1656 gene (Δlmo1656) attenuates virulence in mice infected orally but not intravenously, suggesting that Lmo1656 plays a role during oral listeriosis. We identified sorting nexin 6 (SNX6), an endosomal sorting component and BAR domain–containing protein, as a host cell interactor of Lmol656. SNX6 colocalizes with WT Lm during the early steps of infection. This colocalization depends on Lmo1656, and RNAi of SNX6 impairs infection in infected tissue culture cells, suggesting that SNX6 is utilized by Lm during infection. Our results reveal that Lmo1656 is a novel secreted virulence factor of Lm that facilitates recruitment of a specific member of the sorting nexin family in the mammalian host.

https://openalex.org/W2802431177,"The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual’s emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual’s perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings."

In this issue of JBC, Mikkelsen et al. describe a particularly interesting Darier's mutation that alters calcium transport by disrupting a kinetic braking mechanism that is unique to the SERCA2b calcium pump isoform. The study provides new insight into the intrinsic regulation of this transporter and reveals how disruption of regulation can lead to disease in Darier's patients."
https://openalex.org/W2795879915,"Current influenza vaccination strategy is based on limited analyses of circulating strains and has some drawbacks, as illustrated during the 2014–2015 season with the circulation of A(H3N2) viruses belonging to divergent genetic subgroups. We reasoned that these strains, poorly neutralized in vitro, may have been associated with vaccination failure and more severe diseases. We conducted a study on a continuous series of 249 confirmed influenza infections. Incidence was three fold greater than in the previous three years. Most isolates were A(H3N2) viruses (78%) and clustered in subgroups 3C.2a (57%) and 3C.3b (43%). We identified 23 non-synonymous mutations that had already been identified during previous seasons at low frequencies, except mutation Q197H, present in 26% of 3C.3b isolates. We identified lung disorder, tobacco smoking and A(H1N1)pdm09 infection as risk factor of severe influenza disease. In contrast, young age (< 5 years), A(H3N2) infection and initial admission to an emergency department were associated with a better outcome of influenza infection."
https://openalex.org/W2800603931,"The use of model-based propensity scores as matching tools opens the way to the indirect estimation of mode-related measurement effects and selection effects in web surveys, including a component of selection that cannot be traced back to observable characteristics. By matching and comparing respondents from real independent surveys that use the same questionnaire, but different administration modes, it becomes possible to isolate the selection effect induced by unobservable (or unobserved) respondent characteristics. This study applies a stratification matching algorithm to compare a web survey from a proprietary panel with a computer-assisted telephone survey based on random digit-dialing. The experiment is run in two countries (UK and Italy) to check for consistencies across different cultures and different internet penetration rates. The application to the elicitation of support for healthy eating policies indicates large and significant measurement and selection effects. After controlling for differences in the observed characteristics of respondents and the intensity of internet use, findings suggest that web surveys record lower support and higher neutrality. Similarly, after controlling for administration mode and observed respondent characteristics, internet users are less likely to state support compared to non-users. This suggests that unobserved characteristics play a major role, and post-stratification weighting is not a sufficient countermeasure. As demonstrated by the cross-country comparison, rising internet penetration rates are not a guarantee against this type of error, as disparities in these unobserved characteristics are likely to increase at the same time."
https://openalex.org/W2801890317,"This paper reports on a social discounting experiment conducted with university students in South Africa. In line with other social discounting task experiments, participants identify target individuals at different degrees of intimacy in their social network and then make 10 choices involving sums of money for themselves or their targets. For an altruism premium to exist, senders' donations to recipients should be positive, statistically and economically significant, and independent of relationship closeness. We hypothesize that in addition to the altruism premium for kin documented in the literature, there may be other premia for family in general and for partners and friends. We find that, apart from the ""kinship"" premium, there is a sizeable ""intimacy"" premium, which together translates into a substantial ""family"" premium. The study also finds a ""friendship premium"", as is documented in various experiments. The closeness of relationships among family and kin, especially close kin, has a significant and large effect on altruism. The results also attest to the importance of the extended family in regards to the ""kinship"" premium on altruism. These various premiums on altruism emphasise the importance of the supportive role of various social systems. Nevertheless, altruism within families and among close kin might also be enhanced by building more cohesive and stronger families using developmental social welfare programmes."
