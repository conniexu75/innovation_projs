https://openalex.org/W2972939290,"Although clonal neo-antigen burden is associated with improved response to immune therapy, the functional basis for this remains unclear. Here we study this question in a novel controlled mouse melanoma model that enables us to explore the effects of intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) on tumor aggressiveness and immunity independent of tumor mutational burden. Induction of UVB-derived mutations yields highly aggressive tumors with decreased anti-tumor activity. However, single-cell-derived tumors with reduced ITH are swiftly rejected. Their rejection is accompanied by increased T cell reactivity and a less suppressive microenvironment. Using phylogenetic analyses and mixing experiments of single-cell clones, we dissect two characteristics of ITH: the number of clones forming the tumor and their clonal diversity. Our analysis of melanoma patient tumor data recapitulates our results in terms of overall survival and response to immune checkpoint therapy. These findings highlight the importance of clonal mutations in robust immune surveillance and the need to quantify patient ITH to determine the response to checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2973099640,"Summary Although olfactory mucosa possesses long-lived horizontal basal stem cells (HBCs) and remarkable regenerative capacity, the function of human olfactory neuroepithelium is significantly impaired in chronic inflammatory rhinosinusitis. Here, we show that, while inflammation initially damages olfactory neurons and activates HBC-mediated regeneration, continued inflammation locks HBCs in an undifferentiated state. Global gene expression in mouse HBCs reveals broad upregulation of NF-κB-regulated cytokines and chemokines including CCL19, CCL20, and CXCL10, accompanied by enhancement of “stemness”-related transcription factors. Loss-of-function studies identify an NF-κB-dependent role of HBCs in amplifying inflammatory signaling, contributing to macrophage and T cell local proliferation. Chronically activated HBCs signal macrophages to maintain immune defense and prevent Treg development. In diseased human olfactory tissue, activated HBCs in a P63+ undifferentiated state similarly contribute to inflammation through chemokine production. These observations establish a mechanism of chronic rhinosinusitis-associated olfactory loss, caused by a functional switch of neuroepithelial stem cells from regeneration to immune defense."
https://openalex.org/W2972587590,"Long-range synchronization of neural oscillations correlates with distinct behaviors, yet its causal role remains unproven. In mice, tests of avoidance behavior evoke increases in theta-frequency (∼8 Hz) oscillatory synchrony between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test the causal role of this synchrony, we dynamically modulated vHPC-mPFC terminal activity using optogenetic stimulation. Oscillatory stimulation at 8 Hz maximally increased avoidance behavior compared to 2, 4, and 20 Hz. Moreover, avoidance behavior was selectively increased when 8-Hz stimulation was delivered in an oscillatory, but not pulsatile, manner. Furthermore, 8-Hz oscillatory stimulation enhanced vHPC-mPFC neurotransmission and entrained neural activity in the vHPC-mPFC network, resulting in increased synchrony between vHPC theta activity and mPFC spiking. These data suggest a privileged role for vHPC-mPFC theta-frequency communication in generating avoidance behavior and provide direct evidence that synchronized oscillations play a role in facilitating neural transmission and behavior."

Together, our data demonstrate that microtubule nucleation outside the cell body at Golgi outposts by TPPP is critical for elongation of the myelin sheath. The microtubule architecture of the oligodendrocyte is one of the most intriguing of any cell type. Each oligodendrocyte in the CNS can produce up to 50 myelin sheaths (Chong et al., 2012Chong S.Y.

In contrast, Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system only produce one myelin sheath per cell. The oligodendrocyte accomplishes this extraordinary cellular feat by producing two functional classes of microtubules—proximal microtubules that extend toward the axon (radial microtubules) and distal microtubules that spiral around the myelin sheath (lamellar microtubules). Lamellar microtubules are enclosed inside cytoplasmic channels that tunnel inside the myelin sheath, from the outermost to innermost layer, and can facilitate fast vesicular transport (Snaidero et al., 2014Snaidero N.

Microtubules in oligodendrocytes not only are important for transport but also may play a crucial role in disease. Oligodendrocytes rely on transport of endosomes (Trajkovic et al., 2006Trajkovic K.

Despite these advances, the mechanisms underlying microtubule organization in oligodendrocytes remain enigmatic. Classically, new microtubules form at the perinuclear centrosome, a MTOC that relies on γ-tubulin to nucleate microtubules (Stearns et al., 1991Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M.

In recent years, additional MTOCs have also been identified, including Golgi stacks in the cell body (Chabin-Brion et al., 2001Chabin-Brion K. Marceiller J. Perez F. Settegrana C. Drechou A.

Among specialized cells with ramified cytoarchitecture, neurons have been the focus of many studies on microtubule organization. Mammalian neurons have 2 types of processes—typically one long axon with uniform microtubule polarity (plus ends growing away from the cell body) and many branched dendrites with mixed microtubule polarity (Baas et al., 1988Baas P.W. Deitch J.S. Black M.M. Banker G.A. Polarity orientation of microtubules in hippocampal neurons: uniformity in the axon and nonuniformity in the dendrite.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2016; 36: 1071-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how neurons build these processes—microtubule transport and local nucleation. First, microtubules transported from the cell body (Wang and Brown, 2002Wang L. Brown A. Rapid movement of microtubules in axons.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1496-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) can be severed by katanin or spastin and act as seeds for polymerization. Second, acentrosomal MTOCs outside of the cell body may nucleate the formation of new microtubules. In axons, cultured rat neurons whose centrosomes were laser ablated continue to extend axons many days later (Stiess et al., 2010Stiess M. Maghelli N. Kapitein L.C. Gomis-Ruth S. Wilsch-Brauninger M. Hoogenraad C.C. Tolic-Norrelykke I.M. Bradke F. Axon extension occurs independently of centrosomal microtubule nucleation.Science. 2010; 327: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In dendrites, satellite organelles called Golgi outposts can act as sites of acentrosomal nucleation in Drosophila neurons (Ori-McKenney et al., 2012Ori-McKenney K.M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Golgi outposts shape dendrite morphology by functioning as sites of acentrosomal microtubule nucleation in neurons.Neuron. 2012; 76: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, this finding has been challenged in experiments using Golgi-kinesin fusion proteins to recruit Golgi outposts out of the dendrite (Nguyen et al., 2014Nguyen M.M. McCracken C.J. Milner E.S. Goetschius D.J. Weiner A.T. Long M.K. Michael N.L. Munro S. Rolls M.M. Γ-tubulin controls neuronal microtubule polarity independently of Golgi outposts.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Golgi outposts have also been found in gastric parietal cells (Gunn et al., 2011Gunn P.A. Gliddon B.L. Londrigan S.L. Lew A.M. van Driel I.R. Gleeson P.A. The Golgi apparatus in the endomembrane-rich gastric parietal cells exist as functional stable mini-stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm.Biol. Cell. 2011; 103: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in muscle cells, where they are positioned at the intersections of microtubules that form a grid-like lattice (Oddoux et al., 2013Oddoux S. Zaal K.J. Tate V. Kenea A. Nandkeolyar S.A. Reid E. Liu W. Ralston E. Microtubules that form the stationary lattice of muscle fibers are dynamic and nucleated at Golgi elements.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, acentrosomal microtubule nucleation has yet to be described in oligodendrocytes or other glial cells. In addition, because Golgi in the cell body can also function as a site for microtubule nucleation (Chabin-Brion et al., 2001Chabin-Brion K. Marceiller J. Perez F. Settegrana C. Drechou A. Durand G. Poüs C. The Golgi complex is a microtubule-organizing organelle.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2047-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Efimov et al., 2007Efimov A. Kharitonov A. Efimova N. Loncarek J. Miller P.M. Andreyeva N. Gleeson P. Galjart N. Maia A.R. McLeod I.X. et al.Asymmetric CLASP-dependent nucleation of noncentrosomal microtubules at the trans-Golgi network.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 917-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), a challenge to studying Golgi outposts is the lack of an organelle-specific marker that does not recognize cell body Golgi. Here, we show that oligodendrocytes contain Golgi outposts and identify a new marker for Golgi outposts—TPPP (tubulin polymerization promoting protein). This discovery allowed us to purify Golgi outposts from brain and characterize the proteome of this organelle. We demonstrate using biophysical assays that TPPP nucleates microtubules. In vitro, cultured Tppp KO oligodendrocytes surprisingly have more proximal microtubules and no defects in number of myelin sheaths formed. However, oligodendrocytes cultured on 3D microfibers contain Golgi outposts along nascent myelin sheaths and Tppp KO cells have shorter myelin sheaths. In vivo, Tppp KO mice are hypomyelinated with shorter and thinner sheaths and have motor coordination defects. Together, our data demonstrate that TPPP on Golgi outposts are important for local microtubule nucleation and myelin sheath elongation. Classic electron microscopy (EM) experiments using the “hooking” technique in oligodendrocytes demonstrated that ∼80% of microtubules in large diameter processes have plus-end out orientation (Lunn et al., 1997Lunn K.F. Baas P.W. Duncan I.D. Microtubule organization and stability in the oligodendrocyte.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4921-4932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to validate this using live-cell microscopy, we expressed the plus-end microtubule-binding protein EB3-EGFP in primary rat oligodendrocytes purified via the immunopanning method. When differentiated in culture, oligodendrocytes extend many microtubules that become increasingly complex in arborization with increasing days in vitro (DIV) (Figure 1A). Kymograph analysis of EB3 dynamics demonstrates that DIV1–DIV5 oligodendrocytes have uniform polarity with ∼85%–92% of microtubules growing away from the cell body (Figures 1B and 1C; Video S1). Interestingly, EB3 speeds varied, with the lowest speed ∼0.09 μm/s at DIV1 and the fastest speed ∼0.16 μm/s at DIV2 (Figure 1D), indicating that polymerization is faster at certain developmental periods. The average length of microtubule growth phases did not change from DIV1–DIV5 (Figure 1E). In addition, proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which have bipolar processes, also have uniform microtubule polarity with ∼97% plus-ends out (Figures S1A–S1C). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI1NWM5NGUxYjNjZDI1ZmQ5OTA2NWY1MGZlNmI4NDMxYiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3Njk5MzQ0fQ.srgfOJ-oLjHFG9i2R1MkDR5nPRe6SwhTduueRkdNWlhwyAvt7Q7qptc_Lmvmimmh5iFiz81mrGdM-pWhKBfJpmHD9BBKxhNNLmX6x31G7Cm2H-9nek8oRZ6zTlRQ9iR6DLszvVv6Ce9LQ2GRzk-pZBlUvda8fmgE7fBKekvkCuElf3rVSblpXNmtMBKR2vgsfRe3aL4NOGiNoed8ewUcS88hmYO0GwOKIfG5Q32llynjWXn8Y7ywU2JhrgmYL0jBIktJQRRwW73auHYoO8ayEoOWsKFCcQo9cPNfI2_4iv__jQam72-CWwJbDQhfBc7N_WruH6_Thl-raXzHy7ESzw Download .mp4 (2.61 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. DIV2 Oligodendrocyte Expressing EB3-GFP, Related to Figure 1Immunopanned rat primary oligodendrocyte that was electroporated with an EB3-GFP construct, cultured in differentiation media DIV2, and imaged using a spinning-disk confocal microscope. Images were taken every 3 s for 3 min. Golgi outposts have been found in both fly (Zhou et al., 2014Zhou W. Chang J. Wang X. Savelieff M.G. Zhao Y. Ke S. Ye B.

Biol. 2015; 25: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using the cis Golgi marker GM130. In order to determine whether primary rat oligodendrocytes also contain Golgi outposts, we immunostained them and observed GM130-positive (GM130+) puncta along microtubule processes (Figure 1F), with 34.1% ± 8.9% located at branch points. Golgi outposts are distributed along primary, secondary, and tertiary, but not quaternary, processes (Figure 1G) and at various distances away from the cell center with a non-normal or random distribution (Figure 1H). Over 2 decades ago, EM of cultured oligodendrocytes revealed “outstations of Golgi complex” along cell processes. These organelles were in close proximity to microtubules and ∼1–3 μm in length (de Vries et al., 1993de Vries H. Schrage C. Hoekstra K. Kok J.W. van der Haar M.E. Kalicharan D. Liem R.S. Copray J.C. Hoekstra D. Outstations of the Golgi complex are present in the processes of cultured rat oligodendrocytes.J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), much smaller than Golgi stacks in the cell body. Thus, we asked whether Golgi outposts could also be observed in vivo. Transmission EM (TEM) images of mouse spinal cords at P14 after initiation of myelination show Golgi outposts in the proximal branches of oligodendrocytes (Figure 1I). These structures are ∼1–2 μm in length and contain multiple stacks with small associated vesicular structures, which suggests that cis, medial, and trans Golgi can be found intact in a single Golgi outpost. We also observed Golgi outposts far from nuclei in thin processes (Figure S1D), but it is unclear if they are from oligodendrocytes. Functionally, in order to determine whether Golgi outposts could be a source for growing microtubules, we performed dual-color live-cell imaging using the medial Golgi marker mannosidase II (ManII) and EB3. Indeed, kymographs demonstrate that 32%–41% of ManII-positive (ManII+) puncta colocalize with the initiation of EB3 events during 3-min imaging periods (Figures S2A–S2C), indicating that microtubule plus ends at the start of their growth phase can be located in the vicinity of Golgi outposts. The observed rate of EB3s arising from ManII+ puncta was >3 times higher than the probability based on chance (Figure S2D). Binning by speed indicates that ManII+ puncta that give rise to EB3 events are relatively stationary with mean speed of 0.013 ± 0.006 μm/s (Figure S2E). Thus, while a subpopulation of stationary Golgi outposts can give rise to newly growing microtubules, a separate subpopulation of motile Golgi may have other functions, such as secretion and transport (Horton et al., 2005Horton A.C. Rácz B. Monson E.E. Lin A.L. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Polarized secretory trafficking directs cargo for asymmetric dendrite growth and morphogenesis.Neuron. 2005; 48: 757-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Ye et al., 2007Ye B.

Growing dendrites and axons differ in their reliance on the secretory pathway.Cell. 2007; 130: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because oligodendrocyte processes possess properties found in both mammalian axons (e.g., uniform microtubule polarity) and dendrites (e.g., Golgi outposts), we hypothesized that cell-specific mechanisms may underlie the assembly of this unique microtubule architecture. Thus, we performed a screen for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that are both highly and specifically expressed by oligodendrocytes in a RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) database of immunopanned P5 brain cells (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O’Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C. Ruderisch N. et al.An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar). One candidate from this screen was TPPP, a small ∼25-kDa MAP, whose mRNA expression is high in oligodendrocytes and very low in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (Figure 2A). Classic experiments indicate that TPPP protein is absent in the embryonic brain and increases in the postnatal brain around P11 (Takahashi et al., 1993Takahashi M. Tomizawa K. Fujita S.C. Sato K. Uchida T. Imahori K. A brain-specific protein p25 is localized and associated with oligodendrocytes, neuropil, and fiber-like structures of the CA3 hippocampal region in the rat brain.J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), coincident with the start of myelination. Using a validated anti-TPPP antibody (Figures S5A and S7B), we detected TPPP-positive (TPPP+) puncta along oligodendrocyte processes (Figure 2B). Strikingly, 93% of TPPP+ puncta colocalized with GM130 (Figure 2C). Importantly, no TPPP+ puncta colocalized with GM130+ Golgi stacks in the cell body, indicating that TPPP is a specific marker for Golgi outposts. We also replicated this staining pattern using super-resolution microscopy (Figures 2D and S2F). Functionally, to determine whether TPPP+ Golgi outposts can give rise to microtubules, we first looked for endogenous colocalization of TPPP and EB1. Indeed, 34% of TPPP+ puncta colocalize with EB1 (Figures 2E and 2F), indicating that at the time of fixation, a high percent of TPPP+ puncta are in close proximity to growing microtubules. Next, we performed dual-color live-cell imaging to show that EB3-labeled growing microtubules can emanate from TPPP-EGFP puncta (Figure 2G). The observed rate of EBs arising from TPPP puncta was >5 times higher than the probability based on chance (Figure 2H). We also used the binomial distribution to calculate the mean probability of these outcomes (0.08). TPPP-GFP puncta are relatively stationary with speed of 0.009 ± 0.002 μm/s, consistent with the observation that stationary ManII+ Golgi outposts preferentially give rise to EBs (Figure S2E). In order to further validate TPPP as a Golgi outpost marker, we biochemically purified Golgi outposts by adapting an established sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation protocol for Golgi purification (Wang et al., 2006Wang Y. Taguchi T. Warren G. Purification of Rat Liver Golgi Stacks.Volume 2. Elsevier, 2006Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to use 8 P10 neonatal rat brains (Figure 3A); we chose this age to coincide with the start of myelination. To confirm purification of Golgi, we performed western blots that showed enrichment of both GM130 and TPPP in the resulting Golgi fraction (Figure 3B). We expected this purified Golgi fraction to contain both Golgi stacks from the cell body as well as Golgi outposts. Thus, we further isolated it via immuno-EM and immunoprecipitation (IP). To visualize purified Golgi outposts, we performed immuno-EM using gold beads labeled with anti-TPPP antibody. Bead-associated Golgi are membranous structures with diameters ∼1–2 μm (Figure 3C), similar in size to Golgi outposts in spinal cord EMs (Figure 1I). Importantly, ∼69% of bead-associated Golgi co-purified with microtubules (n = 13 Golgi; 3.67 ± 1.09 microtubules per microtubule-associated Golgi). This further supports that TPPP+ Golgi outposts can give rise to microtubules. In parallel, we immunoprecipitated purified Golgi fractions using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-TPPP antibody. In order to eliminate eluted proteins that nonspecifically adsorb to beads, we used anti-GFP antibody as a negative control. Western blots confirm that TPPP is present in the anti-TPPP eluate but absent in the anti-GFP eluate (Figure 3D). Three IP samples were analyzed by MS—the input (purified Golgi), the anti-GFP eluate, and the anti-TPPP eluate. We identified 118 proteins that specifically elute with anti-TPPP antibody and are enriched relative to the Golgi input (Figure 3E; Table S1). This proteome represents the subpopulation of TPPP+ Golgi outposts in the brain. Thus, the ∼24% of GM130+ puncta in oligodendrocytes that are TPPP-negative (Figure 2C) would not be represented in this proteome. Although we looked for hits of γ-tubulin, none were detected in the anti-TPPP eluate, and we failed to detect colocalization by staining with multiple antibodies (Figure S3). Many top hits are transmembrane proteins, which also confirms that our IPs successfully captured membranous organelles. Unexpectedly, many top hits are signaling proteins that may be trafficked between the Golgi outpost and the plasma membrane. The top hit was Golgi apparatus protein 1, a medial Golgi protein implicated in trafficking of FGF receptors (Köhl et al., 2000Köhl R. Antoine M. Olwin B.B. Dickson C. Kiefer P.

Some hits, such as Protein 9330182L06Rik, have yet to be characterized. We validate the hit MYO18A, an unconventional myosin that colocalizes with some GM130+ Golgi outposts (Figure 3F).

In order to understand the molecular function of TPPP, we purified TPPP protein (Figure 4A) and turned to biophysical assays. Previously, addition of TPPP led to increased microtubule density in bulk spectrophotometer assays and was interpreted to mean an increase in polymerization rate (Tirián et al., 2003Tirián L.

Since no study has been conducted in Lebanon on this topic, our objective was to assess the knowledge, attitude and behaviors towards public stigma of mental health diseases, among a sample of the Lebanese population. Methods A cross-sectional study, conducted between November 2017 and May 2018, enrolled 2289 participants. The Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), the Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness (CAMI) and the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS) were used to assess knowledge, attitude and behaviors toward mental illness respectively. The 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of the MAKS, CAMI and RIBS scales scores were considered as cutoff points for low, medium and high scores respectively. Results A high knowledge score was found in 33.0% of the participants, whereas a high attitude score and a higher behavior score were found in 32.2% and 26.9% of the participants respectively. Living in North Lebanon (Beta = 1.331) and being familiar with a non-close person with mental illness (Beta = 0.811) were associated with higher knowledge of mental illness (higher MAKS score), whereas living in Bekaa (Beta = -8.693) and being 70 years old and above (Beta = -5.060) were associated with lower knowledge toward mental illness (lower MAKS score). Higher knowledge of mental illness (higher MAKS score) (Beta = 0.670), having a high level of education (university (Beta = 8.785), secondary (Beta = 6.084) and technical (Beta = 5.677)) were associated with less stigmatizing attitudes (higher CAMI scale). Being familiar with close people with mental illness (Beta = 0.577), less stigmatizing attitudes (higher CAMI scale) (Beta = 0.077) and higher knowledge of mental illness (higher MAKS score) (Beta = 0.115) were associated with higher favorable behaviors (higher RIBS score), whereas knowing a non-close person who have a mental illness (Beta = -0.720) was associated with lower favorable behaviors (lower RIBS score). Conclusion A mass media awareness campaigns that could transmit health messages to a wide public audience in the country to fight stigma toward mental illness, seems warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2972659958,"The molecular chaperone HSP90 facilitates the folding of several client proteins, including innate immune receptors and protein kinases. HSP90 is an essential component of plant and animal immunity, yet pathogenic strategies that directly target the chaperone have not been described. Here, we identify the HopBF1 family of bacterial effectors as eukaryotic-specific HSP90 protein kinases. HopBF1 adopts a minimal protein kinase fold that is recognized by HSP90 as a host client. As a result, HopBF1 phosphorylates HSP90 to completely inhibit the chaperone’s ATPase activity. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of HSP90 prevents activation of immune receptors that trigger the hypersensitive response in plants. Consequently, HopBF1-dependent phosphorylation of HSP90 is sufficient to induce severe disease symptoms in plants infected with the bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae. Collectively, our results uncover a family of bacterial effector kinases with toxin-like properties and reveal a previously unrecognized betrayal mechanism by which bacterial pathogens modulate host immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2972710233,"Insect-borne flaviviruses produce a 300–500–base long noncoding RNA, termed subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), by stalling the cellular 5′–3′-exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1) via structures located in their 3′ UTRs. In this study, we demonstrate that sfRNA production by Zika virus represses XRN1 analogous to what we have previously shown for other flaviviruses. Using protein–RNA reconstitution and a stringent RNA pulldown assay with human choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells, we demonstrate that the sfRNAs from both dengue type 2 and Zika viruses interact with a common set of 21 RNA-binding proteins that contribute to the regulation of post-transcriptional processes in the cell, including splicing, RNA stability, and translation. We found that four of these sfRNA-interacting host proteins, DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) and enhancer of mRNA decapping 3 (EDC3) (two RNA decay factors), phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (a regulator of the biogenesis of the splicing machinery), and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3C (APOBEC3C, a nucleic acid–editing deaminase), inherently restrict Zika virus infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regulations of cellular mRNA decay and RNA splicing are compromised by Zika virus infection as well as by sfRNA alone. Collectively, these results reveal the large extent to which Zika virus–derived sfRNAs interact with cellular RNA-binding proteins and highlight the potential for widespread dysregulation of post-transcriptional control that likely limits the effective response of these cells to viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2974841325,"The present study investigates the wound healing potential of three chitosan-based topical preparations loaded with either tea tree essential oil, rosemary essential oil or a mixture of both oils in vivo. Essential oils of M. alternifolia and R. officinalis were analyzed using GC/MS. Essential oil-loaded chitosan topical preparations were formulated. Wound healing potential was evaluated in vivo using an excision wound model in rats. GC/MS analysis of M. alternifolia and R. officinalis essential oils revealed richness in oxygenated monoterpenes, representing 51.06% and 69.61% of the total oil composition, respectively. Topical application of chitosan-based formulation loaded with a mixture of tea tree and rosemary oils resulted in a significant increase in wound contraction percentage compared to either group treated with individual essential oils and the untreated group. Histopathological examination revealed that topical application of tea tree and rosemary oil combination demonstrated complete re-epithelialization associated with activated hair follicles. The high percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes in both essential oils play an important role in the antioxidant and wound healing potential observed herein. Incorporation of tea tree and rosemary essential oils in chitosan-based preparations in appropriate combination could efficiently promote different stages of wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2973123227,"The integrated stress response (ISR) is activated in response to diverse stress stimuli to maintain homeostasis in neurons. Central to this process is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Here, we report a critical role for ISR in regulating the mammalian circadian clock. The eIF2α kinase GCN2 rhythmically phosphorylates eIF2α in the suprachiasmatic circadian clock. Increased eIF2α phosphorylation shortens the circadian period in both fibroblasts and mice, whereas reduced eIF2α phosphorylation lengthens the circadian period and impairs circadian rhythmicity in animals. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of eIF2α promotes mRNA translation of Atf4. ATF4 binding motifs are identified in multiple clock genes, including Per2, Per3, Cry1, Cry2, and Clock. ATF4 binds to the TTGCAGCA motif in the Per2 promoter and activates its transcription. Together, these results demonstrate a significant role for ISR in circadian physiology and provide a potential link between dysregulated ISR and circadian dysfunction in brain diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2972416813,"Asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and information on the prevalence of asthma in Nigeria is inconsistent. Nationally representative data, important for health planning is unavailable. We aimed to determine the current prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis in Nigeria.A cross-sectional population survey conducted between June 2017 and March 2018 across five cities representing five geo-political zones in Nigeria. Validated screening questionnaires were used to identify persons with asthma and allergic rhinitis respectively. Asthma was defined as physician diagnosed asthma, clinical asthma and by presence of wheeze in the last 12 months respectively. Socio-demographic information, tobacco smoking, sources of household cooking fuel were also obtained.A total of 20063 participants from 6024 households were screened. The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of physician diagnosed asthma, clinical asthma and wheeze was 2.5% (2.3-2.7%), 6.4% (6.0-6.64%) and 9.0% (8.6-9.4%) respectively. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was 22.8% (22.2-23.4%). The prevalence of asthma and rhinitis increased with age (prevalence of clinical asthma: 3.1% (2.8-3.4%), 9.8% (9.1-10.5) and 10.7% (9.4%-12.0) among 6-17 years, 18-45 years and >45 years respectively). Prevalence also varied across different cities with the highest prevalence of clinical asthma occurring in Lagos (8.0%) and the lowest in Ilorin (1.1%). The frequency of allergic rhinitis among persons with clinical asthma was 74.7%. Presence of allergic rhinitis, family history of asthma, current smoking and being overweight were independent determinants of current asthma among adults.The prevalence of asthma and allergic rhinitis in Nigeria is high with variabilities across regions and age groups. The number of persons with clinical asthma in Nigeria (approximately 13 million) is likely to rank among the highest in Africa. This warrants prioritization by stakeholders and policy makers to actively implement risk reduction measures and increase investment in capacity building for the diagnosis and treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis."
https://openalex.org/W2973427402,"Ensuring access to healthcare in emergency health situations is a persistent concern for health system planners. Emergency services, including critical care units for severe burns and coronary events, are amongst those for which travel time is the most crucial, potentially making a difference between life and death. Although it is generally assumed that access to healthcare is not an issue in densely populated urban areas due to short distances, we prove otherwise by applying improved methods of assessing accessibility to emergency services by the urban poor that take traffic variability into account. Combining unique data on emergency health service locations, traffic flow variability and informal settlements boundaries, we generated time-cost based service areas to assess the extent to which emergency health services are reachable by urban slum dwellers when realistic traffic conditions and their variability in time are considered. Variability in traffic congestion is found to have significant impact on the measurement of timely access to, and availability of, healthcare services for slum populations. While under moderate traffic conditions all slums in Dhaka City are within 60-minutes travel time from an emergency service, in congested traffic conditions only 63% of the city's slum population is within 60-minutes reach of most emergency services, and only 32% are within 60-minutes reach of a Burn Unit. Moreover, under congested traffic conditions only 12% of slums in Dhaka City Corporation comply with Bangladesh's policy guidelines that call for access to 1 health service per 50,000 population for most emergency service types, and not a single slum achieved this target for Burn Units. Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) and First Aid & Casualty services provide the best coverage, with nearly 100% of the slum population having timely access within 60-minutes in any traffic condition. Ignoring variability in traffic conditions results in a 3-fold overestimation of geographic coverage and masks intra-urban inequities in accessibility to emergency care, by overestimating geographic accessibility in peripheral areas and underestimating the same for central city areas. The evidence provided can help policy makers and urban planners improve health service delivery for the urban poor. We recommend that taking traffic conditions be taken into account in future GIS-based analysis and planning for healthcare service accessibility in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W2972801573,"V1-ATPase (V1), the catalytic domain of an ion-pumping V-ATPase, is a molecular motor that converts ATP hydrolysis–derived chemical energy into rotation. Here, using a gold nanoparticle probe, we directly observed rotation of V1 from the pathogen Enterococcus hirae (EhV1). We found that 120° steps in each ATP hydrolysis event are divided into 40 and 80° substeps. In the main pause before the 40° substep and at low ATP concentration ([ATP]), the time constant was inversely proportional to [ATP], indicating that ATP binds during the main pause with a rate constant of 1.0 × 107 m−1 s−1. At high [ATP], we observed two [ATP]-independent time constants (0.5 and 0.7 ms). One of two time constants was prolonged (144 ms) in a rotation driven by slowly hydrolyzable ATPγS, indicating that ATP is cleaved during the main pause. In another subpause before the 80° substep, we noted an [ATP]-independent time constant (2.5 ms). Furthermore, in an ATP-driven rotation of an arginine-finger mutant in the presence of ADP, −80 and −40° backward steps were observed. The time constants of the pauses before −80° backward and +40° recovery steps were inversely proportional to [ADP] and [ATP], respectively, indicating that ADP- and ATP-binding events trigger these steps. Assuming that backward steps are reverse reactions, we conclude that 40 and 80° substeps are triggered by ATP binding and ADP release, respectively, and that the remaining time constant in the main pause represents phosphate release. We propose a chemo-mechanical coupling scheme of EhV1, including substeps largely different from those of F1-ATPases.

https://openalex.org/W2974108476,"In some parts of the Southern Ocean (SO), even though low surface concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) indicate FeMn co-limitation, we still lack an understanding on how Mn and Fe availability influences SO phytoplankton ecophysiology. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of Fe and Mn limitation alone as well as their combination on growth, photophysiology and particulate organic carbon production of the bloom-forming Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros debilis. Our results clearly show that growth, photochemical efficiency and carbon production of C. debilis were co-limited by Fe and Mn as highest values were only reached when both nutrients were provided. Even though Mn-deficient cells had higher photochemical efficiencies than Fe-limited ones, they, however, displayed similar low growth and POC production rates, indicating that Mn limitation alone drastically impeded the cell's performance. These results demonstrate that similar to low Fe concentrations, low Mn availability inhibits growth and carbon production of C. debilis. As a result from different species-specific trace metal requirements, SO phytoplankton species distribution and productivity may therefore not solely depend on the input of Fe alone, but also critically on Mn acting together as important drivers of SO phytoplankton ecology and biogeochemistry."

https://openalex.org/W2973197604,"Although cellular reprogramming enables the generation of new cell types for disease modeling and regenerative therapies, reprogramming remains a rare cellular event. By examining reprogramming of fibroblasts into motor neurons and multiple other somatic lineages, we find that epigenetic barriers to conversion can be overcome by endowing cells with the ability to mitigate an inherent antagonism between transcription and DNA replication. We show that transcription factor overexpression induces unusually high rates of transcription and that sustaining hypertranscription and transgene expression in hyperproliferative cells early in reprogramming is critical for successful lineage conversion. However, hypertranscription impedes DNA replication and cell proliferation, processes that facilitate reprogramming. We identify a chemical and genetic cocktail that dramatically increases the number of cells capable of simultaneous hypertranscription and hyperproliferation by activating topoisomerases. Further, we show that hypertranscribing, hyperproliferating cells reprogram at 100-fold higher, near-deterministic rates. Therefore, relaxing biophysical constraints overcomes molecular barriers to cellular reprogramming."

A major binding motif, which is found in many VAPB-interacting proteins, is the “two phenylalanines in an acidic tract” (FFAT) motif (11Murphy R. Wente S.R.

Typically, the FFAT (or FFAT-like) motif interacts with the major sperm protein domain of VAPB. One example of a protein containing the FFAT motif that binds VAPB is the WD repeat–containing protein WDR44 (13Baron Y. Pedrioli P.G. Tyagi K. Johnson C. Wood N.T. Fountaine D. Wightman M.

A mutation in VAPB (P56S) is involved in an autosomal dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (14Nishimura A.L. Mitne-Neto M. Silva H.C. Richieri-Costa A. Middleton S. Cascio D. Kok F.

Several methods have been developed for the identification of proteins that are in close proximity to each other. They typically introduce biotin into unknown proteins as a tag that can be used for affinity capture with immobilized streptavidin and subsequent analysis by MS (for reviews, see Refs. 16Gingras A.C. Abe K.T. Raught B. Getting to know the neighborhood: using proximity-dependent biotinylation to characterize protein complexes and map organelles.Curr. Opin. Chem.

One prominent approach, proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID), is based on a mutant form of the biotin ligase BirA, which can be fused to a protein of interest (the bait) whose neighboring proteins are to be analyzed (18Roux K.J. Kim D.I. Raida M. Burke B. A promiscuous biotin ligase fusion protein identifies proximal and interacting proteins in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 (22412018): 801-81010.1083/jcb.201112098Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). The enzyme part of the fusion protein releases reactive biotin, which can modify proteins (the prey) within a small spatial range. One drawback of this method is a rather long reaction time of >15 h, although a faster method has been described very recently (19Branon T.C. Bosch J.A. Sanchez A.D. Udeshi N.D. Svinkina T. Carr S.A. Feldman J.L. Perrimon N. Ting A.Y. Efficient proximity labeling in living cells and organisms with TurboID.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 (30125270): 880-88710.1038/nbt.4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). As an alternative to biotin ligase–dependent modifications, peroxidase-based methods have been introduced that allow short reaction times in the range of seconds to minutes (20Rhee H.W. Zou P. Udeshi N.D. Martell J.D. Mootha V.K. Carr S.A. Ting A.Y. Proteomic mapping of mitochondria in living cells via spatially restricted enzymatic tagging.Science. 2013; 339 (23371551): 1328-133110.1126/science.1230593Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) is a plant enzyme that generates biotin-phenoxyl radicals from biotin phenol in the presence of H2O2. These radicals have a very short half-life and, thus, can modify proteins within a range of ∼20 nm, reacting with several amino acids with tyrosine as the primary site of biotinylation (21Udeshi N.D. Pedram K. Svinkina T. Fereshetian S. Myers S.A. Aygun O. Krug K. Clauser K. Ryan D. Ast T. Mootha V.K. Ting A.Y. Carr S.A.

Importantly, APEX can be fused to the N or C terminus of proteins and may also reside internally. Furthermore, the enzyme has been shown to be active in several cellular compartments (20Rhee H.W. Zou P. Udeshi N.D. Martell J.D. Mootha V.K. Carr S.A. Ting A.Y.

Recently, APEX2, which is far more active than the original enzyme, was introduced (24Lam S.S. Martell J.D. Kamer K.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Mootha V.K. Ting A.Y.

So far, APEX- or APEX2-based methods have mainly been used for the identification of proteins that reside in defined subcellular compartments, e.g. in primary cilia (23Mick D.U. Rodrigues R.B. Leib R.D. Adams C.M. Chien A.S. Gygi S.P. Nachury M.V. Proteomics of primary cilia by proximity labeling.Dev.

As an alternative to APEX, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) can also be used as an enzyme to initiate the formation of biotin-phenoxyl radicals, and antibody-directed targeting of HRP to proteins of interest was recently described (26Bar D.Z. Atkatsh K. Tavarez U. Erdos M.R. Gruenbaum Y. Collins F.S. Biotinylation by antibody recognition—a method for proximity labeling.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 (29256494): 127-13310.1038/nmeth.4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We previously characterized the post-translational insertion mechanisms of emerin into ER membranes and analyzed targeting of the protein to the INM (27Pfaff J. Rivera Monroy J. Jamieson C. Rajanala K. Vilardi F. Schwappach B. Kehlenbach R.H. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy mutations impair TRC40-mediated targeting of emerin to the inner nuclear membrane.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 (26675233): 502-51610.1242/jcs.179333Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For this, we applied a rapamycin-dependent dimerization method to monitor sequestration of a soluble nuclear reporter protein (dGFP-GST-NLS-FKBP12) to mCherry-tagged emerin (mCherry-FRB-emerin) at the INM. In this system, rapamycin binds to its two cognate binding regions, a 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and an FKBP-rapamycin–binding (FRB) cassette, promoting rapid interaction of the appropriately tagged proteins (28Chen J. Zheng X.F. Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Identification of an 11-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-binding domain within the 289-kDa FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein and characterization of a critical serine residue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92 (7539137): 4947-495110.1073/pnas.92.11.4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We now combine the APEX2 technology with the rapamycin-dependent dimerization approach. To this end, we target FKBP12-tagged APEX2 to FRB-tagged proteins in a rapamycin-dependent manner. SILAC, followed by quantitative MS, then allows the comparison of proteins that are biotinylated by APEX2 in either the absence or presence of rapamycin. Using this method (rapamycin- and APEX-dependent identification of proteins by SILAC or RAPIDS), we found RMDN3 (PTPIP51), ACBD5, YIF1A, OSBPL9, and other previously known interacting proteins of VAPB. Using a version of APEX2 that accumulates in the nucleus, we identified additional neighboring proteins of VAPB that reside at the nuclear envelope, e.g. emerin, TMEM43, lamins, and the nucleoporin embryonic large molecule derived from yolk sac (ELYS; AHCTF1). We further demonstrated the INM localization of VAPB by immunoelectron microscopy and confirmed the close proximity of endogenous VAPB with several of the newly identified proteins using proximity ligation assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. VAPB is typically described as an ER-resident protein, mediating interactions with multiple organelles. In addition, VAPB seems to play a role in the dynamics of the nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex. In this context, it was reported to affect transport of emerin to the INM (15Tran D. Chalhoub A. Schooley A. Zhang W. Ngsee J.K. A mutation in VAPB that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis also causes a nuclear envelope defect.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (22454507): 2831-283610.1242/jcs.102111Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A localization of VAPB itself to the INM, however, has not been demonstrated so far. We therefore investigated the subcellular localization of VAPB in detail. We first analyzed endogenous VAPB by indirect immunofluorescence using different buffers for the procedure. The specificity of the anti-VAPB antibody was confirmed by siRNA-mediated knockdown (see Fig. 6). As shown before, VAPB localized to the ER, with a clear rim around the nucleus visible in many cells (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the ratio of the ER and the nuclear envelope signal varied a lot, depending on the buffer used (Fig. 1A, compare panels i and ii). Similar to the endogenous protein, differently tagged versions of VAPB (mCherry-FRB-VAPB and HA-FRB-VAPB) were also found at the level of the ER and the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1B). We next tested whether the nuclear rim could reflect targeting of VAPB not only to the outer but also to the inner nuclear membrane. For readout, we used our established rapamycin system (27Pfaff J. Rivera Monroy J. Jamieson C. Rajanala K. Vilardi F. Schwappach B. Kehlenbach R.H. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy mutations impair TRC40-mediated targeting of emerin to the inner nuclear membrane.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 (26675233): 502-51610.1242/jcs.179333Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown before for emerin, the nuclear reporter protein dGFP-GST-NLS-FKBP12 was sequestered to the nuclear rim upon the addition of rapamycin in cells coexpressing mCherry-FRB-VAPB (Fig. 1C). This result suggested that at least a portion of the exogenously expressed VAPB reached the INM. To unequivocally demonstrate INM localization of endogenous VAPB, we performed immunoelectron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1D, immunoreactivity was detected at mitochondria, possibly reflecting the interaction of VAPB with PTPIP51. Furthermore, a significant number of gold dots were found at the level of the INM and in close proximity to nuclear pores. In addition to these morphological studies, we also performed biochemical analyses. Obtaining pure INM fractions is hardly possible; nevertheless, we subjected cell lysates to an established fractionation protocol (29Cheng L.C. Baboo S. Lindsay C. Brusman L. Martinez-Bartolomé S. Tapia O. Zhang X. Yates 3rd, J.R. Gerace L. Identification of new transmembrane proteins concentrated at the nuclear envelope using organellar proteomics of mesenchymal cells.Nucleus. 2019; 10 (31142202): 126-14310.1080/19491034.2019.1618175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. S1, VAPB was largely recovered in the same fraction as emerin and other proteins of the nuclear envelope, although other membrane proteins are certainly expected in this fraction as well. Together, our results clearly point to a localization of a fraction of the cellular VAPB pool at the INM. These results are in line with a recent study, published during the review process of this paper, that suggests a role of VAPB in nuclear egress of herpes simplex viral particles (30Saiz-Ros N.

A portion of VAPB, however, localizes to the INM, so we then set out to devise a method for the identification of neighboring partners of VAPB that allows focus on either the cytoplasm (where the majority of VAPB is expected) or the nuclear compartment. Our approach is based on the APEX2 method for identification of proximity partners. In a “classic” approach, we first fused APEX2 directly to VAPB (Fig. 2A, left), as done before for many other proteins (9Johnson B. Leek A.N. Solé L. Maverick E.E. Levine T.P. Tamkun M.M.

HeLa cells were transfected with constructs coding for APEX2-VAPB or, for a control reaction, GFP-APEX2. Fig. 2B shows the subcellular localization of the APEX2 fusion proteins: as expected, GFP-APEX2 is found all over the cell and should promote unspecific biotinylation of many cellular proteins, whereas APEX2-VAPB localizes largely to the ER, very similarly to other fusion proteins of VAPB (compare Fig. 1B). Next, the cells were subjected to the biotinylation protocol, including loading of cells with biotin-phenol and a short pulse with H2O2. For analysis, biotinylated proteins were enriched using neutravidin beads and detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2C, both fusion proteins were detected at similar levels in total cell lysates and in the protein fractions as bound to the neutravidin beads, indicating self-biotinylation. Furthermore, they led to a similar pattern of biotinylated proteins as detected by streptavidin-HRP. Next, we probed the blots with antibodies against proteins that had previously been identified as interaction partners of VAPB. Indeed, ACBD5 and OSBPL9 were clearly enriched when cells expressed APEX2-VAPB. In the control cells expressing GFP-APEX2, much lower levels of ACBD5 and OSBPL9 were detected (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 7 and 8). This result shows that the APEX method is suited for the identification of interaction/proximity partners of VAPB at the level of the ER. We noted, however, that the difference between specific and unspecific biotinylation (i.e. modification in cells expressing APEX2-VAPB versus cells expressing GFP-APEX2) varied a lot, possibly resulting from different transfection efficiencies. We therefore modified our approach in a way that should allow a better control over specific versus unspecific biotinylation and combined APEX2-dependent biotinylation with the protocol for rapamycin-dependent targeting of proteins to a protein of interest (27Pfaff J.

Although the differential metabolism of the main n-3PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could lead to distinct activities, there are no clinical studies comparing their relative efficacy in human skin. Following a 10-wk oral supplementation of healthy volunteers and using mass spectrometry-based lipidomics, we found that n-3PUFA mainly affected the epidermal mediator lipidome. EPA was more efficient than DHA in reducing production of arachidonic acid–derived lipids, and both n-3PUFA lowered N-acyl ethanolamines. In UV radiation–challenged skin (3 times the minimum erythemal dose), EPA attenuated the production of proinflammatory lipids, whereas DHA abrogated the migration of Langerhans cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, n-3PUFA increased the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but did not alter the erythemal response, either the sunburn threshold or the resolution of erythema, as assessed by spectrophotometric hemoglobin index readings. As EPA and DHA differentially impact cutaneous inflammation through changes in the network of epidermal lipids and dendritic and infiltrating immune cells, they should be considered separately when designing interventions for cutaneous disease.—Kendall, A.

https://openalex.org/W2971980485,"Most species-climate models relate range margins to long-term mean climate but lack mechanistic understanding of the ecological or demographic processes underlying the climate response. We examined the case of a climatically limited edge-of-range population of a medium-sized grassland bird, for which climate responses may involve a behavioural trade-off between temperature stress and reproduction. We hypothesised that temperature will be a limiting factor for the conspicuous, male snort-call display behaviour, and high temperatures would reduce the display activity of male birds. Using remote tracking technology with tri-axial accelerometers we classified and studied the display behaviour of 17 free-ranging male little bustards, Tetrax tetrax, at 5 sites in the Iberian Peninsula. Display behaviour was related to temperature using two classes of Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) at different temporal resolutions. GAMMs showed that temperature, time of the day and Julian date explained variation in display behaviour within the day, with birds snort-calling significantly less during higher temperatures. We also showed that variation in daily snort-call activity was related to average daytime temperatures, with our model predicting an average decrease in daytime snort-call display activity of up to 10.4% for the temperature increases projected by 2100 in this region due to global warming. For lekking birds and mammals undertaking energetically-costly displays in a warming climate, reduced display behaviour could impact inter- and intra-sex mating behaviour interactions through sexual selection and mate choice mechanisms, with possible consequences on mating and reproductive success. The study provides a reproducible example for how accelerometer data can be used to answer research questions with important conservation inferences related to the impacts of climate change on a range of taxonomic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2974228260,"Background Tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN) diagnosis remains a challenge in resource limited countries like Ethiopia. Most diagnostic centers in Ethiopia use smear microscopy, but it has low sensitivity in detecting tubercle bacilli in fine needle aspiration (FNA) specimens. FNA cytology (FNAC) is another widely applicable diagnostic option but it has low specificity for diagnosing TBLN. In 2014, WHO recommended Xpert MTB/RIF assay to be used in detecting TB from FNA specimen by considering the diagnostic limitations of microscopy and cytology. In Ethiopia, there is limited data on Xpert MTB/RIF performance in detecting TBLN from FNA. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assay and non-molecular methods (cytology, microscopy and culture) for the diagnosis of TBLN. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 152 presumptive TBLN patients at St. Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC) from December 2015 to May 2016 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. FNA specimens were collected from each patient. Individual patient specimens were examined by microscopy (acid fast and auramine O staining), cytology, Xpert MTB/RIF and culture. Each specimen was directly inoculated and its sediment following decontamination procedure onto two duplicate Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) media. Composite culture (specimen positive by direct or concentrated or both culturing methods) and composite method (positive by either one of the non-molecular methods) were taken as reference methods. The data was captured and analyzed using software packages SPSS version 20 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated. Result A total of 152 presumptive TBLN patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 105(69%), 68(44.7%), 64(42%), 48(32%) and 33(22%) were positive for M. tuberculosis using composite method (positive by either one of the non-molecular method), composite culture, direct, and concentrated culture, respectively. TB positivity rate was 67.8%, 49.3%, 24.3%, and 14.5% using cytology, Xpert MTB/RIF, Auramine O (FM) microscopy, and Ziehl Nelson (ZN) microscopy, respectively. Using composite culture as reference, the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF was 78% (95% CI: 73.7% to 82.3%) and 74% (95%CI: 69.4% to 78.6%), respectively. However, the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RF improved from 78% to 92% using composite method as a reference. The high positivity rate observed in purulent (70%) followed by caseous (66.7%) type of aspirates by Xpert MTB/RIF. Conclusion Xpert MTB/RIF assay has both considerable sensitivity and specificity; it may be employed for better diagnosis, management and treatment of presumptive TBLN patients."
https://openalex.org/W2973449919,"Fire regime shifts are driven by climate and natural vegetation changes, but can be strongly affected by human land management. Yet, it is poorly known how humans have influenced fire regimes prior to active wildfire suppression. Among the last 250 years, the human contribution to the global increase in fire occurrence during the mid-19th century is especially unclear, as data sources are limited. Here, we test the extent to which forest management has driven fire regime shifts in a temperate forest landscape. We combine multiple fire proxies (macroscopic charcoal and fire-related biomarkers) derived from highly resolved lake sediments (i.e., 3–5 years per sample), and apply a new statistical approach to classify source area- and temperature-specific fire regimes (biomass burnt, fire episodes). We compare these records with independent climate and vegetation reconstructions. We find two prominent fire regime shifts during the 19th and 20th centuries, driven by an adaptive socio-ecological cycle in human forest management. Although individual fire episodes were triggered mainly by arson (as described in historical documents) during dry summers, the biomass burnt increased unintentionally during the mid-19th century due to the plantation of flammable, fast-growing pine tree monocultures needed for industrialization. State forest management reacted with active fire management and suppression during the 20th century. However, pine cover has been increasing since the 1990s and climate projections predict increasingly dry conditions, suggesting a renewed need for adaptations to reduce the increasing fire risk."
https://openalex.org/W2972348508,"Herpesviruses can rewire cellular signaling in host cells by expressing viral G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). These viral receptors exhibit homology to human chemokine receptors, but some display constitutive activity and promiscuous G protein coupling. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been detected in multiple cancers, including glioblastoma, and its genome encodes four GPCRs. One of these receptors, US28, is expressed in glioblastoma and possesses constitutive activity and oncomodulatory properties. UL33, another HCMV-encoded GPCR, also displays constitutive signaling via Gαq, Gαi, and Gαs proteins. However, little is known about the nature and functional effects of UL33-driven signaling. Here, we assessed UL33’s signaling repertoire and oncomodulatory potential. UL33 activated multiple proliferative, angiogenic, and inflammatory signaling pathways in HEK293T and U251 glioblastoma cells. Notably, upon infection, UL33 contributed to HCMV-mediated STAT3 activation. Moreover, UL33 increased spheroid growth in vitro and accelerated tumor growth in different in vivo tumor models, including an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft model. UL33-mediated signaling was similar to that stimulated by US28; however, UL33-induced tumor growth was delayed. Additionally, the spatiotemporal expression of the two receptors only partially overlapped in HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, our results unveil that UL33 has broad signaling capacity and provide mechanistic insight into its functional effects. UL33, like US28, exhibits oncomodulatory properties, elicited via constitutive activation of multiple signaling pathways. UL33 and US28 might contribute to HCMV’s oncomodulatory effects through complementing and converging cellular signaling, and hence UL33 may represent a promising drug target in HCMV-associated malignancies.

Experiments using R33 and M33, UL33 homologs expressed by rodent-specific cytomegaloviruses, have illustrated pathological relevance of UL33 gene family members. Deletion of R33 from rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) highlighted the contribution of R33 to virus replication in vivo. Moreover, lower mortality rates were observed in rats infected with R33-knockout virus (37Beisser P.S. Vink C. Van Dam J.G. Grauls G. Vanherle S.J. Bruggeman C.A.

Although UL33 displays promiscuous G protein coupling and constitutive activity, limited information is available on the signaling properties and functional consequences of UL33. In this study, we explored the signaling repertoire of UL33 as well as its contribution to oncomodulation. Our data demonstrate that UL33 is capable of enhancing tumor growth via constitutive activation of proinflammatory, proliferative, and proangiogenic signal transduction pathways. Hence, UL33 could play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCMV-associated malignancies. UL33 promiscuously couples to G proteins in a constitutive manner (30Casarosa P. Gruijthuijsen Y.K.

https://openalex.org/W2972411314,"Previous studies have shown that ATP synthase α subunit (ATP5A1) plays multiple roles, but our understanding of its biologic functions remains poor and incomprehensive. Here, we clearly demonstrated that zebrafish ATP5A1 was a newly characterized lipoteichoic acid (LTA)- and LPS-binding protein abundantly stored in the eggs and embryos of zebrafish. Zebrafish ATP5A1 acted not only as a pattern recognition receptor, capable of identifying LTA and LPS, but also as an effector molecule, capable of inhibiting the growth of both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. ATP5A1 could disrupt the bacterial membranes by a combined action of membrane depolarization and permeabilization. We also found that the N-terminal 65 residues were critical for the antibacterial activity of zebrafish ATP5A1. In particular, we showed that microinjection of exogenous recombinant (r)ATP5A1 into early embryos could promote their resistance against pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila challenge, and this pathogen-resistant activity was markedly reduced by the coinjection of anti-ATP5A1 antibody or by the knockdown with morpholino for atp5a1 but not by the coinjection of anti-actin antibody. Moreover, each egg/embryo contains a sufficient amount of ATP5A1 in vivo to kill A. hydrophila. Furthermore, the N-terminal 65 residues 1-65 of ATP5A1 α subunit (rA1-65) with in vitro antibacterial activity also promoted the resistance of embryos against A. hydrophila, but the N-terminal 69 residues 66-134 (rA66-134) or C-terminal residues 135-551 (rA135-551) of ATP5A1 α subunit without in vitro antibacterial activity did not. Finally, we showed that the antibacterial activity of the N-terminal 65 residues of ATP5A1 α subunit was conserved throughout animal evolution. Collectively, these results indicate that ATP5A1 is a novel maternal immunocompetent factor that can protect the early embryos of zebrafish from bacterial infection. This work also provides a new viewpoint for understanding the biologic roles of ATP5A1, which is ubiquitously present in animals.-Ni, S., Zhou, Y., Chen, Y., Du, X., Zhang, S.

Previous empirical work on this topic, which shows a diverse range of estimated effects, is based largely on outcome regression (OR) models using the Empirical Bayes approach or on simple before and after comparisons. Issues of causality and confounding have received little formal attention. A causal DR approach combines propensity score (PS) and OR models to give an average treatment effect (ATE) estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal under correct specification of either of the two component models. We develop this approach within a novel approximate Bayesian framework to derive posterior predictive distributions for the ATE of speed cameras on road traffic collisions. Our results for England indicate significant reductions in the number of collisions at speed cameras sites (mean ATE = -15%). Our proposed method offers a promising approach for evaluation of transport safety interventions."

https://openalex.org/W2973474578,"Globally, crustaceans represent one of the most taxonomically diverse and economically important invertebrate group. Notwithstanding, the diversity within this group is poorly known because most crustaceans are often associated with varied habits, forms, sizes and habitats; making species identification by conventional methods extremely challenging. In addition, progress towards understanding the diversity within this group especially in southern Africa has been severely hampered by the declining number of trained taxonomists, the presence of invasive alien species, over exploitation, etc. However, the advent of molecular techniques such as “DNA barcoding and Metabarcoding” can accelerate species identification and the discovery of new species. To contribute to the growing body of knowledge on crustacean diversity, we collected data from five southern African countries and used a DNA barcoding approach to build the first DNA barcode reference library for southern African crustaceans. We tested the reliability of this DNA barcode reference library to facilitate species identification using two approaches. We recovered high efficacy of specimen identification/discrimination; supported by both barcode gap and tree-base species identification methods. In addition, we identified alien invasive species and specimens with ‘no ID” in our DNA barcode reference library.

Our objective was to evaluate the effects of supplement composition (energetic or protein) on the performance, muscle development, thermogenisis, nutrient intake, and digestibility of replacement Holstein heifers grazing Mombaça grass. Eighteen Holstein heifers with an average age and initial body weight (BW) of 12.57 ± 2.54 mo and 218.76 ±47.6 kg, respectively, were submitted to a randomized block design, with six replicates on a rotational grazing system of Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça pasture. Treatments were: control (CON; mineral salt ad libitum); energy supplement (ENE; corn meal as supplement, 8% CP and 3.78 Mcal/kg DE); and protein supplement (PRO; corn and soybean meal, 25% CP and 3.66 Mcal/kg DE). Supplements were individually fed at 0.5% BW. The experiment lasted 120 days, subdivided into three periods. Titanium dioxide and indigestible neutral detergent fiber (iNDF) were used to estimate the intakes and digestibility of the nutrients. BW, wither height, thoracic circumference, body length, and ultrasound of ribeye fat thickness measurements were taken once per period. Body condition score (BCS) was assessed twice during the experiment. The MIXED procedure of SAS, including period as a repeated measure, was used and significance was declared at P ≤ 0.05. Dry matter intake (DMI), CP intake (CPI) and DE intake were greater in heifers fed PRO compared to CON and ENE. Heifers supplemented with ENE had the lowest DMI. Treatment affected pasture intake/BW; it was similar between PRO and CON heifers, and lower for the ENE treatment. A treatment × period interaction was observed for NDF intake (%BW), in which heifers fed PRO and CON had the greatest NDF intake and ENE had the lowest. The digestibility of DM was the greatest in PRO-supplemented heifers and the lowest in CON heifers. Heifers fed ENE had decreased CP digestibility compared to PRO and CON heifers. Average daily gain (ADG) and thoracic circumference gain were greatest in the PRO treatment. BCS was greater in PRO compared to CON and ENE heifers. Supplementing Holstein heifers at 0.5% BW using PRO supplementation resulted in better animal performance, primarily greater ADG, than feeding ENE or not supplementing (CON). In conclusion, our results indicate that dairy heifers should be fed a protein supplement when grazing intensively managed Mombaça grass pasture."

Research has assessed effects of salvage and placement depth of forest topsoil on plant community establishment, with little work on effects of storage, particularly in the boreal forest. Our research assessed boreal forest topsoil storage methods to determine effects on soil chemical and physical properties, native seed viability and germination and rhizome viability and emergence. Factors were topsoil stockpiling length, stockpile size, season of construction and soil texture. Four replicates of large and small stockpiles were constructed in the mineable oil sands, in northeastern Alberta. During construction seeds and rhizomes from a variety of native boreal plant species were buried within large (0.05, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 m) and small (0.05, 1.0, 3.0 m) stockpiles. Soil gas probes were installed at similar depths as seed and rhizomes were placed. Seeds and rhizomes were extracted eight months and sixteen months after construction; during that time soil samples were collected for various chemical analyses. Irrespective of stockpile size, the majority of species seeds and rhizomes buried below 1 m lost viability and did not germinate after eight months. Anaerobic soil conditions developed soon after construction and persisted at depths below 1.0 m in large stockpiles, and over time anaerobic conditions developed in smaller stockpiles. Only seeds of Geranium bicknellii and Dracocephalum parviflorum had a high survival rate in stockpiles; both species have hard seed coats and are physically dormant. Various soil nutrients increased in concentrations in their soluble forms after stockpiling. Direct placement of topsoil is a preferred soil handling technique; however, if topsoil has to be stockpiled increasing the surface area of stockpiles will help preserve some seed and rhizome viability."
https://openalex.org/W2974347020,"China's transport sector is facing enormous challenges from soaring energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transport electrification has been viewed as a major solution to transportation decarbonization, and electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted considerable attention from policymakers. This paper analyzes the effects of the introduction of EVs in China. A system dynamics model is developed and applied to assess the energy-saving and emission-reducing impacts of the projected penetration of EVs until the year 2030. Five types of scenarios of various EV penetration rates, electricity generation mixes, and the speed of technological improvement are discussed. Results confirm that reductions in transport GHG emissions and gasoline and diesel consumption by 3.0%-16.2%, 4.4%-16.1%, and 15.8%-34.3%, respectively, will be achieved by 2030 under China's projected EV penetration scenarios. Results also confirm that if EV penetration is accompanied by decarbonized electricity generation, that is, the use of 55% coal by 2030, then total transport GHG emissions will be further reduced by 0.8%-4.4%. Moreover, further reductions of GHG emissions of up to 5.6% could be achieved through technological improvement. The promotion of EVs could substantially affect the reduction of transport GHG emissions in China, despite the uncertainty of the influence intensity, which is dependent on the penetration rate of EVs, the decarbonization of the power sector, and the technological improvement efficiency of EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2972684396,"Sequential activation of DNA replication origins is precisely programmed and critical to maintaining genome stability. RecQL4, a member of the conserved RecQ family of helicases, plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells. Here, we showed that RecQL4 protein tethered on the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) induces early activation of late replicating origins during S phase. Tethering of RecQL4 or its N terminus on pre-RCs via fusion with Orc4 protein resulted in the recruitment of essential initiation factors, such as Mcm10, And-1, Cdc45, and GINS, increasing nascent DNA synthesis in late replicating origins during early S phase. In this origin activation process, tethered RecQL4 was able to recruit Cdc45 even in the absence of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, whereas CDK phosphorylation of RecQL4 N terminus was required for interaction with and origin recruitment of And-1 and GINS. In addition, forced activation of replication origins by RecQL4 tethering resulted in increased replication stress and the accumulation of ssDNAs, which can be recovered by transcription inhibition. Collectively, these results suggest that recruitment of RecQL4 to replication origins is an important step for temporal activation of replication origins during S phase. Further, perturbation of replication timing control by unscheduled origin activation significantly induces replication stress, which is mostly caused by transcription-replication conflicts. Sequential activation of DNA replication origins is precisely programmed and critical to maintaining genome stability. RecQL4, a member of the conserved RecQ family of helicases, plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication in mammalian cells. Here, we showed that RecQL4 protein tethered on the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) induces early activation of late replicating origins during S phase.

This year’s Lasker Basic Medical Research Award honors Max Cooper and Jacques Miller for discoveries that revealed the organizing principles of adaptive immunity. Their collective contributions have had broad clinical impact in the treatment of immune disease. That the adaptive immune system is composed of two principal arms that defend the body from infections and cancer has been such dogma in the field of immunology for almost 50 years that it’s easy to take for granted how we came to know this as fact. Indeed, this conceptual understanding is so engrained that it transcends the specialized field of immunology to a broader societal awareness. B and T cells have become part of our popular cultural lexicon about human physiology and are often discussed in mass media in relation to public health problems such as cancer, infectious disease, autoimmunity, vaccines, and cancer therapy. It is often taught at the level of high school biology classes that there is a division of labor between B lymphocytes that mediate humoral immunity against circulating pathogens such as viruses and toxins and T lymphocytes that mediate cellular immunity against intracellular pathogens such as bacteria and fungi, virus-infected cells, and cancers and also in the rejection of transplanted tissue. The diversity inherent in each class of immune cell, now known to be due to somatically recombined antigen receptors, and antibodies, expressed by T and B cells, respectively, enables both branches to “adapt” to challenge by virtually any antigenic determinant. This is in contrast to our “innate” immune system which uses hard-wired pattern-recognition receptors that do not genetically adapt to the insult to engage infections in a first line of defense. Max Cooper and Jacques Miller defined our contemporary understanding of the duality of adaptive immunity (Figure 1): its anatomical origins, how two separate lineages develop, how T and B cells collaborate for effective immune responses, how they contribute to host defense, how they communicate in initiating and regulating immune responses, and how defects in their development give rise to specific forms of immunodeficiency and cancers. The implications for global human health, and society as a whole, have been profound and far reaching. However, as with nearly all foundational discoveries, the path to this understanding was illuminated by clues laid by their scientific predecessors. One of the earliest hints about the bipartite nature of adaptive immunity was made by Merrill Chase, who was working with Karl Landsteiner (who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930 for the discovery of human blood groups) at the Rockefeller Institute in the early 1940s. Chase observed that different kinds of immune reactivity could be transferred from one animal to another by either serum alone, containing antibodies, but no cells, or the small lymphocyte-containing “sticky exudate” fraction of the blood. At the time, it was thought that antibodies, or other chemical substances in the bloodstream, were the principal mediators of immunity. However, Chase showed that passive transfer of white blood cells could sensitize an animal to the original sensitizing chemical even in the absence of detectable antibody production in a process called contact allergy or delayed-type hypersensitivity. This was a landmark discovery of a new class of immune response termed “cell-mediated immunity”; however, it remained controversial whether or not this was truly an antibody-independent process (Chase, 1985Chase M.W. Immunology and experimental dermatology.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1985; 3: 1-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chase’s observations did not postulate a division of labor between cellular and humoral immunity and left unresolved the question of where antibodies came from, the relation between antibodies and white blood cells, and how animals specifically developed and adapted their immune responses to different kinds of pathogens. Another important foundation for Cooper and Miller’s work was clonal selection theory in the mid-1950s, originally advanced by Frank Burnet at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) of Medical Research in Melbourne and David Talmage at the University of Chicago and later experimentally proven by Gus Nossal and Josh Lederberg, also at the WEHI (Nossal and Lederberg, 1958Nossal G.J.V. Lederberg J. Antibody production by single cells.Nature. 1958; 181: 1419-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this model, it was hypothesized that each type of lymphocyte was clonally unique yet existed within a highly diverse pool of lymphocytes with enough reactivity bandwidth to bind to most foreign antigens, and engagement of an antigen triggers proliferation of that cell to manifest as an immune response and an immunological memory. Burnet then went on to work with Peter Medawar to refine this idea and develop concepts about how our immune system avoids reacting with the host through an early selection process called self-tolerance, for which Burnet and Medawar were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1960 (Science, 1960Science Burnet and Medawar Share Nobel Award in Physiology and Medicine.Science. 1960; 132: 1300-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yet while these discoveries established some basic conceptual frameworks for immunology, they fell short of a clear understanding of the anatomical origins of the cells and the cellular mechanisms that orchestrate the immune response. As a pediatrician, Max Cooper hypothesized that differences in the clinical manifestations among patients suffering from primary immunodeficiencies were due to functionally different cell lineages in the adaptive immune system, so he set out to explore this question in the laboratory. For example, patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia controlled viral infections, so their cell-mediated immunity was intact, but they could not make antibodies, whereas patients with the X-linked disorder Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) developed herpes infections but still could make antibodies. These paradoxical findings were difficult to rationalize in the context of a single-immune-cell lineage model. Cooper worked with Robert A. Good at Minnesota, building on earlier findings from Bruce Glick that removal of the hindgut lymphoid organ called bursa of Fabricius from chickens impaired antibody production in chickens (Glick et al., 1956Glick B. Chang T.S. Jaap R.G. The Bursa of Fabricius and Antibody Production.Poult. Sci. 1956; 35: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar). However, the problem with these experiments was that some residual cells had exited the bursa prior to removal, making these experiments, as well as contemporaneous experiments by Jacques Miller on thymus removal, difficult to reproduce and interpret. A technical improvement was needed to completely eliminate lymphocytes produced during embryonic life before bursal or thymic removal. Cooper made a key technical insight that was game changing: he irradiated the chicks soon after removing the organs in order to completely eliminate any immune cells that the chick’s thymus or bursa made before hatching. The results were then extremely clear and definitive (Cooper et al., 1965Cooper M.D. Peterson R.D. Good R.A. Delineation of the Thymic and Bursal Lymphoid Systems in the Chicken.Nature. 1965; 205: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, Cooper et al., 1966Cooper M.D. Raymond D.A. Peterson R.D. South M.A. Good R.A. The functions of the thymus system and the bursa system in the chicken.J. Exp. Med. 1966; 123: 75-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar): the irradiated chickens with no bursa did not have plasma cells or produce antibodies when injected with foreign proteins, yet they had many lymphocytes. Conversely, the thymectomized and irradiated chickens were deficient in “small” lymphocytes yet retained the ability to produce antibodies. Irradiated animals that were both thymectomized and bursectomized had combined cellular and humoral immune deficits. Follow-up studies indicated that the thymus was essential for development of the small lymphocytes, later called T cells, that mediate allograft rejection, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and graft-versus-host reactions, all of which are mediated by cellular immunity, while the bursa-derived large cells, later called B cells, were required for antibody responses. The discovery of the separate thymic and bursal systems was more or less concurrent with Jacques Miller (Miller, 1961aMiller J.F. Analysis of the thymus influence in leukaemogenesis.Nature. 1961; 191: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for the thymus in mice (with contributions from others). This two-lymphocyte model helped to explain Cooper’s original clinical observations that either cellular or humoral immunity can be defective while leaving the other system functional. Cooper made another major finding in discovering antibody “class switching” with University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) graduate student Paul Kincade (Kincade et al., 1970Kincade P.W. Lawton A.R. Bockman D.E. Cooper M.D. Suppression of immunoglobulin G synthesis as a result of antibody-mediated suppression of immunoglobulin M synthesis in chickens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1970; 67: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). During an antibody response, the constant region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain changes, but the variable regions, and therefore antigenic specificity, stay the same. Cooper found in chicken B cells that IgM was expressed first, followed by switch to IgG. This seminal discovery was followed by a series of classic papers on other isotypes, including IgA, which was similarly shown to be dependent on IgM precursor cells, but not on IgG-producing cells. This finding is another pillar of adaptive immunity and highlights the essential plasticity of the immune response. Cooper also made seminal contributions to understanding the ontogeny and stages of B cell development by identifying the equivalent organ to the bursa in mammals. He worked with Martin Raff and John Owen at University College London to identify the bone marrow and fetal liver as the origins of B cells and the precursors of B cells (Owen et al., 1974Owen J.J. Cooper M.D. Raff M.C. In vitro generation of B lymphocytes in mouse foetal liver, a mammalian ‘bursa equivalent’.Nature. 1974; 249: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); these findings were contemporaneous with those of Gustav Nossal at the WEHI and Pierre Vassili at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, who were able to generate B cells from mouse bone marrow. After refining models of normal B cell development in humans, Cooper used this information to describe the different stages at which B cell differentiation was aborted in patients with antibody deficiencies and lymphoid malignancies. For example, that X-linked agammaglobulinemia and related B cell disorders are manifestations of arrests at distinct stages of B cell ontogeny. This understanding of the divergent lymphocyte lineages started to change the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas, as the cells of origin of these tumors can now be used to classify the cancers and to tailor therapies. This work has also established principles for grafting hematopoietic tissues that helped set the stage for the bone-marrow and stem-cell transplants that are now in routine clinical use. In an amazing capstone to his career, Cooper became interested in the evolution of the adaptive immune system (which is characteristic of all vertebrates) and began to look in jawless vertebrates (agnathans) like the sea lamprey and hagfish, that are able to resist infection yet show no evidence of antibody production or MHC recognition. In a spectacular series of papers, Cooper found that jawless vertebrates use variable lymphocyte receptors (VLR) comprised of leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) segments as structurally distinct counterparts to the immunoglobulin-based receptors that jawed vertebrates use for antigen recognition (Pancer et al., 2004Pancer Z. Amemiya C.T. Ehrhardt G.R. Ceitlin J. Gartland G.L. Cooper M.D. Somatic diversification of variable lymphocyte receptors in the agnathan sea lamprey.Nature. 2004; 430: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2009Guo P. Hirano M. Herrin B.R. Li J. Yu C. Sadlonova A. Cooper M.D. Dual nature of the adaptive immune system in lampreys.Nature. 2009; 459: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Highly diverse VLR genes are somatically assembled by the insertion of variable LRR sequences into incomplete germline VLRA and VLRB genes with further diversification involving cytosine deaminases. In sea lampreys, VLRA and VLRB receptors are expressed by separate lymphocyte populations that are the functionally equivalents of T-like and B-like cells. The broad impact of these studies is the demonstration that the division of function and organ of origin of the adaptive immune system pre-date the choice of molecules that can serve as antigen receptors. While Cooper’s work has been more B cell focused, Jacques Miller has had an equally profound impact on the field of immunology and essentially founded the field of T cell biology. Miller is among a long list of great Australian immunologists who made seminal discoveries at the WEHI (and other Australian institutions), establishing a tradition of excellence in Australian immunology that persists to this day and that has been acknowledged by many previous prizes and awards. Miller has the distinction of being the only living scientist to have discovered the function of a human organ, the thymus, as the origin of T cells. The thymus atrophies later in life and was thought to be a non-essential vestigial organ; in fact, it was routinely discarded during some forms of cardiothoracic surgery. As a graduate student, Miller became interested in immunology based on a curiosity about the origins of virus-induced leukemia in mice. He noticed that leukemias in mice started in the thymus and then spread to peripheral organs, so he wanted to see if removal of the thymus prevented leukemia. Miller developed the surgical skill to carry out a neonatal thymectomy, which no one else could do, and discovered that animals subjected to thymic ablation at birth did not develop a virus-induced leukemia and that transplanting the virus-infected thymus back into the mouse initiated the leukemia. Importantly, the mice without a thymus were also deficient in the small lymphocytes (T cells), were unable to make antibodies (Miller, 1961bMiller J.F. Immunological function of the thymus.Lancet. 1961; 2: 748-749Abstract PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), were unable to reject transplanted foreign tissues (i.e., thymus derived cells were required graft rejection), and after several months, succumbed to many types of infections through a wasting syndrome (Miller, 1961aMiller J.F. Analysis of the thymus influence in leukaemogenesis.Nature. 1961; 191: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Remarkably, these were single-author papers where Miller did the experiments himself, without the use of modern technologies such as flow cytometry (FACS) or knowledge of surface antigens to track cells in the blood. Miller hypothesized that the thymus was the source of cells, not hormones (as many thought), mediating cellular immunity, which was controversial, because many thought that the spleen and lymph nodes were the source of such cells. Transplanting a thymus back into these mice restored immunity by export of thymus-derived cells that seeded peripheral lymphoid tissues, which he found using chromosomal markers in the transplanted cells. Broad acceptance of Miller’s findings was hampered at the time, even though Miller was ultimately correct, because very few other labs could successfully execute the surgical technique and therefore had trouble to reproducing his findings, and also, the thymus was already producing immune cells before he removed it. Miller later began to use irradiation, as well as complete thymic ablation, which allowed other labs to reproduce his experiments. Later, in the 1970s, the advent of the “nude” mouse by other groups, in which a genetic mutation results in essentially athymic mice, further confirmed Miller’s conclusions by independent means. Nevertheless, the techniques that Miller developed to carry out his experiments, including thymectomy, lymphocyte reconstitution, and bone-marrow chimeras, are standard tools of immunology to this day and are essentially the concepts behind bone-marrow transplants carried out in the clinic. From the original thymic ablation studies, Miller made another profound observation. He found that even MHC-mismatched thymic grafts restored immunity but were also tolerant of skin from mismatched donors, which was the first demonstration that the thymus carried out a selection step to ensure self-tolerance (Miller, 1962Miller J.F. Effect of neonatal thymectomy on the immunological responsiveness of the mouse.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1962; 156: 415-428Crossref Google Scholar). Miller suggested, correctly, that lymphocytes generated in the thymus were specially selected to be tolerant to self-antigens, and that self-reactive lymphocytes were eliminated in the thymus. This was the origin of our now fundamental concepts about how immune tolerance is established. Following up on experiments previously performed in birds by Cooper and colleagues, Miller and his colleagues demonstrated that mouse lymphocytes can be separated into two developmentally and functionally distinct lineages that were later called T and B lymphocytes, and that T lymphocytes are produced by the thymus and B lymphocytes in the bone marrow (Miller and Mitchell, 1968Miller J.F. Mitchell G.F. Cell to cell interaction in the immune response. I. Hemolysin-forming cells in neonatally thymectomized mice reconstituted with thymus or thoracic duct lymphocytes.J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128: 801-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Miller also observed that complete immune reconstitution, including antibody production, required a thymus (which was important to the subsequent successful medical development of allogeneic bone transplantation). With his student Graham Mitchell at the WEHI, Miller showed that thymus-derived lymphocytes were not actually making Abs yet were necessary for it (Mitchell and Miller, 1968Mitchell G.F. Miller J.F. Immunological activity of thymus and thoracic-duct lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1968; 59: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Miller conclusively showed that bone marrow-derived cells were responsible for Ab production, but the thymus-derived cells were absolutely essential in order to allow the bone marrow-derived cells to make antibodies, so there must be an interaction between thymus derived cells and bone marrow-derived cells (Miller and Mitchell, 1967Miller J.F. Mitchell G.F. The thymus and the precursors of antigen reactive cells.Nature. 1967; 216: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results really began to shape our understanding of the interactions of immune cells and the concepts of immune regulation to “help” or suppress immune response in an antigen-specific manner. Collectively, Miller established the main tenets of T cell biology: that the thymus not only is a source of T cells, but also is the place where undifferentiated stem cells are “educated” for self-tolerance and acquire immunocompetence through interaction with thymic epithelial cells; that T cells mediate allograft rejection, and inhibiting T cells is therapeutically useful in transplantation; that T and B lymphocytes are different lineages of cells that achieve their fate by developing in different organs; and, finally, that effective immunity is derived from both a division of labor and collaboration between T and B cells. Jacques Miller essentially founded the field of T cell biology; there are now at least six or seven different known T cell subsets, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th1/Th2, Th17, and others. Clinically, Miller’s work set the stage for our understanding of autoimmunity and tolerance, as well as recent development of T cell-based immunotherapies–particularly adoptive cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The legacy of Cooper and Miller’s discoveries have reverberated through both basic and translational immunology for over 50 years. Cooper and colleagues’ discoveries about B cell biology led to the invention of hybridomas (Kohler and Milstein, Nobel Prize 1984), as well as understanding how antibody clonal diversity is generated (Tonegawa, Nobel Prize 1976). Miller’s work set the stage for subsequent discoveries on MHC restriction (Baruj Benaceraff, Nobel Prize 1980; Rolf Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty, Nobel Prize 1996), the isolation and cloning of T cell receptors (Mark Davis, Tak Mak, John Kappler, Pippa Marrack, and others), antigen presentation (Emil Unanue, Jack Strominger, and Don Wiley, Lasker Basic Medical Research Award 1995), and immune regulation (Ralph Steinman, Lasker Basic Medical Research Award 1995, Nobel Prize 2011). Cooper and Miller’s discoveries fueled rapid advancements in both basic and applied sciences, creating ripple effects socially and economically. These recent accomplishments would not have been possible without the ceaseless efforts in basic immunology and translational research that catalyzed by the pioneering discoveries made by Cooper and Miller, for which they richly deserve the 2019 Lasker Award for Basic Biomedical Research.

Adequate assay and laboratory performance are required to ensure accurate incidence estimates. The NIAID-supported External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) established a proficiency testing program for the most widely-used incidence assay, the HIV-1 Limiting Antigen Avidity EIA (LAg), with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved kits manufactured by Sedia Biosciences Corporation and Maxim Biomedical. The objective of this program is to monitor the performance of participating laboratories. Four rounds of blinded external proficiency (EP) panels were distributed to up to twenty testing sites (7 North American, 5 African, 4 Asian, 2 South American and 2 European). These panels consisted of ten plasma samples: three blinded well-characterized HIV-1-seropositive samples that were included as replicates and an HIV-negative control. The seropositive samples spanned the dynamic range of the assay and are categorized as either recent or long-term infection. Participating sites performed the assay according to manufacturers’ instructions and completed an online survey to gather information on kit manufacturer, lot of kit used, laboratory procedures and the experience of technicians. On average, fifteen sites participated in each round of testing, with an average of four sites testing with only the Maxim assay, seven testing with only the Sedia assay and five sites utilizing both assays. Overall, the Sedia and Maxim assays yielded similar infection status categorization across the laboratories; however, for most of the nine HIV+ samples tested, there were significant differences in the optical density readouts, ODn (N = 8) and OD (N = 7), between LAg kit manufacturers (p < 0.05 based on mixed effects models. The EQAPOL LAg program is important for monitoring laboratory performance as well as detecting variations between manufacturers of HIV-1incidence assays."

Here, using EM and light-scattering assays, we studied the biochemical and assembly properties of SyFtsZ, the FtsZ protein from the cyanobacterial strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. SyFtsZ had a slow GTPase activity of ∼0.4 GTP/FtsZ molecule/min and assembled into thick, straight protofilament bundles and curved bundles, designated toroids. The assembly of SyFtsZ in the presence of GTP occurred in two stages. The first stage consisted of the assembly of single-stranded straight protofilaments and opened circles; in the second stage, the protofilaments associated into straight protofilament bundles and toroids. In addition to these assemblies, we also observed highly curved oligomers and minirings after GTP hydrolysis or in the presence of excess GDP. The three types of protofilaments of SyFtsZ observed here provide support for the hypothesis that a constriction force due to curved protofilaments bends the membrane.

The aim of this study was to determine the spatial distribution of breast cancer in Sudan.A facility based cross-sectional study was implemented in eighteen histopathology laboratories distributed in the three localities of Khartoum State on a sample of 4630 Breast Cancer cases diagnosed during the period 2010-2016. A master database was developed through Epi InfoTM 7.1.5.2 for computerizing the data collected: the facility name, type (public or private), and its geo-location (latitude and longitude). Personal data on patients were extracted from their respective medical records (name, age, marital status, ethnic group, state, locality, administrative unit, permanent address and phone number, histopathology diagnosis). The data was summarized through SPSS to generate frequency tables for estimating prevalence and the geographical information system (ArcGIS 10.3) was used to generate the epidemiological distribution maps. ArcGIS 10.3 spatial analysis features were used to develop risk maps based on the kriging method.Breast cancer prevalence was 3.9 cases per 100,000 female populations. Of the 4423 cases of breast cancer, invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (NST) was the most frequent (79.5%, 3517/4423) histopathological diagnosis. The spatial analysis indicated as high risk areas for breast cancer in Sudan the States of Nile River, Northern, Red Sea, White Nile, Northern and Southern Kordofan.The attempt to develop a predictive map of breast cancer in Sudan revealed three levels of risk areas (risk, intermediate and high risk areas); regardless the risk level, appropriate preventive and curative health interventions with full support from decision makers are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2974126960,"Background Primaquine is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for radical treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria. This drug is known to provoke acute hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Due to lack of data on G6PD deficiency, the use of primaquine has been limited in Africa. In the present study, G6PD deficiency was investigated in blood donors of various ethnic groups living in Nouakchott, a P. vivax endemic area in Mauritania. Methodology/Principal findings Venous blood samples from 443 healthy blood donors recruited at the National Transfusion Center in Nouakchott were screened for G6PD activity using the CareStart G6PD deficiency rapid diagnostic test. G6PD allelic variants were investigated using DiaPlexC G6PD genotyping kit that detects African (A-) and Mediterranean (B-) variants. Overall, 50 of 443 (11.3%) individuals (49 [11.8%] men and 1 [3.7%] woman) were phenotypically deficient. Amongst men, Black Africans had the highest prevalence of G6PD deficiency (15 of 100 [15%]) and White Moors the lowest (10 of 168, [5.9%]). The most commonly observed G6PD allelic variants among 44 tested G6PD-deficient men were the African variant A- (202A/376G) in 14 (31.8%), the Mediterranean variant B- (563T) in 13 (29.5%), and the Betica-Selma A- (376G/968C) allelic variant in 6 (13.6%). The Santamaria A- variant (376G/542T) and A variant (376G) were observed in only one and two individuals, respectively. None of the expected variants was observed in 8 (18.2%) of the tested phenotypically G6PD-deficient men. Conclusion This is the first published data on G6PD deficiency in Mauritanians. The prevalence of phenotypic G6PD deficiency was relatively high (11.3%). It was mostly associated with either African or Mediterranean variants, in agreement with diverse Arab and Black African origins of the Mauritanian population."
https://openalex.org/W2974766070,"While most of the existing class stability assessors just rely on structural information retrieved from a desired source code snapshot. However, class stability is intrinsically characterized by the evolution of a number of dependencies and change propagation factors which aid to promote the ripple effect. Identification of classes prone to ripple effect (instable classes) through mining the version history of change propagation factors can aid developers to reduce the efforts needed to maintain and evolve the system. We propose Historical Information for Class Stability Prediction (HICSP), an approach to exploit change history information to predict the instable classes based on its correlation with change propagation factors. Subsequently, we performed two empirical studies. In the first study, we evaluate the HICSP on the version history of 10 open source projects. Subsequently, in the second replicated study, we evaluate the effectiveness of HICSP by tuning the parameters of its stability assessors. We observed the 4 to 16 percent improvement in term of F-measure value to predict the instable classes through HICSP as compared to existing class stability assessors.

The goal of this study was to investigate reward delay impulsivity in children with LOC-E, ADHD, or a double diagnosis, in contrast to healthy children. Children (8 to 13 years) with LOC-E (n = 24), ADHD (n = 33), a double diagnosis (n = 9), and healthy children (n = 34) performed a computer game (door opening task [DOT]) and the delay of gratification task (DoGT) to assess food related facets of reward delay impulsivity. In addition, children reported whether they worried to lose control over eating during the DoGT. There were no group differences in the DOT. However, children with ADHD or a double diagnosis had a significantly higher risk to eat prematurely during the DoGT than children with LOC-E, who were not significantly different from healthy children. Children with a double diagnosis were most likely to worry about losing control over eating during the DoGT, followed by children with LOC-E, and both had a significantly higher probability to worry than healthy children. For children with a double diagnosis the probability to worry was significantly higher than for children with ADHD. If replicated, these findings point to a special relevance of reward delay impulsivity in children with ADHD or a double diagnosis, compared to children with LOC-E. ADHD should be regularly assessed in children with LOC-E."

Four of the seven named dog allergens are lipocalins: Can f 1, Can f 2, Can f 4, and Can f 6. We present the structure of Can f 6 along with data on the biophysical and biological activity of this protein in comparison with other animal lipocalins. The Can f 6 structure displays the classic lipocalin calyx-shaped ligand binding cavity within a central β-barrel similar to other lipocalins. Despite low sequence identity between the different dog lipocalin proteins, there is a high degree of structural similarity. On the other hand, Can f 6 has a similar primary sequence to cat, horse, mouse lipocalins as well as a structure that may underlie their cross reactivity. Interestingly, the entrance to the ligand binding pocket is capped by a His instead of the usually seen Tyr that may help select its natural ligand binding partner. Our highly pure recombinant Can f 6 is able to bind to human IgE (hIgE) demonstrating biological antigenicity."

https://openalex.org/W2974320953,"Background In Peru, there is an ongoing high-incidence HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW). Sexual concurrency, or having sex with a partner in between two acts of sex with another partner, may be a key factor in onward HIV transmission. In this study, we quantify concurrency, evaluate factors associated with concurrency, and assess condom use with concurrent partners among MSM and TW in Peru. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the 2011 Peruvian Biobehavioral Survey. Pearson’s Chi-squared test was used to identify individual-level characteristics associated with concurrency. We estimated the association between participant characteristics, concurrent partnerships, partnership type (stable vs. non-stable), and CLAI within the context of concurrent partnerships using multivariate and repeated-measure Poisson regression. Results 3-month cumulative prevalence of concurrency was higher among TW compared to MSM (30.7% vs 25.2%, p = 0.014). Among those with concurrent stable and non-stable partners, 45% used condoms with both partners (95% CI: 40%-50%) and 30% preferentially had CLAI with the stable partner only (95%CI: 26%-35%). Factors associated with CLAI within the context of concurrent partnerships varied between MSM and TW. Conclusions Although concurrency is common among TW and MSM in Peru, patterns of concurrency and differential condom use may vary between TW and MSM. Future research may explore differential condom use with stable and non-stable partners to better understand behavioral factors that may alter vulnerability to HIV in TW compared to MSM."

Perhaps equally staggering is the fact that as many as 2 million women worldwide have now been treated with Herceptin (trastuzumab), many of whom benefited from the treatment. This accomplishment is wonderfully rewarding for everyone who has been involved. Receiving the Lasker award for Clinical Medical Research is a staggering event. Perhaps equally staggering is the fact that as many as 2 million women worldwide have now been treated with Herceptin (trastuzumab), many of whom benefited from the treatment. This accomplishment is wonderfully rewarding for everyone who has been involved. There is a particular event that started us down this road. In about 1984, I learned that brain cancer is often treated by local surgery and then administration of a drug ironically called BCNU (bis-chloroethylnitrosourea) to the disease site. This drug can increase survival time, but quality of life is not good. There are many papers describing the mechanism of action of this drug (e.g., alkylating agent), but all it really does is dissolve tissue. At that time, I was just setting up my new lab at Genentech, and we believed we could do a lot better. Our goal became to find cancer targets that were particularly important and specific to cancer cells but irrelevant to normal cells. This, of course, is a recapitulation of Paul Ehrlich’s efforts of about 120 years ago. Ehrlich proposed the “magic bullet” concept. His hypothesis, later borne out by his discovery of the first effective anti-syphilis drug (salvarsan), was that it should be possible to kill specific microbes (such as bacteria) without harming the body itself. The magic bullet concept has been extended to include cancer, partly because Ehrlich learned that certain dyes could stain one type of cell differently than another type of cell. Ehrlich also formulated the first structural concept of an antibody, another topic that is obviously linked to our breakthrough with trastuzumab. He shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Élie Metchnikoff, whose discovery of macrophages contributed to the beginnings of cellular immunology. Metchnikoff’s discovery also figures importantly in our work with the TNF part of the trastuzumab story, as I will describe below. Our lab began by looking for some handle on an early event that distinguished tumor cells from normal cells. We were focusing on the mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF, as it relates to cancer, was discovered by Lloyd Old at Sloan Kettering as a tumor cytotoxin in the sera of mice that had been treated with endotoxin. When the “toxic serum” was injected into mice with the MethA sarcoma, Old observed dramatic tumor hemorrhagic necrotizing effects, thus the name “TNF.” There were not a lot of other tumor types that could be tested by Old at that time, so most of his data related only to MethA sarcoma. Old's TNF proved elusive to purify and was not characterized until its molecular cloning by David Goeddel’s laboratory in 1984. Using this newly available reagent, Barry Sugarman, who was a postdoctoral fellow in my laboratory, characterized its effects on the proliferation of normal and tumor cell lines. Surprisingly, about two-thirds of tumor cell lines were already resistant to growth inhibition by TNF. Thus, TNF resistance was a common characteristic shared by many tumor cell lines and, therefore, might be an early property of aggressive tumors. This was substantiated by results obtained in collaboration with Hans Schreiber at the University of Chicago. In these experiments, we showed that a major mechanism through which macrophages attack early-stage tumors is through secretion of TNF. For these experiments, we used an ultraviolet-induced tumor cell line called UV-1591. Normally, UV-1591 will grow subcutaneously and then regress (Figure 1, blue box). Residual tumor cells will often then begin a second round of tumor growth, which is very rapidly progressive, until T cell immunity induces a second regression (Figure 1, blue circle). Remarkably, the difference between the regressing tumors (UV-1591-RE) and the rapidly progressing ones (UV-1591-PRO) is that, when tested in vitro, UV-1591-RE cells are sensitive to macrophage killing, while the UV-1591-PRO cells are resistant to macrophage killing. Thus, at least in this model system, TNF resistance is an early marker of a more aggressive tumor type. In nude mice that lack both active macrophages and T cells, both UV-1591-RE and -PRO grow rapidly (Figure 1, right). Further experiments showed that macrophage sensitivity or resistance in UV-1591 correlated with TNF sensitivity or resistance. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that tumor cells must get past the macrophage/TNF hurdle before they can progress further. Another surprising observation that we made at this time, in work spearheaded by Gail Lewis Phillips and Barry Sugarman, was that once TNF-sensitive tumor cells are selected for resistance to the cytokine, they are subsequently growth stimulated by it! This is an extraordinary example of the ways in which a tumor cell can adapt to its microenvironment, change its signaling pattern, and continue to benefit from host-supplied factors, even though those same factors had at one time held them in check. When we started this work in 1985, not much was known about the biology of TNF and its receptors. Trying to understand what might make sensitive cells resistant to TNF’s cytotoxic effects required some thought. We reasoned that autocrine or paracrine production of growth factors by the tumor cells themselves might be involved, since this was already a known phenomenon, first articulated by Sporn and Todaro. Following up on his earlier work, Barry Sugarman tested this hypothesis on TNF-sensitive tumor cells and found that adding growth factors that stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the cell-culture media could give 95% inhibition of TNF killing of otherwise TNF-sensitive tumor cells (Figure 2A ; Sugarman et al., 1987Sugarman B.J. Lewis G.D. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Shepard H.M. Effects of growth factors on the antiproliferative activity of tumor necrosis factors.Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 780-786PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggested that one mechanism of resistance to TNF is likely through the presence of growth factors and the tumor-cell-associated RTKs activated by them. Two other events were about to happen that would give us a possible path to create a therapy for cancer that would preferentially target tumors. The first thing to happen was when a postdoctoral fellow in Axel Ullrich’s laboratory, Robert Hudziak, heard me give a talk about our current work on TNF resistance. Late that night, Robert came to talk to me. Hudziak said he was very excited to hear our TNF story and our hypothesis that resistance to TNF might be mediated by RTKs. He went further to tell me that he had a receptor tyrosine kinase that we should use as a model system, which was HER2 (cloned in 1985 by Axel Ullrich’s group). We immediately began collaborating to test whether HER2 overexpression could blunt the cytotoxic effects of TNF. We utilized a set of cell lines, starting with TNF-sensitive 3T3 cells, that were engineered to express increasing amounts of HER2. We found that increasing HER2-associated tyrosine kinase activity correlated with increased resistance to both TNF and activated macrophages (Figure 2B). This was not just due to the transformed phenotype, because transformation of 3T3 cells by the RAS oncogene had no effect on their sensitivity to TNF. Later, it was also found by Hudziak that spontaneously transformed 3T3 cells overexpressed the c-met protooncogene and that they also have accompanying increased resistance to TNF, and similarly, selection of 3T3 cells with TNF resulted in transformed 3T3 cells with amplified c-met. These experiments suggested that HER2 may not be a special case. The next important event was a meeting at Genentech with Dennis Slamon, who, in collaboration with Axel Ullrich and William McGuire (University of Texas, San Antonio), had found that overexpression of HER2 predicted shortened survival for breast and ovarian cancer patients. With this knowledge, and with our work relating to TNF in hand, we thought that perhaps we knew why overexpression of HER2 resulted in worsened outcomes, that is, by blunting host antitumor surveillance by macrophages. The last important proof that we sought was whether the TNF resistance observed with HER2 overexpression could be modulated by an antibody antagonist of HER2. A large family of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies had been made by Hudziak and Bryan Fendly. In my lab, Gail Lewis Phillips, in a colossal effort, ranked the antibodies for their ability to inhibit the growth of tumor cells expressing escalating amounts of HER2. Importantly, she found that an exponential curve best fit the ability of the antibodies to inhibit growth of tumor cells. In practical terms, this meant that cells that expressed low amounts of HER2 (like most normal cells) were not growth inhibited by the antibody, but with 30-fold increased HER2 expression, tumor cells became sensitive to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the ability of the antibodies to induce TNF sensitivity was similarly dependent upon overexpression of HER2. Thus, the idea of biomarker (HER2 overexpression)-driven therapy for breast cancers was born. The antibody that most reproducibly inhibited the growth of HER2-overexpressing cells was called MuMAb4D5 (murine monoclonal antibody 4D5). It was this antibody we chose for most of our experimental work going forward. Probably the most important experiment we could do at this point in the project was to test whether incubation of 4D5 with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells could induce a cytotoxic response to TNF. This experiment was performed using SK-BR-3 tumor cells, which overexpress HER2. We found that these tumor cells were growth inhibited by either 4D5 or TNF alone. However, when they were combined, we observed cell killing. Thus, we knew that not only could HER2 induce resistance to TNF but also that downregulation of HER2 could induce TNF sensitivity. There were, however, still substantial scientific hurdles to overcome. The most difficult theoretical hurdle was the feeling at the time that monoclonal antibodies could not gain access to tumors as a result of high tumor interstitial pressure and the net outflow of fluid from within tumors. This was a serious objection, supported by the work of Rakesh Jain at MIT. Thus, it made sense to test whether an antibody administered to a patient could find its way to a HER2-overexpressing tumor and accumulate at that site. In an amazing experiment, that makes me dizzy even now, Genentech invested about $3 million into an effort to test this hypothesis. We made clinical-grade MuMAb4D5, filed an Investigational New Drug application, and proceeded with the antibody to UCLA. At UCLA, in the basement, Dan Maneval radiolabeled the antibody. Dennis Slamon then injected the antibody into the first patients, who had HER2-overexpressing tumors. Autoradiograms were made of the patients at several time points, and we found that the antibody made it to the tumor sites (correlated with known tumor locations) and accumulated there. Of course, the second big issue was whether MuMAb4D5 instigated an immune response to itself, an event that would make repeated treatments difficult. Indeed, we found that MuMAb4D5 was immunogenic, and this problem went unresolved at the Christmas break in 1990–1991. It now seemed to us, a team of highly charged partisans (“HERetics,” see Figure 3), that we had just one more hurdle to overcome: the issue of immunogenicity of the antibody. This was attacked with vigor in an all-consuming effort. In just 6 weeks, the murine antibody was cloned and sequenced, and Paul Carter made a set of humanized 4D5 variants using a technique he named “six pack mutagenesis,” which enabled both heavy and light chains to be humanized simultaneously. Nothing like this had ever been done before. Another thing that had never been done before was to express antibodies in a standard cell line like Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Undeterred by this, Cori Gorman took Carter’s clones, put them into a mammalian expression vector, and proceeded to make humanized 4D5 (rHuMAb4D5) in culture. Gail Lewis Phillips was on hand to show that one of Carter’s variants was even a little better than its murine parent at inhibiting the growth of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, and Refaat Shalaby showed that rHuMAb4D5 was competent for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, but only on HER2-overexpressing tumor cells. This antibody ultimately became known as trastuzumab, or Herceptin. Faced with this fait acompli, our colleagues in management felt it was worth nominating the project for a full-fledged clinical effort. This is a very short description of the early days of trastuzumab. There were many administrative and business hurdles that needed to be overcome as well as the scientific hurdles I have mentioned. Trastuzumab was the first approved fully humanized monoclonal antibody, first approved inhibitor of a tyrosine kinase, first drug for cancer to be approved based upon biomarker-driven clinical trials (work largely guided by Bob Cohen at Genentech), and first antibody approved for the treatment of solid tumors. There were other biomarker-driven projects in the pipeline of pharma companies at this time, especially imatinib (Gleevec), championed by Brian Druker. Following the approval of trastuzumab, several of these drugs moved forward rapidly. Despite the novelty of trastuzumab, it was approved only 6 years after the first patient was treated, which is fast by any measure of recent drug development efforts in cancer. The most important lessons to be learned from the trastuzumab story are the tremendous value of dedicated teams of visionary researchers determined to make a difference in the world and the value of collaborations between scientists in all kinds of private and public institutions. As an outline of how this worked in the case of Herceptin, the story includes people like Robert Weinberg at MIT, who discovered that RTKs could be oncogenes; Axel Ullrich at Genentech, who shares this Lasker Award; Arthur Levinson, another Genentech scientist who shared reagents with Axel that enabled the cloning of HER2; David Goeddel, who led the Genentech team to clone and express human TNF; Bob Cohen, who developed the original companion diagnostic at Genentech; and Dennis Slamon and Mark Pegram of UCLA and Larry Norton at Sloan Kettering, the first clinical champions, as well as the many other clinicians and patients who took part in the clinical trials. Finally, I should mention the leadership of Robert Swanson, who co-founded Genentech with Herb Boyer. Many times Robert Swanson told me, as he told all the scientists at Genentech, that we should “follow our noses.” Without this kind of support for research aimed at improving human health, the trastuzumab project could never have happened. This was an incredible experience, and I was very lucky to have had a hand in it."

https://openalex.org/W2974030965,"Oil impacting the northern Gulf of Mexico shoreline from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident was predominantly in the form of water-in-oil emulsions (WOE), a chemically weathered, highly viscous, neutrally buoyant material. Once formed, WOE are extremely difficult to destabilize. Commercially-available oil dispersants are largely ineffective de-emulsifiers as a result of the inability of dispersant surfactants to displace asphaltenes stabilizing the oil-water interface. This study investigated the effectiveness of the commercially-available dispersant Corexit 9500A, modified to enhance its polar fraction, in destabilizing WOE. Results suggest that Corexit modified to include between 20–60% fractional amount of either polar additive (1-octanol or hexylamine) will produce a modest increase in WOE instability, with a Corexit to hexylamine ratio of approximately 80/20 providing the most effective enhanced destabilization. Results support the hypothesis that modifying the fraction of polar constituents in commercial dispersants will increase asphaltene solubility, decrease oil-water interface stability, and enhance WOE instability."

Yet, they may use other medications to treat non-HIV diseases. Scarce data are available regarding the use of non-HIV medications in Africa. This study describes the use of non-HIV medications and identifies the factors associated with their use by PLHIV on ART in Côte d’Ivoire. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in six HIV clinics in 2016. HIV-1-infected adults receiving ART for at least one year were eligible. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect demographics, HIV characteristics and medication use data. Associated factors were identified using a multivariate adjusted Poisson regression. Results A total of 1,458 participants (74% women) were enrolled. The median age was 44 years, and the median duration of ART was 81 months. A total of 696 (48%) participants reported having used at least one non-HIV medication. Among the 1,519 non-HIV medications used, 550 (36%) had not been prescribed and 397 (26%) were from the nervous system class. Individuals who were more likely to report the use of at least one non-HIV medication included those who had been treated in an Abidjan HIV clinic, had a high school education level, had a monthly income between 152 and 304 euros, had a poor perceived health status, had WHO advanced clinical stage, had used traditional medicine products and had not used cotrimoxazole. Conclusion Almost half PLHIV on ART reported using non-HIV medication. Further research is needed to assess whether the use of non-HIV medication is appropriate given about a third of those medications are not being prescribed."
