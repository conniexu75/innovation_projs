https://openalex.org/W2947875749,"Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) causing gait impairment, dementia and urinary incontinence among the elderly, is probably under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite being known since the 1960s, there is still a lack of prospective, population-based studies on the prevalence of iNPH. Such studies are warranted to minimize selection bias and estimate the true prevalence of the disease.The prevalence of iNPH was determined in a randomly selected sample of residents, aged 65 years and older, in the Swedish county of Jämtland. Out of 1,000 individuals invited to participate, 673 (67.3%) completed a questionnaire with seven questions on iNPH symptoms. A subgroup, with and without self-reported symptoms, participated in clinical and radiological evaluations and were diagnosed according to international guidelines. Measurement of cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was not performed as it was considered too invasive.Those who reported at least two symptoms in the questionnaire (n = 117) and 51 randomly selected individuals with 0-1 symptom participated in further examinations. Out of them, 25 individuals received the diagnosis probable iNPH according to American-European guidelines (except for the criterion of CSF opening pressure) corresponding to a prevalence of 3.7%. The prevalence of iNPH was four times higher among those aged 80 years and older (8.9%) than among those aged 65-79 years (2.1%) (p <0.001). The difference in prevalence between men (4.6%) and women (2.9%) was not significant (p = 0.24). When iNPH was diagnosed according to the Japanese guidelines the prevalence was 1.5.In this prospective, population-based study the prevalence of iNPH was 3.7% among individuals 65 years and older, and more common in the higher age group, 80 years and above. INPH should be increasingly recognized since it is a fairly common condition and an important cause of gait impairment and dementia among the elderly that can be effectively treated by shunt surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2947461179,"Modern high throughput brain wide profiling techniques for cells and their morphology, connectivity, and other properties, make the use of reference atlases with 3D coordinate frameworks essential. However, anatomical location of observations made in microscopic sectional images from rodent brains is typically determined by comparison with 2D anatomical reference atlases. A major challenge in this regard is that microscopic sections often are cut with orientations deviating from the standard planes used in the reference atlases, resulting in inaccuracies and a need for tedious correction steps. Overall, efficient tools for registration of large series of section images to reference atlases are currently not widely available. Here we present QuickNII, a stand-alone software tool for semi-automated affine spatial registration of sectional image data to a 3D reference atlas coordinate framework. A key feature in the tool is the capability to generate user defined cut planes through the reference atlas, matching the orientation of the cut plane of the sectional image data. The reference atlas is transformed to match anatomical landmarks in the corresponding experimental images. In this way, the spatial relationship between experimental image and atlas is defined, without introducing distortions in the original experimental images. Following anchoring of a limited number of sections containing key landmarks, transformations are propagated across the entire series of sectional images to reduce the amount of manual steps required. By having coordinates assigned to the experimental images, further analysis of the distribution of features extracted from the images is greatly facilitated."
https://openalex.org/W2947826273,"Global climate change alters the dynamic of natural ecosystems and directly affects species distributions, persistence and diversity. The impacts of climate change may lead to dramatic changes in biotic interactions, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Life history traits are extremely important to consider the vulnerability of a species to climate change, producing more robust models than those based primarily on species distributions. Here, we hypothesized that rising temperatures and aridity will reduce suitable habitats for the endemic flora of the Caatinga, the most diverse dry tropical forest on Earth. Specifically, species with specialized reproductive traits (e.g. vertebrate pollination, biotic dispersal, obligatory cross-pollination) should be more affected by climate change than those with generalist traits. We performed two ecological niche models (current and future) to simulate the effects of climate change on the distribution area of endemic species in relation to life-history traits. We used the MIROC-ESM and CCSM4 models for both intermediate (RCP4.5) and highest predicted (RCP8.5) GHG emission scenarios, with a resolution of 30' (~1 km2). Habitat with high occurrence probability (>80%) of endemic species will be reduced (up to ~10% for trees, ~13% for non-arboreous, 10–28% for species with any pollination/reproductive system), with the greatest reductions for species with specialized reproductive traits. In addition, the likely concentration of endemic plants in the extreme northeastern portion of the Caatinga, in more mesic areas, coincides with the currently most human-modified areas of the ecosystem, which combined with climate change will further contract suitable habitats of endemic species. In conclusion, plant species endemic to the Caatinga are highly vulnerable to even conservative scenarios of future climate change and may lose much of their climatic envelopes. New protected areas should be located in the northeastern portion of the Caatinga, which hosts a more favorable climate, but is currently exposed to escalating agricultural intensification."
https://openalex.org/W2947097964,"Clinical resistance against Bedaquiline, the first new anti-tuberculosis compound with a novel mechanism of action in over 40 years, has already been detected in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As a new drug, however, there is currently insufficient clinical data to facilitate reliable and timely identification of genomic determinants of resistance. Here we investigate the structural basis for M. tuberculosis associated bedaquiline resistance in the drug target, AtpE. Together with the 9 previously identified resistance-associated variants in AtpE, 54 non-resistance-associated mutations were identified through comparisons of bedaquiline susceptibility across 23 different mycobacterial species. Computational analysis of the structural and functional consequences of these variants revealed that resistance associated variants were mainly localized at the drug binding site, disrupting key interactions with bedaquiline leading to reduced binding affinity. This was used to train a supervised predictive algorithm, which accurately identified likely resistance mutations (93.3% accuracy). Application of this model to circulating variants present in the Asia-Pacific region suggests that current circulating variants are likely to be susceptible to bedaquiline. We have made this model freely available through a user-friendly web interface called SUSPECT-BDQ, StrUctural Susceptibility PrEdiCTion for bedaquiline (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/suspect_bdq/). This tool could be useful for the rapid characterization of novel clinical variants, to help guide the effective use of bedaquiline, and to minimize the spread of clinical resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2947693122,"Mass mortality events are increasing in frequency and magnitude, potentially linked with ongoing climate change. In October 2016 through January 2017, St. Paul Island, Bering Sea, Alaska, experienced a mortality event of alcids (family: Alcidae), with over 350 carcasses recovered. Almost three-quarters of the carcasses were unscavenged, a rate much higher than in baseline surveys (17%), suggesting ongoing deposition and elevated mortality around St Paul over a 2–3 month period. Based on the observation that carcasses were not observed on the neighboring island of St. George, we bounded the at-sea distribution of moribund birds, and estimated all species mortality at 3,150 to 8,800 birds. The event was particularly anomalous given the late fall/winter timing when low numbers of beached birds are typical. In addition, the predominance of Tufted puffins (Fratercula cirrhata, 79% of carcass finds) and Crested auklets (Aethia cristatella, 11% of carcass finds) was unusual, as these species are nearly absent from long-term baseline surveys. Collected specimens were severely emaciated, suggesting starvation as the ultimate cause of mortality. The majority (95%, N = 245) of Tufted puffins were adults regrowing flight feathers, indicating a potential contribution of molt stress. Immediately prior to this event, shifts in zooplankton community composition and in forage fish distribution and energy density were documented in the eastern Bering Sea following a period of elevated sea surface temperatures, evidence cumulatively suggestive of a bottom-up shift in seabird prey availability. We posit that shifts in prey composition and/or distribution, combined with the onset of molt, resulted in this mortality event."

https://openalex.org/W2947195848,"Camera traps are a key tool in ecological studies, and are increasingly being used to understand entire communities. However, robust inferences continue to be hampered by low detection of rare and elusive species. Attractants can be used to increase detection rates, but may also alter behaviour, and little research has evaluated short-term, localized response to the presence of attractants. We conducted three camera trap surveys in Kibale National Park, Uganda, using food baits and scent lures (“attractants”) at each camera station to entice small carnivores to pass in front of camera stations. To examine the interrelationship between scavenging and response to attractants, we also placed camera traps at five food refuse pits. We modelled the effect of attractant and duration of trap placement on the detection probability of small carnivores and selected African golden cat Caracal aurata prey items. We examine transient site response of each species, by comparing our observed likelihood of detection in each 24 h period from 1–7 d following refreshing of attractants to randomly generated capture histories. African civet Civettictis civetta, rusty-spotted genet Genetta maculata, African palm civet Nandinia binotata, and marsh mongoose Atilax paludinosus detection probabilities were highest and Weyns’s red duiker Cephalophus wenysi detection probability was lowest immediately after attractants were placed. Within 24 h after attractant was placed, rusty-spotted genet and African palm civet were more likely to be detected and African golden cat, red duiker, and blue duiker Philantomba monticola were less likely to be detected. Our results suggest that attractants can increase detection of small-bodied species and include some arboreal species in terrestrial camera trap sampling. However, attractants may also alter short-term visitation rates of some species, with potentially cascading effects on others. Community level and intraguild interaction studies should control for the potentially confounding effects of attractants on spatial activity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2947699952,"Background and aim Various drugs have been developed for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but still there are limitations in the treatment due to the insufficient responses and significant adverse effects of immunosuppressant. Apocynin is an NADPH-oxidase inhibitor with established safety profiles. We aimed to investigate the protective efficacy of apocynin in IBD using chemical-induced mouse colitis model. Method We induced experimental colitis by administrating 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to 8-week old BALB/c mouse for 11 days. Apocynin (400 mg/kg) or sulfasalazine (150 mg/kg) were administeredduring7 days. We monitored bodyweight daily and harvested colon and spleen at day 11 to check weight and length. We also examined histopathologic change and pro-, anti-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes from harvested colons (iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, MCP-1, p-NrF2, and HO-1). Result Apocynin significantly alleviated weight reduction induced by DSS treatment (21.64 ± 0.55 for Apocynin group vs. 20.33 ± 0.90 for DSS group, p = 0.005). Anti-inflammatory efficacy of apocynin was also shown by the recovery of colon weight and length. Histopathologic examination revealed significantly reduced inflammatory foci and erosions by apocynin treatment. Colonic expression of iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α, and MCP-1 was decreased significantly in the apocynin treated group. Anti-inflammatory mediators Nrf2 and HO-1 were activated significantly in apocynin treated mouse. Conclusion Apocynin showed significant anti-inflammatory efficacy against chemically induced colonic inflammation. This study also revealed the unique action of apocynin compared to the currently prescribed drug, sulfasalazine. Given its excellent safety profile and potent efficacy with novel action mechanism, apocynin can be a new therapeutic molecule for the IBD treatment, which can be added to the currently available drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2947180397,"Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is generally recognized as a prognostic factor in HCC. Our purpose is to assess and compare the survival of patients with PVT and without PVT, after Y-90 Trans-Arterial Radio-Embolization (TARE) of unresectable HCC, unresponsive to other loco-regional treatments.Between November 2005 and November 2012, Y-90 resin-based TARE was performed in an IRB-approved prospective protocol, on 89 patients with unresectable HCC. 33/89 patients had PVT, the remaining 56 were resistant-to-cTACE or underwent TARE as a downstaging therapy. All patients were studied with Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT), angiography, 99mTc-MAA-scintigraphy and liver biopsy. Gastro-duodenal artery was embolized in most cases. Proton-Pump Inhibitors were administered to prevent gastritis and ulcers. χ2 test with Yates correction and log rank test were used to compare the two proportions and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, respectively.The average activity administered was 1.7 ± 0.4 GBq. After the treatment, CTCAE grade 2 adverse events occurred in 46% (41/89) patients: in particular, fever and abdominal pain were found in 25 and 16 patients, respectively. No major side-effect was observed. According to mRECIST criteria, partial response or complete response was found in 70% of patient three months after the treatment, and in 90.5% nine months after the treatment. No significant difference was found in survival of patients with PVT compared to those without PVT (p-value = 0.672). A complete regression of PVT was observed in almost half patients (13/27, 48.1%).Portal vein invasion does not affect survival in advanced stage HCC-patients undergoing TARE using Y-90 resin-based microspheres. Y90 procedure is associated with regression of portal vein tumor thrombus."
https://openalex.org/W2946860218,"In the present two-year study, an attempt was made to estimate the grain yield, grain nutrient uptake, and oil quality of three commonly grown maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids fertilized with varied levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Results obtained from both the experimental years indicated that application of 125% of recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) recorded maximum grain yield (10.37 t ha-1; 124% higher than control). When compared with 100% RDF, grain yield reduction with nutrient omission was 44% for N omission, 17% for P omission, and 27% for K omission. Nitrogen uptake was increased with increasing NPK levels up to 150% RDF that was statistically at par (p ≥ 0.01) with 125% RDF. Increasing trend in P and K uptake was observed with successive increase in NPK levels up to 125% RDF, above which it declined. The protein content was significantly higher in grains of var. P 3396 with 125% RDF. Nutrient management has significant (p ≤ 0.01) role in the grain oil content. Saturated fatty acids (palmitic, stearic and arachidic acid) content decreased, and unsaturated fatty acid (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid) increased with increasing NPK levels. The average oleic acid desaturation and linoleic acid desaturation ratios were increased with increasing NPK levels up to 100 and 125% RDF, respectively. However, average monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA): poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), saturated: unsaturated as well as linoleic: linolenic acid ratios were increased on receiving 75% RDF, and beyond that it showed decreasing trend. The omission of K had the highest inhibitory effect on corn oil quality followed by N and P omission."
https://openalex.org/W2947612626,"Background Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients treated with resection or non-surgical treatment. Here, we investigated the association of elevated CRP (≥1 vs. <1 mg/dL) with (i) recurrence of HCC and (ii) OS after liver transplantation (LT). Methods Adult HCC patients undergoing orthotopic deceased donor LT at the Medical University of Vienna between 1997 and 2014 were retrospectively analysed. Results Among 216 patients included, 132 (61.1%) were transplanted within the Milan criteria and forty-two patients (19.4%) had microvascular invasion on explant histology. Seventy patients (32.4%) showed elevated CRP (≥ 1 mg/dL). On multivariate analysis, a CRP ≥ 1 mg/dL was an independent risk factor for HCC recurrence with a 5-year recurrence rate of 27.4% vs. 16.4% (HR 2.33; 95% CI 1.13–4.83; p = 0.022). OS was similar in patients with normal vs. elevated CRP levels. Conclusions Elevated serum CRP is associated with HCC recurrence after LT and may be a marker for more aggressive tumor biology. Future studies should evaluate whether patients with elevated pre-transplant CRP levels benefit from closer monitoring for HCC recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2946866831,"Methods of reconstructing changes in plant traits over long time scales are needed to understand the impact of changing environmental conditions on ecosystem processes and services. Although Holocene pollen have been extensively used to provide records of vegetation history, few studies have adopted a functional trait approach that is pertinent to changes in ecosystem processes. Here, for woody and herbaceous fen peatland communities, we use modern pollen and vegetation data combined with pollen records from Holocene deposits to reconstruct vegetation functional dynamics. The six traits chosen (measures of leaf area-to-mass ratio and leaf nutrient content) are known to modulate species’ fitness and to vary with changes in ecosystem processes. We fitted linear mixed effects models between community weighted mean (CWM) trait values of the modern pollen and vegetation to determine whether traits assigned to pollen types could be used to reconstruct traits found in the vegetation from pollen assemblages. We used relative pollen productivity (RPP) correction factors in an attempt to improve this relationship. For traits showing the best fit between modern pollen and vegetation, we applied the model to dated Holocene pollen sequences from Fenland and Romney Marsh in eastern and southern England and reconstructed temporal changes in trait composition. RPP adjustment did not improve the linear relationship between modern pollen and vegetation. Leaf nutrient traits (leaf C and N) were generally more predictable from pollen data than mass-area traits. We show that inferences about biomass accumulation and decomposition rates can be made using Holocene trait reconstructions. While it is possible to reconstruct community-level trends for some leaf traits from pollen assemblages preserved in sedimentary archives in wetlands, we show the importance of testing methods in modern systems first and encourage further development of this approach to address issues concerning the pollen-plant abundance relationship and pollen source area."
https://openalex.org/W2947259603,"We have previously shown that knockdown of endomucin (EMCN), an integral membrane glycocalyx glycoprotein, prevents VEGF-induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. In the endothelium, VEGF mediates most of its angiogenic effects through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). To understand the role of EMCN, we examined the effect of EMCN depletion on VEGFR2 endocytosis and activation. Results showed that although VEGF stimulation promoted VEGFR2 internalization in control endothelial cells (ECs), loss of EMCN prevented VEGFR2 endocytosis. Cell surface analysis revealed a decrease in VEGFR2 following VEGF stimulation in control but not siRNA directed against EMCN-transfected ECs. EMCN depletion resulted in heightened phosphorylation following VEGF stimulation with an increase in total VEGFR2 protein. These results indicate that EMCN modulates VEGFR2 endocytosis and activity and point to EMCN as a potential therapeutic target.-LeBlanc, M. E., Saez-Torres, K.

https://openalex.org/W2949447597,"The porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) devastates the health of piglets but may not infect piglets whose CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene is mutated (knockouts, KO) by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I, n = 6, and III, n = 15) and 3-day-old (in exp. II, n = 9) KO and wild-type (WT, same ages in respective exps.) piglets were inoculated with TCID50 1x103 PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow’s colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals either deceased or euthanized were necropsied and intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2947047228,"Culex quinquefasciatus is a vector of lymphatic filariasis and vector control strategies normally involve the use of synthetic insecticides targeted against them. Extensive and uncontrolled use of these synthetic insecticides has led to the development of insecticide resistance in the mosquito vectors. In this context, to study the resistance status of Cx. quinquefasciatus, field populations were collected from three districts of Northern part of West Bengal and tested against insecticides (5% malathion, 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.05% lambdacyhalothrin,0.75% permethrin, 0.1% propoxur, 4% DDT and Temephos). Qualitative and quantitative enzyme assay was also conducted in order to find the role of detoxifying enzymes behind the development of insecticide resistance. This study revealed the presence of widespread resistance amongst the field populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus throughout the studied regions. Moreover, the result of native PAGE and biochemical enzyme assay may be linked to some extent in the involvement of the detoxifying enzymes in conferring resistance against insecticides in most of the tested Cx. quinquefasciatus populations. The present study involving the survey of resistance status may be of immense help during the implementation of vector control strategies throughout this region."

Among these, several are based on modifications of a conserved core element of serotype O2a OPS, which has a disaccharide repeat structure [→3)-α-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-Galf-(1→]. Here, we describe the enzymatic pathways for a highly unusual modification strategy involving the attachment of a second glycan repeat-unit structure to the nonreducing terminus of O2a. This occurs by the addition of the O1 [→3)-α-d-Galp-(1→3)-β-d-Galp-(1→] or O2c [→3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→5)-β-d-Galf-(1→] antigens. The organization of the enzyme activities performing these modifications differs, with the enzyme WbbY possessing two glycosyltransferase catalytic sites solely responsible for O1 antigen polymerization and forming a complex with the O2a glycosyltransferase WbbM.

These OPSs also offer insight into strategies used by bacteria in diversification of polysaccharide antigens. These processes create related structures that complicate serotype distinction among the clinically prevalent O1/O2 group (Fig. 1).

The O2 serotype is actually made up of a collection of four sub-serotypes that, along with O1, represent different modified versions of O2a.

The O2afg and O2aeh serotypes modify the O2a repeat unit by side-chain addition of (1→4)- or (1→2)–linked Galp residues, respectively (Fig. 1) (27Kelly R.F. Perry M.B. MacLean L.L. Whitfield C.

The side-chain modification is catalyzed by a system similar to bacteriophage-mediated OPS glucosylation in Salmonella and Shigella, and it is directed by a set of three genes, denoted gmlABC responsible for the (1→4)-linkage in O2afg and gmlABD responsible for the (1→2)- linkage in O2aeh (8Stojkovic K.

The O2c antigen is also extended from the O2a antigen and possesses a [→3)-β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→5)-β-d-Galf-(1→] repeat unit (Fig. 1).

Although the minimum requirements for O1 and O2c production have been established, the biochemical function of WbbY and the individual roles of WbmVWX remain unclear. Here, we unequivocally establish the activities of the two GT catalytic modules of WbbY in O1 biosynthesis, and we assign the GT activities of WbmV and WbmW, which are sufficient for O2ac biosynthesis. Completing the characterization of O2a modifications provides a fundamental understanding of the minimal genetic and biosynthetic requirements for clinically-important glycans. It also offers the first enzymatic insight into a novel strategy for diversification of polysaccharide antigens. All available structural data are consistent with the O1 glycan being linked to the nonreducing end of the underlying OPS (e.g. O2a or O2afg) (Fig. 1) (8Stojkovic K. Szijártó V. Kaszowska M. Niedziela T. Hartl K. Nagy G. Lukasiewicz J. Identification of d-Galactan-III as part of the lipopolysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae serotype O1.Front.

Biosynthesis of the O1 antigen should therefore require the activities of each of the O2a assembly and export components in addition to WbbY. However, the shared linkages in the O2a and O1 antigens opened the possibility that WbbY makes one of the O2a GTs expendable. This was examined using a genetic approach in a recombinant Escherichia coli CWG286 host, which has its own OPS biosynthesis locus deleted, but it can assemble and export the O2a antigen from plasmid-encoded genes (22Köplin R.

The LPS products were examined in silver-stained SDS-PAGE and the corresponding immunoblots using polyclonal anti-O2a and monoclonal anti-O1 antibodies (Fig. 2). Plasmids containing individual mutations in each of the O2a biosynthesis genes were introduced together with a plasmid expressing wbbY into E. coli CWG286. When wbbY and a functional rfb2a gene cluster were introduced, E. coli GWG286 produced HMW OPS that was reactive only with a mAb specific for O1 PS (Fig. 2, A–C). In the absence of transport (Δwzm-wzt), no OPS-containing LPS species were visible by silver staining, but the anti-O1 antibodies detected OPS. This material is consistent with Und-PP–OPS retained in the cytoplasm, and the higher apparent molecular mass (compared with the corresponding LPS-linked form) is consistent with previous results indicating that active export is required to control O2a glycan chain length (21Kos V. Cuthbertson L. Whitfield C. The Klebsiella pneumoniae O2a antigen defines a second mechanism for O-antigen ATP-binding cassette transporters.J. Biol.

Any of the deletions that abrogated O2a biosynthesis also eliminated O1 production. These results indicated that the O1 antigen is assembled on an acceptor composed of at least one O2a repeat unit. Although the results above indicated that O2a production is essential for O1 production, they do not distinguish between a model where one or more of the O2a GTs participate in polymerization of the O1 repeat unit itself, as opposed to a role confined to forming an acceptor for O1 extension. This was investigated by in vitro biosynthesis experiments. His6–WbbY was overexpressed in E. coli K-12. Attempts to purify full-length protein failed due to extensive and unresolvable degradation during protein extraction and purification. Therefore, membrane fractions were isolated and used as a source of enzyme. The two potential O2a acceptors for initiating O1 PS synthesis were synthesized as disaccharides (1 and 2) attached to fluorescein-containing aglycones for detection (Fig. 3 and Schemes S2 and S3). Robust polymerization was observed only with 2, which has a terminal Galp residue. A trace of activity was seen with 1. The product of WbbY polymerization on 2 was purified, size-fractionated, and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (Table 1 and Fig. S1). This confirmed that the glycan synthesized by WbbY in vitro was structurally identical to authentic O1 PS from K. pneumoniae (16Whitfield C. Richards J.C. Perry M.B. Clarke B.R. MacLean L.L.

Our objectives were to quantify glucose export, cellular glycogen, and expression of genes controlling oxidation and gluconeogenesis in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes exposed to increasing concentrations of choline chloride (CC) and D,L-methionine (DLM) with or without fatty acids (FA). Primary hepatocytes isolated from 3 Holstein calves were maintained as monolayer cultures for 24 h before treatment with CC (61, 128, 2028, 4528 μmol/L) and DLM (16, 30, 100, 300 μmol/L) with or without a 1 mmol/L FA cocktail in a factorial design. After 24 h, media was harvested to quantify glucose, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and cells harvested to quantify glycogen, DNA, and gene expression. No interactions between CC and DLM were detected. The potential two-way interaction between CC or DLM and FA was partitioned into three contrasts when P ≤ 0.20: linear without FA, linear with FA, difference of slope. Fatty acids did not affect glucose or cellular glycogen but increased pyruvate carboxylase (PC), cytosolic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCKc, PEPCKm), and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) expression. Increasing CC decreased glucose but increased cellular glycogen. Expression of PC and PEPCKc was increased by CC during FA treatment. Increasing DLM did not affect metabolites or PC expression, although PEPCKc was marginally decreased. Methionine did not affect G6PC, while CC had a marginal quadratic effect on G6PC. Oxidative and gluconeogenic enzymes appear to respond to FA in primary bovine neonatal hepatocytes. Increased PC and PEPCKc by CC during FA treatment suggest increased gluconeogenic capacity. Changes in G6PC may have shifted glucose-6-phosphate towards cellular glycogen; however, subsequent examination of G6PC protein is needed. Unaltered PC and marginally decreased PEPCKc suggest increased oxidative capacity with DLM, although BHB export was unaltered. The differential regulation supports unique effects of CC and DLM within bovine hepatocytes."

Here we synthesized a DNA 23-mer containing a site-specific DNA–peptide cross-link (DpC) by cross-linking an 11-mer peptide to the DNA epigenetic mark 5-formylcytosine in synthetic DNA and used it to generate a DpC-containing plasmid construct. Upon replication of the DpC-containing plasmid in HEK 293T cells, approximately 9% of progeny plasmids contained targeted mutations and 5% semitargeted mutations. Targeted mutations included C→T transitions and C deletions, whereas semitargeted mutations included several base substitutions and deletions near the DpC lesion. To identify DNA polymerases involved in DpC bypass, we comparatively studied translesion synthesis (TLS) efficiency and mutagenesis of the DpC in a series of cell lines with TLS polymerase knockouts or knockdowns. Knockdown of either hPol ι or hPol ζ reduced the mutation frequency by nearly 50%. However, the most significant reduction in mutation frequency (50%–70%) was observed upon simultaneous knockout of hPol η and hPol κ with knockdown of hPol ζ, suggesting that these TLS polymerases play a critical role in error-prone DpC bypass. Because TLS efficiency of the DpC construct was not significantly affected in TLS polymerase–deficient cells, we examined a possible role of replicative DNA polymerases in their bypass and determined that hPol δ and hPol ε can accurately bypass the DpC. We conclude that both replicative and TLS polymerases can bypass this DpC lesion in human cells but that mutations are induced mainly by TLS polymerases.

https://openalex.org/W2947388783,"Researchers investigating cancer chemotherapy and management continue to search for agents that selectively kill malignant cells and leave healthy neighboring cells intact. Natural products provide relevant resources for anti-cancer drug discovery. However, the physicochemical properties of these compounds limit their efficient uptake and bioavailability. We introduced a nanocarrier system, namely, zinc-aluminum-layered double hydroxide (ZnAl-LDH) intercalated with protocatechuic acid. In this study, the efficacy and toxicity of protocatechuic acid intercalated in zinc aluminum-layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (PCA-ZnAl) against diethylnitrosamine/phenobarbital (DEN/PB)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in BALB/c mice was evaluated. HCC in male mice was induced by a single-dose intraperitoneal administration of DEN and was promoted by the introduction of PB via drinking water for 12 weeks. HCC induction was confirmed after the DEN/PB introduction period by measurement of the elevated level of serum α-feto protein (AFP). The results showed that the level of α-fetoprotein was significantly reduced in PCA-ZnAl (350±43.90 ng/mL), doxorubicin (DOX) (290±20.52 ng/mL) and ZnAl-LDH (390±19.65 ng/mL) treated animals compared to HCC mice treated with normal saline (580.4± 52.04 ng/mL). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly increased, whereas the level of lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased in HCC mice treated with DOX, PCA-ZnAl and ZnAl-LDH compared with those in HCC mice treated with saline. Restoration of hepatocyte morphology was observed following treatment that was comparable to that in the normal control group. Deterioration of hepatic cells and a significant increase of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were observed in the cancer-induced untreated group compared with that in the groups treated with nanoparticles. The histopathological features of the liver obtained from PCA-ZnAl-treated mice showed a uniform size with a similar distribution of the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and nucleus centrally located in the cytoplasm, similar to the normal liver cells. The results underscored the potential of PCA-ZnAl for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2946886879,"NKL homeobox genes encode developmental transcription factors regulating basic processes in cell differentiation. According to their physiological expression pattern in early hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis, particular members of this homeobox gene subclass constitute an NKL-code. B-cell specific NKL-code genes generate a regulatory network and their deregulation is implicated in B-cell lymphomagenesis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects B-cells and influences the activity of signalling pathways including JAK/STAT and several genes encoding developmental regulators. Therefore, EBV-infection impacts the pathogenesis and the outcome of B-cell malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Here, we isolated EBV-positive and EBV-negative subclones from the DLBCL derived cell line DOHH-2. These subclones served as models to investigate the role of EBV in deregulation of the B-cell specific NKL-code members HHEX, HLX, MSX1 and NKX6-3. We showed that the EBV-encoded factors LMP1 and LMP2A activated the expression of HLX via STAT3. HLX in turn repressed NKX6-3, SPIB and IL4R which normally mediate plasma cell differentiation. In addition, HLX repressed the pro-apoptotic factor BCL2L11/BIM and hence supported cell survival. Thus, EBV aberrantly activated HLX in DLBCL, thereby disturbing both B-cell differentiation and apoptosis. The results of our study appreciate the pathogenic role of EBV in NKL homeobox gene deregulation and B-cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2947012126,"Research associating the increased prevalence of familial autoimmunity with neuropsychiatric disorders is reliant upon the ascertainment of history of autoimmune diseases from relatives. To characterize the accuracy of self-report, we compared self-reported diagnoses of 18 autoimmune diseases using an online self-report questionnaire to the electronic medical record (EMR) diagnoses in 1,013 adult (age 18-70 years) patients of a primary care clinic. For the 11 diseases meeting our threshold observed prevalence, we estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for self-reported diagnoses under the assumption that EMR-based diagnoses were accurate. Six diseases out of 11 had either sensitivity or PPV below 50%, with the lowest PPV for dermatological and endocrinological diseases. Common errors included incorrectly self-reporting type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), when type 1 DM was indicated by the EMR, and reporting rheumatoid arthritis when osteoarthritis was indicated by the EMR. Results suggest that ascertainment of familial autoimmunity through self-report contributes to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in studies of autoimmune disease history and that future studies would benefit from incorporating EMR review and biological measures."

The DSB is then repaired by either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR)–mediated repair. For gene knockouts, NHEJ randomly joins the two processed ends of DNA from the DSB site, which is efficient in generating insertion- or deletion-based gene knockouts. In contrast, HR is a favored method for gene knockins and tagging because it is a precise repair mechanism and allows in-frame modification. However, HR is extremely inefficient compared with NHEJ and requires a large fragment of a homologous DNA sequence corresponding to the genomic DNA surrounding the DSB site (4Dalvai M. Loehr J.

The system is easily expandable with other tags and will be a useful tool set for scientists. The MMEJ-mediated PITCh tagging system utilizes the pX330 vector, which expresses the Cas9 nuclease and two gRNAs.

One of the gRNAs targets the genome to generate a DSB, whereas the other targets the PITCh vector to release the tagging cassette.

MMEJ-Assisted gene knock-in using TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9 with the PITCh systems.Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 (26678082): 118-13310.1038/nprot.2015.140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Many proteins do not tolerate C-terminal tags, either because of structural distortion or because of modification sites. We therefore redesigned and optimized the MMEJ-based tagging approach for N-terminal tagging and expanded the repertoire of tags (Fig. 1B). This required rearranging the location of the GFP and the flanking microhomology sequence and addition of an additional 2A peptide. Compared with the Yamamoto system, which fuses GFP to the C terminus of the target protein, GFP expression in our system solely serves as a reporter for successful integration, which greatly reduces the number of samples for PCR and Western blot confirmation. The need for N-terminal tagging tools became evident when we needed to tag the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2AC). The C terminus of the essential PP2AC subunit is highly regulated by posttranslational modifications (20Janssens V. Longin S. Goris J. PP2A holoenzyme assembly: in cauda venenum (the sting is in the tail).Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33 (18291659): 113-12110.1016/j.tibs.2007.12.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The 309-amino-acid-long PP2AC is phosphorylated at Thr-304 and Tyr-307 and carboxylmethylated at Leu-309 (21Wlodarchak N. Xing Y. PP2A as a master regulator of the cell cycle.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2016; 51 (26906453): 162-18410.3109/10409238.2016.1143913Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), making C-terminal tagging impossible. We therefore re-engineered the C-terminal PITCh tagging system for N-terminal tagging (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal PITCh tagging cassette (pN-PITCh) starts with GFP, followed by the puromycin resistance gene and one of several available tags, all divided by self-cleaving 2A sequences for separation (Fig. 1B). The PITCh tagging cassette is flanked by 20-bp microhomology sequences to direct insertion at the desired genomic site by MMEJ (Fig. 1A). To test the efficiency of our approach, we designed a gRNA that targets the N terminus of the PP2AC ORF to insert the PITCh cassette containing GFP, PuroR, and 3×HA tag, all separated by 2A self-cleaving peptides. Note that, depending on the exact Cas9 cleavage position, part of the nucleotide sequence encoding the N-terminal amino acids needs to be artificially added back into the PITCh cassette to prevent the loss of the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1C, the blue sequence on the repair template). We transiently transfected 293T cells with pX330X2-PP2Ac-PITCh, which expresses the Cas9 nuclease and the two gRNAs that target the PITCh cassette for release of the repair fragment and the genomic sequence encoding the PP2Ac N terminus, respectively (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we cloned the U6 promoter and PITCh gRNA directly after the target gRNA (YFG) cloning site that is flanked by BbsI to bypass the golden gate assembly step. Cells were co-transfected with the second plasmid, pN-PITCh-HA, which contains the repair fragment (Fig. 1B). Three days after transfection, cells were selected using puromycin. Because the PuroR gene is driven by the endogenous promoter of the target gene (here PP2AC), only correctly integrated cassettes will be puromycin resistant, show a GFP signal, and express 3×HA-PP2AC. Depending on the target gene, the GFP expression driven by the endogenous promoter is typically weaker compared with overexpressed CMV promoter-driven GFP (Fig. 2A) but, nevertheless, is a useful visual indicator of successful integration. Single clones were selected and tested by immunoblotting with anti-PP2AC and anti-HA antibodies. Ten of 12 clones (83%) were CRISPR modified in both alleles and produced homozygous 3×HA-tagged PP2AC (Fig. 2B). One clone had no tagged PP2AC (#4), and another clone was heterozygous for tagged PP2AC (#10) (Fig. 2B). Note that there is a trace amount of lower molecular species of PP2Ac visible when protein extracts are probed with anti-PP2Ac antibodies (Fig. 2B). These species are not detected with anti-HA antibodies, suggesting nonspecific N-terminal degradation. This appears to be a problem caused by the HA tag only because no such degradation products were seen when other tags were fused to the PP2Ac N terminus (Fig. 2C). To broaden the application of our method, we generated a selection of different tags in the pN-PITCh system, including His6FLAG, mCherry, HBTH, and GFP (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal HBTH tagging construct was also tested on PP2AC, and six of six (100%) tested single colonies showed homozygous expression of HBTH-PP2AC (Fig. 2C). The HBTH tag is a combination of two copies of the His6 tag (HBTH) flanking an autonomous biotinylation peptide (HBTH) and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (HBTH). This tag is useful for cross-linking MS, tandem purification under fully denaturing conditions, and general applications that benefit from highly stringent purification conditions (14Guerrero C.

The HBTH and mCherry tags were also tested on the proteasome component RPN1 to evaluate application at a different genomic locus (Fig. 3A). Three of three (100%) tested single colonies were homozygous for HBTH-RPN1 (Fig. 3A). RPN1 is critical for 26S proteasome activity, as it coordinates substrate recruitment, deubiquitination, and movement toward the catalytic core (23Rosenzweig R. Bronner V. Zhang D. Fushman D. Glickman M.H. Rpn1 and Rpn2 coordinate ubiquitin processing factors at proteasome.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22318722): 14659-1467110.1074/jbc.M111.316323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To test whether the N-terminal HBTH-tagged RPN1 is completely functional, we performed proteasome activity assays using fluorogenic substrate peptides. Proteasome activity was unaffected in cells expressing HBTH-tagged RPN1 (Fig. 3B). Leveraging the high affinity of the biotinylated HBTH tag for streptavidin beads, we purified the proteasome complex and analyzed the affinity-purified complex by SDS-PAGE and MS. Subunits of the catalytic 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle were readily visible by protein staining after separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C) (24Wang X. Chen C.F. Baker P.R. Chen P.L. Kaiser P. Huang L. Mass spectrometric characterization of the affinity-purified human 26S proteasome complex.Biochemistry. 2007; 10.1021/BI061994UGoogle Scholar). Mass spectrometry confirmed that all 26S subunits were purified and detected with high peptide coverage (Table S2). Both mCherry and GFP tagging allow intracellular protein tracing. Although mCherry-tagged RPN1 expressed at the endogenous level only produces a weak fluorescent signal, it was enough to visualize intracellular RPN1 with extended exposure time (∼10-s exposure) (Fig. 3D). The N-terminal GFP tagging construct pN-PITCh-GFP was tested by tagging catalase. Catalase is a key antioxidant enzyme with a C-terminal peroxisome targeting sequence (25Murakami K. Ichinohe Y. Koike M. Sasaoka N. Iemura S. Natsume T. Kakizuka A. VCP Is an integral component of a novel feedback mechanism that controls intracellular localization of catalase and H2O2 levels.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (23457492): e5601210.1371/journal.pone.0056012Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Zhou Z.

GFP-catalase was readily detected and, as expected, colocalized with peroxisomes, which were visualized with red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Fig. 4). Notably, when we attempted to tag the N terminus of PP2AC with GFP or mCherry, we were unable to retrieve viable cell clones with correct GFP or mCherry-fused PP2AC. This might be the result of spatial hindrance from bulky tags, such as GFP or mCherry, which abrogates essential protein interactions and thereby prevents formation of a functional PP2A holoenzyme complex. Because PP2AC is essential for cell viability, failure to obtain GFP- and mCherry-tagged PP2AC is a good indication that the tags interfere with protein function. Such negative effects on the functionality of proteins is less obvious for nonessential proteins, and, as with all tagging approaches, careful evaluation of protein function after tagging is important. During gRNA design, we noticed that not all genes have gRNA target sites with good scores (>0.5 from a scale of 0 to 1, using the web tool developed by Doench et al. (28Doench J.G. Fusi N. Sullender M. Hegde M. Vaimberg E.W. Donovan K.F. Smith I. Tothova Z. Wilen C. Orchard R. Virgin H.W. Listgarten J. Root D.E. Optimized sgRNA design to maximize activity and minimize off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9.Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 (26780180): 184-19110.1038/nbt.3437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar)). This situation requires placing the Cas9 cut site upstream of the start codon. To test the efficiency of using gRNA positions upstream of the start codon, we compared two gRNAs that target mRNA guanine-N7 methyltransferase (RNMT). gRNA1 targets the coding region, and placement of the microhomology region allows seamless repair. In contrast, gRNA2 targets more than 20 bp upstream of the start codon, and the microhomology regions needed to be designed so that the 20-bp noncoding fragment is removed by the repair machinery during MMEJ, producing the tag directly fused to the beginning of the ORF (Fig. 5A). In addition to providing the flexibility to choose optimal gRNAs, this approach also avoids the need to reinsert the lost ORF fragments when gRNAs target inside the ORF (Figs. 1C and 5A, gRNA1). However, the upstream gRNA2 placement is less efficient than the intra-ORF gRNA1, with only one of seven (14%) homozygous tag insertions for gRNA2. Most of the resulting clones carried heterozygous HBTH-RNMT. In contrast, consistent with other tagging approaches, three of three (100%) clones were homozygous for HBTH-RNMT when gRNA1 was used (Fig. 5B). This is most likely due to the additional trimming required to insert the repair template (Fig. 5A). To overcome this inefficiency, a potential solution would be to employ two identical tagging cassettes that carry different selection markers. This will increase the frequency of homozygous insertions because of the resistance to both antibiotics. There are about 2,000 essential genes in human cell lines (29Hart T. Chandrashekhar M.

Furthermore, even for nonessential proteins, rapid conditional degradation of the protein can be important to detect the immediate phenotype after target protein depletion, before compensatory effects can obscure the phenotype. Therefore, compared with CRISPR-mediated gene knockout, conditional protein depletion offers flexibility to study essential genes for cell viability and avoids adaptation to knockout of nonessential genes.

These nonequilibrium self-organized systems are known as dissipative structures. We study the oscillatory mode of an electrically driven dissipative structure. Our system consists of aluminum beads in shallow oil, which, when subjected to a high voltage, self-organize into connected ‘tree’ structures. The tree structures serve as pathways for the conduction of charge to ground. This system shows a variety of spatio-temporal behaviors, such as oscillating movement of the tree structures. Utilizing a dynamical systems model of the electromagnetic phenomena, we explore a potential mechanism underlying the system’s behavior and use the model to make additional empirical predictions. The model reproduces the oscillatory behavior observed in the real system, and the behavior of the real system is consistent with predictions from the model under various constraints. From the empirical results and the mathematical model, we observe a tendency for the system to select modes of behavior with increased dissipation, or higher rates of entropy production, in accord with the proposed Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) Principle."
https://openalex.org/W2947321552,"Background Human breastmilk contains pro- and anti-inflammatory compounds and hormones that can influence infant growth. However, little is known about the specific interrelationships between these compounds and whether their effects on infant growth may be influenced by pre-pregnancy weight status. Objective The purpose of this novel, prospective cohort study was to assess the interrelationships between pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), hormones (insulin, leptin) and PUFAs (n-6, n-3) in blood and breastmilk in early postpartum between women with normal BMI (Group 1, n = 18; 18.5<BMI≤24.9 kg/m2) and with overweight/obesity (Group 2, n = 15; BMI≥25.0 kg/m2) before pregnancy to determine if these components correlated to infant growth measures at age 4–8 weeks. Methods Participants were robustly phenotyped along with their infants at 4–8 weeks postpartum. TNF-α, IL-6, insulin, leptin, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs measured in blood and breastmilk and compared between pre-pregnancy BMI groups and with infant weight, length, head circumference and % fat mass. Results Group 1 women had higher serum leptin (p<0.01) and breastmilk leptin (p<0.001) compared to Group 2. Other inflammatory markers, hormones, and total n-6, n-3 and n-6/n-3 ratio PUFAs were similar between pre-pregnancy BMI groups. No relationships were observed between whey inflammatory markers, hormones, PUFAs and growth measures in infants born to Group 2 women. However, TNF-α was positively related and, IL-6, leptin, insulin, total n-6, n-3 and n-6/n-3 PUFAs in whey breastmilk were negatively correlated to infant growth measures in infants born to Group 1 women (p<0.01). Conclusions Pro-inflammatory qualities of breastmilk were associated with infant growth measures regardless of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. However, infants born to women with overweight or obesity demonstrated less responsive growth to breastmilk contents. More studies are needed to assess longitudinal effects of this impact."

The approach proposed comprises a variety of quantitative methods, ranging from exploratory techniques aimed at capturing relationships of any type between variables, to network theory and supervised-learning predictive modelling. Results provided by all techniques consistently show that the differences observed in food sharing practices across the sampled populations cannot be explained just by the differential distribution of ecological, geographical and economic variables.

https://openalex.org/W2947516079,"Unsafe abortion continues to impact negatively on women's health in countries with restrictive abortion laws. It remains one of the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. Paradoxically, modern contraceptive prevalence remains low and the unmet need for contraception continues to mirror unwanted pregnancy rates in many countries within sub-Saharan Africa. This qualitative study assessed women's knowledge; their expectation and experiences of the methods employed for abortion; and their health care-seeking decisions following a complicated abortion. Women who presented with abortion complications were purposively sampled from seven health facilities in south-west Nigeria. In-depth interviews were conducted by social scientists with the aid of a semi-structured interview guide. Coding schemes were developed and content analysis was performed with WEFTQDA software. Thirty-one women were interviewed. Misoprostol was used by 16 women; 15 women used other methods. About one-fifth of respondents were aged ≤ 20 years; almost one-third were students. Common reasons for terminating a pregnancy were: ""too young/still in school/training""; ""has enough number of children""; ""last baby too young"" and ""still breastfeeding"". Women had little knowledge about methods used. Friends, nurses or pharmacists were the commonest sources of information. Awareness about use of misoprostol for abortion among women was high. Women used misoprostol to initiate an abortion and were often disappointed if misoprostol did not complete the abortion process. Given its clandestine manner, women were financially exploited by the abortion providers and only presented to hospitals for post-abortion care as a last resort. Women's narratives of their abortion experience highlight the difficulties and risks women encounter to safeguard and protect their sexual and reproductive health. To reduce unsafe abortion therefore, urgent and synergized efforts are required to promote prompt access to family planning and post-abortion care services."

Nine proteins showed decreasing plasma levels during natalizumab treatment, with PEBP1 and RTN3 displaying the most significant changes. Protein levels remained stable during fingolimod treatment for both proteins. The decreasing PEBP1 levels during natalizumab treatment could be validated using ELISA and replicated in an independent cohort.

https://openalex.org/W2947291818,"Background Close-to-community (CTC) providers of health care are a crucial workforce for delivery of high-quality and universal health coverage. There is limited evidence on the effect of training supervisors of this cadre in supportive supervision. Our study aimed to demonstrate the effects of a training intervention on the approach to and frequency of supervision of CTC providers of health care. Methods We conducted a context analysis in 2013 in two Kenyan counties to assess factors that influenced delivery of community health services. Supervision was identified a priority factor that needed to be addressed to improve community health services. Supervision was inadequate due to lack of supervisor capacity in supportive approaches and lack of supervision guidelines. We designed a six-day training intervention and trained 48 purposively selected CTC supervisors on the educative, administrative and supportive components of supportive supervision, problem solving and advocacy and provided them with checklists to guide supervision sessions. We administered quantitative questionnaires to supervisors to assess changes in supervision frequency before and after the training and then explored perspectives on the intervention with community health volunteers (CHVs) and their supervisors using qualitative in-depth interviews. Results Six months after the intervention, we observed that supervisors had shifted the supervision approach from being controlling and administrative to coaching, mentorship and problem solving. Changes in the frequency of supervision were found in Kitui only, whereby significant decreases in group supervision were met with increases in accompanied home visit supervision. Supervisors and CHVs reported the intervention was helpful and it responded to capacity gaps in supervision of CHVs. Conclusion Our intervention responded to capacity gaps in supervision and contributed to enhanced supervision capacity among supervisors. Supervisors found the curriculum acceptable and useful in improving supervision skills."
https://openalex.org/W2947871760,"Acidocalcisomes are acidic calcium stores rich in polyphosphate (polyP) and are present in trypanosomes and also in a diverse range of other organisms. Ca2+ is released from these organelles through a channel, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (TbIP3R), which is essential for growth and infectivity of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. However, the mechanism by which TbIP3R controls Ca2+ release is unclear. In this work, we expressed TbIP3R in a chicken B lymphocyte cell line in which the genes for all three vertebrate IP3Rs were stably ablated (DT40–3KO). We show that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release depends on Ca2+ but not on ATP concentration and is inhibited by heparin, caffeine, and 2-aminomethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Excised patch clamp recordings from nuclear membranes of DT40 cells expressing only TbIP3R disclosed that luminal inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) or pyrophosphate (PPi), and neutral or alkaline pH can stimulate IP3-generated currents. In contrast, polyP or acidic pH did not induce these currents, and nuclear membranes obtained from cells expressing rat IP3R were unresponsive to polyP or its hydrolysis products. Our results are consistent with the notion that polyP hydrolysis products within acidocalcisomes or alkalinization of their luminal pH activate TbIP3R and Ca2+ release. We conclude that TbIP3R is well-adapted to its role as the major Ca2+ release channel of acidocalcisomes in T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W2947916837,"There is extensive evidence showing that bilinguals activate the lexical and the syntactic representations of both languages in a nonselective way. However, the extent to which the lexical and the syntactic levels of representations interact during second language (L2) sentence processing and how those interactions are modulated by L2 proficiency remain unclear. This paper aimed to directly address these issues by using an online technique (eye-tracking) that is highly sensitive to the lexical and syntactic processes involved in sentence reading. To that purpose, native-speakers of European Portuguese (EP) learning English as L2 at intermediate and advanced levels of proficiency were asked to silently read temporally ambiguous L2 relative clause (RC) sentences disambiguated with a High-Attachment (HA) or Low-Attachment (LA) strategy while their eye-movements were monitored. Since EP and English native speakers differ in the way they process and comprehend this syntactic structure (EP: HA, English: LA), HA preferences were used as a marker of L1 RC syntax interference. Additionally, the cognate status of the complex NP that preceded the RC was manipulated to further analyze how the lexical co-activation of both languages would also affect the syntactic representations of the non-target (L1) language. Results showed cognate facilitation in early and late reading time measures regardless of L2 proficiency, and also that the cognate status of the complex NP impacted L2 reading performance, particularly at lower levels of L2 proficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a bilingual reading system that seems to be highly dynamic and interactive not only within each level of processing, but, importantly, across levels of representation. They also suggested that, as the level of L2 proficiency increases, L1 RC syntax interference becomes stronger, in a syntactic parser that seems to operate in a more integrated and nonselective way, with both strategies being equally available to guide L2 reading comprehension. Results are discussed attending to the current models of bilingual syntactic processing."

In Study 1, 143 parents of infants and toddlers recruited from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and childcare centers completed a 48-item PPPAS. In Study 2, 98 parents of premature infants completed the revised 34-item PPPAS. Study 1 principal components analysis (PCA) identified three components (benefits of, barriers to, and perceived influence on PA), and the scale was reduced. Scores for Perceived Barriers to PA were significantly different between groups, U = 1,108, z = -4.777, p < .0001, with NICU parents reporting more barriers to PA than childcare parents. In Study 2, PCA revealed the same components, and the scale was further reduced to 25 items. Three subscales measuring perceived benefits of, barriers to, and influence over an infant's PA produced Cronbach's alphas of .93, .85, .81, respectively. Results demonstrated sufficient construct validity and internal consistency of PPPAS scores, supporting its use in future PA research."
https://openalex.org/W2947204165,"Certain plant genotypes can achieve optimal growth under appropriate environmental conditions. Under high planting density conditions, plants undergo competition for uptake and utilization of light and nutrients. However, the relationship between whole-genome expression patterns and the planting density in perennial woody plants remains unknown. In this study, whole-genome RNA sequencing of poplar (Populus × euramericana) was carried out at three different sampling heights to determine gene expression patterns under high (HD) and low (LD) planting densities. As a result, 4,004 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between HD and LD, of which 2,300, 701, and 1,003 were detected at the three positions, upper, middle and bottom, respectively. Function annotation results further revealed that a large number of the DEGs were involved in distinct biological functions. There were significant changes in the expression of metabolism-related and stimulus-related genes in response to planting density. There were 37 DEGs that were found at all three positions and were subsequently screened. Several DEGs related to plant light responses and photosynthesis were observed at different positions. Meanwhile, numbers of genes related to auxin/indole-3-acetic acid, and carbon and nitrogen metabolism were also revealed, displaying overall trends of upregulation under HD. These findings provide a basis for identifying candidate genes related to planting density and could increase our molecular understanding of the effect of planting density on gene expression."

Crude and adjusted Odds ratios were done for each explanatory variable at 95% confidence level.The likelihood of developing noncommunicable disease was higher among participants who drank alcohol [AOR = 1.72, 95% CI: (1.3, 2.1)] and coffee [AOR = 4.54, 95% CI: (3.4, 5.9)], did not take vegetables [AOR = 2. 30, 95% CI: (1.6, 3.1)] and fruits [AOR = 2.04, 95% CI: (1.4, 2.9)], took packed oil [AOR = 2.35, 95% CI: (1.7, 3.1)], overweight or obesity [AOR = 2.23, 95% CI: (1.3, 3.8)] and physically inactive [AOR = 1.71, 95% CI: (1.2, 2.4)].Of those assessed, the main factors associated with noncommunicable disease were drinking alcohol and coffee, not taking vegetables and fruits, taking packed oil, being overweight and physically inactive. Thus, the finding suggests changing the dietary habit of the community to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, use of unsaturated fat for cooking, to avoid consumption of alcohol and to decrease taking coffee, to do physical activity and weight reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2946846773,"Background Maternal hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are associated with an increased risk of having offspring with conotruncal heart defects (CTDs). Prior studies have identified sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with risk for each of these three adult phenotypes. We hypothesized that these same SNPs are associated with maternal risk of CTDs in offspring. Methods and results We evaluated the parents of children with a CTD ascertained from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (n = 466) and by the Pediatric Cardiac Genomic Consortium (n = 255). We used a family-based design to assess the association between CTDs and the maternal genotype for individual hypertension, T2D, and obesity-related SNPs and found no association between CTDs and the maternal genotype for any individual SNP. In addition, we calculated genetic risk scores (GRS) for hypertension, T2D, and obesity using previously published GRS formulas. When comparing the GRS of mothers to fathers, there were no statistically significant differences in the mean for the combined GRS or the GRS for each individual condition. However, when we categorized the mothers and fathers of cases with CTDs as having high (>95th percentile) or low (≤95th percentile) scores, compared to fathers, mothers had almost two times the odds of having a high GRS for hypertension (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0, 2.8) and T2D (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1, 3.1). Conclusions Our results support a link between maternal genetic risk for hypertension/T2D and CTDs in their offspring. These associations might be independent of maternal phenotype at conception."
https://openalex.org/W2947347765,"The relatively rapid inhibition of microplasmin by α2-AP leads to short functional half-life of the molecule in vivo, causing inefficient clot dissolution, even after site-specific, local catheter-based delivery. Here, we describe a PEGylation approach for improving the therapeutic potential via improving the survival of microplasmin in presence of its cognate inhibitor, α2-AP, wherein a series of strategically designed cysteine analogs of micro-plasminogen were prepared and expressed in E. coli, and further modified by covalent grafting in vitro with PEG groups of different molecular sizes so as to select single or double PEG chains that increase the molecular weight and hydrodynamic radii of the conjugates, but with a minimal discernible effect on intrinsic plasmin activity and structural framework, as explored by amidolytic activity and CD-spectroscopy, respectively. Interestingly, some of the purified PEG-coupled proteins after conversion to their corresponding proteolytically active forms were found to exhibit significantly reduced inhibition rates (up to 2-fold) by α2-AP relative to that observed with wild-type microplasmin. These results indicate an interesting, and not often observed, effect of PEG groups through reduced/altered dynamics between protease and inhibitor, likely through a steric hindrance mechanism. Thus, the present study successfully identifies single- and double-site PEGylated muteins of microplasmin with significantly enhanced functional half-life through enhanced resistance to inactivation by its in vivo plasma inhibitor. Such an increased survival of bioactivity in situ, holds unmistakable potential for therapeutic exploitation, especially in ischemic strokes where a direct, catheter-based deposition within the cranium has been shown to be promising, but is currently limited by the very short in vivo bioactive half-life of the fibrin dissolving agent/s."
https://openalex.org/W2947845385,"BACKGROUND In patients with diabetes, foot amputations among Black patients have been historically higher compared with White patients. Using the National Inpatient Sample database, we sought to determine if disparities in foot amputations and resource utilization have improved over time. We hypothesized there would be improvements and reduced differences in foot amputations between the two races as quality of care and access to healthcare has improved. METHODS AND FINDINGS Patients over 18 years old with a principal diagnosis of diabetic foot complications and secondary diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus were selected. We compared the primary outcome of foot amputations between Black and White patients. Adjusted rates, odds ratios (aOR) and trends of foot amputations among Black and White patients were studied. Healthcare utilization was measured via length of hospital stay (LOS). Of 262,924 patients, 18% were Black. Following adjustment for confounders, major foot amputations decreased among Whites (1.5% in 2003 to 1.1% in 2014) and Blacks (2.1% in 2003 to 0.9% in 2014). On pooled analysis, Black patients had higher adjusted odds of major foot amputations in 2003-2004 [aOR 1.7; (1.16-2.57), p<0.01]. Disparities in major foot amputations disappeared in 2013-2014 [aOR: 0.92 (0.58-1.44), p = 0.70]. Black patients had declining but persistently longer LOS (adjusted mean difference (aMD): 1.1 days (0.52-1.6) p<0.01 in 2003-2004 and 0.46 days (0.18-0.73) p<0.01 in 2013-2014). The main limitation of the study was that the NIS uses ICD-9 and ICD-10 CM codes, and hence prone to incorrect or missing codes. CONCLUSIONS Major foot amputations declined among Black and White patients hospitalized with Diabetic foot complications between 2003 and 2014. The observed difference for amputations in 2003-2004 was absent by 2013-2014. Future research to determine specific contributors for this reduction in health disparities is needed for ongoing improvements and sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W2947064567,"Background Children living in disadvantaged socio-economic circumstances (SEC) are more commonly victims of bullying, but pathways leading to social inequalities in being bullied are unclear. We assess how early life risk factors might mediate the increased risk of being bullied at age seven for children living in disadvantaged circumstances. Material and methods Using data from 5,857 children in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) we calculate risk ratios (RR) for being bullied at age seven (child-reported), by household income quintile. Socially patterned risk factors for being bullied relating to social networks, family relationships and child characteristics from birth to age five were adjusted for to assess if they mediated any association between SEC and being bullied. Results 48.6% of children reported having been bullied. Children living in the lowest income households were at 20% greater risk of being bullied compared to those from the highest (RR1.20, 95%CI 1.06,1.36). Controlling for social networks, family relationships and child characteristics attenuated the increased risk for children in low income households to aRR 1.19 (95%CI 1.05, 1.35), aRR 1.16 (95%CI 1.02,1.32) and aRR 1.13 (95%CI 1.00,1.28) respectively. Our final model adjusted for risk factors across all domains attenuated the RR by 45% (aRR 1.11,95%CI 0.97,1.26). Conclusions About half of children reported being bullied by age seven with a clear social gradient. The excess risk in children growing up in disadvantaged circumstances was partially explained by differences in their early years relating to their social network, family relationships and the child’s own abilities and behaviours. Policies to reduce inequalities in these risk factors may also reduce inequalities in the risk of being bullied in childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2947853774,"Background Mobile phones are increasingly associated with accidents while walking. Little is known, however, about the impact of phone messaging on the actual perception of other pedestrians. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which the detection of approaching pedestrians is affected by the sensory modality (text or audio) of phone messages in young vs. older adults. Methods Eighteen healthy young (24 ± 2.9 years) and 15 older adults (68 ± 4.2 years) performed a phone message deciphering task, an obstacle detection task, and a dual-task condition combining both tasks. Participants were tested while seated and viewing a virtual subway station (VE) in a helmet mounted display. As they were passively moved within the VE one of three virtual pedestrians randomly approached them from the center (0°), right (+40°) or left (+40°). When present, phone message conditions were delivered at obstacle movement onset and presented either as (1) text messages on the screen of a virtual phone or (2) audio messages delivered through earphones. Participants were instructed to press a joystick button as soon as they detected the approaching virtual pedestrian and to report the message content at the end of the trials. Results Young and older participants showed delayed obstacle detection times with vs. without text messages. Older adults further showed reduced accuracy of message report for texts compared to audio messages. In both groups, audio messages yielded no difference in obstacle detection time or accuracy of message report compared to the no message condition. Conclusions Findings indicate that text messages prolong the detection of approaching pedestrians, suggesting that they compromise safe ambulation in community environments. Older adults, who show larger deteriorations on the obstacle detection and message deciphering tasks, may be at even greater risk of collision. Audio messages could be a safer alternative for on-the-go communication."
https://openalex.org/W2946849019,"Extensive studies have been carried out over the years to determine the maximum acceptable weight that a worker is capable of lifting in a given situation among Occidental populations across Europe and US. Nonetheless, studies that place emphasis on using lifting frequency as the quantifying task parameter, especially in developing countries such as Malaysia, appear to be in scarcity. Hence, this study determined the maximum acceptable frequency of lift (MAFL) for combined manual material handling (MMH) tasks amongst Malaysian males.Two lifting loads were considered in this study: 1 kg and 5 kg. Each subject adjusted his frequency of lifting using a psychophysical approach. The subjects were instructed to perform combined MMH task as fast as they could over a period of 45 minutes without exhausting themselves or becoming overheated. The physiological response energy expenditure was recorded during the experimental sessions. The ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) for four body parts (forearms, upper arm, lower back and entire body) were recorded after the subjects had completed the instructed task.The mean frequencies of the MMH task had been 6.8 and 5.5 cycles/minute for lifting load of 1 and 5 kg, respectively, while the mean energy expenditure values were 4.16 and 5.62 kcal/min for 1 and 5 kg load, respectively. These displayed a significant difference in the Maximum Acceptable Frequency of Lift (MAFL) between the two loads, energy expenditure and RPE (p < 0.05) whereby the subjects appeared to work harder physiologically for heavier load.It can be concluded that it is significant to assess physiological response and RPE in determining the maximum acceptable lifting frequency at varied levels of load weight. The findings retrieved in this study can aid in designing tasks that do not exceed the capacity of workers in order to minimise the risk of WRMSDs."
https://openalex.org/W2947107300,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can not only classify images but can also generate key features, e.g., the Google neural network that learned to identify cats by simply watching YouTube videos, for the classification. In this paper, crop models are distilled by CNN to evaluate the ability of deep learning to identify the plant physiology knowledge behind such crop models simply by learning. Due to difficulty in collecting big data on crop growth, a crop model was used to generate datasets. The generated datasets were fed into CNN for distillation of the crop model. The models trained by CNN were evaluated by the visualization of saliency maps. In this study, three saliency maps were calculated using all datasets (case 1) and using datasets with spikelet sterility due to either high temperature at anthesis (case 2) or cool summer damage (case 3). The results of case 1 indicated that CNN determined the developmental index of paddy rice, which was implemented in the crop model, simply by learning. Moreover, CNN identified the important individual environmental factors affecting the grain yield. Although CNN had no prior knowledge of spikelet sterility, cases 2 and 3 indicated that CNN realized about paddy rice becoming sensitive to daily mean and maximum temperatures during specific periods. Such deep learning approaches can be used to accelerate the understanding of crop models and make the models more portable. Moreover, the results indicated that CNN can be used to develop new plant physiology theories simply by learning."
https://openalex.org/W2947920174,"Background Donor funding for HIV/AIDS services is declining in Cambodia, and domestic resources need to be mobilized to sustain and expand these services. However, the cost of delivering HIV/AIDS services is not well studied in Cambodia. This study aims to assess the costs of delivering HIV/AIDS services, identify the major components of costs, and sources of funding. Methods Four of the six highest HIV burden provinces were selected at random for this study. Within each province, four health centers and two hospitals were selected for detailed data collection. A mix of top-down and bottom-up methods were used to assess the costs for HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) from the provider perspective. We assessed the differences in the quantity and prices of inputs between health facilities of the same type to identify cost-drivers. Results The average cost per visit for HIV testing was $8.92 at health centers and $14.03 at referral hospitals. Differences in the number of visits per staff were the primary determinant of differences in the cost per visit. First-line ART costed about $250 per patient per year, and the number of patients per staff was an important cost driver. Second-line ART costed from $500 to $716 per patient per year, on average, across the types of facilities, with the quantity and mix of second-line antiretroviral drugs being an important cost driver. Inpatient care at referral and provincial hospitals in total represented less than 2 percent of costs of outpatient ART. Discussion Costs are similar to neighboring countries, but over 50% of the costs of ART are financed by donors. Cambodia now is scaling up social health insurance coverage; the data from this study could serve as one input when setting reimbursement rates for HIV/AIDS services to help ensure that providers are adequately reimbursed for their services."
https://openalex.org/W2951983079,"Background Although research has found associations between increasing number of children and higher body mass index (BMI), there has been limited research investigating the association with body composition despite abdominal fat being independently associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk. Most existing research has focussed on women, but investigating the relationship in men can help distinguish biological effects of pregnancy from social pathways related to parenthood. Methods Using the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) multiple regression models were applied to test associations between number of children and body composition at age 60–64 years (N = 2229) and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) at ages 60–64 and 69 years (N = 2149). Results In adjusted models, associations were observed between increasing numbers of children and increasing fat-adjusted lean mass index in women (p = 0.06). Among men, those with children had 0.59kg (95% CI: 0.15 to 1.02) greater lean mass index than those without and fat:lean mass ratio was greater in those with 4+ children because of their slightly higher mean fat mass. Weak evidence of a higher android:gynoid mass ratio among mothers (0.03, 95% CI: 0.00,0.06, p = 0.1) was observed with no associations with fat mass index,android or gynoid fat mass. Increasing parity in women was associated with increasing BMI at 60–64 years and, more strongly, with increasing BMI at 69 years. Associations among men were also observed more clearly with BMI at 69 years. Conclusion There was little evidence of a consistent association between number of children and body composition in early old age. The strongest associations are observed for lean, rather than fat mass, and in men rather than women, suggesting little evidence of biological effects of pregnancy. The results indicate social pathways associated with parenthood are the likely underlying mechanisms, with suggestion of selection into parenthood among men."
https://openalex.org/W2946844973,"Objectives To elucidate the effect of cinacalcet use on all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization outcomes using a prospective cohort of maintenance hemodialysis patients. Methods We used data from a prospective cohort of Japanese hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and examined baseline characteristics as well as longitudinal changes. All patients were cinacalcet-naïve at study enrollment. Further, we used a marginal structural model to account for time-varying confounders on cinacalcet initiation and hospitalization outcomes, and an Andersen-Gill–type recurrent event model to account for any recurring events of hospitalization in the outcome analysis using the weighted dataset. Results Among the 3,276 patients, cinacalcet treatment was initiated in 1,384 patients during the entire follow-up. Cinacalcet users were slightly younger, included more patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and fewer patients with diabetes, were more likely to have a history of parathyroidectomy, and were more often used receiving vitamin D receptor activator, phosphate binders, and iron supplements. The overall hospitalization analysis yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80, 1.18). A trend toward a mild protective association was observed for cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.14). In the subgroup analysis, a protective association was seen due to cinacalcet use for infection-related hospitalizations in the lowest intact parathyroid hormone group (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.95). Conclusions Cinacalcet initiation in patients on maintenance hemodialysis had no effect on all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations. Although the overall association was statistically not significant, cinacalcet may have a protective association on cardiovascular-related hospitalization in all patients and infection-related hospitalization in patient with low intact parathyroid hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2947136028,"In vivo and ex vivo sensors have the potential to aid tracking and anti-poaching endeavours and provide new insights into rhinoceros physiology and environment. However, the propagation of electromagnetic signals in rhinoceros tissue is currently not known. We present simulation and agar models of the rhinoceros that allow the investigation of electromagnetic propagation by in vivo and ex vivo devices without the need for surgery. Since the dielectric properties of rhinoceros tissue have not been documented, the conductivity and permittivity of the skin, fat, muscle, blood and other organs are first approximated by means of a meta-analysis that includes animals with similar physical properties. Subsequently, we develop anatomical models that include dermal layers, internal organs and a skeleton. We also develop a flank model that serves as an approximation of the anatomical model in certain situations. These models are used to determine the viability of communication between an in vivo device and an ex vivo device attached to the hind leg of the animal. Two types of antenna (microstrip-fed planar elliptical monopole antenna and printed inverted-F antenna) and three feasible implant locations (back, neck and chest) are considered. In addition to the computer models, phantom recipes using salt, sugar and agar are developed to match the dielectric properties of each tissue type at the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) frequencies of 403MHz, 910MHz and 2.4GHz. The average error between the measured and theoretically predicted dielectric values was 6.22% over all recipes and 4.49% for the 2.4 GHz recipe specifically. When considering the predicted efficiency of the transmitting and receiving antennas, an agreement of 67.38% was demonstrated between the computer simulations and laboratory measurements using the agar rhinoceros flank models. Computer simulations using the anatomical model of the rhinoceros indicate that the chest is the optimal implant location and that best signal propagation is achieved using the planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA). Using this configuration, the simulations indicate that communication between the implant and an ex vivo device attached to the hind leg is challenging but possible. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of factors such as the density and temperature of the phantom materials were found to be critical to the achievement of good agreement between practice and simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2947567018,"Background Several lines of evidence indicate that medical schools have been failing to adequately nurture empathy and the ethical dimension in their graduates, the lack of which may play a central role in the genesis of medical errors, itself a major source of avoidable deaths, incapacity and wasted resources. It has been widely proposed that medical schools should adopt evaluation strategies as a means to promote a culture of respectful relationships. However, it is not clear if evaluation strategies in medical schools have addressed key domains related to that aim, such as ethics, through the perspective of their students. Hence, we conducted a national survey of instruments used by Brazilian medical schools to assess clerkship rotations from the perspective of students, with a main focus on the ethical domain. Methods The authors invited 121 randomly selected institutions to participate in the study. Key informants answered a questionnaire about clerkship rotations and sent copies of any instrument used to assess the quality of clerkship rotations according to the students’ perspectives. Results Twenty-six (53%) of 49 participating schools used an instrument to assess the quality of clerkship rotations according to the perspective of students. Just 13 (27%) schools had instruments containing at least one question encompassing the ethical domain. Only 2 (4%) schools asked students specifically about the occurrence of any negative experience concerning the ethical domain during rotations. Merely 1 (2%) school asked students about having witnessed patient mistreatment and none asked about mistreatment against students themselves. Conclusions There are several missed opportunities in the way medical schools assess the quality of clerkship rotations regarding the ethical domain. Closing the gap between usual institutional discourses regarding ethics and how that dimension is assessed within clerkship rotations might represent an important step towards the improvement of medical education and healthcare systems."
