https://openalex.org/W2887570246,"Introduction Compared to young adults, older adults walk with smaller propulsive forces and a redistribution to more proximal leg muscles for power generation during push-off. Despite this deficit in propulsive function, older adults can increase push-off intensity when encouraged to via real-time biofeedback. However, the specific joint-level modifications used by older adults to enhance propulsive force generation has yet to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify the joint-level modifications used by young and older adults to modulate propulsive forces when walking at their preferred speed. Methods 9 young and 16 older adults walked at their preferred speed while visual biofeedback prompted them to modulate their propulsive forces using targets prescribed at ±10% and ±20% of their preferred value. Older adults were then divided into groups exhibiting relatively larger or smaller baseline redistribution to more proximal leg muscles for power generation. Results Neither young nor either older adult cohort modulated propulsive forces by altering their peak ankle power generation. Instead, subjects increased trailing limb extension and attenuated mechanical power demands at the hip during push-off. Older adults that had a larger baseline redistribution exhibited larger responses to enhanced push-off intensity than their peers–for example, walking with 11% less hip flexor power and 10% more trailing limb extension during push-off when exerting larger than preferred propulsive forces. Conclusion Propulsive force biofeedback that elicits larger than preferred propulsive forces also increases trailing limb extension and attenuates mechanical power demands at the hip in older adults most exhibiting a distal-to-proximal redistribution. Our results suggest that considering baseline redistribution may be important in the personalized prescription of interventions aimed at enhancing walking performance by improving push-off intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2886993029,"Lucid dreaming is a remarkable state of consciousness in which one is aware of the fact that one is dreaming while continuing to dream. Based on the strong relationship between physiological activation during rapid eye-movement sleep and lucid dreaming, our pilot research investigated whether enhancing cortical activation via acetylcholinesterease inhibition (AChEI) would increase the frequency of lucid dreams and found AChEI to be a promising method for lucid dream induction. In the current study we sought to quantify the size and reliability of the effect of AChEI on lucid dreaming, dream recall and dream content as well as to test the effectiveness of an integrated lucid dream induction protocol which combined cholinergic stimulation with other methods for lucid dream induction. Participants (N = 121) with high dream recall and an interest in lucid dreaming were randomly assigned counterbalanced orders of 3 doses of galantamine (0, 4 and 8 mg). On 3 consecutive nights, they awoke approximately 4.5 hours after lights out, recalled a dream, ingested the capsules and stayed out of bed for at least 30 minutes. Participants then returned to bed and practiced the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams technique while returning to sleep. The percentage of participants who reported a lucid dream was significantly increased for both 4 mg (27%, odds ratio = 2.29) and 8 mg doses (42%, odds ratio = 4.46) compared to the active placebo procedure (14%). Galantamine also significantly increased dream recall, sensory vividness and complexity (p<0.05). Dream recall, cognitive clarity, control, positive emotion, vividness and self-reflection were increased during lucid compared to non-lucid dreams (p<0.0001). These results show that galantamine increases the frequency of lucid dreams in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, the integrated method of taking galantamine in the last third of the night with at least 30 minutes of sleep interruption and with an appropriately focused mental set is one of the most effective methods for inducing lucid dreams available today."

A register can be used to follow-up high risk women for early intervention to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes. We evaluate the performance of the world's first national gestational diabetes register.Observational study that used data linkage to merge: (1) pathology data from the Australian states of Victoria (VIC) and South Australia (SA); (2) birth records from the Consultative Council on Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity (CCOPMM, VIC) and the South Australian Perinatal Statistics Collection (SAPSC, SA); (3) GDM and type 2 diabetes register data from the National Gestational Diabetes Register (NGDR). All pregnancies registered on CCOPMM and SAPSC for 2012 and 2013 were included-other data back to 2008 were used to support the analyses. Rates of screening for GDM, rates of registration on the NGDR, and rates of follow-up laboratory screening for type 2 diabetes are reported.Estimated GDM screening rates were 86% in SA and 97% in VIC. Rates of registration on the NGDR ranged from 73% in SA (2013) to 91% in VIC (2013). During the study period rates of screening at six weeks postpartum ranged from 43% in SA (2012) to 58% in VIC (2013). There was little evidence of recall letters resulting in screening 12 months follow-up.GDM Screening and NGDR registration was effective in Australia. Recall by mail-out to young mothers and their GP's for type 2 diabetes follow-up testing proved ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2887172576,"It is widely recognized that increasing agricultural production to the levels needed to feed an expanding world population requires sharply increased public investment in research and development and widespread adoption of new technologies, but funding for national and international agricultural research has rather declined in recent years. In this situation, priority setting has become increasingly important for allocating scarce research resources among competing needs to achieve greater impacts. Using partial equilibrium economic surplus models and poverty impact simulations, this paper assesses cassava research priorities in Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, and Asia based on the potential economic and poverty reduction impacts of alternative research and technology options. The results showed that efficient planting material production and distribution systems and sustainable crop and soil fertility management practices have the greatest expected economic and poverty reduction impacts in the three regions. Lack of clean planting materials is a major constraint to adoption and it is envisaged that efficient production and distribution systems for planting material can accelerate technology adoption by farmers. Similarly, sustainable crop and soil fertility management practices play a key role in closing the observed yield gaps, especially in Africa. The paper discusses the results of the priority assessment for key cassava research options and concludes with the implications for cassava research priorities."
https://openalex.org/W2887826759,"Mathematics is a science which can lead to both anxiety in children and teaching difficulties in teachers. Together, these two difficulties can increase the time spent in teaching and learning mathematics. The aim of this study is to examine the efficiency of a new integrated mathematics/geometry and physical activity program, specifically structured for increasing learning in fourth-grade pupils. Thirty-six children (age 10.36±0.55) were divided into an experimental (n1 = 19) group and a control (n2 = 17) group. The experimental group of subjects learned mathematics and geometry via the integrated teaching method, while the control group of subjects learned these subjects via traditional teaching methods. We administered two ad hoc tests, before and after the intervention, in order to study its effect. One test was on geometry knowledge and the other on mathematics, in which there were questions about the implemented teaching topics: rectangles, squares and their perimeters. Using a factorial 2×2 ANOVA, the results after four weeks indicated that the group of subjects who gained their mathematics and geometry knowledge through our intervention program were significantly more successful (P<0.05) than the control group. Our results suggest that the integrated teaching method proposed here could be considered a useful and efficient method for teaching mathematics and geometry based on motor tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2885109990,"Predicting species distributions requires substantial numbers of georeferenced occurrences and access to remotely sensed climate and land cover data. Reliable estimates of the distribution of most species are unavailable, either because digitized georeferenced distributional data are rare or not digitized. The emergence of online biodiversity information databases and citizen science platforms dramatically improves the amount of information available to establish current and historical distribution of lesser-documented species. We demonstrate how the combination of museum and online citizen science databases can be used to build reliable distribution maps for poorly documented species. To do so, we investigated the distribution and the potential range expansions of two north-eastern North American spider species (Arachnida: Araneae), the Northern black widow (Latrodectus variolus) and the Black purse-web spider (Sphodros niger). Our results provide the first predictions of distribution for these two species. We also found that the Northern black widow has expanded north of its previously known range providing valuable information for public health education. For the Black purse-web spider, we identify potential habitats outside of its currently known range, thus providing a better understanding of the ecology of this poorly-documented species. We demonstrate that increasingly available online biodiversity databases are rapidly expanding biogeography research for conservation, ecology, and in specific cases, epidemiology, of lesser known taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2886264338,"Although Scandinavian flint is one of the most important materials used for prehistoric stone tool production in Northern and Central Europe, a conclusive method for securely differentiating between flint sources, geologically bound to northern European chalk formations, has never been achieved. The main problems with traditional approaches concern the oftentimes high similarities of SiO2 raw materials (i.e. chert and flint) on different scales due to similar genetic conditions and higher intra- than inter-source variation. Conventional chert and flint provenance studies chiefly concentrate on visual, petrographic or geochemical investigations. Hence, attempts to generate characteristic fingerprints of particular chert raw materials were in most cases unsatisfying. Here we show that the Multi Layered Chert Sourcing Approach (MLA) achieves a clear differentiation between primary sources of Scandinavian flint. The MLA combines visual comparative studies, stereo-microscopic analyses of microfossil inclusions, geochemical trace element analyses applying LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and statistical analyses through CODA (Compositional Data Analysis). For archaeologists, provenance studies are the gateway to advance interpretations of economic behavior expressed in resource management strategies entailing the procurement, use and distribution of lithic raw materials. We demonstrate the relevance of our results for archaeological materials in a case study in which we were able to differentiate between Scandinavian flint sources and establish the provenance of historic ballast flint from a shipwreck found near Kristiansand close to the shore of southern Norway from a beach source in Northern Jutland, the Vigsø Bay."
https://openalex.org/W2886693407,"Global food security and agricultural land management represent two urgent and intimately related challenges that humans must face. We quantify the changes in the global agricultural land footprint if the world were to adhere to the dietary guidelines put forth by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), while accounting for the land use change incurred by import/export required to meet those guidelines. We analyze data at country, continental, and global levels. USDA guidelines are viewed as an improvement on the current land-intensive diet of the average American, but despite this our results show that global adherence to the guidelines would require 1 gigahectare of additional land-roughly the size of Canada-under current agricultural practice. The results also show a strong divide between Eastern and Western hemispheres, with many Western hemisphere countries showing net land sparing under a USDA guideline diet, while many Eastern hemisphere countries show net land use increase under a USDA guideline diet. We conclude that national dietary guidelines should be developed using not just health but also global land use and equity as criteria. Because global lands are a limited resource, national dietary guidelines also need to be coordinated internationally, in much the same way greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W2885399450,"Objectives Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is among the least studied risk factors for erectile dysfunction (ED). We aimed to determine ED prevalence in newly-diagnosed OSA patients, describe their main characteristics and assess continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effects on ED. Methods Cross-sectional study assessing ED prevalence in OSA patients and open-label, parallel, prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating 3-month CPAP treatment effects on sexual function, satisfaction, and psychological, hormonal and biochemical profiles. Male patients newly diagnosed with moderate/severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >20 events·h−1), aged 18–70 years, attending the sleep unit of a Spanish hospital during 2013–2016 were considered. A total of 150 patients were recruited (75 randomized ED patients). ED was defined as scores <25 on International Index Erectile Function 15 test. Wilcoxon’s matched-pairs signed-ranks and rank-sum tests were used. Results ED prevalence was 51%. Patients with ED were older (p<0.001), had greater waist-to-hip ratios (p<0.001), were more frequently undergoing pharmacological treatment (p<0.001) and had higher glucose levels (p = 0.024) than non-ED patients. Although significant increases in erectile function (mean(SD) change: +4.6(7.9); p = 0.002), overall satisfaction (+1(2.2); p = 0.035), and sexual satisfaction (+2.1(4.3); p = 0.003) were found after CPAP treatment, only differences in sexual satisfaction (p = 0.027) and erectile function (p = 0.060) were found between study arms. CPAP treatment did not impact psychological, hormonal or biochemical profiles. Conclusions This study confirmed the relationship between OSA and ED, suggesting the potential usefulness of ED screening in OSA patients, but could not determine conclusively whether CPAP is an effective stand-alone ED treatment, regardless of positive results on sexual satisfaction.

https://openalex.org/W2887078221,"Shark jaws exhibit teeth that are arranged into distinct series and files and display great diversities in shapes and structures, which not only is related to their function (grasping, cutting, crushing) during feeding, but also bear a strong phylogenetic signal. So far, most research on the relationship between shark teeth and feeding ecology and systematics focused on the external tooth morphology only. Although the tooth histology of sharks has been examined since the early 19th century, its functional and systematic implications are still ambiguous. Shark teeth normally consist of either a porous, cellular dentine, osteodentine (in lamniform sharks and some batoids) or a dense layer of orthodentine (known from different sharks). Sharks of the order Carcharhiniformes, comprising ca. 60% of all extant shark species, are known to have orthodont teeth, with a single exception—the snaggletooth shark, Hemipristis elongata. High resolution micro-CT images of jaws and teeth from selected carcharhiniform sharks (including extant and fossil snaggletooth sharks) and tooth sections of teeth of Hemipristis, other carcharhiniform and lamniform sharks, have revealed that (1) Hemipristis is indeed the only carcharhiniform shark filling its pulp cavity with osteodentine in addition to orthodentine, (2) the tooth histology of Hemipristis elongata differs from the osteodont histotype, which evolved in lamniform sharks and conversely represents a modified orthodonty, and (3) this modified orthodonty was already present in extinct Hemipristis species but the mineralization sequence has changed over time. Our results clearly show the presence of a third tooth histotype—the pseudoosteodont histotype, which is present in Hemipristis. The unique tooth histology of lamniform sharks might provide a phylogenetic signal for this group, but more research is necessary to understand the phylogenetic importance of tooth histology in sharks in general."
https://openalex.org/W2885506073,"Aflatoxins (AF) can be cumulative in fish tissues and can influence weight, length, feed intake and survival depending on the species. The aim of this work is to measure performance and aflatoxin levels in tissues of matrinxã (Brycon cephalus) fish chronically exposed to aflatoxin. Aflatoxin was incorporated into fish diets at the following levels: Control Feed + 0 μg AFB1 kg-1; A. Feed + 10 μg AFB1 kg-1; B. Feed + 20 μg AFB1 kg-1; C. Feed + 50 μg AFB1 kg-1. It was used one tank per treatment, each one with 150 juvenile fish, and three replicates within each tank were used for sampling, that was carried out monthly over a period of six months. Aflatoxin was quantified by HPLC in fish liver and muscle after clean up using immunoaffinity columns. Performance was evaluated by using weight, length, consumption and survival rate. Muscle and liver aflatoxin levels were below the limit of detection in all control samples. Aflatoxins B2, G1 and G2 were not detected in any tissues. Traces (values between limits of detection and quantification) of AFB1 were observed in liver tissue in treatment A from day 30 through 90, reaching 0.32 μg AFB1 kg-1 at 150 days of exposure. Treatment B presented traces up to day 60 and had, with a maximum level of 0.39 μg AFB1 kg-1 at 150 days of exposure. Treatment C had aflatoxin residues after day 30, with values ranging from 0.17 to 0.61 μg AFB1 kg-1 during exposure. Muscle samples only had traces of AFB1 in all treatments. Fish was affected by exposure to AFB1 with higher values (P<0.05) for weight and length in treatments A, B and C relative to controls. Therefore, results indicate that matrinxã do not accumulate AFB1 residues in edible tissues, but chronic exposure affects the species."
https://openalex.org/W2885735275,"Because hornworts occupy a pivotal position in early land colonization as sister to other bryophytes, sister to tracheophytes, or sister to all other land plants, a renewed interest has arisen in their phylogenetic diversity, morphology, and genomes. To date, only five organellar genome sequences are available for hornworts. We sequenced the plastome (155,956 bp) and mitogenome (212,153 bp) of the hornwort Leiosporoceros dussii, the sister taxon to all hornworts. The Leiosporoceros organellar genomes show conserved gene structure and order with respect to the other hornworts and other bryophytes. Additionally, using RNA-seq data we quantified the frequency of RNA-editing events (the canonical C-to-U and the reverse editing U-to-C) in both organellar genomes. In total, 109 sites were found in the plastome and 108 in the mitogenome, respectively. The proportion of edited sites corresponds to 0.06% of the plastome and 0.05% of the mitogenome (in reference to the total genome size), in contrast to 0.58% of edited sites in the plastome of Anthoceros angustus (161,162 bp). All edited sites in the plastome and 88 of 108 sites in the mitogenome are C-to-U conversions. Twenty reverse edited sites (U-to-C conversions) were found in the mitogenome (17.8%) and none in the plastome. The low frequency of RNA editing in Leiosporoceros, which is nearly 88% less than in the plastome of Anthoceros and the mitogenome of Nothoceros, indicates that the frequency of RNA editing has fluctuated during hornwort diversification. Hornworts are a pivotal land plant group to unravel the genomic implications of RNA editing and its maintenance despite the evident evolutionary disadvantages."
https://openalex.org/W2887934894,"Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly applied to cardiovascular (CV) medicine in arenas ranging from genomics to cardiac imaging analysis. Cardiac Phase Space Tomography Analysis (cPSTA), employing machine-learned linear models from an elastic net method optimized by a genetic algorithm, analyzes thoracic phase signals to identify unique mathematical and tomographic features associated with the presence of flow-limiting coronary artery disease (CAD). This novel approach does not require radiation, contrast media, exercise, or pharmacological stress. The objective of this trial was to determine the diagnostic performance of cPSTA in assessing CAD in patients presenting with chest pain who had been referred by their physician for coronary angiography.This prospective, multicenter, non-significant risk study was designed to: 1) develop machine-learned algorithms to assess the presence of CAD (defined as one or more ≥ 70% stenosis, or fractional flow reserve ≤ 0.80) and 2) test the accuracy of these algorithms prospectively in a naïve verification cohort. This report is an analysis of phase signals acquired from 606 subjects at rest just prior to angiography. From the collective phase signal data, features were extracted and paired with the known angiographic results. A development set, consisting of signals from 512 subjects, was used for machine learning to determine an algorithm that correlated with significant CAD. Verification testing of the algorithm was performed utilizing previously untested phase signals from 94 subjects.The machine-learned algorithm had a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI: 74%-100%) and specificity of 62% (95% CI: 51%-74%) on blind testing in the verification cohort. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 96% (95% CI: 85%-100%).These initial multicenter results suggest that resting cPSTA may have comparable diagnostic utility to functional tests currently used to assess CAD without requiring cardiac stress (exercise or pharmacological) or exposure of the patient to radioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2887458809,"The middle and lower portions of the Yangtze River basin is the most species-rich region for freshwater mussels in Asia. The management and conservation of the taxa in this region has been greatly hampered by the lack of a well-developed phylogeny and species-level taxonomic framework. In this study, we tested the utility of two mitochondrial genes commonly used as DNA barcodes: the first subunit of the cytochrome oxidase c gene (COI) and the first subunit of the NADH dehydrogenase gene (ND1) for 34 putative species representing 15 genera, and also generated phylogenetic hypotheses for Chinese unionids based on the combined dataset of the two mitochondrial genes. The results showed that both loci performed well as barcodes for species identification, but the ND1 sequences provided better resolution when compared to COI. Based on the two-locus dataset, Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses indicated 3 of the 15 genera of Chinese freshwater mussels examined were polyphyletic. Additionally, the analyses placed the 15 genera into 3 subfamilies: Unioninae (Aculamprotula, Cuneopsis, Nodularia and Schistodesmus), Gonideninae (Lamprotula, Solenaia and Ptychorhychus) and Anodontinae (Cristaria, Arconaia, Acuticosta, Lanceolaria, Anemina and Sinoanodonta). Our results contradict previous taxonomic classification that placed the genera Arconaia, Acuticosta and Lanceolaria in the Unioninae. This study represents one of the first attempts to develop a molecular phylogenetic framework for the Chinese members of the Unionidae and will provide a basis for future research on the evolution, ecology, and conservation of Chinese freshwater mussels."
https://openalex.org/W2887835822,"Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common ICU-acquired infection. Recently, the incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) has substantially increased in critically ill patients. Identifying patients at risk for VAP related to ESBLE could be helpful to improve the rate of appropriate initial antibiotic treatment, and to reduce unnecessary exposure to carbapenems. The primary objective was to identify risk factors for VAP related to ESBLE. Secondary objective was to determine the impact of ESBLE on outcome in VAP patients.This retrospective study was conducted in a single mixed intensive care unit (ICU), during a 4-year period. All patients with confirmed VAP were included. VAP was defined using clinical, radiologic and quantitative microbiological data. VAP first episodes were prospectively identified using the continuous surveillance data. Exposure to different risk factors was taken into account until the diagnosis of ESBLE VAP or until ICU discharge, in patients with ESBLE VAP and VAP related to other bacteria, respectively. In all patients, routine screening for ESBLE (rectal swab) was performed at ICU admission and once a week. Patients with ESBLE VAP were compared with those with VAP related to other bacteria using univariate analysis. All significant factors were included in the multivariate logistic regression model.Among the 410 patients with VAP, 43 (10.5%) had ESBLE VAP, 76 (19%) patients had polymicrobial VAP and 189 (46%) had VAP related to multidrug resistant bacteria. Multivariate analysis identified prior ESBLE colonization of the digestive tract as the only independent risk factor for ESBLE VAP (OR [95% CI] = 23 [10-55], p < 0.001). Whilst the positive predictive value of ESBLE digestive colonization was low (43.6%), its negative predictive value was excellent (97.3%) in predicting ESBLE VAP. Duration of mechanical ventilation (median [IQR], 28 [18,42] vs 23 [15,42] d, p = 0.4), length of ICU stay (31 [19,53] vs 29 [18,46] d, p = 0.6), and mortality rates (55.8% vs 50%, p = 0.48) were similar in ESBLE VAP, compared with VAP related to other bacteria.Digestive tract colonization related to ESBLE is independently associated with ESBLE VAP. Its excellent negative predictive value suggests that patients without ESBLE colonization should not receive carbapenems as part of their initial empirical treatment to cover ESBLE."
https://openalex.org/W2887656318,"Background The UK National Health Service is striving to improve access to palliative care for patients with advanced cancer however limited information exists on the level of palliative care support currently provided in the UK. We aimed to establish the duration and intensity of palliative care received by patients with advanced cancer and identify which cancer patients are missing out. Methods Retrospective cancer registry, primary care and secondary care data were obtained and linked for 2474 patients who died of cancer between 2010 and 2012 within a large metropolitan UK city. Associations between the type, duration, and amount of palliative care by demographic characteristics, cancer type, and therapies received were assessed using Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multinomial multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the odds of receiving community and/or hospital palliative care compared to no palliative care by demographic characteristics, cancer type, and therapies received. Results Overall 64.6% of patients received palliative care. The average palliative care input was two contacts over six weeks. Community palliative care was associated with more palliative care events (p<0.001) for a longer duration (p<0.001). Patients were less likely to receive palliative care if they were: male (p = 0.002), aged 80 years or over (p<0.05), diagnosed with lung cancer (p<0.05), had not received an opioid prescription (p<0.001), or had not received chemotherapy (p<0.001). Patients given radiotherapy were more likely to receive community only palliative care compared to no palliative care (Odds Ratio = 1.49, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.16–1.90). Conclusion Timely supportive care for cancer patients is advocated but these results suggest that older patients and those who do not receive anti-cancer treatment or opioid analgesics miss out. These patients should be targeted for assessment to identify unmet needs which could benefit from palliative care input."
https://openalex.org/W2886071289,"Isoetes are ancient quillworts members of the only genus of the order Isoetales. The genus is slow evolving but is resilient, and widespread worldwide. Two recently described species occur in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon, Isoetes serracarajensis and Isoetes cangae. They are found in the ironstone grasslands known as Canga. While I. serracarajensis is present mostly in seasonal water bodies, I. cangae is known to occur in a single permanent lake at the South mountain range. In this work, we undertake an extensive morphological, physiological and genetic characterization of both species to establish species boundaries and better understand the morphological and genetic features of these two species. Our results indicate that the morphological differentiation of the species is subtle and requires a quantitative assessment of morphological elements of the megaspore for diagnosis. We did not detect differences in microspore output, but morphological peculiarities may establish a reproductive barrier. Additionally, genetic analysis using DNA barcodes and whole chloroplast genomes indicate that although the plants are genetically very similar both approaches provide diagnostic characters. There was no indication of population structuring I. serracarajensis. These results set the basis for a deeper understanding of the evolution of the Isoetes genus."
https://openalex.org/W2886901196,"The innate immune system plays a critical role in the initial antiviral response. However, the timing and duration of these responses must be tightly regulated during infection to ensure appropriate immune cell activation and anti-viral defenses. Here we demonstrate that during antiviral response, a negative regulator miR-221 was also induced in an ELF4-dependent manner. We further show that ELF4 promotes miR-221 expression through direct binding to its promoter. Overexpression and knockdown assay show that miR-221 can negatively regulate IFNβ production in time of virus infection. RNA-seq analysis of miR-221 overexpressed cells revealed multiple candidate targets. Taken together, our study identified a novel negative microRNA regulator of innate antiviral response, which is dependent on ELF4."
https://openalex.org/W2887638996,"Background Non-coding RNAs (i.e., miRNAs) play a role in the development of obesity and related comorbidities and the regulation of body weight. Objective To identify candidate miRNA biomarkers throughout omics approaches in order to predict the response to specific weight-loss dietary treatments. Design Genomic DNA and cDNA isolated from white blood cells of a subset from the RESMENA nutritional intervention study (Low-responders (LR) vs High-responders (HR)) was hybridized in Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip and in Illumina Human HT-12 v4 gene expression BeadChips arrays respectively. A bioinformatic prediction of putative target sites of selected miRNAs was performed by applying miRBase algorithms. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors containing the 3’-UTR of candidate genes to validate the binding of miRNAs to its target sites. Results 134 miRNAs were differentially methylated between HR and LR in the methylation array, whereas 44 miRNAs were differentially expressed between both groups in the expression array. Specifically, miR-1237, miR-1976, miR-642, miR-636, miR-612 and miR-193B were simultaneously hypomethylated and overexpressed in HR. miR-612 and miR-1976 showed greatest differences in methylation and expression levels, respectively. The bioinformatic prediction revealed that TP53 was a putative target gene of miR-612 and CD40 of miR-1976. Moreover, TP53 was downregulated in the expression array when comparing HR vs LR expression levels adjusted by sex, diet, age and baseline weight, and CD40 showed a statistical trend. Furthermore, gene expression levels of TP53 and CD40 in white blood cells, when measured by qPCR, were also downregulated in HR. Finally, miR-612 and miR-1976 potently repressed TP53 and CD40 respectively by targeting its 3’-UTR regions. Conclusion miR-612 and miR-1976 levels could be prospective biomarkers of response to specific weight-loss diets and might regulate the gene expression of TP53 and CD40."
https://openalex.org/W2887338989,"During prolonged running, the magnitude of Achilles tendon (AT) length change may increase, resulting in increased tendon strain energy return with each step. AT elongation might also affect the magnitude of triceps surae (TS) muscle shortening and shortening velocity, requiring greater activation and increased muscle energy cost. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the tendon strain energy return and muscle energy cost necessary to allow energy storage to occur prior to and following prolonged running. 14 trained male (n = 10) and female (n = 4) distance runners (24±4 years, 1.72±0.09 m, 61±10 kg, 64.6±5.8 ml•kg-1•min-1) ran 90 minutes (RUN) at approximately 85% of lactate threshold speed (sLT). Prior to and following RUN, AT stiffness and running energy cost (Erun) at 85% sLT were determined. AT energy return was calculated from AT stiffness, measured with dynamometry and ultrasound and estimated TS force during stance. TS energy cost was estimated on the basis of AT force and assumed crossbridge mechanics and energetics. Following RUN, AT stiffness was reduced from 328±172 N•mm-1 to 299±148 N•mm-1 (p = 0.022). Erun increased from 4.56±0.32 J•kg-1•m-1 to 4.62±0.32 J•kg-1•m-1 (p = 0.049). Estimated AT energy return was not different following RUN (p = 0.99). Estimated TS muscle energy cost increased significantly by 11.8±12.3 J•stride-1, (p = 0.0034), accounting for much of the post-RUN increase in Erun (8.6±14.5 J•stride-1,r2 = 0.31). These results demonstrate that a prolonged, submaximal run can reduce AT stiffness and increase Erun in trained runners, and that the elevated TS energy cost contributes substantially to the elevated Erun."

With the aim of preventing severe influenza illness, the World Health Organization (WHO) includes pregnant women as a target group for seasonal influenza vaccination. However, influenza vaccine uptake during pregnancy remains low in many countries, including Spain. The objectives of this study were to increase the evidence of pregnancy as a risk factor for severe influenza illness and to study the potential role of seasonal influenza vaccination in the prevention of severe outcomes in infected pregnant women. Using information from the surveillance of Severe Hospitalized Confirmed Influenza Cases (SHCIC) in Spain, from seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16, we estimated that pregnant women in our study had a relative risk of hospitalization with severe influenza nearly 7.8 times higher than non-pregnant women of reproductive age. Only 5 out of 167 pregnant women with known vaccination status in our study had been vaccinated (3.6%). Such extremely low vaccination coverage only allowed obtaining crude estimates suggesting a protective effect of the vaccine against influenza complications (ICU admission or death). Our overall results support that pregnant women could benefit from seasonal influenza vaccination, in line with national and international recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W2886578185,"The Bermuda fireworm Odontosyllis enopla exhibits an extremely tight circalunar circadian behavior that results in an impressive bioluminescent mating swarm, thought to be due to a conventional luciferase-mediated oxidation of a light-emitting luciferin. In addition, the four eyes become hypertrophied and heavily pigmented, and the nephridial system is modified to store and release gametes and associated secretions. In an effort to elucidate transcripts related to bioluminescence, circadian or circalunar periodicity, as well as epitoky-related changes of the eyes and nephridial system, we examined the transcriptomic profile of three female O. enopla during a bioluminescent swarm in Ferry Reach, Bermuda. Using the well-characterized luciferase gene of the Japanese syllid Odontosyllis undecimdonta as a reference, a complete best-matching luciferase open reading frame (329 amino acids in length) was found in all three individuals analyzed in addition to numerous other paralogous sequences in this new gene family. No photoproteins were detected. We also recovered a predicted homolog of 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (268 amino acids in length) that best matched luciferase of the firefly Luciola with the best predicted template being the crystal structure of luciferase for Photinus pyralis, the common eastern firefly. A wide variety of genes associated with periodicity were recovered including predicted homologs of clock, bmal1, period, and timeless. Several genes corresponding to putative epitoky-related changes of the eyes were recovered including predicted homologs of a phototransduction gene, a retinol dehydrogenase and carotenoid isomerooxygenase as well as a visual perception related retinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase. Genes correlating to putative epitoky-related changes of the nephridia included predicted homologs of nephrocystin-3 and an egg-release sex peptide receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2886687698,"The relationship between oil price and investor sentiment is crucial to economic activity. Disentangling the shocks in crude oil price by structural VAR model, this paper analyzes the interaction between oil price shocks and investor sentiment by linear and nonlinear causality approach, TVP-VAR mode and NARDL model. The results reveal that changes of oil-specific demand shock not only linearly but also nonlinearly cause changes of investor sentiment while there is no significant link between other oil shocks (oil supply shock and aggregate demand shock) and investor sentiment. In addition, the study discovers that the oil-specific demand shock generally positively affects investor sentiment over time, and it has positive and asymmetric effects on investor sentiment in the short-run. In other words, it is the negative oil-specific demand shock rather than the positive component that has the significant impact on investor sentiment for short-run. This study could enrich current theories on the interaction between oil price and investor sentiment and serve as a supplement to current literature."
https://openalex.org/W2886970704,"A novel small molecule named tuftsin-phosphorylcholine (TPC), which is linked to the biological activity of helminths, was constructed. The current study address the effect of TPC treatment in established collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice and propose TPC bi-functional activity. TPC treatment was initiated when clinical score was 2 to 4. Arthritis scores in TPC treated mice were lower compared to mice treated with vehicle (P < 0.001). Joint staining showed normal joint structure in TPC-treated mice compared to control groups treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), phosphorylcholine, or tuftsin, which exhibited severely inflamed joints. TPC enhanced anti-inflammatory response due to increased IL-10 secretion, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-1-β, IL-6, TNF-αP < 0.001). Furthermore, TPC therapy increased expansion of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+T regulatory cells and IL-10+CD5+CD1d+B regulatory cells. We propose that the immunomodulatory activity of TPC can be a result of a bi-specific activity of TPC: (a) The tuftsin part of the TPC shifts RAW macrophage cells from pro-inflammatory macrophages M1 to anti-inflammatory M2-secreting IL-10 (P < 0.001) through neuropilin-1 and (b) TPC significantly reduce mouse TLR4 expression via NFkB pathway by HEKTM cells (P < 0.02) via the phosphorylcholine site of the molecule. Our results indicate that TPC, significantly ameliorated established CIA by its immunomodulatory activity. These data could lead to a novel self bi-functional small molecule for treating patients with progressive RA."
https://openalex.org/W2887908314,"Ant–diaspore interactions are directly related to fruit consumption, seed predation and dispersal, being determinant for the plant fitness. However, although abundant and diversified, these ecological interactions have been neglected in network studies. Understanding the structure of these networks is the first step in preserving these ecological functions. However, describing the network structure is not enough; we need to understand what mechanisms are behind the network patterns. In this study, for the first time, we describe the structure of the ant–diaspore network, considering only the interactions that can benefit plants, separating it into fruit consumption and diaspore removal networks in the Brazilian Savanna. We postulated that ant–diaspore interactions tend to be more specialized in the diaspore removal network compared to the fruit consumption network. Furthermore, we tested whether morphological features, such as size of mandibles of ants and diaspores, could modulate these ecological networks. Overall, we recorded 24 ant and 29 plant species interacting. We found that fruit consumption and diaspore removal networks exhibited similar patterns of interactions (i.e., non-modular), although only the diaspore removal network was nested. The diaspore removal network did not show a more specialized pattern than the fruit consumption network, since both networks consisted of opportunistic interactions. We found that ant mandible and diaspore size does not explain the structure of ecological networks, but in diaspore removal networks the relationship between these morphological traits may explain the pattern of interactions. Thus, we showed that mandible size of ants may have implications on seedling recruitment, suggesting that mandible size can predict possible effects on plant fitness within in diaspore removal networks. Overall, ant–diaspore networks maintain important ecological functions, such as fruit consumption and seed dispersal, which often implies an increase in reproductive success of the plants."
https://openalex.org/W2885287164,"Collective decision-making plays a central role in group-living animals and can be crucial to the survival of a group and the fitness of its members. As group-level properties emerge from individual decisions, personality variation can be a major determinant of collective behaviours. Here, we explore the relationship between personality and social interactions to explain the speed and cohesion of collective decision making during the aggregation process of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana). We composed groups solely with shy individuals (spending a long time sheltered) or bold individuals (spending a short time sheltered) and tested them in a binary setup (arena with two shelters) for 3 consecutive days. We analysed the shelter use of individuals and groups to compare behavioural consistency among days and analyse the collective decision-making process. Contrary to the bold groups, shy groups had a faster aggregation process with more individuals sheltered mainly because shy individuals found the shelter more rapidly. Moreover, we show that personality is modulated by social interactions. We show high behavioural plasticity in bold groups, where some individuals act shy. This also suggests that learning and regulation mechanisms may take place. This study sheds some light on the implications of individual personality for collective decision making and the key role of shy individuals in gregarious species, such as P. americana."
https://openalex.org/W2885470638,"Indigenous cattle in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, provide abundant genetic resources. However, their genetic diversity and population structure remain largely unknown, especially on the genome-wide scale. In the present study, we successfully employed the restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach (RADseq) to explore genome-wide SNPs among six breeds of Sichuan cattle. A total of 238,725 high-confidence SNPs were finally obtained with a mean distance of 11,140 bp between two adjacent sites, and 43.4% were revealed to be novel in comparison with a public reference database of genetic variants. The mean nucleotide diversity and polymorphism information content (PIC) among all six breeds were 0.1878 and 0.1555, respectively. Pingwu and Ganzi cattle showed the highest and lowest genetic diversity, respectively. The inter-breed comparisons revealed that Ganzi and Ebian cattle were obviously separate from the others. Our reference set of genome-wide SNPs specific to indigenous cattle in Sichuan is the first of its kind. Moreover, our set can be used to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure and for genome-wide association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2887168701,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells express increased levels of the pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8), which promotes their proliferation and migration. Because TNBC patients are unresponsive to current targeted therapies, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. While proteasome inhibition by bortezomib (BZ) or carfilzomib (CZ) has been effective in treating hematological malignancies, it has been less effective in solid tumors, including TNBC, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we report that proteasome inhibition significantly increases expression of IL-8, and its receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, in TNBC cells. Suppression or neutralization of the BZ-induced IL-8 potentiates the BZ cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effect in TNBC cells. The IL-8 expression induced by proteasome inhibition in TNBC cells is mediated by IκB kinase (IKK), increased nuclear accumulation of p65 NFκB, and by IKK-dependent p65 recruitment to IL-8 promoter. Importantly, inhibition of IKK activity significantly decreases proliferation, migration, and invasion of BZ-treated TNBC cells. These data provide the first evidence demonstrating that proteasome inhibition increases the IL-8 signaling in TNBC cells, and suggesting that IKK inhibitors may increase effectiveness of proteasome inhibitors in treating TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2886477341,"Numerous studies in the field of embodied cognition have shown a crosstalk between language and sensorimotor processes. In particular, it has been demonstrated that perceiving an action influences subsequent language processing. However, when studying the effect of action observation on language processing it has not been considered whether the context of action presentation could modulate this influence. To test this assumption, the participants in our study observed a prime, specifically a cartoon picture of a person performing an action in either a usual or an unusual context, and then had to perform a semantic decision task involving action verbs that could be congruent or incongruent with the action in the prime. Data analyses showed a significant difference on response times for congruent action verbs compared with incongruent action verbs in the usual context, whereas no difference was observed in the unusual context. This finding indicates that the influence of action observation on language appears only with usual actions, suggesting that the context of action presentation is crucial to enable the influence of action observation on action verbs processing."
https://openalex.org/W2885796941,"In the health sector, questions are being raised about the possible threats to the accepted principles of ethics such as autonomy, beneficence, non malfeasance and justice in the delivery of health care. There is limited information in Ethiopia regarding to practice of code of ethics among medical doctors. Hence, this study aimed to assess practice of code of ethics and associated factors among medical doctors working in governmental and private hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Institution based cross sectional quantitative study triangulated with qualitative study was conducted among 500 medical doctors working in governmental and private hospitals and three key informants from Federal Ministry of Health, Ethiopian Food, Medicine and Healthcare Administration and Control Authority and Ethiopian Medical Association in Addis Ababa from May 8, 2017 to June 30, 2017. Data were collected using pretested self-administered structured questionnaire and semi-structured questionnaire. Binary Logistic Regression and Content Analysis methods were used for the quantitative and qualitative data analysis respectively.The study showed that only 152 (30.4%) of medical doctors had good practice of code of ethics. The odds of having good practice of code of ethics among medical doctors in the age group of 25-29 years were 2.749 times the odds of those in the age group of 30-34 years (AOR = 2.749, 95% CI: 1.483, 5.096), medical doctors working in governmental hospitals were 65.4% less likely to have good practice of code of ethics compared to those working in private hospitals (AOR = 0.346, 95% CI: 0.184, 0.652), knowledgeable medical doctors were 83.5% more likely to have good practice of code of ethics compared to those who were not knowledgeable about code of ethics (AOR = 1.835, 95% CI: 0.999, 3.368), and the odds of having good practice of code of ethics among medical doctors with favourable attitude were 7.404 times the odds of those with unfavourable attitude towards code of ethics (AOR = 7.404, 95% CI: 4.254, 12.887). Furthermore lack of motivation, unfavorable working environment, working at various health facilities simultaneously, public awareness, taking courses on medical ethics, lack of unethical conduct reporting and complaint handling system, incompetence of medical doctors, and weak collaboration among key stakeholders were identified as determinants of practice of code of ethics.Only 30.4% of medical doctors had good practice of code of ethics. This indicates that practice of code of ethics among medical doctors in Addis Ababa is poor. The factors associated with practice of code of ethics were age, type of hospital, knowledge, attitude, lack of motivation, unfavorable working environment, working at various health facilities simultaneously, public awareness, medical ethics course, lack of unethical conduct reporting and compliant handling system, incompetence of medical doctors and weak collaboration among key stakeholders. Hence, awareness creation and attitudinal change on code of ethics by continuous training, implementation of integrated medical ethics course, enforcement of code of ethics and continuing professional development (CPD) implementation are important."
https://openalex.org/W2886844690,"Zebu cattle (Bos taurus indicus) are highly adapted to tropical regions. However, females reach puberty after taurine heifers, which affects the economic efficiency of beef cattle breeding in the tropical regions. The aims of this study were to establish associations between the haplotype alleles of the bovine genome and age at first calving (AFC) in the Nelore cattle, and to identify the genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to this phenotype. A total of 2,273 Nelore cattle (995 males and 1,278 females) genotyped using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip were used in the current study. The association analysis included females with valid first calving records as well as open heifers. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis among the markers was performed using blocks of 5, 10, and 15 markers, which were determined by sliding windows shifting one marker at a time. Then, the haplotype block size to be used in the association study was chosen based on the highest r2 average among the SNPs in the block. The five HapAlleles most strongly associated with the trait (top five) were considered as significant associations. The results of the analysis revealed four genomic regions related to AFC, which overlapped with 20 QTL of the reproductive traits reported previously. Furthermore, there were 19 genes related to reproduction in those regions. In conclusion, the use of haplotypes allowed the detection of chromosomal regions associated with AFC in Nelore cattle, and provided the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying this trait."
https://openalex.org/W2887816392,"Background Road accidents are one of the main causes of death around the world and yet, from a time-space perspective, they are a rare event. To help us prevent accidents, a metric to determine the level of concentration of road accidents in a city could aid us to determine whether most of the accidents are constrained in a small number of places (hence, the environment plays a leading role) or whether accidents are dispersed over a city as a whole (hence, the driver has the biggest influence). Methods Here, we apply a new metric, the Rare Event Concentration Coefficient (RECC), to measure the concentration of road accidents based on a mixture model applied to the counts of road accidents over a discretised space. A test application of a tessellation of the space and mixture model is shown using two types of road accident data: an urban environment recorded in London between 2005 and 2014 and a motorway environment recorded in Mexico between 2015 and 2016. Findings In terms of their concentration, about 5% of the road junctions are the site of 50% of the accidents while around 80% of the road junctions expect close to zero accidents. Accidents which occur in regions with a high accident rate can be considered to have a strong component related to the environment and therefore changes, such as a road intervention or a change in the speed limit, might be introduced and their impact measured by changes to the RECC metric. This new procedure helps us identify regions with a high accident rate and determine whether the observed number of road accidents at a road junction has decreased over time and hence track structural changes in the road accident settings."
https://openalex.org/W2887593917,"The emergence of functional specialization is a core problem in biology. In this work we focus on the emergence of reproductive (germ) and vegetative viability-enhancing (soma) cell functions (or germ-soma specialization). We consider a group of cells and assume that they contribute to two different evolutionary tasks, fecundity and viability. The potential of cells to contribute to fitness components is traded off. As embodied in current models, the curvature of the trade-off between fecundity and viability is concave in small-sized organisms and convex in large-sized multicellular organisms. We present a general mathematical model that explores how the division of labor in a cell colony depends on the trade-off curvatures, a resource constraint and different fecundity and viability rates. Moreover, we consider the case of different trade-off functions for different cells. We describe the set of all possible solutions of the formulated mathematical programming problem and show some interesting examples of optimal specialization strategies found for our objective fitness function. Our results suggest that the transition to specialized organisms can be achieved in several ways. The evolution of Volvocalean green algae is considered to illustrate the application of our model. The proposed model can be generalized to address a number of important biological issues, including the evolution of specialized enzymes and the emergence of complex organs."
https://openalex.org/W2887498956,"In sub Saharan Africa, the epidemiology, including the distribution of serogroups of strains of N. meningitidis is poorly investigated in countries outside ""the meningitis belt"". This study was conducted with the aim to determine the distribution of serogroups of strains of N. meningitidis causing meningococcal meningitis in children and adults in Mozambique.A total of 106 PCR confirmed Neisseria meningitidis Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) samples or isolates were obtained from the biobank of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) surveillance being implemented by the National Institute of Health, at three central hospitals in Mozambique, from January to December 2014. Serogroups of N. meningitidis were determined using conventional PCR, targeting siaD gene for Neisseria meningitidis. Outer Membrane Proteins (OMP) Genotyping was performed by amplifying porA gene in nine samples.Of the 106 PCR confirmed Neisseria meningitidis samples, the most frequent serotype was A (50.0%, 53/106), followed by W/Y (18.9%, 20/106), C (8.5%, 9/106), X (7.5%, 8/106) and B (0.9%, 1/106). We found non-groupable strains in a total of 15 (14.2%) samples. PorA genotypes from nine strains showed expected patterns with the exception of two serogroup C strains with P1.19,15,36 and P1.19-36,15 and one serogroup X with P1.19,15,36, variants frequently associated to serogroup B.Our data shows that the number of cases of meningococcal meningitis routinely reported in central hospitals in Mozambique is significant and the most dominant serogroup is A. In conclusion, although serogroup A has almost been eliminated from the ""meningitis belt"", this serogroup remains a major concern in countries outside the belt such as Mozambique."
https://openalex.org/W2886738802,"The circulation of poor quality medicines, especially in the developing countries, is a public health concern. Compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMP) is essential to ensure the quality, efficacy, and safety of medicines. This study evaluated the outcomes of the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency's (ANVISA) international inspections of two years (2015 and 2016) and compared these to those of other regulatory authorities. The information from 255 inspection reports was analyzed, and the type and extent of deficiencies were collected. In the period evaluated, 62.75% of ANVISA-inspected companies were classified as GMP ""satisfactory,"" 24.71% were classified as having ""on demand"" status, and 12.55% of inspections concluded that the company did not comply with Brazilian GMP regulations (""unsatisfactory""). The most common areas of deficiency were documentation (28.63%) and premises (26.27%). The pattern of deficiencies was similar to the findings of other regulatory agencies. However, ANVISA detected a more significant number of non-compliance results than other authorities, which may be caused by differences in classifications adopted by each Agency. Furthermore, manufacturers inspected by ANVISA may follow different standards and practices for products manufactured for the Brazilian market. Disclosure of main GMP deficiencies found can be useful for encouraging the industry to comply with GMP, and additional guidelines in the specific areas where deficiencies are often identified may be useful to industry to improve GMP compliance. Harmonization of GMP guidelines and inspection procedures are the key steps to avoid duplicate work, but regulatory authorities also need to work together to enforce the proper level of GMP compliance by pharmaceutical manufacturers, assuring high quality and safe medicines supply."
https://openalex.org/W2886652142,"We investigated the molecular phylogenetic divergence and historical biogeography of the gall-inducing micromoth Eucecidoses minutanus Brèthes (Cecidosidae) in the Neotropical region, which inhabits a wide range and has a particular life history associated with Schinus L. (Anacardiaceae). We characterize patterns of genetic variation based on 2.7 kb of mitochondrial DNA sequences in populations from the Parana Forest, Araucaria Forest, Pampean, Chacoan and Monte provinces. We found that the distribution pattern coincides with the Peripampasic orogenic arc, with most populations occurring in the mountainous areas located east of the Andes and on the Atlantic coast. The phylogeny revealed a marked geographically structured differentiation, which highlights a first split into two major clades: western (Monte and Chacoan) and eastern (Pampean and coastal forests). Together with AMOVA and network analysis, phylogeny revealed the existence of six well-defined lineages, which are isolated by distance. The TMRCA for Eucecidoses was estimated at ca. 65 Mya, and the divergence among major clades occurred by the Plio-Pleistocene ca. 20–25 Mya, with the extant six lineages emerging about 0.9 to 5.7 Mya (later than the rise of Schinus). These results are associated with a diversification pattern of either a late burst of speciation or early extinction. Population range expansion for some lineages concurring with major climatic changes that occurred during the wet–dry events of the Pleistocene in the region was recovered in both neutrality tests and past dynamics through time analysis. A possible biogeographic scenario reconstructed suggests that Eucecidoses likely emerged from a central meta-population in the south and later dispersed (ca. 38 Mya) using western and eastern as two major routes. Thus, a combination of dispersal and vicariance events that occurred in the ancestral populations might have shaped the current distribution of extant lineages. Speciation driven by host plant shift is potentially involved in the evolutionary history of Eucecidoses."
https://openalex.org/W2885360703,"Malnutrition is very complex in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with poor prognosis. This is because hemodynamic changes, hormonal changes, persistent inflammatory reactions, and fluid overloads are more complicated as uremia is worsening. Bio-impedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a useful method to estimate fluid balance (Overhydration/ extracellular water, OH/ECW) and nutritional status (Phase angle, PhA). We aimed to evaluate the volume and nutritional status by BIS and to investigate the relationship between the appetite regulating hormones and the parameters of BIS in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease not undergoing dialysis (CKD5-ND).We enrolled a total of 91 CKD5-ND patients. We measured routine serum markers including albumin and NT-proBNP and the appetite regulating hormones, leptin and ghrelin. We defined poor nutritional status as a PhA < 4.5°, and proper nutritional status as a PhA ≥ 4.5°. We also evaluated each patient's nutritional status by assessing their geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and their volume status by measuring NT-proBNP.Forty-one patients (45%) had poor nutritional status. Patients with a poor nutritional status had significantly higher OH/ECW (29.6 ± 12.7% vs. 6.2 ± 10.3%, p<0.001) and lower levels of leptin (3.8 ± 3.1 vs. 7.0 ± 6.2 ng/mL, p = 0.004) than those with proper nutritional status. PhA was associated with GNRI (r = 0.597, P<0.001) and NT-proBNP was associated with OH/ECW (r = 0.384, P<0.001). Leptin was negatively correlated with OH/ECW (r = -0.288, p = 0.006). In contrast, leptin was positively correlated with PhA (r = 0.263, p = 0.012). In multivariate logistic regression, high level of leptin (OR 7.00, 95% CI 1.74-28.10) was associated with proper nutrition, while an increased OH/ECW (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.84) was associated with poor nutrition.Our study demonstrates that CKD5-ND patients with poor nutrition generally also suffer from excessive body fluid. Low leptin level suggests poor nutrition in CKD5-ND patients. PhA could be used as a nutritional index for ESRD patients."

Twenty young adults (Mage = 25.5 SD = 2.91) participated in this study. Of the 20, 11 subjects (5 males and 6 females) reported no history of pain, 9 subjects (5 males and 4 females) reported lower back pain (LBP) within the last three months. Subjects performed lumbar spine stabilization manoeuvres (abdominal bracing (AB) and abdominal hollowing (AH)) with static and dynamic abdominal muscles strengthening exercises (i.e., plank, side-bridges, and curl-ups). Noraxon Telemyo twelve channel electromyography device (Noraxon USA, Inc.) was used to record EMG data from rectus abdominal muscle (RA), external oblique muscles (EO), internal oblique muscles (IO), and erector spine muscles (ES). In static exercises such as side-bridge exercise, significantly higher RA muscle electrical activity was recorded with AB manoeuvre compared to AH manoeuvre both on the right side and left side respectively (Z = -2.17; p = 0.03; Z = 3.40; p = 0.001). In dynamic exercises such as curl-up exercise, during the lifting phase, median value of RA muscle activity with AB was significantly higher than with AH (Z = -2.315; p = 0.021). Median value of IO muscles activity with AH was significantly higher than with AB (Z = -3.230; p = 0.001). Our findings indicated that although surface muscles are more activated with AB manoeuvre exercises, deep abdominal muscles are more activated in exercises with AH manoeuvre. These findings can help practitioners design interventions to integrate AH manoeuvre for benefiting persons with lumbar instability."
https://openalex.org/W2887769081,"Breast cancer (BC) is increasing in incidence and resistance to treatment worldwide. The challenges in limited therapeutic options and poor survival outcomes in BC subtypes persist because of its molecular heterogeneity and resistance to standard endocrine therapy. Recently, high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been used to identify biomarkers of disease progression and signaling pathways that could be amenable to specific therapies according to the BC subtype. However, there is no single generally accepted pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data in biomarker discovery due, in part, to the needs of simultaneously satisfying constraints of sensitivity and specificity. We proposed a combined approach using gene-wise normalization, UQ-pgQ2, followed by a Wald test from DESeq2. Our approach improved the analysis based on within-group comparisons in terms of the specificity when applied to publicly available RNA-seq BC datasets. In terms of identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we combined an optimized log2 fold change cutoff with a nominal false discovery rate of 0.05 to further minimize false positives. Using this method in the analysis of two GEO BC datasets, we identified 797 DEGs uniquely expressed in triple negative BC (TNBC) and significantly associated with T cell and immune-related signaling, contributing to the immunotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC patients. In contrast, we identified 1403 DEGs uniquely expressed in estrogen positive and HER2 negative BC (ER+HER2-BC) and significantly associated with eicosanoid, notching and FAK signaling while a common set of genes was associated with cellular growth and proliferation. Thus, our approach to control for false positives identified two distinct gene expression profiles associated with these two subtypes of BC which are distinguishable by their molecular and functional attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2885420385,"For generalist predators, a mixed diet can be advantageous as it allows individuals to exploit a potentially broad range of profitable food types. Despite this, some generalist predators show preferences for certain types of food and may forage selectively in places or at times when these foods are available. One such species is the lesser hairy-footed dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni). Usually considered to be a generalist insectivore, in the Simpson Desert, Australia, this small marsupial predator has been found to selectively consume wolf spiders (Family Lycosidae), for reasons yet unknown. Here, we tested whether lycosids have relatively high energy or nutrient contents compared to other invertebrates, and hence whether these aspects of food quality can explain selective predation of lycosids by S. youngsoni. Energy, lipid and protein composition of representatives of 9 arthropod families that are eaten by S. youngsoni in the Simpson Desert were ascertained using microbomb calorimetry, chloroform-methanol extraction and Dumas combustion, respectively. Although lycosids contained a high proportion of energy and nutrients, they were not found to yield statistically greater amounts of these food components than many other available arthropod prey that are not selected by S. youngsoni. Our results therefore suggest that alternative factors may be more influential in shaping dietary selection in this marsupial predator, such as high rates of encounter between lycosids and S. youngsoni."
https://openalex.org/W2886534380,"Nurses have high work stress that may contribute to an increased overdose for sedatives, hypnotics, and antipsychotics (OSHA). We conducted this nationwide population-based cross-sectional study to clarify this still unclear issue. We used a nationwide database to identify 110,379 nurses, 22,032 other healthcare providers (HCPs), and an identical number of individuals from the general population matched by age and sex. We compared the period prevalence of OSHA between nurses and the general population, other HCPs and the general population, and nurses and other HCPs, among nurse subgroups from 2006 to 2012. The risk for OSHA in nurses and in the general population was not significantly different after adjusting for anxiety, insomnia, depression, schizophrenia, and affective disorders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.145; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.974-1.346). However, in the age subgroups < 35 years, nurses had higher risk than the general population of having OSHA (AOR: 1.333; 95% CI: 1.109-1.601). Other HCPs had a significantly lower risk for OSHA than the general population (AOR: 0.237; 95% CI: 0.122-0.460). Nurses had a significantly higher risk for OSHA than other HCPs (AOR: 3.902; 95% CI: 2.159-7.048). Comparison among nurses showed that younger nurses (< 35 years) had a significantly higher risk for OSHA than the older nurses (≥ 50 years) (AOR: 3.569; 95% CI: 1.252-10.330). Registered nurses had significantly higher risk for OSHA than registered professional nurses (AOR: 1.810; 95% CI: 1.405-2.332); and nurses from clinics, local hospitals, and regional hospitals had significantly higher risk than nurses from medical centers. This study delineated that nurses had a nearly four-fold risk for OSHA when compared to other HCPs. Younger nurses, registered nurses, and nurses from clinics, local hospitals, and regional hospitals had higher risks for OSHA than their respective nurse controls; it suggests that more attention should be given to the occupational health of these populations."
https://openalex.org/W2885474251,"We propose a nonparametric risk-adjusted cumulative sum chart to monitor surgical outcomes for patients with different risks of post-operative mortality due to risk factors that exist before the surgery. Using varying-coefficient logistic regression models, we accomplish the risk adjustment. Unknown coefficient functions are estimated by global polynomial spline approximation based on the maximum likelihood principle. We suggest a bisection minimization approach and a bootstrap method to determine the chart testing limit value. Compared with the previous (parametric) risk-adjusted cumulative sum chart, a major advantage of our method is that the morality rate can be modeled more flexibly by related covariates, which significantly enhances the monitoring efficiency. Simulations demonstrate nice performance of our proposed procedure. An application to a UK cardiac surgery dataset illustrates the use of our methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2886543220,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) where pathology is thought to be regulated by autoreactive T cells of the Th1 and Th17 phenotype. In this study we sought to understand the functions of Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) in regulating T cell effector responses in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) murine model of MS. PSEN1 is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase a multimolecular protease that mediates intramembranous proteolysis. γ-secretase is known to regulate several pathways of immune importance. Here we examine the effects of disrupting PSEN1 functions on EAE and T effector differentiation using small molecule inhibitors of γ-secretase (GSI) and T cell-specific conditional knockout mice (PSEN1 cKO). Surprisingly, blocking PSEN1 function by GSI treatment or PSEN1 cKO had little effect on the development or course of MOG35-55-induced EAE. In vivo GSI administration reduced the number of myelin antigen-specific T cells and suppressed Th1 and Th17 differentiation following immunization. In vitro, GSI treatment inhibited Th1 differentiation in neutral but not IL-12 polarizing conditions. Th17 differentiation was also suppressed by the presence of GSI in all conditions and GSI-treated Th17 T cells failed to induce EAE following adoptive transfer. PSEN cKO T cells showed reduced Th1 and Th17 differentiation. We conclude that γ-secretase and PSEN1-dependent signals are involved in T effector responses in vivo and potently regulate T effector differentiation in vitro, however, they are dispensable for EAE."
https://openalex.org/W2724364772,"Game theory has been widely applied to many areas including economics, biology and social sciences. However, it is still challenging to quantify the global stability and global dynamics of the game theory. We developed a landscape and flux framework to quantify the global stability and global dynamics of the game theory. As an example, we investigated the models of three-strategy games: a special replicator-mutator game, the repeated prison dilemma model. In this model, one stable state, two stable states and limit cycle can emerge under different parameters. The repeated Prisoner's Dilemma system has Hopf bifurcation transitions from one stable state to limit cycle state, and then to another one stable state or two stable states, or vice versa. We explored the global stability of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma system and the kinetic paths between the basins of attractor. The paths are irreversible due to the non-zero flux. One can explain the game for $Peace$ and $War$."
https://openalex.org/W2885669595,"Early Triassic microbialites are distributed widely in the shallow marine facies of the Tethys Region, especially in the carbonate platform where they were deposited immediately after the latest Permian mass extinction (LPME). Ten Griesbachian domed microbial mounds were found in an outcrop of the uppermost first member of the Feixianguan (FXG) Formation at Baimiaozi, which is located in Beibei in the Upper Yangtze Region of southwest China. Field investigations and thin-sections analyses indicated that oolitic limestone, bioclastic limestone, microbialite, marl, and mudstone deposits are present in the first and second members of the FXG Formation, among which the thickness of the microbial mound above the massive oolitic limestone at the carbonate platform was approximately 3–4 m. Three facies were identified at the microbial mounds, namely, a mound base, mound body, and mound cap. Irregular laminae were found in the brown-colored microbialite of the mound base. The main mound body, which is composed of gray microbialite, is 1.0–1.5 m high and 2.0–3.0 m in diameter at the base. Dark gray grainstone found in the mound cap is covered by a thin layer of shelly limestone containing intact fossils of bivalves and gastropods, which are indicative of a simple ecosystem consisting of microbes and primary consumers. Brown-colored mudstone and marl layers of the second member of the FXG Formation overlie the microbialite, and this indicates that growth of the microbial mounds was halted by a sudden increase of terrestrial inputs and rapid transgression. Early Griesbachian conodonts of Hindeodus parvus? were identified from the mound limestone and the overlying strata of the second member of the FXG Formation, which is suggestive of the presence of a microbialite-dominated ocean in the Upper Yangtze Region during a certain interval after the LPME."
https://openalex.org/W2886614182,"Garnets from disparate geographical environments and origins such as oxidized soils and river sediments in Thailand host intricate systems of microsized tunnels that significantly decrease the quality and value of the garnets as gems. The origin of such tunneling has previously been attributed to abiotic processes. Here we present physical and chemical remains of endolithic microorganisms within the tunnels and discuss a probable biological origin of the tunnels. Extensive investigations with synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) reveal morphological indications of biogenicity that further support a euendolithic interpretation. We suggest that the production of the tunnels was initiated by a combination of abiotic and biological processes, and that at later stages biological processes came to dominate. In environments such as river sediments and oxidized soils garnets are among the few remaining sources of bio-available Fe2+, thus it is likely that microbially mediated boring of the garnets has trophic reasons. Whatever the reason for garnet boring, the tunnel system represents a new endolithic habitat in a hard silicate mineral otherwise known to be resistant to abrasion and chemical attack."
https://openalex.org/W2887793216,"Preoperative anemia occurs in about one third of patients who undergo elective surgery and is associated with an impaired outcome. Therefore, screening of preoperative anemia was established in the context of a multidisciplinary Patient Blood Management (PBM) program at the University Hospital of Muenster, Germany. Anemic patients without contraindications were treated with intravenous (IV) iron (ferric carboxymaltose) to increase their hemoglobin (Hgb) levels and hence to treat anemia prior to surgery. Interestingly, we detected a large variability in the response of Hgb levels after IV iron administration. Systemic iron homeostasis is mainly regulated by the hepatic hormone hepcidin, which regulates the cell surface expression of the sole known iron exporter ferroportin. The objective of this retrospective pilot study was to analyze the potential of hepcidin to predict the response of anemic patients to preoperative IV iron treatment measured as increase in Hgb. Serum samples of non-anemic (n = 48), untreated anemic (n = 64) and anemic patients treated with IV iron (n = 79), in total 191 patients, were collected between October 2014 until June 2016. Serum hepcidin levels were determined and data were analyzed retrospectively. The analysis revealed at first a correlation between serum hepcidin levels and the parameters of the iron status. Second, patients treated with IV iron showed a noticeably higher increase in their delta Hgb level between PBM consultation and surgery (0.45g/dl [0.05, 1.05] compared to patients without IV iron (0.1g/dl [-0.48, 0.73], *p = 0.03). Patients were then grouped into ‘non-responders’, defined as delta Hgb <0.6g/dl and ‘responders’, with delta Hgb ≥0.6g/dl between the day of IV iron treatment and the day of surgery. Within normal ranges and clinically unapparent, a statistically noticeable difference between responders and non-responders was found for CRP and leukocytes. Serum hepcidin levels were higher in the group of non-responders (10.6ng/ml [3.93, 34.77]) compared to responders (2.1ng/ml [0.25, 7.97], *p = 0.04). To conclude, the data of this retrospective pilot study indicate that hepcidin might be a promising biomarker to predict a patient`s responsiveness to IV iron in preoperative anemia treatment. Prospective studies have to investigate serum hepcidin levels as a biomarker to guide physician`s decision on IV iron substitution."
https://openalex.org/W2887912316,"Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, azoles are poorly active against biofilms, echinocandins do not achieve clinically useful urinary concentrations, and amphotericin B exhibits severe toxicities. Thus, novel strategies are needed to prevent Candida UTIs, which are often associated with urinary catheter biofilms. We previously demonstrated that cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins (PACs) prevent C. albicans biofilm formation in an in vitro urinary model. To elucidate functional pathways unique to urinary biofilm development and PAC inhibition, we investigated the transcriptome of C. albicans in artificial urine (AU), with and without PACs. C. albicans biofilm and planktonic cells were cultivated with or without PACs. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed by RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were determined using DESeq2 software; pathway analysis was performed using Cytoscape. Approximately 2,341 of 6,444 total genes were significantly expressed in biofilm relative to planktonic cells. Functional pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in filamentation, adhesion, drug response and transport were up-regulated in urinary biofilms. Genes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism and nutrient response were down-regulated. In PAC-treated urinary biofilms compared to untreated control biofilms, 557 of 6,444 genes had significant changes in gene expression. Genes downregulated in PAC-treated biofilms were implicated in iron starvation and adhesion pathways. Although urinary biofilms share key features with biofilms formed in other environments, many genes are uniquely expressed in urinary biofilms. Cranberry-derived PACs interfere with the expression of iron acquisition and adhesion genes within urinary biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2885391768,"Phenotypic plasticity is a common defensive strategy in species experiencing variable predation risk, such as habitat generalists. Larvae of generalist dragonflies can elongate their abdominal spines in environments with fish, but long spines render larvae susceptible to invertebrate predators. Long-spined specialists adapted to fish-heavy habitats are not expected to have phenotypic plasticity in this defence trait, but no empirical studies have been undertaken. Moreover, in comparison to prey responding to multiple predators that induce similar phenotypes, relatively little is known regarding how species react to combinations of predators that favour opposing traits. We examined plasticity of larval dragonfly Sympetrum depressiusculum, a long-spined habitat specialist. In a rearing experiment, larvae were exposed to four environments: (i) no predator control, (ii) fish cues (Carassius auratus), (iii) invertebrate cues (Anax imperator), as well as (iv) a combination of (ii) and (iii). Compared with the control, fish but not invertebrate cues resulted in longer spines for two (one lateral, one dorsal) of the six spines measured. Interestingly, the combined-cue treatment led to the elongation of all four dorsal spines compared with the fish treatment alone, whereas lateral spines showed no response. Our experiment provided evidence of morphological plasticity in a long-spined specialist dragonfly. We showed that nearly all spines can elongate, but also react differently under specific predator settings. Therefore, while spine plasticity evolved in direct response to a single predator type (fish), plasticity was maintained against invertebrate predators as long as fish were also present. Selective spine induction under the combined condition suggests that S. depressiusculum can successfully survive in environments with both predators. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity may be an effective strategy for habitat generalists and specialists. Although more studies are necessary to fully understand how selection shapes the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, we demonstrated that in dragonflies, presence or absence of a specific predator is not the only factor that determines plastic defence responses."
