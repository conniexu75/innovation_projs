https://openalex.org/W1975526121,"The mutant floury-2 results in the production of maize endosperm proteins with an altered amino acid pattern. The lysine concentration is high, eapproximately equal to that in mutant opaque-2, and the methionine concentration is higher than in any other stock tested. Other mutants of similar phenotype!, opaque-1, floury-1, and soft-starch do not cause major changes in amino acid Pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2017587126,"Many physical systems that have interacting structures that span wide ranges in size involve substantial scale invariant (or scaling) subranges. In these regimes, the large and small scales are related by an operation that involves only the scale ratio. The system has no intrinsic characteristic size. In the atmosphere gravity causes differential stratification, so that the scale change involves new elliptical dimensions (d(el)). Fields that are extremely variable, such as rain, involve multiple scaling and dimensions that characterize the increasingly intense regions. Elliptical dimensional sampling and functional box-counting have been used to analyze radar rain data to obtain both the multiple dimensions of the rain field and the estimate d(el) = 2.22 +/- 0.07."
https://openalex.org/W1982448541,"Model calculations were performed to test the possibility of solving crystal structures of proteins by Patterson search techniques with three-dimensional structures obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) interproton distance restraints. Structures for crambin obtained from simulated NMR data were used as the test system; the root-mean-square deviations of the NMR structures from the x-ray structure were 1.5 to 2.2 A for backbone atoms and 2.0 to 2.8 A for side-chain atoms. Patterson searches were made to determine the orientation and position of the NMR structures in the unit cell. The correct solution was obtained by comparing the rotation function results of several of the NMR structures and the average structure derived from them. Conventional refinement techniques reduced the R factor from 0.43 at 4 A resolution to 0.27 at 2 A resolution without inclusion of water molecules. The partially refined structure has root-mean-square backbone and side-chain atom deviations from the x-ray structure of 0.5 and 1.3 A, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2001873099,"The Martian ionospheric observations made by Mariner IV are interpreted in terms of an atmospheric model. The ion peak is identified as an F2 peak, that is, as a maximum whose profile is controlled by ambipolar diffusion. The principal features of the resulting atmospheric model are that the atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, the temperature is very low, and there is no thermosphere. Surface temperature is 210 degrees K. The tropopause occurs at an altitude of 14 kilometers and has a temperature of 140 degrees K. Above the tropopause, the temperature decreases with altitude at the rate of 0.64 degrees C km(-1), following the solid carbon dioxide vapor-pressure curve up to 100 km, where the temperature is 85 degrees K; at higher altitudes the temperature is isothermal."
https://openalex.org/W2003885486,"Roots of some tropical trees grow vertically upward on the stems of neighboring trees. Apogeotropic roots occur in 12 species across five families. These roots, originating as fine roots in the mineral soil, grow upward as fast as 5.6 centimeters in 72 hours. Apogeotropic root growth may be an adaptation to extremely low soil nutrient availability in Amazon forests. In these forests upward-growing roots obtain nutrients via the predictable pathway of precipitation that flows down along the stem. Apogeotropic roots form a nutrient cycling pathway in which nutrients are absorbed and transported directly from plant to plant, without entering the soil solution."

https://openalex.org/W1972853479,The Douglas-fir beetle is attracted to alpha-pinene but repelled by beta-pinene. Attacks on standing trees are related to the content of alpha- or beta-pinene in the tree; this correlation suggests that volatile oils may be the stimuli initially attracting the insect to the Douglas fir.

The final installation of these remarkable mushroom models"
