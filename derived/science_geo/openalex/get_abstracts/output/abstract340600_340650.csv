https://openalex.org/W2046788667,"Forest systems cover more than 4.1 × 109 hectares of the Earth's land area. Globally, forest vegetation and soils contain about 1146 petagrams of carbon, with approximately 37 percent of this carbon in low-latitude forests, 14 percent in mid-latitudes, and 49 percent at high latitudes. Over two-thirds of the carbon in forest ecosystems is contained in soils and associated peat deposits. In 1990, deforestation in the low latitudes emitted 1.6 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, whereas forest area expansion and growth in mid- and high-latitude forest sequestered 0.7 ± 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year, for a net flux to the atmosphere of 0.9 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year. Slowing deforestation, combined with an increase in forestation and other management measures to improve forest ecosystem productivity, could conserve or sequester significant quantities of carbon. Future forest carbon cycling trends attributable to losses and regrowth associated with global climate and land-use change are uncertain. Model projections and some results suggest that forests could be carbon sinks or sources in the future."

These results help explain why the long-term (20th century) increase in surface air temperature over Northern Hemisphere land has been greater in spring than in any other season relative to the interannual variability."
https://openalex.org/W2051702738,"Root-knot nematodes are obligate plant parasites that induce development of an elaborate feeding site during root infection. Feeding-site formation results from a complex interaction between the pathogen and the host plant in which the nematode alters patterns of plant gene expression within the cells destined to become the feeding site. Expression of TobRB7, a gene expressed only in tobacco roots, is induced during feeding site development. The cis-acting sequences that mediate induction by the nematode are separate from those that control normal root-specific expression. Reporter transgenes driven by the nematode-responsive promoter sequences exhibit expression exclusively in the developing feeding site."

Their hindlimbs are not visible externally and the bones are reduced to one or a few splints that commonly lack joints. However, cetaceans originated from four-legged land mammals that used their limbs for locomotion and were probably apt runners. Because there are no relatively complete limbs for archaic archaeocete cetaceans, it is not known how the transition in locomotory organs from land to water occurred. Recovery of a skeleton of an early fossil cetacean from the Kuldana Formation, Pakistan, documents transitional modes of locomotion, and allows hypotheses concerning swimming in early cetaceans to be tested. The fossil indicates that archaic whales swam by undulating their vertebral column, thus forcing their feet up and down in a way similar to modern otters. Their movements on land probably resembled those of sea lions to some degree, and involved protraction and retraction of the abducted limbs."
https://openalex.org/W2033028146,Ordered arrays of charged uniform colloidal polystyrene particles in solution form a single-wavelength laser filter that is transparent to other wavelengths. A usable filter was prepared by solidification within an acrylamide-methylene-bisacrylamide gel. The rejection wavelength of the colloidal array filter changes with gel composition. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy of two gel formulations shows that the colloidal array filter is composed of AAA stacking of close-packed planes. Excellent agreement is found between the layer spacings measured and those predicted from the rejection wavelengths.
https://openalex.org/W1982577318,"By providing cold, dense water that sinks and mixes to fill the abyssal world ocean, high-latitude air-sea-ice interaction is the main conduit through which the deep ocean communicates with the rest of the climate system. A key element in modeling and predicting oceanic impact on climate is understanding the processes that control the near surface exchange of heat, salt, and momentum. In 1992, the United States—Russian Ice Station Weddell-1 traversed the western Weddell Sea during the onset of winter, providing a platform for direct measurement of turbulent heat flux and Reynolds stress in the upper ocean. Data from a storm early in the drift indicated (i) well-formed Ekman spirals (in both velocity and turbulent stress); (ii) high correlation between mixed layer heat flux and temperature gradients; (iii) that eddy viscosity and eddy thermal diffusivity were similar, about 0.02 square meters per second; and (iv) that the significant turbulent length scale (2 to 3 meters through most of the boundary layer) was proportional to the wavelength at the peak in the weighted vertical velocity spectrum. The measurements were consistent with a simple model in which the bulk eddy viscosity in the neutrally buoyant mixed layer is proportional to kinematic boundary stress divided by the Coriolis parameter."
https://openalex.org/W2043468129,"Free-radical side-chain brominations of alkylaromatics in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) are reported. Direct bromination of toluene and ethylbenzene form the corresponding benzyl bromides in high yield. The observed selectivity in SC-CO2 is similar to that observed in conventional organic solvents. Also, SC-CO2 is an effective alternative to carbon tetrachloride for use in the classical Ziegler bromination with N-bromosuccinimide. Reaction yields are high, side products are minimized, and bromine-atom selectivities are observed. Thus, SC-CO2 must be useful as a viable, environmentally benign substitute for many of the solvents typically used for free-radical reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2006737888,"Data from two microseismic field experiments in northern Chile revealed an elongated cluster of earthquakes in the subducted Nazca plate at a depth of about 100 kilometers in which down-dip tensional events were consistently shallower than a family of compressional earthquakes. This double seismic zone shows a distribution of stresses of opposite polarity relative to that observed in other double seismic zones in the world. The distribution of stresses in northern Chile supports the notion that at depths of between 90 to 150 kilometers, the basalt to eclogite transformation of the subducting oceanic crust induces tensional deformation in the upper part of the subducted slab and compressional deformation in the underlying mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2086436215,"The ultraviolet spectrum of methyl isothiocyanate (CH3NCS) and the quantum yield for its dissociation into methyl isocyanide (CH3NC) and atomic sulfur at 308 nanometers, φ = 0.98 ± 0.24, were measured. Methyl isothiocyanate is widely used as an agricultural fumigant and readily enters the atmosphere during and after application. The results indicate that photodissociation by sunlight is an effective pathway for its removal from the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1989515690,"Crustal extension and formation of the Mineral Mountains core complex, Utah, involved tilting of the Mineral Mountains batholith and associated faults during hanging wall and footwall deformation. The batholith was folded in the hanging wall of the Beaver Valley fault between 11 and 9 million years ago yielding about 45 degrees of tilt. Subsequently, the batholith was unroofed along the Cave Canyon detachment fault, and the batholith and fault were tilted approximately 40 degrees during footwall uplift. Recognition of deformed dikes beneath the detachment fault establishes the importance of footwall tilt during formation of extensional core complexes and demonstrates that footwall rebound can be an important process during extension."
