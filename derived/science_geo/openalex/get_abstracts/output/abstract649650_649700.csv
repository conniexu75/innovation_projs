https://openalex.org/W3011286936,"Although the cerebral cortex is organized into six excitatory neuronal layers, it is unclear whether glial cells show distinct layering. In the present study, we developed a high-content pipeline, the large-area spatial transcriptomic (LaST) map, which can quantify single-cell gene expression in situ. Screening 46 candidate genes for astrocyte diversity across the mouse cortex, we identified superficial, mid and deep astrocyte identities in gradient layer patterns that were distinct from those of neurons. Astrocyte layer features, established in the early postnatal cortex, mostly persisted in adult mouse and human cortex. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial reconstruction analysis further confirmed the presence of astrocyte layers in the adult cortex. Satb2 and Reeler mutations that shifted neuronal post-mitotic development were sufficient to alter glial layering, indicating an instructive role for neuronal cues. Finally, astrocyte layer patterns diverged between mouse cortical regions. These findings indicate that excitatory neurons and astrocytes are organized into distinct lineage-associated laminae. A new spatial transcriptomic approach reveals astrocyte heterogeneity across layers of the mammalian cerebral cortex. Astrocytes diversify into superficial-, mid- and deep-layer subtypes distinct from neuronal laminae, yet instructed by neuronal cues."
https://openalex.org/W3012720150,"TAZ promotes growth, development and tumorigenesis by regulating the expression of target genes. However, the manner in which TAZ orchestrates the transcriptional responses is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that TAZ forms nuclear condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation to compartmentalize its DNA-binding cofactor TEAD4, coactivators BRD4 and MED1, and the transcription elongation factor CDK9 for transcription. TAZ forms phase-separated droplets in vitro and liquid-like nuclear condensates in vivo, and this ability is negatively regulated by Hippo signalling through LATS-mediated phosphorylation and is mediated by the coiled-coil (CC) domain. Deletion of the TAZ CC domain or substitution with the YAP CC domain prevents the phase separation of TAZ and its ability to induce the expression of TAZ-specific target genes. Thus, we identify a mechanism of transcriptional activation by TAZ and demonstrate that pathway-specific transcription factors also engage the phase-separation mechanism for efficient and specific transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W3012749684,"Brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma (BM-LUAD) frequently cause patient mortality. To identify genomic alterations that promote brain metastases, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 73 BM-LUAD cases. Using case-control analyses, we discovered candidate drivers of brain metastasis by identifying genes with more frequent copy-number aberrations in BM-LUAD compared to 503 primary LUADs. We identified three regions with significantly higher amplification frequencies in BM-LUAD, including MYC (12 versus 6%), YAP1 (7 versus 0.8%) and MMP13 (10 versus 0.6%), and significantly more frequent deletions in CDKN2A/B (27 versus 13%). We confirmed that the amplification frequencies of MYC, YAP1 and MMP13 were elevated in an independent cohort of 105 patients with BM-LUAD. Functional assessment in patient-derived xenograft mouse models validated the notion that MYC, YAP1 or MMP13 overexpression increased the incidence of brain metastasis. These results demonstrate that somatic alterations contribute to brain metastases and that genomic sequencing of a sufficient number of metastatic tumors can reveal previously unknown metastatic drivers. Whole-exome sequencing of human brain metastases from lung adenocarcinoma uncovers new drivers by comparison of somatic alteration frequencies in brain metastasis cases to those in primary lung adenocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W3011699272,"Although the transition metal copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient that is conventionally viewed as a static cofactor within enzyme active sites, a non-traditional role for Cu as a modulator of kinase signalling is emerging. Here, we found that Cu is required for the activity of the autophagic kinases ULK1 and ULK2 (ULK1/2) through a direct Cu–ULK1/2 interaction. Genetic loss of the Cu transporter Ctr1 or mutations in ULK1 that disrupt the binding of Cu reduced ULK1/2-dependent signalling and the formation of autophagosome complexes. Increased levels of intracellular Cu are associated with starvation-induced autophagy and are sufficient to enhance ULK1 kinase activity and, in turn, autophagic flux. The growth and survival of lung tumours driven by KRASG12D is diminished in the absence of Ctr1, is dependent on ULK1 Cu binding and is associated with reduced levels of autophagy and signalling. These findings suggest a molecular basis for exploiting Cu-chelation therapy to prevent autophagy signalling to limit proliferation and improve patient survival in cancer. Tsang et al. show that copper modulates the activity of autophagic kinases ULK1/2 to control autophagy, and is required for KRASG12D-driven tumour growth and cancer survival in response to starvation."
https://openalex.org/W3012860965,"Rho GTPases are central regulators of the cytoskeleton and, in humans, are controlled by 145 multidomain guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs). How Rho signalling patterns are established in dynamic cell spaces to control cellular morphogenesis is unclear. Through a family-wide characterization of substrate specificities, interactomes and localization, we reveal at the systems level how RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs contextualize and spatiotemporally control Rho signalling. These proteins are widely autoinhibited to allow local regulation, form complexes to jointly coordinate their networks and provide positional information for signalling. RhoGAPs are more promiscuous than RhoGEFs to confine Rho activity gradients. Our resource enabled us to uncover a multi-RhoGEF complex downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors controlling CDC42–RHOA crosstalk. Moreover, we show that integrin adhesions spatially segregate GEFs and GAPs to shape RAC1 activity zones in response to mechanical cues. This mechanism controls the protrusion and contraction dynamics fundamental to cell motility. Our systems analysis of Rho regulators is key to revealing emergent organization principles of Rho signalling. Müller et al. provide a comprehensive resource depicting cellular substrates, localization and interacting partners of RhoGEF and RhoGAP proteins regulating the canonical Rho family of GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W3012899267,"Mutations in genes involved in DNA methylation (DNAme; for example, TET2 and DNMT3A) are frequently observed in hematological malignancies1-3 and clonal hematopoiesis4,5. Applying single-cell sequencing to murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we observed that these mutations disrupt hematopoietic differentiation, causing opposite shifts in the frequencies of erythroid versus myelomonocytic progenitors following Tet2 or Dnmt3a loss. Notably, these shifts trace back to transcriptional priming skews in uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells. To reconcile genome-wide DNAme changes with specific erythroid versus myelomonocytic skews, we provide evidence in support of differential sensitivity of transcription factors due to biases in CpG enrichment in their binding motif. Single-cell transcriptomes with targeted genotyping showed similar skews in transcriptional priming of DNMT3A-mutated human clonal hematopoiesis bone marrow progenitors. These data show that DNAme shapes the topography of hematopoietic differentiation, and support a model in which genome-wide methylation changes are transduced to differentiation skews through biases in CpG enrichment of the transcription factor binding motif."
https://openalex.org/W3012787339,"There is currently much debate regarding the best model for how heritability varies across the genome. The authors of GCTA recommend the GCTA-LDMS-I model, the authors of LD Score Regression recommend the Baseline LD model, and we have recommended the LDAK model. Here we provide a statistical framework for assessing heritability models using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Based on 31 studies of complex human traits (average sample size 136,000), we show that the Baseline LD model is more realistic than other existing heritability models, but that it can be improved by incorporating features from the LDAK model. Our framework also provides a method for estimating the selection-related parameter α from summary statistics. We find strong evidence (P < 1 × 10−6) of negative genome-wide selection for traits, including height, systolic blood pressure and college education, and that the impact of selection is stronger inside functional categories, such as coding SNPs and promoter regions. Assessing heritability models using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of 31 human traits shows that the Baseline LD model is realistic and can be improved by incorporating features from the LDAK model."
https://openalex.org/W3012738293,"Differences in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture can influence the integrity of topologically associating domains (TADs) and rewire specific enhancer-promoter interactions, impacting gene expression and leading to human disease. Here we investigate the 3D chromatin architecture in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) by using primary human leukemia specimens and examine the dynamic responses of this architecture to pharmacological agents. Systematic integration of matched in situ Hi-C, RNA-seq and CTCF ChIP-seq datasets revealed widespread differences in intra-TAD chromatin interactions and TAD boundary insulation in T-ALL. Our studies identify and focus on a TAD 'fusion' event associated with absence of CTCF-mediated insulation, enabling direct interactions between the MYC promoter and a distal super-enhancer. Moreover, our data also demonstrate that small-molecule inhibitors targeting either oncogenic signal transduction or epigenetic regulation can alter specific 3D interactions found in leukemia. Overall, our study highlights the impact, complexity and dynamic nature of 3D chromatin architecture in human acute leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W3012591046,"Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) drive learning across the animal kingdom, but the upstream circuits that regulate their activity and thereby learning remain poorly understood. We provide a synaptic-resolution connectome of the circuitry upstream of all DANs in a learning center, the mushroom body of Drosophila larva. We discover afferent sensory pathways and a large population of neurons that provide feedback from mushroom body output neurons and link distinct memory systems (aversive and appetitive). We combine this with functional studies of DANs and their presynaptic partners and with comprehensive circuit modeling. We find that DANs compare convergent feedback from aversive and appetitive systems, which enables the computation of integrated predictions that may improve future learning. Computational modeling reveals that the discovered feedback motifs increase model flexibility and performance on learning tasks. Our study provides the most detailed view to date of biological circuit motifs that support associative learning. Eschbach, Fushiki et al. combine synaptic-resolution circuit mapping, functional analyses and modeling to reveal circuit motifs that regulate dopaminergic neuron activity and may increase associative learning task performance and flexibility."

https://openalex.org/W3012861936,"Although a large body of research has focused on social isolation and loneliness, few studies have examined social isolation and loneliness together. The objectives of this study were to examine: 1) the relationship between four groups derived from combining social isolation and loneliness (socially isolated and lonely; only socially isolated; only lonely; neither socially isolated nor lonely) and the desire for more social participation, and social support; and 2) the relationship between the four groups and psychological distress.The study was based on the Comprehensive Cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Using CLSA baseline data (unweighted N = 30,079), ordinary and logistic regression analysis was used to examine the cross-sectional relationship between the four social isolation/loneliness groups and desire for more social participation and four types of social support (tangible, positive interaction, affection, and emotional support). Prospective logistic regression analysis was possible for psychological distress, which was derived from the Maintaining Contact Questionnaire administered about 18 months after the baseline questionnaire (unweighted N = 28,789).Findings indicate that being socially isolated and lonely was associated with the most social support gaps; this group also had an increased likelihood of psychological distress, relative to those who were neither socially isolated nor lonely. Participants who were only socially isolated, and those only lonely also perceived some social support gaps. In addition, the only lonely group was more likely to be psychologically distressed than the only socially isolated group and the neither isolated nor lonely group.Examining the four social isolation/loneliness was useful, as it provided more nuanced risk profiles than would have been possible had we examined social isolation and loneliness separately. Findings may suggest avenues for interventions tailored to the unique needs of at-risk individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3012855465,"This large, retrospective case-control study of electronic health records from 56 million unique adult patients examined whether or not treatment with a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocking agent is associated with lower risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases which are mediated in part by TNF and for which a TNF blocker is an approved treatment. The analysis compared the diagnosis of AD as an outcome measure in patients receiving at least one prescription for a TNF blocking agent (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) or for methotrexate. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. RA was associated with a higher risk for AD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.06, 95% Confidence Interval: (2.02–2.10), P-value <0.0001) as did psoriasis (AOR = 1.37 (1.31–1.42), P <0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (AOR = 1.57 (1.39–1.77), P <0.0001), inflammatory bowel disease (AOR = 2.46 (2.33–2.59), P < 0.0001), ulcerative colitis (AOR = 1.82 (1.74–1.91), P <0.0001), and Crohn’s disease (AOR = 2.33 (2.22–2.43), P <0.0001). The risk for AD in patients with RA was lower among patients treated with etanercept (AOR = 0.34 (0.25–0.47), P <0.0001), adalimumab (AOR = 0.28 (0.19–0.39), P < 0.0001), or infliximab (AOR = 0.52 (0.39–0.69), P <0.0001). Methotrexate was also associated with a lower risk for AD (AOR = 0.64 (0.61–0.68), P <0.0001), while lower risk was found in patients with a prescription history for both a TNF blocker and methotrexate. Etanercept and adalimumab also were associated with lower risk for AD in patients with psoriasis: AOR = 0.47 (0.30–0.73 and 0.41 (0.20–0.76), respectively. There was no effect of gender or race, while younger patients showed greater benefit from a TNF blocker than did older patients. This study identifies a subset of patients in whom systemic inflammation contributes to risk for AD through a pathological mechanism involving TNF and who therefore may benefit from treatment with a TNF blocking agent."
https://openalex.org/W3012928138,"Loot boxes are digital containers of randomised rewards available in many video games. Due to similarities between some loot boxes and traditional forms of gambling, concerns regarding the relationship between spending on loot boxes in video games and symptoms of problematic gambling have been expressed by policy makers and the general public. We present the first investigation of these concerns in large cross-sectional cross-national samples from three countries (Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States). A sample of 1,049 participants were recruited through Qualtrics’ Survey Targeting service from a broad cross-section of the population in Australia (n = 339), Aotearoa New Zealand (n = 323), and the United States (n = 387). Participants answered a survey assessing problem gambling, problem gaming symptomology, and how much they spent on loot boxes per month. On average, individuals with problem gambling issues spent approximately $13 USD per month more on loot boxes than those with no such symptoms. Loot box spending was also associated with both positive and negative moods, albeit with small effect sizes. Analyses showed both interactions and correlations between problematic gambling and problematic gaming symptoms, indicating both some commonality in the mechanisms underlying, and independent contributions made by, these proposed diagnostic criteria. These results provide context for dialogues regarding how best to reduce the impacts of loot box spending among those with problematic gambling symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W3011108872,"Gene network transitions in embryos and other fate-changing contexts involve combinations of transcription factors. A subset of fate-changing transcription factors act as pioneers; they scan and target nucleosomal DNA and initiate cooperative events that can open the local chromatin. However, a gap has remained in understanding how molecular interactions with the nucleosome contribute to the chromatin-opening phenomenon. Here we identified a short α-helical region, conserved among FOXA pioneer factors, that interacts with core histones and contributes to chromatin opening in vitro. The same domain is involved in chromatin opening in early mouse embryos for normal development. Thus, local opening of chromatin by interactions between pioneer factors and core histones promotes genetic programming."
https://openalex.org/W3012351699,"Local adaptation directs populations towards environment-specific fitness maxima through acquisition of positively selected traits. However, rapid environmental changes can identify hidden fitness trade-offs that turn adaptation into maladaptation, resulting in evolutionary traps. Cancer, a disease that is prone to drug resistance, is in principle susceptible to such traps. We therefore performed pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells treated with various chemotherapies to map the drug-dependent genetic basis of fitness trade-offs, a concept known as antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). We identified a PRC2-NSD2/3-mediated MYC regulatory axis as a drug-induced AP pathway whose ability to confer resistance to bromodomain inhibition and sensitivity to BCL-2 inhibition templates an evolutionary trap. Across diverse AML cell-line and patient-derived xenograft models, we find that acquisition of resistance to bromodomain inhibition through this pathway exposes coincident hypersensitivity to BCL-2 inhibition. Thus, drug-induced AP can be leveraged to design evolutionary traps that selectively target drug resistance in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3012809876,"The advent of new therapies has increased the need to achieve early diagnosis in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). The aim of the present study was to define the age of diagnosis in the three main types of SMA with pediatric-onset and the timing between the recognition of clinical signs and confirmed genetic diagnosis.All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of type I, II, III SMA followed in 5 Italian centers were included in this study, assessing age at symptoms onset, presenting sign or symptom, age at diagnosis, interval between clinical onset and diagnosis and type of medical investigations conducted in order to obtain the diagnosis.The cohort included 480 patients, 191 affected by SMA type I, 210 by type II and 79 by type III. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.70 months (SD ±2.82) in type I, 15.6 months (SD±5.88) in type II, and 4.34 years (SD±4.01) in type III. The mean time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 1.94 months (SD±1.84) in type I, 5.28 months (SD±4.68) in type II and 16.8 months (SD±18.72) in type III.Our results suggest that despite improved care recommendations there is still a marked diagnostic delay, especially in type III. At the time new therapies are becoming available more attention should be devoted to reducing such delay as there is consistent evidence of the benefit of early treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3012267561,"Learning disabilities are hallmarks of congenital conditions caused by prenatal exposure to harmful agents. These include fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) with a wide range of cognitive deficiencies, including impaired motor skill development. Although these effects have been well characterized, the molecular effects that bring about these behavioral consequences remain to be determined. We previously found that the acute molecular responses to alcohol in the embryonic brain are stochastic, varying among neural progenitor cells. However, the pathophysiological consequences stemming from these heterogeneous responses remain unknown. Here we show that acute responses to alcohol in progenitor cells altered gene expression in their descendant neurons. Among the altered genes, an increase of the calcium-activated potassium channel Kcnn2 in the motor cortex correlated with motor learning deficits in a mouse model of FASD. Pharmacologic blockade of Kcnn2 improves these learning deficits, suggesting Kcnn2 blockers as a new intervention for learning disabilities in FASD."

This information usually comes from surveys and border controls, but timely accessibility and methodological concerns reduce its usefulness. Here, we propose a method to detect migration flows worldwide using geolocated Twitter data. We focus on the migration crisis in Venezuela and show that the calculated flows are consistent with official statistics at country level. Our method is versatile and far-reaching, as it can be used to study different features of migration as preferred routes, settlement areas, mobility through several countries, spatial integration in cities, etc. It provides finer geographical and temporal resolutions, allowing the exploration of issues not contemplated in official records. It is our hope that these new sources of information can complement official ones, helping authorities and humanitarian organizations to better assess when and where to intervene on the ground."

https://openalex.org/W3012615373,"Gait analysis is a technique that is used to understand movement patterns and, in some cases, to inform the development of rehabilitation protocols. Traditional rehabilitation approaches have relied on expert guided feedback in clinical settings. Such efforts require the presence of an expert to inform the re-training (to evaluate any improvement) and the patient to travel to the clinic. Nowadays, potential opportunities exist to employ the use of digitized ""feedback"" modalities to help a user to ""understand"" improved gait technique. This is important as clear and concise feedback can enhance the quality of rehabilitation and recovery. A critical requirement emerges to consider the quality of feedback from the user perspective i.e. how they process, understand and react to the feedback. In this context, this paper reports the results of a Quality of Experience (QoE) evaluation of two feedback modalities: Augmented Reality (AR) and Haptic, employed as part of an overall gait analysis system. The aim of the feedback is to reduce varus/valgus misalignments, which can cause serious orthopedics problems. The QoE analysis considers objective (improvement in knee alignment) and subjective (questionnaire responses) user metrics in 26 participants, as part of a within subject design. Participants answered 12 questions on QoE aspects such as utility, usability, interaction and immersion of the feedback modalities via post-test reporting. In addition, objective metrics of participant performance (angles and alignment) were also considered as indicators of the utility of each feedback modality. The findings show statistically significant higher QoE ratings for AR feedback. Also, the number of knee misalignments was reduced after users experienced AR feedback (35% improvement with AR feedback relative to baseline when compared to haptic). Gender analysis showed significant differences in performance for number of misalignments and time to correct valgus misalignment (for males when they experienced AR feedback). The female group self-reported higher utility and QoE ratings for AR when compared to male group."
https://openalex.org/W3012701818,"Internalizing and externalizing behavior problems are established risk factors for many unpleasant outcomes and psychopathology in adulthood, and understanding the interplay between genes and environment is important for deducing implications for therapeutic interventions. Among genetic studies on internalizing and externalizing problem behavior, the heritability estimates differ widely. Most research only uses twin data and other-reports, and therefore certain limitations are inevitable. Our study is the first to investigate genetic and environmental influences on problem behavior using a Nuclear Twin Family Design and self-reports, in order to address these limitations. Internalizing and externalizing problem behavior of 3,087 twin pairs (age 11–23), a sibling, and their parents were analyzed with structural equation modeling to estimate heritability separately for each of three twin birth cohorts. Genetic influences account for about one-third of the variance for both internalizing and externalizing. Shared environmental influences were only found for internalizing, and through the advantages of considering data from the whole twin family, firstly could be identified as solely twin-specific. Our findings could contribute to a better understanding of the gap between heritability based on twin studies and DNA-based heritability (‘missing heritability problem’): Results indicate that heritability estimates gained via classic twin design and other-reports are slightly overestimated and therefore environmental influences, in general, are more important than previous research suggests. Simultaneously, we showed that family-specific environment either contributes to behavior problems only on an individual level, or that it has a lesser influence than originally thought."
https://openalex.org/W3012947535,"Pupil size modulations have been used for decades as a window into the mind, and several pupillary features have been implicated in a variety of cognitive processes. Thus, a general challenge facing the field of pupillometry has been understanding which pupil features should be most relevant for explaining behavior in a given task domain. In the present study, a longitudinal design was employed where participants completed 8 biweekly sessions of a classic mental arithmetic task for the purposes of teasing apart the relationships between tonic/phasic pupil features (baseline, peak amplitude, peak latency) and two task-related cognitive processes including mental processing load (indexed by math question difficulty) and decision making (indexed by response times). We used multi-level modeling to account for individual variation while identifying pupil-to-behavior relationships at the single-trial and between-session levels. We show a dissociation between phasic and tonic features with peak amplitude and latency (but not baseline) driven by ongoing task-related processing, whereas baseline was driven by state-level effects that changed over a longer time period (i.e. weeks). Finally, we report a dissociation between peak amplitude and latency whereby amplitude reflected surprise and processing load, and latency reflected decision making times."
https://openalex.org/W3012572109,"Observing animals directly in the field provides the most accurate understanding of animal behaviour and resource selection. However, making prolonged observation of undisturbed animals is difficult or impossible for many species. To overcome this problem for the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), a cryptic and nocturnal carnivore, we developed animal-borne video collars to investigate activity patterns, foraging behaviour and social interactions. We collected 173 hours of footage from 13 individual devils between 2013 and 2017. Devils were active mostly at night, and resting was the most common behaviour in all diel periods. Devils spent more time scavenging than hunting and exhibited opportunistic and flexible foraging behaviours. Scavenging occurred mostly in natural vegetation but also in anthropogenic vegetation and linear features (roads and fence lines). Scavenging frequency was inversely incremental with size e.g. small carcasses were scavenged most frequently. Agonistic interactions with conspecifics occurred most often when devils were traveling but also occurred over carcasses or dens. Interactions generally involved vocalisations and brief chases without physical contact. Our results highlight the importance of devils as a scavenger in the Tasmanian ecosystem, not just of large carcasses for which devils are well known but in cleaning up small items of carrion in the bush. Our results also show the complex nature of intraspecific interactions, revealing greater detail on the context in which interactions occur. In addition, this study demonstrates the benefits of using animal-borne imaging in quantifying behaviour of elusive, nocturnal carnivores not previously seen using conventional field methods."
https://openalex.org/W3012582388,"Background While depression is typically associated with reduced levels of empathy, this association differs depending on how empathy is measured. Given the importance of empathy in the parent–child relationship, we sought to examine whether the associations between depression and dispositional empathy would also extend to empathy towards one’s own child. Methods Within a non-clinical sample of 150 parents of young children, we examined the associations between self-reported depressive symptoms, dispositional empathic tendencies, and empathy specifically toward their own children, and how these associations might differ based on parent gender. Results Depressive symptoms were related to lower levels of cognitive and affective empathy, and higher levels of empathic distress. Over and above the association with dispositional empathy, depressive symptoms were associated with reduced levels of parents’ affective empathy toward their own child. The associations between depressive symptoms and both dispositional and own-child specific empathy varied by parent gender. For fathers, depressive symptoms predicted own-child specific affective empathy, over and above dispositional affective empathy, while for mothers, depressive symptoms predicted own-child specific empathic distress, over and above dispositional empathic distress. Conclusions The current findings provide further indication that caregivers with elevated depression may engage in patterns of thoughts and behaviors that have implications for their interactions with their children. Parents’ experienced empathy toward their own child may be one mechanism by which depression impacts the early caregiving environment, and thus may be an important target for intervention in improving the early caregiving experiences for children at elevated risk due to parental depression. Differences in cognitive and affective empathy found among those with depression may be even more pronounced in the thoughts and feelings towards one’s own child, making this an important clinical target."
https://openalex.org/W3012878965,"Purpose To assess the association of low- vs. guideline-recommended high-intensity cystoscopic surveillance with outcomes among patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Materials & methods A retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs patients diagnosed with high-risk NMIBC between 2005 and 2011 with follow-up through 2014. Patients were categorized by number of surveillance cystoscopies over two years following diagnosis: low- (1–5) vs. high-intensity (6 or more) surveillance. Propensity score adjusted regression models were used to assess the association of low-intensity cystoscopic surveillance with frequency of transurethral resections, and risk of progression to invasive disease and bladder cancer death. Results Among 1,542 patients, 520 (33.7%) underwent low-intensity cystoscopic surveillance. Patients undergoing low-intensity surveillance had fewer transurethral resections (37 vs. 99 per 100 person-years; p<0.001). Risk of death from bladder cancer did not differ significantly by low (cumulative incidence [CIn] 8.4% [95% CI 6.5–10.9) at 5 years) vs. high-intensity surveillance (CIn 9.1% [95% CI 7.4–11.2) at 5 years, p = 0.61). Low vs. high-intensity surveillance was not associated with increased risk of bladder cancer death among patients with Ta (CIn 5.7% vs. 8.2% at 5 years p = 0.24) or T1 disease at diagnosis (CIn 10.2% vs. 9.1% at 5 years, p = 0.58). Among patients with Ta disease, low-intensity surveillance was associated with decreased risk of progression to invasive disease (T1 or T2) or bladder cancer death (CIn 19.3% vs. 31.3% at 5 years, p = 0.002). Conclusions Patients with high-risk NMIBC undergoing low- vs. high-intensity cystoscopic surveillance underwent fewer transurethral resections, but did not experience an increased risk of progression or bladder cancer death. These findings provide a strong rationale for a clinical trial to determine whether low-intensity surveillance is comparable to high-intensity surveillance for cancer control in high-risk NMIBC."
https://openalex.org/W3012824443,"We investigate a no-boarding policy in a system of N buses serving M bus stops in a loop, which is an entrainment mechanism to keep buses synchronised in a reasonably staggered configuration. Buses always allow alighting, but would disallow boarding if certain criteria are met. For an analytically tractable theory, buses move with the same natural speed (applicable to programmable self-driving buses), where the average waiting time experienced by passengers waiting at the bus stop for a bus to arrive can be calculated. The analytical results show that a no-boarding policy can dramatically reduce the average waiting time, as compared to the usual situation without the no-boarding policy. Subsequently, we carry out simulations to verify these theoretical analyses, also extending the simulations to typical human-driven buses with different natural speeds based on real data. Finally, a simple general adaptive algorithm is implemented to dynamically determine when to implement no-boarding in a simulation for a real university shuttle bus service."
https://openalex.org/W3012834492,"Introduction The clinical and economic impact of cervical cancer consistently become a serious burden for all countries, including Indonesia. The implementation of HPV vaccination policy for a big country such as Indonesia requires a strong commitment from several decision-makers. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive description on cost-effectiveness and the budget-impact of HPV vaccination policy in Indonesia. Method A cohort Markov model was used to evaluate the cost and the clinical impact of HPV vaccination for 10 years old girls in Indonesia. The researchers consider two doses of all three available HPV vaccines adjusted with the HPV infection profilewith 95% vaccination coverage to estimate the national cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The Budget impact analysis explores three different scenarios covering (1) Two districts per year expansion, (2) oneprovince per year expansion and (3) achieving the National Immunization Program in 2024. Results Upon fully vaccinating almost 2.3 million 10-year-old girls, 34,723; 43,414; and 51,522 cervical cancer cases were prevented by Quadrivalent, Bivalent and Nonavalent vaccines, consecutively. Furthermore, the highest (591 cases) and lowest (399 cases) mortality were prevented by Nonavalent and Quadrivalent vaccines, respectively. Most of the vaccines were considerably cost-effective and only the Bivalent vaccine with the GAVI/UNICEF price which will be considered a cost-saving strategy.To provide national coverage of HPV vaccination in Indonesia, the government has to provide an annual budget of about US$49 million and US$22 million using the government contract price and GAVI/UNICEF price, respectively. Conclusion HPV vaccination shows a cost-effective strategy and the budget required to provide this policy is considerably affordable for Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W3012915235,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is crucial for tissue morphogenesis. Mutations in PCP genes cause multi-organ anomalies including dysplastic kidneys. Defective PCP signaling was postulated to contribute to cystogenesis in polycystic kidney disease. This work was undertaken to elucidate the role of the key PCP gene, Vangl2, in embryonic and postnatal renal tubules and ascertain whether its loss contributes to cyst formation and defective tubular function in mature animals. We generated mice with ubiquitous and collecting duct-restricted excision of Vangl2. We analyzed renal tubules in mutant and control mice at embryonic day E17.5 and postnatal days P1, P7, P30, P90, 6- and 9-month old animals. The collecting duct functions were analyzed in young and adult mutant and control mice. Loss of Vangl2 leads to profound tubular dilatation and microcysts in embryonic kidneys. Mechanistically, these abnormalities are caused by defective convergent extension (larger tubular cross-sectional area) and apical constriction (cuboidal cell shape and a reduction of activated actomyosin at the luminal surface). However, the embryonic tubule defects were rapidly resolved by Vangl2-independent mechanisms after birth. Normal collecting duct architecture and functions were found in young and mature animals. During embryogenesis, Vangl2 controls tubular size via convergent extension and apical constriction. However, rapidly after birth, PCP-dependent control of tubular size is switched to a PCP-independent regulatory mechanism. We conclude that loss of the Vangl2 gene is dispensable for tubular elongation and maintenance postnatally. It does not lead to cyst formation and is unlikely to contribute to polycystic kidney disease."

https://openalex.org/W3012920556,"Background Delta neutrophil index (DNI) can be used as a biomarker for infection to predict patient outcomes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between DNI and clinical outcomes in trauma patients who underwent abdominal surgery. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed injured patients who underwent emergent abdominal surgery in the regional trauma center of Wonju Severance Christian Hospital between March 2016 and May 2018. Patient characteristics, operation type, preoperative and postoperative laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Logistic regression analysis was performed for risk factors associated with mortality. Results Overall, 169 patients (mean age, 53.8 years; 66.3% male) were enrolled in this study, of which 19 (11.2%) died. The median injury severity score (ISS) was 12. The non-survivors had a significantly higher ISS [25(9–50) vs. 10(1–50), p<0.001] and serum lactate level (9.00±4.10 vs. 3.04±2.23, p<0.001) and more frequent shock (63.2% vs 23.3%, p<0.001) and solid organ injury (52.6% vs. 25.3%, p = 0.013) than the survivors. There were significant differences in postoperative DNI between the two groups (p<0.009 immediate post-operation, p = 0.001 on postoperative day 1 [POD1], and p = 0.013 on POD2). Logistic regression analysis showed that the independent factors associated with mortality were postoperative lactate level (odds ratio [OR] 1.926, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.101–3.089, p = 0.007), postoperative sequential organ failure assessment score (OR 1.593, 95% CI 1.160–2.187, p = 0.004), and DNI on POD1 (OR 1.118, 95% CI 1.028–1.215, p = 0.009). The receiver operating characteristics curve demonstrated that the area under the curve of DNI on POD1 was 0.887 (cut-off level: 7.1%, sensitivity 85.7%, and specificity 84.4%). Conclusions Postoperative DNI may be a useful biomarker to predict mortality in trauma patients who underwent emergent abdominal surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3012933623,"Most Atlantic salmon mariculture operations use open sea cages for the grow out phase. The ultimate fate and effects of the effluents and the possibilities of disease transfer between fish farms are major concerns for farmers, governance and the general public alike. Numerical model systems applied to studying and managing effluents and disease transfer in mariculture must realistically resolve the hydrodynamics in the vicinity of the fish farms. In the present study, the effects of the aquaculture structures on the current patterns were introduced in the ocean model system SINMOD. The drag parameters for the ocean model were determined by comparing the simulation results from the ANSYS Fluent ® software suite and SINMOD in an idealized channel setting with uniform currents. The model was run for a number of realistic scenarios in high horizontal resolution (∼30 m) with sea cages influencing the flow field. Comparisons between extensive current measurements and the simulation results showed that the model system reproduced the current local current field well. By running simulation scenarios with and without the effects of the sea cages on the flow field, it was possible to assess the importance of such effects for numerical dispersal models and aquaculture environment interactions simulations and hence for assessment of environmental impacts."
https://openalex.org/W3012662900,"The pathogenesis of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is dictated mainly by the immune-mediated-tissue inflammation developed. The understanding of the immunological mechanisms that generate tissue damage or resolution of lesions is the key to the development of effective vaccine protocols and proper therapeutic schemes. It is clear that the specific immune response mediated by T cells is responsible for the beneficial outcome of the disease, however, the roles of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK and NKT cell subpopulations in immunopathogenesis of CL need to be elucidated. Peripheral blood cells from patients before, during and after the antimonial therapy, as well as healthy individuals (HI) were cultured with (LbAgS) or without (NS) L. braziliensis antigens (LbAg). Afterwards, the frequencies of LbAg-specific-cytotoxic CD8+ T, CD4+ T, NK and CD3+CD56+ NKT cells, as well as their activation and exhaustion profiles, were defined by flow cytometry. We observed higher frequencies of CD8+ T, NK and CD3+CD56+ NKT cells and lower frequencies of CD4+ T lymphocytes in LbAgS cell cultures from patients before treatment. The specific response to LbAg resulted in an expansion of cytotoxic-activated CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells, before and during treatment, indicating specificity in the response by these cells against L. braziliensis. Furthermore, comparing the differences of frequencies of cytotoxic-activated CD4+T, CD8+T, and NK cells, among before and during treatment patients and HI groups, we conclude that these cell populations are in charge of immune response elicited by antimonial therapy. Interestingly, we also observed that NK cells were induced by LbAg to an exhaustion profile during all clinical stages of the disease. The increased antigen-specific activation and cytotoxic activity are in line with the strong inflammatory response described in this disease, a likely cause of tissue damage. These findings reinforce the involvement of these distinct cytotoxic-activated cell populations in the immunopathogenesis of CL, showing a character of specificity in this immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3012935296,"Extant research suggests that individuals employ traditional moral heuristics to support their observed altruistic behavior; yet findings have largely been limited to inductive extrapolation and rely on relatively few traditional frames in so doing, namely, deontology in organizational behavior and virtue theory in law and economics. Given that these and competing moral frames such as utilitarianism can manifest as identical behavior, we develop a moral framing instrument—the Philosophical Moral-Framing Measure (PMFM)—to expand and distinguish traditional frames associated and disassociated with observed altruistic behavior. The validation of our instrument based on 1015 subjects in 3 separate real stakes scenarios indicates that heuristic forms of deontology, virtue-theory, and utilitarianism are strongly related to such behavior, and that egoism is an inhibitor. It also suggests that deontic and virtue-theoretical frames may be commonly perceived as intertwined and opens the door for new research on self-abnegation, namely, a perceived moral obligation toward suffering and self-denial. These findings hold the potential to inform ongoing conversations regarding organizational citizenship and moral crowding out, namely, how financial incentives can undermine altruistic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3012660793,"Posttranslational generation of disulfide bonds catalyzed by bacterial Dsb (disulfide bond) enzymes is essential for the oxidative folding of many proteins. Although we now have a good understanding of the Escherichia coli disulfide bond formation system, there are significant gaps in our knowledge concerning the Dsb systems of other bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, a food-borne, zoonotic pathogen. We attempted to gain a more complete understanding of the process by thorough analysis of C8J_1298 functioning in vitro and in vivo. C8J_1298 is a homodimeric thiol-oxidoreductase present in wild type (wt) cells, in both reduced and oxidized forms. The protein was previously described as a homolog of DsbC, and thus potentially should be active in rearrangement of disulfides. Indeed, biochemical studies with purified protein revealed that C8J_1298 shares many properties with EcDsbC. However, its activity in vivo is dependent on the genetic background, namely, the set of other Dsb proteins present in the periplasm that determine the redox conditions. In wt C. jejuni cells, C8J_1298 potentially works as a DsbG involved in the control of the cysteine sulfenylation level and protecting single cysteine residues from oxidation to sulfenic acid. A strain lacking only C8J_1298 is indistinguishable from the wild type strain by several assays recognized as the criteria to determine isomerization or oxidative Dsb pathways. Remarkably, in C. jejuni strain lacking DsbA1, the protein involved in generation of disulfides, C8J_1298 acts as an oxidase, similar to the homodimeric oxidoreductase of Helicobater pylori, HP0231. In E. coli, C8J_1298 acts as a bifunctional protein, also resembling HP0231. These findings are strongly supported by phylogenetic data. We also showed that CjDsbD (C8J_0565) is a C8J_1298 redox partner."
https://openalex.org/W3012704795,"Sum of Ranking Differences is an innovative statistical method that ranks competing solutions based on a reference point. The latter might arise naturally, or can be aggregated from the data. We provide two case studies to feature both possibilities. Apportionment and districting are two critical issues that emerge in relation to democratic elections. Theoreticians invented clever heuristics to measure malapportionment and the compactness of the shape of the constituencies, yet, there is no unique best method in either cases. Using data from Norway and the US we rank the standard methods both for the apportionment and for the districting problem. In case of apportionment, we find that all the classical methods perform reasonably well, with subtle but significant differences. By a small margin the Leximin method emerges as a winner, but—somewhat unexpectedly—the non-regular Imperiali method ties for first place. In districting, the Lee-Sallee index and a novel parametric method the so-called Moment Invariant performs the best, although the latter is sensitive to the function’s chosen parameter."
https://openalex.org/W3012782263,"Background People living with HIV (PLWH) residing in rural areas experience substantial barriers to HIV care, which may contribute to poor HIV health outcomes, including retention in HIV care and viral suppression. The Health Resources and Services Administration’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (HRSA RWHAP) is an important source of HIV medical care and support services in rural areas. The purpose of this analysis was to (1) assess the reach of the RWHAP in rural areas of the United States, (2) compare the characteristics and funded services of RWHAP provider organizations in rural and non-rural areas, and (3) compare the characteristics and clinical outcomes of RWHAP clients accessing medical care and support services in rural and non-rural areas. Methods and findings Data for this analysis were abstracted from the 2017 RWHAP Services Report (RSR), the primary source of annual, client-level RWHAP data. Organizations funded to deliver RWHAP any service (“RWHAP providers”) were categorized as rural or non-rural according to the HRSA FORHP’s definition of modified Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. RWHAP clients were categorized based on their patterns of RWHAP service use as “visited only rural providers,” “visited only non-rural providers,” or “visited rural and non-rural providers.” In 2017, among the 2,113 providers funded by the RWHAP, 6.2% (n = 132) were located in HRSA-designated rural areas. Rural providers were funded to deliver a greater number of service categories per site than non-rural providers (44.7% funded for ≥5 services vs. 34.1% funded for ≥5 services, respectively). Providers in rural areas served fewer clients than providers in non-rural areas; 47.3% of RWHAP providers in rural areas served 1–99 clients, while 29.6% of non-rural providers served 1–99 clients. Retention in care and viral suppression outcomes did not differ on the basis of whether a client accessed services from rural or non-rural providers. Conclusions RWHAP providers are a crucial component of HIV care delivery in the rural United States despite evidence of significant barriers to engagement in care for rural PLWH, RWHAP clients who visited rural providers were just as likely to be retained in care and reach viral suppression as their counterparts who visited non-rural providers. The RWHAP, especially in partnership with Rural Health Clinics and federally funded Health Centers, has the infrastructure and expertise necessary to address the HIV epidemic in rural America."
https://openalex.org/W3012896578,"Individuals with chronic kidney disease have elevated levels of oxidative stress and are at a significantly higher risk of skeletal fracture. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which accumulate in bone and compromise mechanical properties, are known to be driven in part by oxidative stress. The goal of this study was to study effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on reducing oxidative stress and improving various bone parameters, most specifically mechanical properties, in an animal model of progressive CKD. Male Cy/+ (CKD) rats and unaffected littermates were untreated (controls) or treated with NAC (80 mg/kg, IP) from 30 to 35 weeks of age. Endpoint measures included serum biochemistries, assessments of systemic oxidative stress, bone morphology, and mechanical properties, and AGE levels in the bone. CKD rats had the expected phenotype that included low kidney function, elevated parathyroid hormone, higher cortical porosity, and compromised mechanical properties. NAC treatment had mixed effects on oxidative stress markers, significantly reducing TBARS (a measure of lipid peroxidation) while not affecting 8-OHdG (a marker of DNA oxidation) levels. AGE levels in the bone were elevated in CKD animals and were reduced with NAC although this did not translate to a benefit in bone mechanical properties. In conclusion, NAC failed to significantly improve bone architecture/geometry/mechanical properties in our rat model of progressive CKD."

A within-subjects design was used to evaluate seventeen (6 female and 11 male) tennis players (mean ± SD; 16.5 ± 1.3 years old; 1.75 ± 8.4 m; 67.0 ± 8.1 kg; 22.04 ± 1.8 kg/m2) on StV of three specific tennis actions (serve, forehand and backhand) and CODS for the following conditions: wearing a 50, 100, 150, 200 g weight or no weight at all (baseline). No significant differences were found between conditions for forehand (F = 0.412; p = 0.799), backhand (F = 0.269; p = 0.897) and serve (F = 0.541; p = 0.706) velocity and forehand (F = 1.688; p = 0.161), backhand (F = 0.567; p = 0.687) and serve (F = 2.382; p = 0.059) accuracy and CODS (F = 0.416; p = 0.797). Small-to-moderate effect sizes (ES) negatively affecting StV when using 200 g compared to the baseline (ES = 0.48, 0.35 and 0.45) could be observed. Moderate (ES = -0.49) and trivial (ES = -0.14 and -0.16) ES for a higher accuracy score were noticed in serve, forehand and backhand 100 g compared to the baseline. Moreover, small ES (ES = 0.41) for improvement in 200 g CODS comparing to baseline conditions were found. These results indicate that the use of a weighting set does not significantly affect StV or CODS respectively. Notwithstanding, small-to-moderate changes show impact in accuracy and no variance in velocity production when using 100 g alongside faster execution in CODS when using 200 g."
https://openalex.org/W3012872256,"Objective To investigate variation of care dependency after hip fracture across German regions based on the assessment by the German statutory long-term care insurance. Data sources/study setting Patient-level statutory health and long-term care insurance claims data from 2009–2011 and official statistical data from Germany. Study design We performed a retrospective cohort study. Investigated multinomial outcome categories were increase in care dependency (new onset or a higher care dependency than pre-fracture), no change as reference and death as competing risk in the quarterly period following hip fracture (follow-up 3 months). Regional variation was operationalized with the variance of regional-level random intercepts based on generalized linear mixed models. We adjusted for patient and regional characteristics. Principal findings The study included 122,887 hip fracture patients in 95 German postal code regions. Crude outcomes were 30.87% increase in care dependency and 14.35% death. Results indicated modest variation on regional level. Male sex, increasing age, increasing comorbidity, pertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fracture site compared to femoral neck, time from hospital admission to surgery of 3 or more days, as well as increasing inpatient length of stay, non-participation in rehabilitation and regions with lower hospital density were positively associated with an increase in care dependency. Conclusions Several characteristics on patient and regional level associated with the outcome were identified. Variation in the increase in care dependency after hip fracture appeared to be attributable primarily to patient characteristics. Variation on regional level was only modest."
https://openalex.org/W3012774627,"The Internet is a remarkably complex technical system. Its rapid growth has also brought technical issues such as problems to information retrieval. Search engines retrieve requested information based on the provided keywords. Consequently, it is difficult to accurately find the required information without understanding the syntax and semantics of the content. Multiple approaches are proposed to resolve this problem by employing the semantic web and linked data techniques. Such approaches serialize the content using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and execute the queries using SPARQL to resolve the problem. However, an exact match between RDF content and query structure is required. Although, it improves the keyword-based search; however, it does not provide probabilistic reasoning to find the semantic relationship between the queries and their results. From this perspective, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for searching RDF graphs. The proposed approach treats document requests as a classification problem. First, we preprocess the RDF graphs to convert them into N-Triples format. Second, bag-of-words (BOW) and word2vec feature modeling techniques are combined for a novel deep representation of RDF graphs. The attention mechanism enables the proposed approach to understand the semantic between RDF graphs. Third, we train a convolutional neural network for the accurate retrieval of RDF graphs using the deep representation. We employ 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is accurate and surpasses the state-of-the-art. The average accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure are up to 97.12%, 98.17%, 95.56%, and 96.85%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3012876000,"Background Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease with imbalance between the Th17 and T regulatory sub-populations. CD200/CD200R is an anti-inflammatory/immune-suppressive axis that might contribute to its pathogenesis given its relation to the Tregs induction. The current study aimed to investigate the status of the CD200/CD200R axis in the blood of psoriasis vulgaris patients versus healthy controls. Methods In this comparative cross sectional study, the blood levels of sCD200 and CD200R levels were measured in 25 psoriasis vulgaris patients and an age and sex matched 25 healthy controls using ELISA and flow-cytometry respectively. Their levels were tested for correlation to disease severity. Results sCD200 was significantly higher while CD200R was significantly lower in psoriasis vulgaris patients than in controls. They did not correlate to each other or to psoriasis severity although they differed significantly among cases of different severities. Conclusion Aberrant expression of CD200/CD200R might play a role in psoriasis vulgaris pathophysiology and disease severity. It might constitute a future target of therapy, but cannot be used as a marker of disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W3012830130,"Much of the literature surrounding bilingual spoken word recognition is based on bilinguals of non-tonal languages. In the Mandarin spoken word recognition literature, lexical tones are often considered as equally important as segments in lexical processing. It is unclear whether and how lexical tones contribute to bilingual language processing. One recent study demonstrates that tonal bilinguals require the availability of both tonal and segmental information to induce cross-language lexical competition during bilingual lexical access, even without phonological overlap between the target and non-target language. The current study investigates whether overt phonological overlap between the target and non-target language would equally require both tonal and segmental information available to induce cross-language lexical competition. We employed two auditory lexical decision experiments with both Mandarin-English bilinguals and English monolinguals to test whether inter-lingual homophones (IH) would induce lexical competition from the non-target language, L1 Mandarin. Our results show that cross-language lexical competition was only observed with the presence of lexical tones, in addition to segmental overlap."
https://openalex.org/W3012881611,"The perception of the body and its parts has traditionally been studied using the conscious body image. Here, we determine the implicit representation of the hand. Participants were sequentially shown two life-size images of either the dorsal or palmar surface of their hand. In one interval either the horizontal or vertical dimension of the image was varied using an adaptive staircase, while the other interval contained the full-size, undistorted image. Participants reported which image most closely matched their hand. The staircase honed in on the distorted image that was equally likely to be judged as matching their own hand as the accurate image. The implicit representation was taken as midway between these two images. The experiment was repeated with different hand orientations. Perceived width depended on the orientation, with differences found between the upright and right orientations. Interestingly, the perceived length of the dorsum and palm were different from each other—length of the dorsum was overestimated whereas palm length was perceived accurately. This study reveals distortions of the implicit representation of the hands in healthy individuals."
