https://openalex.org/W3119803887,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a leading cause of infectious blindness. Current treatments for HSV-1 do not eliminate the virus from the site of infection or latent reservoirs in the trigeminal ganglia. Here, we target HSV-1 genomes directly using mRNA-carrying lentiviral particles that simultaneously deliver SpCas9 mRNA and viral-gene-targeting guide RNAs (designated HSV-1-erasing lentiviral particles, termed HELP). We show that HELP efficiently blocks HSV-1 replication and the occurrence of herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) in three different infection models. HELP was capable of eliminating the viral reservoir via retrograde transport from corneas to trigeminal ganglia. Additionally, HELP inhibited viral replication in human-derived corneas without causing off-target effects, as determined by whole-genome sequencing. These results support the potential clinical utility of HELP for treating refractory HSK. CRISPR–Cas9 eliminates herpes simplex virus both in the corneal infection site and in the viral reservoir of the trigeminal ganglia."

These DNA fragments are derived from fragmented chromatin in dying cells and retain some of the cell-of-origin histone modifications. In this study, we applied chromatin immunoprecipitation of cell-free nucleosomes carrying active chromatin modifications followed by sequencing (cfChIP-seq) to 268 human samples. In healthy donors, we identified bone marrow megakaryocytes, but not erythroblasts, as major contributors to the cfDNA pool. In patients with a range of liver diseases, we showed that we can identify pathology-related changes in hepatocyte transcriptional programs. In patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma, we detected clinically relevant and patient-specific information, including transcriptionally active human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplifications. Altogether, cfChIP-seq, using low sequencing depth, provides systemic and genome-wide information and can inform diagnosis and facilitate interrogation of physiological and pathological processes using blood samples."
https://openalex.org/W3119049870,"Humans’ decision making process often relies on utilizing visual information from different views or perspectives. However, in machine-learning-based image classification we typically infer an object’s class from just a single image showing an object. Especially for challenging classification problems, the visual information conveyed by a single image may be insufficient for an accurate decision. We propose a classification scheme that relies on fusing visual information captured through images depicting the same object from multiple perspectives. Convolutional neural networks are used to extract and encode visual features from the multiple views and we propose strategies for fusing these information. More specifically, we investigate the following three strategies: (1) fusing convolutional feature maps at differing network depths; (2) fusion of bottleneck latent representations prior to classification; and (3) score fusion. We systematically evaluate these strategies on three datasets from different domains. Our findings emphasize the benefit of integrating information fusion into the network rather than performing it by post-processing of classification scores. Furthermore, we demonstrate through a case study that already trained networks can be easily extended by the best fusion strategy, outperforming other approaches by large margin."
https://openalex.org/W3121009300,"DNA has been the predominant information storage medium for biology and holds great promise as a next-generation high-density data medium in the digital era. Currently, the vast majority of DNA-based data storage approaches rely on in vitro DNA synthesis. As such, there are limited methods to encode digital data into the chromosomes of living cells in a single step. Here, we describe a new electrogenetic framework for direct storage of digital data in living cells. Using an engineered redox-responsive CRISPR adaptation system, we encoded binary data in 3-bit units into CRISPR arrays of bacterial cells by electrical stimulation. We demonstrate multiplex data encoding into barcoded cell populations to yield meaningful information storage and capacity up to 72 bits, which can be maintained over many generations in natural open environments. This work establishes a direct digital-to-biological data storage framework and advances our capacity for information exchange between silicon- and carbon-based entities. A new DNA data storage technology—data recording in vivo by electrical stimulation (DRIVES)—places CRISPR-based DNA encoding activity under electrochemical control by coupling cellular redox state to CRISPR array gene expression."

While multiple tools are available to aid oxygenation, data supporting immune biomarkers for monitoring the host-pathogen interaction across disease stages and for titrating immunomodulatory therapy is lacking. Methods In this single-center cohort study, we used an immunoassay platform that enables rapid and quantitative measurement of interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), a host protein involved in lung injury from virus-induced hyperinflammation. A dynamic clinical decision support protocol was followed to manage patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and examine the potential utility of timely and serial measurements of IP-10 as tool in regulating inflammation. Results Overall, 502 IP-10 measurements were performed on 52 patients between 7 April and 10 May 2020, with 12 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. IP-10 levels correlated with COVID-19 severity scores and admission to the intensive care unit. Among patients in the intensive care unit, the number of days with IP-10 levels exceeding 1,000 pg/mL was associated with mortality. Administration of corticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy decreased IP-10 levels significantly. Only two patients presented with subsequent IP-10 flare-ups exceeding 1,000 pg/mL and died of COVID-19-related complications. Conclusions Serial and readily available IP-10 measurements potentially represent an actionable aid in managing inflammation in COVID-19 patients and therapeutic decision-making.

https://openalex.org/W3119939294,"Growth curve measurements are commonly used in microbiology, while the use of microplate readers for such measurements provides better temporal resolution and higher throughput. However, evaluating bacterial growth with microplate readers has been hurdled by barriers such as multiple scattering. Here, we report our development of a method based on the time derivatives of the optical density (OD) and/or fluorescence (FL) of bacterial cultures to overcome these barriers. First, we illustrated our method using quantitative models and numerical simulations, which predicted the number of bacteria and the number of fluorescent proteins in time as well as their time derivatives. Then, we systematically investigated how the time derivatives depend on the parameters in the models/simulations, providing a framework for understanding the FL growth curves. In addition, as a demonstration, we applied our method to study the lag time elongation of bacteria subjected to treatment with silver (Ag + ) ions and found that the results from our method corroborated well with that from growth curve fitting by the Gompertz model that has been commonly used in the literature. Furthermore, this method was applied to the growth of bacteria in the presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) at various concentrations, where the OD curve measurements failed. We showed that our method allowed us to successfully extract the growth behavior of the bacteria from the FL measurements and understand how the growth was affected by the AgNPs."
https://openalex.org/W3118603277,"Introduction Rapid urbanization and industrialization drives the rising burden of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) worldwide that are characterized by uptake of unhealthy lifestyle such as tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet. In India, the prevalence of various NCDs and its risk factors shows wide variations across geographic regions necessitating region-specific evidence for population-based prevention and control of NCDs. Objective To estimate the prevalence of behavioral and biological risk factors of NCDs among adult population (18–69 years) in the Puducherry district located in Southern part of India. Methodology We surveyed adults using the World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed STEPwise approach to NCD surveillance (STEPS) during February 2019 to February 2020. A total of 2560 individuals were selected from urban and rural areas (50 clusters in each) through multi-stage cluster random sampling method. STEPS instrument was used to assess behavioral and physical measurements. Fasting blood sample was collected to estimate biochemical risk factors (Diabetes, Hypercholesterolemia) of NCDs. Results Among men, alcohol use 40.4% (95% CI: 37.4–43.4) was almost twice higher compared to tobacco use 24.4% (95% CI: 21.7–26.9). Nearly half of the population was physically inactive 45.8% (95% CI: 43.8–47.8) and obese 46.1% (95% CI: 44–48.1). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were present among one-third 33.6% (95% CI: 31.6–35.5) and one-fourth 26.7% (95% CI: 24.1–29.1) of the population which were significantly higher among men (37.1% vs 30.8% and 31.6% vs 23.2% respectively). Physical inactivity and overweight/obesity increased with increasing education levels. Tobacco and alcohol use was more common among men, whereas physical inactivity with obesity and hypercholesterolemia was higher among women. Conclusion We found high prevalence of various NCDs and its risk factors among the adult population of Puducherry district."
https://openalex.org/W3119311421,"Background Understanding contraceptive use dynamics is critical to addressing unmet need for contraception. Despite evidence that male partners may influence contraceptive decision-making, few studies have prospectively examined the supportive ways that men influence women’s contraceptive use and continuation. Objective This study sought to understand the predictive effect of partner influence, defined as partner’s fertility intentions and support for contraception, and discussions about avoiding pregnancy prior to contraceptive use, on contraceptive use dynamics (continuation, discontinuation, switching, adoption) over a one-year period. Methods This study uses nationally representative longitudinal data of Ugandan women aged 15–49 collected in 2018–2019 (n = 4,288 women baseline; n = 2,755 women one-year follow-up). Two analytic sub-samples of women in union and in need of contraception at baseline were used (n = 618 contraceptive users at baseline for discontinuation/switching analysis; n = 687 contraceptive non-users at baseline for adoption analysis). Primary dependent variables encompassed contraceptive use dynamics (continuation, discontinuation, switching, and adoption); three independent variables assessed partner influence. For each sub-sample, bivariate associations explored differences in sociodemographic and partner influences by contraceptive dynamics. Multinomial regression models were used to examine discontinuation and switching for contraceptive users at baseline; logistic regression identified predictors of contraceptive adoption among non-users at baseline. Results Among users at baseline, 26.3% of women switched methods and 31.5% discontinued contraceptive use by follow-up. Multinomial logistic regression, adjusting for women’s characteristics, indicated the relative risk of contraceptive discontinuation doubled when women did not discuss pregnancy avoidance with their partner prior to contraceptive use. Partner influence was not related to method switching. Among non-users at baseline, partner support for future contraceptive use was associated with nearly three-fold increased odds of contraceptive adoption. Significance These results highlight the potentially supportive role of male partners in contraceptive adoption. Future research is encouraged to elucidate the complex pathways between couple-based decision-making and contraceptive dynamics through further prospective studies."
https://openalex.org/W3118993376,"Epitope-specific enzymes are powerful tools for site-specific protein modification but generally require genetic manipulation of the target protein. Here, we describe the laboratory evolution of the bacterial transpeptidase sortase A to recognize the LMVGG sequence in endogenous amyloid-β (Aβ) protein. Using a yeast display selection for covalent bond formation, we evolved a sortase variant that prefers LMVGG substrates from a starting enzyme that prefers LPESG substrates, resulting in a >1,400-fold change in substrate preference. We used this evolved sortase to label endogenous Aβ in human cerebrospinal fluid, enabling the detection of Aβ with sensitivities rivaling those of commercial assays. The evolved sortase can conjugate a hydrophilic peptide to Aβ42, greatly impeding the ability of the resulting protein to aggregate into higher-order structures. These results demonstrate laboratory evolution of epitope-specific enzymes toward endogenous targets as a strategy for site-specific protein modification without target gene manipulation and enable potential future applications of sortase-mediated labeling of Aβ peptides. Laboratory evolution of the bacterial transpeptidase sortase A coupled with yeast display selection enables a change of the enzyme’s substrate preference to recognize and covalently label endogenous amyloid-β protein, impeding the protein’s ability to aggregate."
https://openalex.org/W3120128985,"In the midst of the current coronavirus pandemic, the United States continues to struggle with an ongoing opioid epidemic, initially fueled by widespread prescribing of opioid medications during the 1990s. The primary reason for prescribing opioids is to treat pain. Women have more acute and chronic pain and have been prescribed these drugs in significantly greater numbers than men. Comparison of women and men with chronic pain also shows that women receive the majority of prescription opioids, and the use of these prescribed medications became the major pathway to misuse and addiction for women. Yet, recognition of the extent of women's exposure to opioids and the attendant consequences has been limited. Attempts to stem the overall tide of the epidemic focused on reducing the availability of prescription opioids. However, as these medications became more difficult to obtain and treatment opportunities were limited, many turned to other synthetic opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl. Thus, the public health crisis of opioid addiction has endured. This paper highlights the importance of understanding differences among women and men in opioid use and its biological and psychosocial effects to advance the gender-based treatment approaches and effective public health policy."
https://openalex.org/W3119018558,"Retrotransposons can cause somatic genome variation in the human nervous system, which is hypothesized to have relevance to brain development and neuropsychiatric disease. However, the detection of individual somatic mobile element insertions presents a difficult signal-to-noise problem. Using a machine-learning method (RetroSom) and deep whole-genome sequencing, we analyzed L1 and Alu retrotransposition in sorted neurons and glia from human brains. We characterized two brain-specific L1 insertions in neurons and glia from a donor with schizophrenia. There was anatomical distribution of the L1 insertions in neurons and glia across both hemispheres, indicating retrotransposition occurred during early embryogenesis. Both insertions were within the introns of genes (CNNM2 and FRMD4A) inside genomic loci associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Proof-of-principle experiments revealed these L1 insertions significantly reduced gene expression. These results demonstrate that RetroSom has broad applications for studies of brain development and may provide insight into the possible pathological effects of somatic retrotransposition."
https://openalex.org/W3119567983,"Allowing students to voluntarily ask and answer questions in front of the whole class are common teaching practices used in college science courses. However, few studies have examined college science students’ perceptions of these practices, the extent to which students choose to engage in these practices, and what discourages students from participating. In this study, we surveyed 417 undergraduates at a research-intensive institution about their experiences asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses. Specifically, students answered questions about to what extent they perceive voluntarily asking and answering questions in large-enrollment science courses is helpful to them and why. They also answered questions about to what extent they engage in asking and answering questions in large-enrollment college science courses and what factors could discourage them from participating. Using binary logistic regression, we examined whether there were differences among students of different demographic groups regarding their opinions about asking and answering questions. We found that overwhelmingly students reported that other students voluntarily asking and answering instructor questions is helpful to them. Notably, compared to continuing generation students, first-generation students were more likely to perceive other students asking questions to be helpful. Despite perceiving asking and answering questions to be helpful, over half of students reported that they never ask or answer questions in large-enrollment college science courses during a semester, and women were more likely than men to report never asking questions. We identified fear of negative evaluation, or students’ sense of dread associated with being unfavorably evaluated, as a primary factor influencing their decision to answer instructor questions. This work adds to a growing body of literature on student participation in large-enrollment college science courses and begins to uncover underlying factors influencing student participation."
https://openalex.org/W3120883776,"Emergency Departments (EDs) worldwide are confronted with rising patient volumes causing significant strains on both Emergency Medicine and entire healthcare systems. Consequently, many EDs are in a situation where the number of patients in the ED is temporarily beyond the capacity for which the ED is designed and resourced to manage―a phenomenon called Emergency Department (ED) crowding. ED crowding can impair the quality of care delivered to patients and lead to longer patient waiting times for ED doctor’s consult (time to provider) and admission to the hospital ward. In Singapore, total ED attendance at public hospitals has grown significantly, that is, roughly 5.57% per year between 2005 and 2016 and, therefore, emergency physicians have to cope with patient volumes above the safe workload. The purpose of this study is to create a virtual ED that closely maps the processes of a hospital-based ED in Singapore using system dynamics, that is, a computer simulation method, in order to visualize, simulate, and improve patient flows within the ED. Based on the simulation model (virtual ED), we analyze four policies: (i) co-location of primary care services within the ED, (ii) increase in the capacity of doctors, (iii) a more efficient patient transfer to inpatient hospital wards, and (iv) a combination of policies (i) to (iii). Among the tested policies, the co-location of primary care services has the largest impact on patients’ average length of stay (ALOS) in the ED. This implies that decanting non-emergency lower acuity patients from the ED to an adjacent primary care clinic significantly relieves the burden on ED operations. Generally, in Singapore, there is a tendency to strengthen primary care and to educate patients to see their general practitioners first in case of non-life threatening, acute illness."
https://openalex.org/W3119869079,"Maintaining ovarian steroidogenesis is of critical importance, considering that steroid hormones are required for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and proper development of embryos and fetuses. Investigating the mechanism that butyrate modulates the ovarian steroidogenesis is beneficial for understanding the impact of lipid nutrition on steroidogenesis. Herein, we identified that butyrate improved estradiol and progesterone synthesis in rat primary ovarian granulosa cells and human granulosa KGN cells and discovered the related mechanism. Our data indicated that butyrate was sensed by GPR41 and GPR43 in ovarian granulosa cells. Butyrate primarily upregulated the acetylation of histone H3K9 (H3K9ac). Chromatin immune-precipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of H3K9ac revealed the influenced pathways involving in the mitochondrial function (including cellular metabolism and steroidogenesis) and cellular antioxidant capacity. Additionally, increasing H3K9ac by butyrate further stimulated the PPARγ/CD36/StAR pathways to increase ovarian steroidogenesis and activated PGC1α to enhance mitochondrial dynamics and alleviate oxidative damage. The improvement in antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial dynamics by butyrate enhanced ovarian steroidogenesis. Collectively, butyrate triggers histone H3K9ac to activate steroidogenesis through PPARγ and PGC1α pathways in ovarian granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W3120362180,"Introduction Impaired utero-placental perfusion is a well-known feature of early preeclampsia and is associated with placental hypoxia and oxidative stress. Although aberrations at the level of the mitochondrion have been implicated in PE pathophysiology, whether or not hypoxia-induced mitochondrial abnormalities contribute to placental oxidative stress is unknown. Methods We explored whether abnormalities in mitochondrial metabolism contribute to hypoxia-induced placental oxidative stress by using both healthy term placentae as well as a trophoblast cell line (BeWo cells) exposed to hypoxia. Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic potential of the antioxidants MitoQ and quercetin in preventing hypoxia-induced placental oxidative stress. Results Both in placental explants as well as BeWo cells, hypoxia resulted in reductions in mitochondrial content, decreased abundance of key molecules involved in the electron transport chain and increased expression and activity of glycolytic enzymes. Furthermore, expression levels of key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis were decreased while the abundance of constituents of the mitophagy, autophagy and mitochondrial fission machinery was increased in response to hypoxia. In addition, placental hypoxia was associated with increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Moreover, experiments with MitoQ revealed that hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species originated from the mitochondria in the trophoblasts. Discussion This study is the first to demonstrate that placental hypoxia is associated with mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species and significant alterations in the molecular pathways controlling mitochondrial content and function. Furthermore, our data indicate that targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress may have therapeutic benefit in the management of pathologies related to placental hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W3119118203,"Background The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) funded the Evidence-Based Tele-Emergency Network Grant Program (EB TNGP) to serve the dual purpose of providing telehealth services in rural emergency departments (teleED) and systematically collecting data to inform the telehealth evidence base. This provided a unique opportunity to examine trends across multiple teleED networks and examine heterogeneity in processes and outcomes. Method and findings Six health systems received funding from HRSA under the EB TNGP to implement teleED services and they did so to 65 hospitals (91% rural) in 11 states. Three of the grantees provided teleED services to a general patient population while the remaining three grantees provided teleED services to specialized patient populations (i.e., stroke, behavioral health, critically ill children). Over a 26-month period (November 1, 2015 –December 31, 2017), each grantee submitted patient-level data for all their teleED encounters on a uniform set of measures to the data coordinating center. The six grantees reported a total of 4,324 teleED visits and 99.86% were technically successful. The teleED patients were predominantly adult, White, not Latinx, and covered by Medicare or private insurance. Across grantees, 7% of teleED patients needed resuscitation services, 58% were rated as emergent, and 30% were rated as urgent. Across grantees, 44.2% of teleED patients were transferred to another inpatient facility, 26.0% had a routine discharge, and 24.5% were admitted to the local inpatient facility. For the three grantees who served a general patient population, the most frequent presenting complaints for which teleED was activated were chest pain (25.7%), injury or trauma (17.1%), stroke symptoms (9.9%), mental/behavioral health (9.8%), and cardiac arrest (9.5%). The teleED consultation began before the local clinician exam in 37.8% of patients for the grantees who served a general patient population, but in only 1.9% of patients for the grantees who provided specialized services. Conclusions Grantees used teleED services for a representative rural population with urgent or emergent symptoms largely resulting in transfer to a distant hospital or inpatient admission locally. TeleED was often available as the first point of contact before a local provider examination. This finding points to the important role of teleED in improving access for rural ED patients."

Methods In 24 participants, three PPT and TSP measures were assessed at four sites (2 at the low back, 2 at the forearm) in two blocks of measurements separated by 20 minutes. The standard error of measurement, the minimal detectable change (MDC) and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were investigated for five different sequences of measurements (e.g. measurement 1, 1–2, 1-2-3). Results The MDC for the group (MDC gr ) for PPT ranged from 28.71 to 50.56 kPa across the sites tested, whereas MDC gr for TSP varied from 0.33 to 0.57 out of 10 (numeric scale). Almost all ICC showed an excellent relative reliability (between 0.80 and 0.97), except when only the first measurement was considered (moderate). Although minimal differences in absolute PPT reliability were present between the different sequences, in general, using only the first measurement increase measurement error. Three TSP measures reduced the measurement error. Discussion We established that two measurements of PPT and three of TSP reduced the measurement error and demonstrated an excellent relative reliability. Our results could be used in future pain research to confirm the presence of true hypo/hyperalgesia for paradigms such as conditioned pain modulation or exercise-induced hypoalgesia, indicated by a change exceeding the measurement variability."

https://openalex.org/W3118868681,"Nicotine oxidoreductase (NicA2), a member of the flavin-containing amine oxidase family, is of medical relevance as it shows potential as a therapeutic to aid cessation of smoking due to its ability to oxidize nicotine into a non-psychoactive metabolite. However, the use of NicA2 in this capacity is stymied by its dismal O2-dependent activity. Unlike other enzymes in the amine oxidase family, NicA2 reacts very slowly with O2, severely limiting its nicotine-degrading activity. Instead of using O2 as an oxidant, we discovered that NicA2 donates electrons to a cytochrome c, which means that NicA2 is actually a dehydrogenase. This is surprising, as enzymes of the flavin-containing amine oxidase family were invariably thought to use O2 as an electron acceptor. Our findings establish new perspectives for engineering this potentially useful therapeutic and prompt a reconsideration of the term ‘oxidase’ in referring to members of the flavin-containing amine ‘oxidase’ family. Unlike other amine oxidase-family enzymes, nicotine oxidoreductase (NicA2) reacts very slowly with oxygen, prompting the search for and identification of a cytochrome c protein (CycN) that is responsible for accepting electrons from NicA2 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3119569715,"Image processing technologies are available for high-throughput acquisition and analysis of phenotypes for crop populations, which is of great significance for crop growth monitoring, evaluation of seedling condition, and cultivation management. However, existing methods rely on empirical segmentation thresholds, thus can have insufficient accuracy of extracted phenotypes. Taking maize as an example crop, we propose a phenotype extraction approach from top-view images at the seedling stage. An end-to-end segmentation network, named PlantU-net, which uses a small amount of training data, was explored to realize automatic segmentation of top-view images of a maize population at the seedling stage. Morphological and color related phenotypes were automatic extracted, including maize shoot coverage, circumscribed radius, aspect ratio, and plant azimuth plane angle. The results show that the approach can segment the shoots at the seedling stage from top-view images, obtained either from the UAV or tractor-based high-throughput phenotyping platform. The average segmentation accuracy, recall rate, and F1 score are 0.96, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The extracted phenotypes, including maize shoot coverage, circumscribed radius, aspect ratio, and plant azimuth plane angle, are highly correlated with manual measurements (R 2 = 0.96–0.99). This approach requires less training data and thus has better expansibility. It provides practical means for high-throughput phenotyping analysis of early growth stage crop populations."

The aim of this study was to assess both short- and long-term between- and within-group differences in affective disturbance among FA, OM and their combination (MBCT) in the context of a randomized controlled trial. Method One hundred and four participants with mild to severe depression and anxiety were randomized into one of three 8-week interventions: MBCT (n = 32), FA (n = 36) and OM (n = 36). Outcome measures included the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS), and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Mixed effects regression models were used to assess differential treatment effects during treatment, post-treatment (8 weeks) and long-term (20 weeks). The Reliable Change Index (RCI) was used to translate statistical findings into clinically meaningful improvements or deteriorations. Results All treatments demonstrated medium to large improvements ( ds = 0.42–1.65) for almost all outcomes. While all treatments were largely comparable in their effects at post-treatment (week 8), the treatments showed meaningful differences in rapidity of response and pattern of deteriorations. FA showed the fastest rate of improvement and the fewest deteriorations on stress, anxiety and depression during treatment, but a loss of treatment-related gains and lasting deteriorations in depression at week 20. OM showed the slowest rate of improvement and lost treatment-related gains for anxiety, resulting in higher anxiety in OM at week 20 than MBCT ( d = 0.40) and FA ( d = 0.36), though these differences did not reach statistical significance after correcting for multiple comparisons ( p’s = .06). MBCT and OM showed deteriorations in stress, anxiety and depression at multiple timepoints during treatment, with lasting deteriorations in stress and depression. MBCT showed the most favorable pattern for long-term treatment of depression. Conclusions FA, OM and MBCT show different patterns of response for different dimensions of affective disturbance.

https://openalex.org/W3119035947,"This study was conducted to evaluate the mucosal immune responses of rainbow trout when supplementing an experimental formulated feed with multi-strain yeast fraction product ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cyberlindnera jardinii ). In total, 360 fish (initial BW 23.1 ± 0.2 g) were randomly allotted into three dietary treatments in an 8-week feeding trial. The dietary treatments included basal diet (control) and control + 1.5 g/kg multi-strain yeast fraction product (MsYF) fed continuously and pulsed every two weeks between control and MsYF diet. No negative effects on growth performance of feeding the MsYF supplemented diet were observed. SGR and FCR averaged 2.30 ± 0.03%/day and 1.03 ± 0.03, respectively, across experimental groups. Muscularis thickness in the anterior intestine after 8 weeks of feeding was significantly elevated by 44.3% in fish fed the MsYF continuously, and by 14.4% in fish fed the MsYF pulsed ( P &lt; 0.02). Significant elevations in goblet cell density in the anterior and posterior (&gt;50% increase) intestine were observed after 8 weeks of feeding the MsYF supplemented diet ( P &lt; 0.03). In contrast, lamina propria width was significantly lower in fish fed the experimental diets (&gt;10% reduction). The gene expression analysis of the intestine revealed significant elevations in expression of tlr2 , il1r1 , irak4 , and tollip2 after 4 weeks of feeding the MsYF. Significant elevations in effector cytokines tnfα , il10 and tgfβ were observed after 4 weeks of feeding the MsYF regime. After 8 weeks significant elevations in the gene expression levels of il1β , ifnγ , and il12 were observed in fish fed the MsYF. Likewise, the expression of the transcription factor gata3 was significantly elevated ( P &lt;0.01). Supplementation of the multi-strain yeast fraction product positively modulates the intestinal mucosal response of rainbow trout through interaction with toll-like receptor two signalling pathway and potential for increased capacity of delivery of antigens to the underlying mucosal associated lymphoid tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3119846213,"The study aimed to adapt the standardized Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C) into the Czech language and assess its psychometric properties. A forwards-and-backwards translation method was carried out to prepare the Czech PAQ-C version (PAQ-C/CZ), followed by adjustments based on socio-cultural aspects. In the next phase, participants (n = 169) wore accelerometers for seven days. On the 8th day, participants completed the PAQ-C/CZ in school so that it was possible to determine the concurrent validity (correlation between the accelerometer and PAQ-C/CZ data, Spearman’s r), internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha), item/scale properties (corrected item-total correlations, CITCs), and factor structure (exploratory factor analysis, EFA) for PAQ-C/CZ. In the last phase, participants (n = 63) completed the PAQ-C/CZ twice on two consecutive school days in the morning to determine the test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC; independent sample T-test). The PAQ-C/CZ indicated moderate internal consistency (alpha = 0.77), acceptable item/scale properties (CITCs = 0.29–0.61), and good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.73–0.94). The EFA findings suggested a single factor model (factor load = 0.32–0.73) for PAQ-C/CZ, with items 2, 3, and 4 contributing low to the total score. Results on concurrent validity showed low but significant association (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.05) between accelerometer and PAQ-C/CZ data. Considering the study results, the PAQ-C/CZ can be recommended as a tool for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity assessment in large-sample research studies only, but with an emphasis on the interpretation of the correct results."
https://openalex.org/W3120035574,"Purpose To evaluate the retinal vessel density (VD) in the macular region and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in patients with and without disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRILs) after resolution of diabetic macular edema. Methods Thirty-seven eyes of 37 DRIL patients (mean age 63 ± 13.97 years), 30 eyes of 30 no DRIL patients and 35 eyes of 35 controls were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the VD in the macular region of superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP) and FAZ area. Results DRIL and no DRIL groups showed decreased VD in SCP and DCP (p&lt;0.05) and a larger FAZ area (p&lt;0.001) compared to controls. However, DRIL patients revealed a statistically significant reduction in VD of SCP (p = 0.041) and a greater FAZ area (p&lt;0.001) with respect to no DRIL patients. We found a significant negative correlation between the VD of the foveal SCP (r = -0.414, p = 0.011), foveal DCP (r = -0.358, p = 0.025) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in DRIL group. Moreover there was a significant positive correlation between the FAZ area (r = 0.425, p = 0.034) and BCVA. Therefore, in presence of DRILs lower VD values of SCP and DCP and a larger FAZ area correlated with a worse visual acuity. In no DRILs group, there was a significant negative correlation between the VD of the foveal DCP and BCVA. Conclusion OCTA highlights the role of retinal vascular ischemia in the pathogenesis of DRILs. This parameter could represent an important functional predictive factor in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3120652087,"Objectives Evidence regarding the prevalence of medication prescribing errors (PEs) and potential factors that increase PEs among patients treated in the emergency department (ED) are limited. This study aimed to explore the prevalence and nature of PEs in discharge prescriptions in the ED and identify potential risk factors associated with PEs. Methods This was a prospective observational cross-sectional study in an ambulatory ED in a tertiary teaching hospital. Data were collected for six months using a customized reporting tool. All patients discharged from ED with a discharged prescription within the study period were enrolled in this study. Results About 13.5% (n = 68) of the 504 prescriptions reviewed (for 504 patients) had at least one error. Main PEs encountered were wrong dose (23.2%), wrong frequency (20.7%), and wrong strength errors (14.6%). About 36.8% of identified PEs were related to pediatric prescriptions, followed by the acute care emergency unit (26.5%) and the triage emergency unit (20.6%). The main leading human-related causes associated with PEs were lack of knowledge (40.9%) followed by an improper selection from a computer operator list (31.8%). The leading contributing systems related factors were pre-printed medication orders (50%), lack of training (31.5%), noise level (13.0%), and frequent interruption of prescriber and distraction (11.1%). Prescribers' involved with the identified errors were resident physicians (39.4%), specialists (30.3%), and (24.4%) were made by general practitioners. Physicians rejected around 12% of the pharmacist-raised recommendations related to the identified PEs as per their clinical judgment. Conclusion PEs in ED setting are common, and multiple human and systems-related factors may contribute to the development of PEs. Further training to residents and proper communication between the healthcare professionals may reduce the risk of PEs in ED."

https://openalex.org/W3118272200,"To date, there are limited and incomplete data on possible sex-based differences in fiber-types of skeletal muscle and their response to physical exercise. Adult healthy male and female mice completed a single bout of endurance exercise to examine the sex-based differences of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60), interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression, as well as the Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) fiber-type distribution in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. Our results showed for the first time that in male soleus, a muscle rich of type IIa fibers, endurance exercise activates specifically genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1 α1 isoform, Hsp60 and IL-6, whereas the expression of PGC1 α2 and α3 was significantly upregulated in EDL muscle, a fast-twitch skeletal muscle, independently from the gender. Moreover, we found that the acute response of different PGC1α isoforms was muscle and gender dependent. These findings add a new piece to the huge puzzle of muscle response to physical exercise. Given the importance of these genes in the physiological response of the muscle to exercise, we strongly believe that our data could support future research studies to personalize a specific and sex-based exercise training protocol."
https://openalex.org/W3119259231,"Background Undernutrition is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality among adolescent girls worldwide, especially in South-East Asia and Africa. Even though adolescence is a window of opportunity to break the intergenerational cycle of undernutrition, adolescent girls are a neglected group. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status and associated factors among adolescent girls in the Wolaita and Hadiya zones of Southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted, and a multistage random sampling method was used to select a sample of 843 adolescent girls. Anthropometric measurements were collected from all participants and entered in the WHO Anthro plus software for Z-score analysis. The data was analyzed using EPI-data 4.4.2 and SPSS version 21.0. The odds ratios for logistic regression along with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated. A P-value &lt; 0.05 was declared as the level of statistical significance. Result Thinness (27.5%) and stunting (8.8%) are found to be public health problems in the study area. Age [AOR(adjusted odds ratio) (95% CI) = 2.91 (2.03–4.173)], large family size [AOR (95% CI) = 1.63(1.105–2.396)], low monthly income [AOR (95% CI) = 2.54(1.66–3.87)], not taking deworming tablets [AOR (95% CI) = 1.56(1.11–21)], low educational status of the father [AOR (95% CI) = 2.45(1.02–5.86)], the source of food for the family only from market [AOR (95% CI) = 5.14(2.1–12.8)], not visited by health extension workers [AOR (95% CI) = 1.72(1.7–2.4)], and not washing hand with soap before eating and after using the toilet [AOR (95% CI) = 2.25(1.079–4.675)] were positively associated with poor nutritional status of adolescent girls in the Wolaita and Hadiya zones, Southern Ethiopia. Conclusion Thinness and stunting were found to be high in the study area. Age, family size, monthly household income, regularly skipping meals, fathers’ educational status, visits by health extension workers, and nutrition services decision-making are the main predictors of thinness. Hand washing practice, visits by health extension workers, and nutrition services decision-making are the main predictors of stunting among adolescent girls. Multisectoral community-based, adolescent health and nutrition programs should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3119660075,"Human behavior as they engaged in financial activities is intimately connected to the observed market dynamics. Despite many existing theories and studies on the fundamental motivations of the behavior of humans in financial systems, there is still limited empirical deduction of the behavioral compositions of the financial agents from a detailed market analysis. Blockchain technology has provided an avenue for the latter investigation with its voluminous data and its transparency of financial transactions. It has enabled us to perform empirical inference on the behavioral patterns of users in the market, which we explore in the bitcoin and ethereum cryptocurrency markets. In our study, we first determine various properties of the bitcoin and ethereum users by a temporal complex network analysis. After which, we develop methodology by combining k -means clustering and Support Vector Machines to derive behavioral types of users in the two cryptocurrency markets. Interestingly, we found four distinct strategies that are common in both markets: optimists, pessimists, positive traders and negative traders. The composition of user behavior is remarkably different between the bitcoin and ethereum market during periods of local price fluctuations and large systemic events. We observe that bitcoin (ethereum) users tend to take a short-term (long-term) view of the market during the local events. For the large systemic events, ethereum (bitcoin) users are found to consistently display a greater sense of pessimism (optimism) towards the future of the market."
https://openalex.org/W3119875264,"The tumor suppressor p53 is known as a critical mediator of many cellular processes, including cellular senescence, but its role in mitochondrial dynamics is not fully understood. We have previously shown that p53 regulates mitochondrial dynamics via the PKA-Drp1 pathway to induce cellular senescence. In this study, to further understand the role of p53-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, the effect of p53 expression on mitochondrial morphology was examined in various cancer cell lines and normal human cells. We found that p53 induced remarkable mitochondrial elongation and cellular senescence in various cancer cells regardless of their p53 status. p53 also induced mitochondrial elongation in various human primary normal cells, suggesting that p53-mediated mitochondrial elongation is a general phenomenon. Moreover, we found that p53 plays an essential role in mitochondrial elongation in H-Ras-induced cellular senescence and in the replicative senescence of normal human cells. Treatment with the MDM-2 antagonist Nutlin-3a also induced mitochondrial elongation through the PKA-Drp1 pathway in IMR90 normal human cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of PKA activity in late-passage normal cells significantly reduced both mitochondrial elongation and cellular senescence, suggesting that the p53-PKA pathway is essential for maintaining the senescence phenotype in normal cells. Together, these results further confirm the direct regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by p53 and the important role of p53-mediated mitochondrial elongation in cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W3120037440,"Smoking, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) are important global health problems. We aimed to investigate the association between smoking, alteration in MetS status, and the consequent risk of MACE. We performed a nationwide observational cohort study based on the claims database of Korea. We included people with ≥ 3 national health screenings from 2009 to 2013. Total 6,099,717 people, including 3,576,236 nonsmokers, 862,210 ex-smokers, 949,586 light-to-moderate smokers, and 711,685 heavy smokers, at the first health screening, were investigated. First, we performed a logistic regression analysis using smoking status at the first screening as the exposure variable and MetS development or recovery as the outcome variable. Second, we performed a Poisson regression using smoking status at the third screening as the exposure variable and the outcome was risk of incident MACEs. Among those previously free from MetS (N = 4,889,493), 347,678 people developed MetS, and among those who had previous MetS (N = 1,210,224), 347,627 people recovered from MetS. Smoking was related to a higher risk of MetS development [for heavy smokers: adjusted OR 1.71 (1.69 to 1.73)] and a lower probability of MetS recovery [for heavy smokers: adjusted OR 0.68 (0.67 to 0.69)]. Elevated triglycerides was the MetS component with the most prominent association with smoking. The risk for incident MACEs (78,640 events during a median follow-up of 4.28 years) was the highest for heavy smokers, followed in order by light-to-moderate, ex-smokers and nonsmokers, for every MetS status. Therefore, smoking may promote MetS or even hinder recovery from MetS. Smoking cessation should be emphasized to reduce MACE risk even for those without MetS."
https://openalex.org/W3120617426,"Introduction There is a paucity of prospective data on the performance of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this exploratory analysis was to evaluate the feasibility and performance of FIT in Nigeria. Methods This was a prospective, single-arm study. A convenience sample of asymptomatic, average-risk individuals between 40–75 years of age were enrolled at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital. Study participants returned in 48 hours with a specimen for ova and parasite (O&amp;P) and qualitative FIT (50ug/g) testing. Participants with a positive FIT had follow-up colonoscopy and those with intestinal parasites were provided treatment. Results Between May-June 2019, 379 individuals enrolled with a median age of 51 years (IQR 46–58). In total, 87.6% (n = 332) returned for FIT testing. FIT positivity was 20.5% (95% CI = 16.3%-25.2%). Sixty-one (89.7%) of participants with a positive FIT had a follow-up colonoscopy (n = 61), of whom 9.8% (95%CI:3.7–20.2%) had an adenoma and 4.9% (95%CI:1.0–13.7%) had advanced adenomas. Presence of intestinal parasites was inversely related to FIT positivity (6.5% with vs. 21.1% without parasites, p = 0.05). Eighty-two percent of participants found the FIT easy to use and 100% would recommend the test to eligible family or friends if available. Conclusions Asymptomatic, FIT-based CRC screening was feasible and well tolerated in this exploratory analysis. However, the high FIT positivity and low positive predictive value for advanced neoplasia raises concerns about its practicality and cost effectiveness in a low-resource setting such as Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3120619736,"With the recent research development, the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in renal clear cell carcinoma (CCRCC) has become widely known. The purpose of this study is to screen out the potential biomarkers of renal clear cell carcinoma (CCRCC) by microarray analysis. The miRNA chip (GSE16441) and mRNA chip (GSE66270) related to CCRCC were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After data filtering and pretreating, R platform and a series of analysis tools (funrich3.1.3, string, Cytoscape_ 3.2.1, David, etc.) were used to analyze chip data and identify the specific and highly sensitive biomarkers. Finally, by constructing the miRNA -mRNA interaction network, it was determined that five miRNAs ( hsa-mir-199a-5p , hsa-mir-199b-5p , hsa-mir-532-3p and hsa-mir-429 ) and two key genes ( ETS1 and hapln1 ) are significantly related to the overall survival rate of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3119118785,"Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a frequent condition. In the absence of treatment, OSA is associated with a higher risk of traffic accidents and a large variety of diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe the characteristics of patients treated for OSA in France and assess the time trends in treatment. Methods The French National Health Data System is an individual database with data on all healthcare reimbursements for the entire French population. Based on this database, we included all patients aged 20 years or over who were treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mandibular advancement splint (MAS) between 2009 and 2018. Negative binomial models, adjusted for age, were used to assess time trends in treatment prevalence and incidence rates. Results In 2017, 2.3% of French adults aged ≥20 years were treated with CPAP (men: 3.3%; women: 1.3%). The highest prevalence was observed in people aged 70–74 years (5.0%). From 2009 to 2018, the annual prevalence of CPAP increased 3-fold and the annual incidence 1.9-fold. During the same period, the rate of patients reimbursed for MAS (first prescription or renewal) was multiplied by 7.6. The proportion of patients treated with CPAP in 2017 who were no longer treated in the subsequent year was 6.9%. Discussion The sharp increase in the incidence of OSA treatment probably reflects a better recognition of the disease in France. However, the prevalence of OSA treatment remains lower than expected based on the international literature. Further studies are needed to identify the obstacles to an optimal management of individuals with OSA in France."

Dexmedetomidine via the intra-articular (i.a.) route might be an option for the treatment of osteoarthritis-associated pain. The present study assessed the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of dexmedetomidine administered via the i.a. route in different doses in an experimental model of rat knee osteoarthritis induced with monosodium iodoacetate. Rats were allocated to four groups with 24 animals in each group. The OA (osteoarthritis), DEX-1 (dexmedetomidine in dose of 1μg/kg) and DEX-3 (dexmedetomidine in dose of 3μg/kg) groups were subjected to induction of osteoarthritis through injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) via the i.a. route on the right knee; the control group was not subjected to osteoarthritis induction. Clinical assessment was performed on day 0 (before osteoarthritis induction) and then on days 5, 10, 14, 21 and 28 after induction. Treatment was performed on day 7 via the i.a. route, consisting of dexmedetomidine in doses of 1 and 3 μg/kg, while group OA received 0.9% normal saline. The animals were euthanized on days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Samples of the synovial membrane were collected for histopathological analysis, and the popliteal lymph nodes were collected for measurement of cytokines (interleukin [IL] IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]). Dexmedetomidine (1 and 3 μg/kg) significantly reduced the animals’ weight distribution deficit during the chronic-degenerative stage of osteoarthritis and improved the pain threshold throughout the entire experiment. Histological analysis showed that dexmedetomidine did not cause any additional damage to the synovial membrane. The TNF-α levels decreased significantly in the DEX-3 group on day 28 compared with the OA group. Dexmedetomidine reduced pain, as evidenced by clinical parameters of osteoarthritis in rats, but did not have an anti-inflammatory effect on histological evaluation."

Laboratory experiments were conducted with a check treatment CK (no γ-PGA added) and two different forms of γ-PGA added to sandy loam soil (T and TM stand for γ-PGA and γ-PGA SAP) at four different soil mass ratios (0.05% (1), 0.10% (2), 0.15% (3) and 0.20% (4)) to determine their effects on sandy loam soil hydro-physical properties. Both of them could reduce the cumulative infiltration of soil water. The total available water (TAW) which the soil water content (SWC) from field water capacity (FC) to permanent wilting point (PWP) after γ-PGA added into sandy loam soil had no significant different compared with CK, and the TAW was highest at the treatment of γ-PGA with 0.10% addition amount into sandy loam soil. However, the TAW of sandy loam soil increased dramatically with the γ-PGA SAP addition amount increasing. TM3 had the highest soil water absorption among the treatments with γ-PGA SAP. The T1 to T4 treatments with γ-PGA addition slightly prolonged retention time (RT) when SWC varied from FC to PWP compared with CK. For γ-PGA SAP addition treatments, the time for SWC varied from FC to PWP was 1.48 times (TM1), 1.88 times (TM2), 2.01 times (TM3) and 2.87 times (TM4) longer than that of CK, respectively. The results of this study will provide further information for the use of these materials in agricultural application."

https://openalex.org/W3119532406,"Background Previous studies indicate that migrant integration is associated with migrants’ characteristics as well as restrictions and opportunities in receiving cities. However, the effect of receiving cities and the relationship between migrants and receiving cities have not been fully explored due to the lack of large samples from cities. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of receiving cities alone and their regulating role in the interaction with individual characteristics. Methods Cross-city data on 154,044 Chinese domestic migrants above 15 years old in 289 cities from the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey are used. Migrant integration is assessed by a four-dimensional model proposed by Esser, which is slightly adjusted according to the characteristics of Chinese migrants. A hierarchical linear model is used to measure the proportion of effects of city factors in migrant integration as well as the effects when city factors are considered alone and in interaction with individual factors. Results The individual-level and city-level factors are responsible for 69.81% and 30.19% of the effect on migrant integration, respectively. City political factors do not affect migrant integration directly, and cities with larger sizes and higher wages can directly and significantly improve integration, while higher housing prices will directly inhibit integration. From the cross-level interaction of city and individual, different social, economic and political factors at the city level have an indirect impact on migrant integration by inhibiting or strengthening the effect of individual-level factors on migrant integration. Conclusion This study is one of the first to show the effect of cities and the relationship between receiving cities and migrants on migrant integration by keeping the national context constant. It is necessary to weaken the social and economic privileges associated with a city’s administrative level and reduce the negative impact of cities’ social and economic conditions by implementing city agglomeration, developing advantageous industries and optimizing the industrial structure. It is also essential to improve migrants’ socioeconomic capital through social support, occupation training and contiguous education."
https://openalex.org/W3120090593,"Six putative α-galactosidase genes (α-Gals), three acid forms ( CsGAL 1, CsGAL 2, CsGAL 3) and three alkaline forms ( CsAGA 1, CsAGA 2, CsAGAL 3), were found in the cucumber genome. It is interesting to know the expression pattern and possible function of these α-Gals in the cucumber plant since it is a stachyose-translocating species. In this study, full-length cDNAs of six α-Gals were cloned and heterologously expressed. The result showed that all recombinant proteins revealed acid or alkaline α-Gal activities with different substrate specificities and pH or temperature responding curves, indicating their distinct roles in cucumber plants. Phylogenetic analysis of collected α-Gal amino acid sequences from different plants indicated that the ancestor of both acid and alkaline α-Gals existed before monocots and dicots separated. Generally, six α-Gal genes are universally expressed in different cucumber organs. CsGAL2 highly expressed in fasting-growing leaves, fruits and germinating seeds; CsGAL3 mainly distributes in vacuoles and significantly expressed in cucumber fruits, senescent leaves and seeds during late stage germination; The expression of CsAGA1 increased from leaf 1 to leaf 3 (sink leaves) and then declined from leaf 4 to leaf 7 (source leaves), and this isoform also highly expressed in male flowers and germinating seeds at early stage; CsAGA2 significantly expressed in cucumber leaves and female flowers; CsAGA3 is localized in plastids and also actively expressed in senescent leaves and germinating seeds; The role of CsGAL1 in cucumber plants is now unclear since its expression was relatively low in all organs. According to their expression patterns, subcellular localizations and previously reported functions of these isoforms in other plants, combining the data of soluble sugars contents in different tissues, the possible functions of these α-Gals were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3120266763,"Background In Japan, there is a large geographical maldistribution of obstetricians/gynecologists, with a high proportion of females. This study seeks to clarify how the increase in the proportion of female physicians affects the geographical maldistribution of obstetrics/gynecologists. Methods Governmental data of the Survey of Physicians, Dentists and Pharmacists between 1996 and 2016 were used. The Gini coefficient was used to measure the geographical maldistribution. We divided obstetricians/gynecologists into four groups based on age and gender: males under 40 years, females under 40 years, males aged 40 years and above, and females aged 40 years and above, and the time trend of the maldistribution and contribution of each group was evaluated. Results The maldistribution of obstetricians/gynecologists was found to be worse during the study period, with the Gini coefficient exceeding 0.400 in 2016. The contribution ratios of female physicians to the deterioration of geographical maldistribution have been increasing for those under 40 years and those aged 40 years and above. However, there was a continuous decrease in the Gini coefficient of the two groups. Conclusions The increase in the contribution ratio of the female physician groups to the Gini coefficient in obstetrics/gynecology may be due to the increased weight of these groups. The Gini coefficients of the female groups were also found to be on a decline. Although this may be because the working environment for female physicians improved or more female physicians established their practice in previously underserved areas, such a notion needs to be investigated in a follow-up study."
https://openalex.org/W3119670325,"Several factors such as genotype, environment, and post-harvest processing can affect the responses of important traits in the coffee production chain. Determining the influence of these factors is of great relevance, as they can be indicators of the characteristics of the coffee produced. The most efficient models choice to be applied should take into account the variety of information and the particularities of each biological material. This study was developed to evaluate statistical and machine learning models that would better discriminate environments through multi-traits of coffee genotypes and identify the main agronomic and beverage quality traits responsible for the variation of the environments. For that, 31 morpho-agronomic and post-harvest traits were evaluated, from field experiments installed in three municipalities in the Matas de Minas region, in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Two types of post-harvest processing were evaluated: natural and pulped. The apparent error rate was estimated for each method. The Multilayer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function networks were able to discriminate the coffee samples in multi-environment more efficiently than the other methods, identifying differences in multi-traits responses according to the production sites and type of post-harvest processing. The local factors did not present specific traits that favored the severity of diseases and differentiated vegetative vigor. Sensory traits acidity and fragrance/aroma score also made little contribution to the discrimination process, indicating that acidity and fragrance/aroma are characteristic of coffee produced and all coffee samples evaluated are of the special type in the Mata of Minas region. The main traits responsible for the differentiation of production sites are plant height, fruit size, and bean production. The sensory trait ""Body"" is the main one to discriminate the form of post-harvest processing."
https://openalex.org/W3120610392,"Motivation and background The patient’s immune system plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis, prognosis and susceptibility to treatment. Recent work introduced an immune related breast cancer. This subtyping is based on the expression profiles of the tumor samples. Specifically, one study showed that analyzing 658 genes can lead to a signature for subtyping tumors. Furthermore, this classification is independent of other known molecular and clinical breast cancer subtyping. Finally, that study shows that the suggested subtyping has significant prognostic implications. Results In this work we develop an efficient signature associated with survival in breast cancer. We begin by developing a more efficient signature for the above-mentioned breast cancer immune-based subtyping. This signature represents better performance with a set of 579 genes that obtains an improved Area Under Curve (AUC). We then determine a set of 193 genes and an associated classification rule that yield subtypes with a much stronger statistically significant (log rank p-value &lt; 2 × 10 −4 in a test cohort) difference in survival. To obtain these improved results we develop a feature selection process that matches the high-dimensionality character of the data and the dual performance objectives, driven by survival and anchored by the literature subtyping."
https://openalex.org/W3121092232,"Exposure to volatile anesthetics during the neonatal period results in acute neuron death. Prior work suggests that apoptosis is the dominant mechanism mediating neuron death. We show that Bax deficiency blocks neuronal death following exposure to isoflurane during the neonatal period. Blocking Bax-mediated neuron death attenuated the neuroinflammatory response of microglia following isoflurane exposure. We find that GABAergic interneurons are disproportionately overrepresented among dying neurons. Despite the increase in neuronal apoptosis induced by isoflurane exposure during the neonatal period, seizure susceptibility, spatial memory retention, and contextual fear memory were unaffected later in life. However, Bax deficiency alone led to mild deficiencies in spatial memory and contextual fear memory, suggesting that normal developmental apoptotic death is important for cognitive function. Collectively, these findings show that while GABAergic neurons in the neonatal brain undergo elevated Bax-dependent apoptotic cell death following exposure to isoflurane, this does not appear to have long-lasting consequences on overall neurological function later in life."
https://openalex.org/W3120091175,"The rapid expansion of the open-source community has shortened the software development cycle, but the spread of vulnerabilities has been accelerated, especially in the field of the Internet of Things. In recent years, the frequency of attacks against connected devices is increasing exponentially; thus, the vulnerabilities are more serious in nature. The state-of-the-art firmware security inspection technologies, such as methods based on machine learning and graph theory, find similar applications depending on the known vulnerabilities but cannot do anything without detailed information about the vulnerabilities. Moreover, model training, which is necessary for the machine learning technologies, requires a significant amount of time and data, resulting in low efficiency and poor extensibility. Aiming at the above shortcomings, a high-efficiency similarity analysis approach for firmware code is proposed in this study. First, the function control flow features and data flow features are extracted from the functions of the firmware and of the vulnerabilities, and the features are used to calculate the SimHash of the functions. The mass storage and fast query capabilities of the SimHash are implemented by the pigeonhole principle. Second, the similarity function pairs are analyzed in detail within and among the basic blocks. Within the basic blocks, the symbolic execution is used to generate the basic block semantic information, and the constraint solver is used to determine the semantic equivalence. Among the basic blocks, the local control flow graphs are analyzed to obtain their similarity. Then, we implemented a prototype and present the evaluation. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can implement large-scale firmware function similarity analysis. It can also get the location of the real-world firmware patch without vulnerability function information. Finally, we compare our method with existing methods. The comparison results demonstrate that our method is more efficient and accurate than the Gemini and StagedMethod. More than 90% of the firmware functions can be indexed within 0.1 s, while the search time of 100,000 firmware functions is less than 2 s."

This study aimed at finding the impact a Community Based Continuous Training (CBCT) project in improving couples’ knowledge on birth preparedness and complication readiness in rural Tanzania. Method The quasi-experimental study design with control was adopted to determine the impact of CBCT in improving knowledge on birth preparedness and complication readiness. The study was conducted from June 2017 until March 2018. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to obtain 561couples. Pre-test and post-training intervention information were collected using semi-structured questionnaires. The impact of CBCT was determined using both independent t-test and paired t-test. Linear regression analysis was used to establish the association between the project and the change in knowledge mean scores. The effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d. Results At post-test assessment, knowledge mean scores were significantly higher in the intervention group among both pregnant women (m = 14.47±5.49) and their male partners (m = 14.1±5.76) as compared to control group among both pregnant women (m = 9.09±6.44) and their male partners (m = 9.98±6.65) with large effect size of 0.9 among pregnant women and medium effect size of 0.66 among male respondents. When the mean scores were compared within groups among both pregnant women and male partners in the intervention group, there were a significant increase in knowledge mean scores at post-test assessment as compared to pre-test assessment with large effect size of Cohen’s d = 1.4 among pregnant women and 1.5 among male partners. After adjusting for the confounders, the predictors of change in knowledge among pregnant women were the CBCT project (β = 0.346, p&lt;0.000) and ethnic group [Mambwe (β = -0.524, p = 0.001)] and the predictors of change in knowledge among male partners were the CBCT project (β = 1.058, p&lt;0.001) and walking distance [more than five kilometers (β = -0.55, p&lt; 0.05)]. Conclusion This interventional study which focused on knowledge empowerment and behavior change among expecting couples was both feasible and effective on improving knowledge about birth preparedness and complication readiness in rural settings of Tanzania."

As people age, they confront personal and cultural challenges, the effects of which on mental health are not fully understood. The aim of this research was to learn from women of the Baby Boomer generation (born 1946–1964) what contributes to and hinders their mental health and wellbeing. Eighteen women participated in qualitative interviews (in English); data were analysed thematically. Participants were located across Australia in rural and urban areas; not all were born in Australia. They were diverse in education, employment status, and experiences of life and ageing. The women nominated as the main contributors to poor mental health in older women Illness and disability , Financial insecurity , Maltreatment , and Loss and grief . Contributors to good mental health were identified as Social interdependence , Feeling valued , Physical activity , Good nutrition , and Having faith or belief . Women’s accounts supplied other influences on mental health, both associated with the person ( Personality and Intimate relationships and sex ) and with society ( Constructs of ageing , Gender , and Culture ). Women also specified what they needed from others in order to improve their mental health as they aged: Public education about ageing , Purposeful roles for older women in society , Adequate services and resources , and Sensitive health care . In sum, older women wanted to be treated with respect and for their lives to have meaning. It is evident from these results that circumstances throughout life can have profound influences on women’s mental health in older age. Anti-discriminatory policies, informed and inclusive health care, and social structures that support and enhance the lives of girls and women at all ages will therefore benefit older women and increase the potential for their continuing contribution to society. These conclusions have implications for policy and practice in well-resourced countries."
