https://openalex.org/W1816400090,"We propose a method to produce entangled states of several particles starting from a Bose-Einstein condensate. In the proposal, a single fast $\pi/2$ pulse is applied to the atoms and due to the collisional interaction, the subsequent free time evolution creates an entangled state involving all atoms in the condensate. The created entangled state is a spin-squeezed state which could be used to improve the sensitivity of atomic clocks."

We used pathway-specific inhibitors to compare the roles of actin dynamics, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in signaling either to SRF itself or to four cellular SRF target genes. Serum, lysophosphatidic acid, platelet-derived growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) each activated transcription of a stably integrated SRF reporter gene dependent on functional RhoA GTPase. Inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK kinase (MEK) signalling reduced activation of the SRF reporter by all stimuli by about 50%, except for PMA, which was effectively blocked. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase slightly reduced reporter activation by serum and lysophosphatidic acid but substantially inhibited activation by platelet-derived growth factor and PMA. Reporter induction by all stimuli was absolutely dependent on actin dynamics. Regulation of the SRF (srf) and vinculin (vcl) genes was similar to that of the SRF reporter gene; activation by all stimuli was Rho-dependent and required actin dynamics but was largely independent of MEK activity. In contrast, activation of fos and egr1 occurred independently of RhoA and actin polymerization but was almost completely dependent on MEK activation. These results show that at least two classes of SRF target genes can be distinguished on the basis of their relative sensitivity to RhoA-actin and MEK-ERK signaling pathways. Activation of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) is dependent on Rho-controlled changes in actin dynamics.

Weinhold B. Oelgeschlager M. Ruther U. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6289-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The activity of SRF is regulated both by cellular signal transduction pathways and by its interaction with other transcription factors. At the immediate-early fos and egr1 promoters, for example, SRF forms a ternary complex with members of the ternary complex factor (TCF) family of mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated Ets domain proteins (Ref. 2Shaw P.E. Schroter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar; for review see Ref. 3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether all SRF-controlled immediate-early gene promoters bind TCF, however, because the TCF recognition site is simple and can be located at variable distances from that of SRF (4Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). SRF also exhibits functional cooperation with a number of other, constitutively active, transcription factors including Sp1, ATF6, GATA4, Nkx2.5, and the myogenic regulatory factors (5Zhu C.

The signaling pathways impinging on SRF and its TCF partners at immediate-early promoters have been extensively studied. Transcriptional activation by the TCF proteins is potentiated by signal-induced phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal activation domain (3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 11Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Promoter mutant and TCF expression studies suggest that TCF binding is required to link the fos and egr1promoters to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway (12Graham R. Gilman M. Science. 1991; 251: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Kortenjann M.

Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). In transfection assays, both the serum-induced activity of SRF and fos reporter genes and the constitutive activity of certain muscle-specific promoters are strongly dependent on functional Rho (21Hill C.S.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) has also been implicated in signaling to SRF via both Rho-dependent and -independent mechanisms, although this is not detectable in all cell types (24Wang Y. Falasca M. Schlessinger J. Malstrom S. Tsichlis P. Settleman J. Hu W. Lim B. Prywes R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 513-522PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wei L. Zhou W. Wang L. Schwartz R.J. Am. J.

Recent studies have shown that Rho GTPases activate SRF via their ability to induce depletion of the G-actin pool (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R.

Treisman, manuscript in preparation. Although this pathway is required for serum-induced transcription of the cellular SRF, vinculin, and cytoskeletal actin genes, it contributes little to activation of fos or egr1 (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). This suggests that the efficiency of Rho-actin signaling to SRF is dependent on promoter context and that other signal pathways must control the activity of SRF target genes not responsive to Rho-actin signaling. Here we use pathway-specific inhibitors to investigate the roles of Rho-actin signaling, MEK-ERK, and PI-3K in activation of an SRF reporter gene by different stimuli. We compare the results to those obtained with a panel of endogenous SRF target genes. Our results define two classes of SRF target gene controlled by Rho-mediated actin dynamics and MEK-ERK signaling, respectively. SRE.FosHA cells are NIH3T3 cell-derivative cells carrying an integrated 3D.AFos HA reporter (21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells in a 6-well plate were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations; 6 μl of LipofectAMINE, 0.05 μg of LexOP2tkLuc, 0.02 μg ofr NLexElkC, 0.1 μg of MLVLacZ, and 0.65 μg of MLV128β (11Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) were used per well. The cells were lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined by standard methods. DNA manipulations and plasmid DNA preparation were by standard methods. RNase protection probes were synthesized from appropriate derivatives of pCR2.1TOPO (T7; pre-vcl), pGEM-T (SP6; pre-srf), pSP65 (SP6; egr1), and pSP64 (SP6, fos). LexOP2tkLUC comprises the LexA operator and HSVtk promoter sequences from LexOP2tkCAT (3Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 11Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) inserted into theXhoI site of pGL3Basic (Promega). RNA preparation and RNase protection assays were as described (13Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). GAPDH and 3D.AFos probes were as described (21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Other probes were: fos, a 199-nucleotide probe spanning 5′-flanking region and part of exon 1, nucleotides 540–738 (GenBank accession number V00727), generating a 185-nucleotide protected fragment; egr1, a 348-nucleotide probe spanning 5′-flanking region and part of exon1, nucleotides 1348–1661 (GenBank accession number M22326), generating a 267-nucleotide protected fragment; pre-srf, a 343-nucleotide probe spanning the exon 5-intron 5 boundary, nucleotides 8181–8450 (GenBank accession number AB03837), generating a 276-nucleotide protected fragment (exon 5-intron 5 precursor) and a 192-nucleotide protected fragment (exon 5 mRNA); pre-vcl, a 443-nucleotide fragment spanning the exon 3-intron 3 boundary, nucleotides 413–769 (GenBank accession number L13299) generating a 357-nucleotide protected fragment (exon 3-intron 3 precursor) and a 108-nucleotide protected fragment (exon 3 mRNA). For quantitation of RNase protection assays, images were obtained using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protected fragments were quantified after background subtraction with ImageQuant software and normalized to the GAPDH signal. For Western blot analysis 4 × 105 cells were plated per 60-mm dish, serum-starved for 24 h, pretreated with inhibitors as required, and then stimulated with different agents. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed into ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). Following clarification, equal amounts of lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and probed with the following antibodies: phospho-ERK, anti-phospho ERK1(T202,Y204) monoclonal E10 (New England Biolabs, 9106S); pan-ERK (Transduction Laboratories, E17120); Akt anti-Ser(P)473 (New England Biolabs, 9271S); and Akt (New England Biolabs, 9272S). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse goat antibodies were from DAKO; ECL detection reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Western blots were stripped in 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, 0.1% SDS for 30 min and reprobed with the appropriate antibodies. Stimuli were used at the following concentrations: fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 15%, LPA (Sigma), 10 μm; PDGF-BB (Calbiochem), 25 ng/ml; PMA (Sigma), 50 ng/ml; cytochalasin D (Calbiochem), 2 μm; and jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes), 0.5 μm. The inhibitors were used as follows: U0126 (Promega), 10 μm; LY294002 (Calbiochem), 20 μm; wortmannin (Sigma), 200 nm; and latrunculin B (Calbiochem), 0.5 μm. UO126, LY294002, and wortmannin pretreatments were for 30 min, and latrunculin B treatments were for 60 min. Cycloheximide and anisomycin (both Sigma) were used at 10 μg/ml, and C2IN-C3/C2II chimeric toxin (32Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and toxin B were kindly provided by H. Barth and K. Aktories (Freiburg University). C2IN-C3 and C2II proteins were added directly to the tissue culture medium at 0.4 μg/ml final concentration 5 h prior to stimulation; toxin B was added to 5 ng/ml 60 min before stimulation. At these times more than 90% of the cells were rounded up. Although responsive to serum, Fos reporter genes controlled by the minimal fos SRE are unresponsive to receptor-tyrosine kinase activation and PMA stimulation upon transient transfection into NIH3T3 cells (21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 33Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that SRF reporter genes maintained in stable transfectants might respond to a greater range of stimuli, we examined the NIH3T3 cell line SRE.FosHA (31Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These cells contain the SRF reporter gene 3D.AFos, which comprises the human c-fos transcription unit controlled by a chimeric promoter comprising a cytoskeletal actin TATA region and three SRF binding sites. Reporter activity was evaluated by RNase protection at various times following stimulation of serum-deprived cells with serum, LPA, PDGF, or PMA. The reporter gene showed a robust response to stimulation with each agent (Fig.1 A). Activation by PMA, but not the other stimuli, required protein kinase C activation because it was blocked by a prolonged PMA pretreatment and by the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X (data not shown). Maximal reporter RNA accumulation following serum, LPA, and PMA stimulation occurred ∼60 min after stimulation, followed by a slow decline; in contrast, PDGF-induced reporter RNA was maximal at 30 min and declined rapidly thereafter (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained with two further NIH3T3 cell clones carrying the 3D.AFos reporter (data not shown). Activation of a transfected SRF reporter gene by serum and LPA requires functional RhoA (21Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar); therefore we next investigated the involvement of RhoA in activation of the integrated SRF reporter gene. We used two different toxins to inactivate Rho family GTPases: the chimeric toxin C2-C3, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates RhoA (32Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andClostridium difficile toxin B, which glucosylates and inactivates the Rac1, Cdc42, and Rho GTPases (34Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 35Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with toxin for a period sufficient to induce rounding up of the entire cell population (data not shown) and then stimulated as before. Activation of the integrated SRF reporter gene by serum, LPA, PDGF, and PMA was completely inhibited in cells pretreated either with C2-C3 toxin (Fig. 1 B) or toxin B (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, activation of the reporter by cytochalasin D, which alters actin dynamics directly by interacting with actin, was not affected (data not shown). All the stimuli are strong activators of the ERK pathway; therefore we next investigated the contribution of this pathway to activation of the SRF reporter gene. The cells were pretreated for 30 min with the specific MEK inhibitor U0126 (36Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2747) Google Scholar) before stimulation and analysis of reporter activity as before. Serum- and LPA-induced transcription was reduced by almost 50%, whereas activation by PDGF was reduced by 60%; only induction by PMA was reduced to background levels (Fig.2 A). To examine the efficacy of the inhibitor, we measured ERK activation by immunoblotting using an antiserum specific for the activated form of ERK1/2. U0126 treatment completely blocked ERK activation by all the stimuli except serum, where a low level of activation persisted at late times; the inhibitor did not affect PI-3K activity (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained using another MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (18Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). The ability of serum, LPA, and PDGF to activate the SRF reporter gene is thus substantially independent of ERK signaling (see “Discussion”). We next investigated whether reporter activity was dependent on PI-3K, which has previously been implicated in SRF activation in transfected HeLa cells (24Wang Y. Falasca M. Schlessinger J. Malstrom S. Tsichlis P. Settleman J. Hu W. Lim B. Prywes R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 513-522PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002, then stimulated, and analyzed as before. The inhibitor had variable effects according to the stimulus. Serum induction was unaffected, and LPA induction was reduced by some 20%; in contrast, PDGF-induced reporter activity was reduced by 70%, and PMA induction was substantially blocked (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained using another PI-3K inhibitor, wortmannin (data not shown). To evaluate the activation of PI-3K in response to the various stimuli, we examined phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of the PI-3K pathway, using an antiserum specific for Akt Ser(P)473. Serum and PDGF strongly induced Akt phosphorylation, which was blocked by LY294002; in contrast LPA very weakly induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas induction by PMA was not detectable (Fig. 2 D,upper panels). The efficiency of Akt activation did not correlate with reporter activity (compare Fig. 1 A and2 D, upper panels). Moreover, LY294002 treatment did not affect ERK activation by any of the stimuli (Fig.2 D, lower panels). The apparent failure of PMA stimulation to activate Akt phosphorylation suggests that, at least in this case, inhibition of SRF activation by LY294002 reflects a requirement for basal PI-3K activity. We previously showed that serum and LPA induction of an SRF reporter gene is absolutely dependent on signal-induced changes in actin polymerization (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Because activation of this reporter by PDGF and PMA exhibits a different requirement for MEK and PI-3K signaling compared with serum and LPA, we next investigated whether activation by these stimuli is also dependent on signal-induced actin polymerization. Serum-starved reporter cells were pretreated for 60 min with 0.5 μm latrunculin B, which inhibits actin polymerization by sequestering G-actin monomer (37Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), prior to stimulation and analysis of reporter RNA activity. Latrunculin B treatment completely blocked transcriptional induction by all stimuli including PDGF and PMA (Fig.3 A; U0126 ± latrunculin B allows comparison with Fig. 6). To confirm that latrunculin treatment did not affect the activation of the ERK and PI-3K pathways, we performed immunoblotting experiments with the activated ERK and Akt Ser(P)473 antibodies. Latrunculin B treatment did not inhibit activation of either ERK or PI-3K by any stimuli (Fig.3 B).Figure 6SRF target genes differ in their requirement for cellular signaling pathways. A, differential dependence on actin polymerization and MEK activity. Serum-deprived cells were stimulated for the indicated times after 30-min pretreatments with latrunculin B (LB), U0126 (U), or both (U LB). RNA was prepared and analyzed using probes specific for srf exon 5-intron 5 (top panel),vcl exon 3-intron 3 (middle panel), oregr1 plus fos (bottom panel) each together with GAPDH reference probe. The protected fragments fromsrf precursor (pre-srf), srf mRNA (srf), vcl precursor (pre-vinc),vcl mRNA (vinc), egr1 andfos, and GAPDH are indicated.

Un., untreated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All the stimuli tested potentiate transcriptional activation by members of the ternary complex factor family of Ets domain proteins. The SRF reporter gene does not contain consensus TCF binding sites, but we nevertheless considered the possibility that its enhanced ability to respond to stimuli when integrated into cellular DNA might reflect TCF binding. To test this idea, we evaluated the effects of the inhibitors on TCF activation using a TCF Elk-1 reporter system. The cells were transfected with a LexA operator-controlled reporter plasmid and an expression vector encoding a LexA/Elk-1 fusion protein (11Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Following treatment with the various inhibitors, cells were stimulated, and reporter gene activity was measured. Activation of the Elk-1 reporter by all stimuli was reduced to background level by U0126 pretreatment but was not affected by pretreatment with latrunculin B (Fig. 4). Although Elk-1 reporter activation by PDGF and LPA was reduced some 50% by LY294002 pretreatment, LY294002 had no substantial effect on ERK activation by these stimuli (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these results provide strong support for the notion that TCF is not involved in activation of the integrated SRF reporter gene. The availability of inhibitors specific for the signal transduction pathways that regulate SRF and TCF activation provides a simple way to evaluate the potential contributions of these transcription factors to immediate-early gene transcription. We previously demonstrated that serum-induced transcription of various SRF target genes exhibits a differential sensitivity to actin dynamics; induction of the genes encoding vinculin (vcl), cytoskeletal actin (actb), and SRF (srf) was sensitive to latrunculin B, like the SRF reporter gene, whereas induction of fos transcription was not (28Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Having established the contributions of different signaling pathways to activation of the SRF reporter gene, we set out to determine their contribution to SRF target gene activation. The kinetics of transcriptional activation of fos and egr1 are well established (38Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 39Lau L.F.

Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The somatic pili, protein filaments that extend as bundles from one or both of the cell poles, are considered to be a major virulence factor, promoting adherence and invasiveness (2Hahn H. Gene. 1997; 192: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 3Paranchych W. Frost L.S. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1988; 29: 53-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These fibers are composed of a monomeric subunit, pilin, which has a strain-dependent molecular weight of ∼16,000. The mature form of this protein is produced by the removal of a six-residue leader sequence, a process that is accompanied by methylation of the nascent amino-terminal phenylalanine (4Strom M.S. Lory S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 565-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Although this had initially been considered the only post-translational modification of this protein, evidence has been generated indicating that P. aeruginosastrain 1244 pilin is also glycosylated (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This process is dependent on pilO, a gene present as part of an operon that also contains the pilin structural gene, pilA. Although archeal and eubacterial S-layers commonly contain covalently bound glycan (6Lechner J. Wieland F. Annu. Rev.

Cell wall-associated glycoproteins have been demonstrated in Streptococcus sanguis (9Erickson P.R. Herzberg M.C. J. Biol.

Immun. 1995; 63: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among Gram-negative bacteria, Campylobacter species have been shown to contain a general protein glycosylation system that modifies a number of surface proteins including flagellin (11Doig P. Kinsella N. Guerry P. Trust T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Logan S.M. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J.

Evidence has been presented that a glycan is associated with P. aeruginosa flagellin (14Brimer C.D. Montie T.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with P. aeruginosa (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the pili of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been shown to be glycosylated. X-ray diffraction studies indicate that theN. gonorrhoeae pilin glycan is a disaccharide (15Parge H.E. Forest K.T. Hickey M.J. Christensen D.E. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In addition to glycerol phosphate (16Stimson E. Virji M. Barker S. Panico M. Blench I. Saunders J. Payne G. Moxon E.R. Dell A.

Although the detection of glycosylated bacterial surface proteins is uncommon, the comprehensive determination of their carbohydrate structure has been even more rare. Results presented in this paper provide a complete structural analysis of the P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin glycan, showing that it is a serine-linked trisaccharide with the following structure: α-5NβOHC47NFmPse-(2→4)-β-Xyl-(1→3)-β-FucNAc-(1→3)-Ser. 5NβOHC47NFmPse is an infrequently occurring sugar found in certain P. aeruginosa O-antigens (18Knirel Y.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 273-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All three pilin glycan sugars are repeating unit components of O7 LPS,1 the serotype to whichP. aeruginosa 1244 belongs (18Knirel Y.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 273-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa strain 1244, a smooth human blood isolate of LPS serotype O7, was originally provided by A. T. McManus, U. S. Army Institute of Surgical Research, San Antonio, and strain 1244N3 was provided by S. Lory, University of Washington, Seattle. P. aeruginosa strain 653A was from C. C. Brinton, University of Pittsburgh. All strains were grown aerobically on LB plates or broth cultures at 37 °C. Broth cultures were grown on a rotatory shaker at 275 rpm. Additions to the growth media were as follows: carbenicillin, 200 µg/ml; tetracycline, 50 µg/ml; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 5.0 mm. Western blotting was performed as described previously (19Castric P.A. Sidberry H.F. Sadoff J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mAbs used were a gift from J. C. Sadoff, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D. C. mAb 1.2.48 was a hybridoma supernatant fluid, and mAbs 11.14 and 5.44 were ascites fluids. When used in Western blots or twitching inhibition tests, mAbs 11.14 and 5.44 were purified as follows. Ammonium sulfate (0.67 g) was added to 2.0 ml of ascites fluid followed by stirring for 30 min at 4 °C. This material was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at room temperature, and the supernatant fluid was discarded. The precipitate was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 10.0 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed three times against one liter of the same buffer at 4 °C. These preparations were applied to a 0.5 × 5.0-cm Mono-Q column equilibrated with this same buffer and eluted with a 0.0–0.4 m NaCl gradient, again in the same buffer, over a volume of 10.0 ml. Eluted protein was monitored by absorption at 280 nm. Fractions (0.25 ml) were taken at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 stain. The P. aeruginosa 1244 LPS standard was a gift from from Dr. A. Bhattacharjee, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Crude P. aeruginosa 653A LPS was prepared using the procedure of Hitchcock and Brown (20Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employed polystyrene plates coated with either 50 µl of purified native 1244 pili (20 µg/ml) or 50 µl of purified strain 1244 LPS (10 µg/ml). Plates to be coated with LPS as antigen were precoated with 50 µl of polylysine (1 mg/ml). All plates were blocked (2 h at room temperature) with 200 µl of 0.5% casein and 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody preparations were diluted 3 × 10−4 with blocker and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with purified pilin aminoglycan. This material (50 µl) was added to the coated plates and incubated overnight at room temperature with slow shaking. Secondary antibody (50 µl of alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (heavy and light chains), 1:1000 dilution, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was applied for 2 h at room temperature with slow shaking. Each step was followed by four washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were assayed by the addition of substrate (150 µl of 10% diethanolamine, 0.05%p-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma), 0.5 mmMgCl2, pH 9.8) followed by incubation at room temperature with shaking from 10 to 30 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 µl of 0.1 m ethylenediaminetetracetic acid, and the A 405 was measured using a Bio-Rad model 3550 plate reader. The motility assay described by McMichael (21McMichael J.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was carried out as follows. Filter-sterilized antibiotics, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, or monoclonal antibody were added to 3.3 ml of melted LB agar (containing 1% agar), which was poured into a 15 × 60-mm plastic Petri dish. After solidification, the plate was dried, with lid side up, at 37 °C for 6 h. The medium was then stab-inoculated with the test organism so that the inoculating needle came in contact with the bottom of the plate. The diameter of the zone of growth that radiated from the inoculation point between the agar layer and the interior bottom of the plate was measured after an 18-h incubation at 37 °C. Strain 1244N3, a mutant that is unable to make pilin (22Ramphal R. Koo L. Ishimoto K.S. Totten P.A. Lara J.C. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), could produce nonglycosylated strain 1244 pilin when carrying pPAC24, a plasmid containing the strain 1244 pilA gene (which codes for pilin) but lacking the pilO gene required for glycosylation. This strain was able to produce glycosylated pilin when carrying pPAC46, a plasmid containing both the strain 1244 pilA andpilO genes (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Glycosylated and nonglycosylated pili, produced by hyperexpression of the pilA gene of pPAC46 and pPAC24, respectively, were isolated and purified as described previously (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For use in Western blots, glycosylated and nonglycosylated pilin were purified further to remove traces of LPS. Here, pilin samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min in 10.0 mm Tris/HCl, 1% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, pH 8.0, for 20 min. These proteins were next subjected to gel filtration using a 1.0 × 30.0-cm Superose-12 column equilibrated with 10.0 mm Tris/HCl and 1.0% β-octyl glucoside at pH 8.0. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Glycosylated pilin from this step was applied to an 0.5 × 10.0-cm Mono-P column equilibrated with 0.025 m2-[Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)imino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, adjusted to pH 6.25 with HCl, and eluted with 10.0 ml of a solution containing 10% (w/v) Polybuffer 74 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 1% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, pH 4.0. Nonglycosylated pilin was applied to a Mono-P column equilibrated with 0.025 mtriethanolamine equilibrated to pH 8.3 with acetic acid and eluted with 10.0 ml of a solution containing 0.2% (w/v) Pharmalyte 8–10.5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 9% (w/v) Polybuffer 96 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 1% (w/v) β-octyl glucoside, pH 6.0. Fractions (0.5 ml) were taken at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Protein elution was monitored by absorption at 280 nm. Glycosylated pilin eluted at approximately pH 4.8, whereas nonglycosylated pilin eluted at pH 6.8. These proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and stored frozen. No LPS was detected as determined by Western blot using an anti-LPS-specific serum. In a typical preparation, ∼12.5 mg of pure glycosylated pili were suspended in 12 ml of a solution containing 5 mm Tris/HCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, pH 7.6. To this was added 7.2 mg each of proteinase K and Pronase followed by 40 µl of toluene to suppress microbial growth. This material was incubated at 45 °C for ∼18 h, at which time 1.8 mg each of proteinase K and Pronase were added. This was incubated for an additional 18 h at 55 °C and dried in a stream of filtered air at 45 °C. The digested material was resuspended with 1.0 ml of deionized water, and after removal of precipitate by centrifugation, it was passed through a 1.3 × 20-cm Sephadex G-25 column (calibrated with glucose and lactose) using 25 mmammonium acetate, pH 8.5, as elution buffer. 0.5-ml fractions at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min were taken, and protein absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Aliquots of fractions were incubated with 3.2% orcinol in 80% sulfuric acid at 80 °C for 15 min, and the absorbance at 420 nm was measured. The single peak that appeared in the 400–800 molecular weight range was pooled and dried. Pili in the absence of protease, or protease in the absence of pilin, produced no peak after similar treatment. This dried material was dissolved in a minimal volume of deionized water, loaded onto a 20 × 20-cm Whatman PE SIL G polyester-backed silica gel plate (Fisher), and subjected to TLC using an isopropanol-ammonium hydroxide (2:1) solvent (23Castric P.A. Strobel G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4089-4094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The position of the glycan-containing band was determined by excising a section of the plate and spraying it with an 0.11% orcinol in 0.3% sulfuric acid solution followed by incubation at 90 °C for 60 min. The area of the plate matching the orcinol-reactive band was scraped and the glycan eluted with deionized water. This material was dried and subjected to a second round of TLC using chloroform-methanol-water (10:10:3; (24Cassels F.J. London J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4019-4025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) as solvent. Glycan from this plate was again subjected to TLC using the isopropanol-ammonium hydroxide solvent. The purity of the material resulting from this scheme was tested by two-dimensional high performance TLC using Whatman silica gel glass-backed plates (Fisher) and employing butanol-acetic acid-water (3:1:1) and choroform-methanol-water (10:10:3) as solvents. Development of these plates with either orcinol or ninhydrin (0.3% ninhydrin in 95% ethanol followed by 90 °C treatment for 30 min) sprays produced a single spot at identical R f coordinates, indicating that this material was of high purity and contained both a sugar moiety and a free amino group. Approximately 450 µg of this material, as determined by spot test using serine as standard, was obtained using this procedure. The amino acid composition of the isolated pilin aminoglycan was determined after hydrolysis in 1m trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 95 °C. Hydrolysis products were subjected to high performance TLC using the isopropanol-ammonium hydroxide solvent described above withl-serine, l-threonine, andl-aspartic acid as standards and ninhydrin treatment for detection. For confirmation, an aminoglycan sample was hydrolyzedin vacuo in pre-pyrolyzed 10-mm tubes with 6 nHCl, 0.5% phenol, at 110 °C for 24 h. Amino acid composition of vacuum-dried hydrolysates was carried out at the University of Pittsburgh Protein Sequencing Facility using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer employing post-column ninhydrin detection. The sugar composition of the isolated pilin aminoglycan was analyzed after hydrolysis in 1 m HCl for 2–6 h at 95 °C. Hydrolysis products were subjected to high performance TLC using glucose, lactose, and xylose as standards with acetone-water (9:1 (25Ghebregzabher M. Rufini S. Monaldi B. Lato M. J. Chromatogr. 1976; 127: 133-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)) as solvent and orcinol spray for detection. Mass determination of glycosylated pilin was performed at the Mellon Institute Center for Molecular Analysis, Carnegie Mellon University, using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager STR with delayed extraction and a high m/zdetector. Sequence and mass analysis of the pilin aminoglycan was carried out by ESI-MS using a SCIEX API-III mass analyzer operated in the positive ion mode with an orifice potential of 50 V. Spectra are the accumulation of 10–15 scans collected over the mass range of 400 to 2,000. The sample was dissolved in distilled water at a final concentration of 2 µg/µl, and the sample solution was mixed with an equal volume of ESI-MS solution (aqueous 30% methanol containing 1% hydrochloric acid) and pumped into the mass spectrometer at a rate of 3 µl/min. MS/MS was also performed on the SCIEX instrument by selecting the parent ion for collision-induced dissociation using argon as the collision gas. For NMR analysis, the dried sample was dissolved in D2O and lyophilized. This procedure was repeated, and then the sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O and subjected to both one- and two-dimensional NMR analyses. The spectra were acquired using a Varian 300 MHz instrument. The gradient COSY, TOCSY, and ROESY experiments were performed using the pulse sequences provided by Varian, and processed using Varian software. Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million downfield from internal trimethylsilylpropionate with an accuracy of 0.002 ppm. The xylosyl linkage was determined by the preparation and GLC-MS analysis of its partially methylated alditol acetate (PMAA). The PMAAs were prepared using the Hakomori method as described by York et al. (26York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Analysis of the PMAAs was performed by GLC-MS on a Hewlett-Packard 5970 MSD using a 30-m SP2330 capillary column from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Previous work (27Sadoff J.C. Wright D.C. Futrovsky S. Sidberry H. Collins H. Kaufmann B. Antibiot. Chemother. 1985; 36: 134-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that the pilin and LPS of P. aeruginosa 1244 were immunologically similar. To verify this, glycosylated 1244 pilin was analyzed by Western blot using a mAb 11.14, which is specific for 1244 LPS O-antigen (28Cross A.S. Opal S.M. Palardy J.E. Bodmer M.W. Sadoff J.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that this antibody reacted with pilin to produce a single band at the anticipated position and also recognized LPS, as indicated by the typical ladder structure produced. To determine whether this mAb was directed against the pilin glycan, the nonglycosylated form of strain 1244 pilin (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) was also tested. Fig.1 shows that whereas this antibody reacted with glycosylated pilin there was no recognition of the nonglycosylated form, indicating that the pilin glycan was the reactive epitope. Anti-pilus mAb 5.44, previously shown to react with a peptide epitope (29Castric P.A. Deal C.D. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 371-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reacted with both glycosylated and nonglycosylated pilin. Neither form of pilin nor strain 1244 LPS reacted in the absence of primary antibody or in the presence of a mAb directed against O6 serotype P. aeruginosaLPS. Western blot analysis of the cytoplasmic, membrane, and periplasmic cell fractions of strain 1244 showed that pilin and LPS were the only antigens present that reacted with mAb 11.14. 2J. Rao and P. Castric, unpublished observations. A polyclonal typing serum directed against the LPS O antigen and specific for International Antigenic Typing System serotype O7 (30Liu P.V. Matsumoto H. Kusama H. Bergan T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1983; 33: 256-264Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was found also to recognize glycosylated but not nonglycosylated pilin, as determined by Western blot (results not shown). An antibody inhibition test was carried out to determine whether the antigen detected by Western blot was present on native functional pili. The pili of P. aeruginosa mediate a form of cell motility called twitching (31Bradley D.E. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) that can be inhibited by anti-pilus sera. If the glycan epitope exists on the pilus surface and is accessible to antibody reaction, inhibition of twitching motility by mAb 11.14 would be expected. Table I shows that purified mAb 11.14 inhibited twitching at concentrations as low as 1.6 µg/ml. Because this antibody also reacted with LPS, the possibility existed that twitching motility was inhibited through interaction with and not by directly binding to the pili. To determine whether this was the case, twitching inhibition was tested under conditions where only nonglycosylated pili were produced. P. aeruginosa 1244N3, a pilin-negative mutant (22Ramphal R. Koo L. Ishimoto K.S. Totten P.A. Lara J.C. Lory S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can produce glycosylated pili when carrying pPAC46, a plasmid bearing the whole pilAO operon (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This organism carrying pPAC24, a plasmid containing PilA but notpilO, produced only nonglycosylated pilin. TableII shows that twitching motility by the strain producing glycosylated pili was sensitive to inhibition by mAb 11.14, whereas the strain producing nonglycosylated pili was not affected. These results indicate that the 11.14-reactive epitope is present on the surface of the pilus under physiological conditions.Table IInhibition of P. aeruginosa 1244 twitching motility by a glycan-specific mAbAntibodyProtein concentrationMotility1-aMotility zone diameter.

Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin was post-translationally modified. Although the sequence of the pilin structural gene, pilA, predicted a molecular weight of 15,648 for mature pilin, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that the value was ∼16,900 (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study, MALDI analysis of pure strain 1244 pilin produced a value of 16,307 (±25) (results not shown), indicating the presence of covalently bound material with a total mass of ∼660 and with no signal seen at the mass predicted by the pilin gene. The use of a saccharide-specific probe indicated that this pilin contained bound glycan (5Castric P. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, proteolytically digested pure pili were found to contain a glycan material as determined by TLC using orcinol reagent detection. No glycan was seen under the same digestion conditions in the absence of either pili or protease. The orcinol-reactive material released by pilus degradation was purified by gel filtration and TLC and was found to be homogeneous as determined by two-dimensional high performance TLC using either orcinol or ninhydrin detection. The R f coordinates of the spots produced by these methods were identical. For preliminary identification of the amino-containing component, purified pilin aminoglycan was hydrolyzed (1 m trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 95C°) and the hydrolysate subjected to high performance TLC, with undigested aminoglycan, serine, threonine, and aspartic acid as references. The only ninhydrin-reactive spot present in the digested glycan matched the R f of serine, which was absent in undigested aminoglycan (results not shown). These findings were confirmed by amino acid analysis where serine was the sole amino acid present above background. Here it was found that 18.6 nmol of serine (2.0 µg) was produced from 18.8 µg (as determined by sugar analysis) of aminoglycan. The aminoglycan was treated with 1 m HCl for 6 h at 95 C°, and the hydrolysate was subjected to high performance TLC with orcinol detection. This procedure revealed the presence of three sugars, one of which corresponded in mobility to xylose (results not shown). Gel filtration of the aminoglycan using a calibrated Sephadex G-25 column indicated a molecular weight in the range of 400 to 800 (results not shown), which would be consistent with the additional mass revealed by the MALDI analysis described above. Altogether, these results suggest that the P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin monomer has a single covalently bound trisaccharide O-linked to one of the protein's 13 serine residues. To determine whether the purified aminoglycan carried the mAb 11.14-specific epitope, blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out in which this molecule was allowed to compete with pure native pili for antibody recognition. Fig.2 shows that the aminoglycan efficiently inhibited pili binding by mAb 11.14 but failed to interfere with mAb 5.44, which recognizes a pilin protein epitope (29Castric P.A. Deal C.D. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 371-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Competition was also seen between the isolated glycan and pure strain 1244 LPS, supporting the contention that the pilin glycan and strain 1244 LPS O-antigen share a common epitope. Results presented above suggested that P. aeruginosa 1244 pilin glycan was antigenically related to the LPS O-antigen of this organism and was structurally similar to an O-antigen repeating unit. Agglutination testing using International Antigenic Typing System sera (results not shown) showed that P. aeruginosa 1244 belonged to O-antigen group O7, a serogroup that is equivalent to Lanyi-Bergan 7a,7b, 7c (30Liu P.V. Matsumoto H. Kusama H. Bergan T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1983; 33: 256-264Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar,32Lanyi B. Bergan T. Bergan T. Norris J.R. Methods in Microbiology.

Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the serum of Camelidae contains in addition a large proportion (∼50%) of functional antibodies devoid of light chains and heavy chains possessing only three domains since the equivalent of the first constant domain is missing (2Hamers-Casterman C.

The two C-terminal domains of the heavy chain homodimers within camelids and conventional IgG molecules share large sequence identities and are responsible for the effector functions. Also, the N-terminal variable domain of the heavy chain antibodies (referred to as VHH)1 (3Muyldermans S. Lauwereys M. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) has an overall sequence and structure that is homologous to the variable domain (VH) of the heavy chain of a classical human antibody (4Muyldermans S.

Biochem. 2000; 39: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Important amino acid differences occur between the VH and VHH in their framework 2 region. This region is hydrophilic in VHHs rendering the domain soluble in aqueous solution, whereas the region is hydrophobic in the VH, and its amino acids associate with the VL. The VHH domain represents the smallest naturally occurring, intact antigen-binding site (9Sheriff S. Constantine K.L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), comprising only one single immunoglobulin domain with three antigen-binding loops (or complementarity determining regions, CDRs). Heavy chain antibodies with high specificity and affinity can be generated against a wide variety of antigens (10van der Linden R. de Geus B. Stok W. Bos W. van Wassenaar D. Verrips T. Frenken L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 240: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Their VHHs are readily cloned (11Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 12Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and expressed in bacteria and yeast (13Frenken L. van der Linden R.H.J. Hermans P.W.J.J. Bos W. Ruuls R.C. de Geus B. Verrips T. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 78: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and are extremely stable (14van der Linden R.H.J. Frenken L. de Geus B. Harmsen M.M. Ruuls R.C. Stok W. de Ron L. Wilson S. Davis P. Verrips T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In human and mouse, the first two antigen-binding loops of a VH domain, CDR1 and CDR2, can be assigned to a limited number of possible conformations referred to as canonical structures (15Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 16Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Gherardi E. Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J.

Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies A.H. Tulip W. Colman P.M. Spinelli S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The conformation of these loops depends both on their length and on the presence of specific residues at key positions. In contrast, the x-ray structure analysis of four VHH domains showed that their CDR1 and CDR2 deviate significantly from the canonical loop structures observed in human or mouse VHs (19Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The third antigen-binding loop (CDR3) of the VHH fragments is often constrained by an interloop disulfide bond and is, on average, longer than a human or mouse VH-CDR3 loop (4Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A.R.G. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This allows for a potentially larger antigen-binding surface (20Vu K.B. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). About half of the dromedary single-domain binders to enzymes are potent inhibitors (12Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This can be explained by their long CDR3 loop inserting into the active site cleft on the enzyme surface, as illustrated by the lysozyme binder cAb-Lys3. In this case, the N-terminal part of the 24-amino acid-long CDR3 loop protrudes from the remaining antigen-binding surface, penetrates deeply into the active site of the enzyme (6Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Dao-Thi M.-H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and mimics the lysozyme natural substrate (21Transue T.R. De Genst E. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, several non-inhibiting antibody fragments with a long CDR3 loop were also isolated (12Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and these fragments are not expected to interact with the active site of their enzymes. Therefore, it was hypothesized that these non-inhibiting VHH molecules would interact with other clefts present on the protein surface. Here, we present the crystal structures of a camel VHH fragment, cAb-CA05, both as free antibody and in complex with its antigen. This specific non-inhibiting enzyme binder recognizes the bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase with an affinity of 72 nm(K d), which is in the same range as other VHHs or single chain variable fragment (11Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 12Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the structural data reveal for the first time an antibody using only one single loop, its CDR3, to interact directly with the antigen. The cAb-CA05 was extracted from Escherichia coli periplasm and purified by chromatography on Ni-NTA (Qiagen) and Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gel filtration (12Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The cAb-CA05-carbonic anhydrase complex was prepared by mixing cAb-CA05 in phosphate buffered saline with bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (Sigma) in a molar ratio of 1.2: 1 and applied on Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Crystals from the antigen-free cAb-CA05 (1.7 mg/ml) and from the complex cAb-CA05·carbonic anhydrase (3.5 mg/ml) were grown in 25% (w/v) PEG8000 (Hampton), 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. A data set to 2.1 Å for cAb-CA05 was collected using a Rigaku RU-H2R rotating anode generator (Kobe, Japan) and a MarResearch image plate (MarResearch, Hamburg, Germany). Data for the antigen-antibody crystal were collected on beam line BW7A at EMBL-Hamburg using a MarResearch image plate. Primary data processing was done with DENZO (22Otwinowski Z. Swayer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. CLRC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, England1993: 107-113Google Scholar), scaling was done with SCALA, and further processing was done with the CCP4 program suite (23Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). The structure of the free antigen was solved by molecular replacement as implemented in AMORE (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar), using the VHH cAb-RN05 (Protein Data Bank entry code 1BZQ) as a search model. The structure was refined with X-PLOR (25Brünger A.T. A system for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). The CDR loops were deleted from the search model and rebuilt from scratch. Possible water positions were identified with ARP (27Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and checked manually. Model and structure factors are deposited in the Protein Data Bank, entry 1F2X. The antigen-antibody complex structure was solved by molecular replacement with the antigen-free cAb-CA05 structure and human carbonic anhydrase structure (1CA2) as search models. For refinement, we used the CNS program (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewskie J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), and included a simulated-annealing step to reduce possible model bias. As the high resolution limit of the data set is 3.5 Å, a grouped B factor refinement scheme was used (only one B factor for main chain atoms and one B factor for side chain atoms/residue). Model and structure factors are accessible through the Protein Data Bank, entry 1G6V. Superposition of structures or structure fragments and calculation of rmsd were done with LSQKAB (23Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). Inter-residue and inter-atom distances were calculated with CONTACT (23Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar), and accessible surface areas were calculated with NACCESS (29Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS Computer Program, Version 2.1.1. Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College London, UK1993Google Scholar). Figures were produced with MOLSCRIPT 2.1 (30Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and rendered with RASTER3D (31Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). cAb-CA05 is a VHH antibody fragment of 135 residues (M r 15,000) that binds specifically to bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (K d = 72 nm) but does not inhibit the enzymatic activity of the antigen. It was selected by panning from a VHH library of an immunized dromedary (12Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Hölzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The cAb-CA05 shares a high sequence identity with other VHHs or human VHs of family III (Fig.1). Nevertheless, the VHH characteristic amino acids in framework 2 (Phe-37, Glu-44, Arg-45, and Gly-47) (4Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A.R.G. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 20Vu K.B. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) are all present (Kabat amino acid numbering (32Kabat E. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Publication 91-3242. U.S. Public Health Services, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar)). In addition, residue Trp-103, constitutively conserved in all VHs and interacting with the VL, is substituted by Arg in cAb-CA05. Like most other VHHs from camelids, the cAb-CA05 contains a long CDR3 (19 amino acids) with a cysteine at position 100c expected to form a disulfide bond with Cys-33 located in the CDR1. The CDR2 of cAb-CA05 is unusually short as it contains 15 amino acids instead of a standard length of 16, 17, or 19 amino acids (32Kabat E. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Publication 91-3242. U.S. Public Health Services, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). The cAb-CA05 was crystallized both as free antibody and in complex with its antigen. Antigen-free cAb-CA05 crystallizes in space group P 21 with cell dimensions of a = 29.98 Å,b = 43.86 Å, c = 87.95 Å, β = 93.23 ° and two VHH molecules in the asymmetric unit. The antigen-antibody complexes crystallize in space group P 41212 with cell dimensions of a= 83.86 Å and c = 224.05 Å and one antigen-antibody complex in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the antigen-free cAb-CA05 was refined to 2.1 Å resolution (Table I). It adopts the standard fold of an immunoglobulin variable domain with nine conserved anti-parallel β-strands (Fig. 2) and three hypervariable regions clustering at one end of the domain (1Padlan E.A.

The Cys-22 and Cys-92 are oxidized into an intradomain disulfide bond, conserved in all immunoglobulin domains. Its general structure superimposes very well with a human VH reference structure (1igm) and with all available VHH structures of camel (1mel, 1bzq) and llama (1hcv, 1qdo). Root-mean-square deviations for the main chain atoms of the framework residues (residues 2–24, 32–52, 55–72, 77–92, and 103–112) ranged between 0.58 and 0.88 Å.Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statistics for antigen-free and antigen-complexed cAb-CA05Data statistics (highest shell)Antigen-freeAntigen-complexedResolution limits (Å)31.0–2.126.5–3.5(2.21–2.1)(3.69–3.5)R factor (%)10.3 (22.7)15.9 (34.5)Completeness99.8 (99.8)99 (99)I/ς4.9 (2.7)4.4 (2.1)Multiplicity5.8 (5.3)5.6 (5.8)Refinement statistics# of reflections1278610533# of reflections free666502R (%)19.021.0Rfree (%)27.027.6GeometryRmsd bond lengths (Å)0.009 (refmac)0.008 (cns)Rmsd bond angles (°)0.027 (refmac)1.360 (cns)Rmsd planarity (Å)0.026/ESU1-aESU, estimated standard uncertainty.

Open table in a new tab Structural adaptations, however, are expected to occur in the side of the domain that corresponds to the VL-interacting side of a VH domain. This area is hydrophobic in all VHs by the presence of Val-37, Leu-45, Trp-47, and Trp-103 side chains, conserved in sequence and structural position (Fig. 3 A) (35Chothia C. Novotny J. Bruccoleri R. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The L45R and W47G substitutions and the Trp-103 rotated over its Cβ-Cγ bond in cAb-Lys3 (Fig. 3 C) make this VHH region more hydrophilic. The V37F mutation fills a hydrophobic pocket created by the side chains of the Trp-103, Tyr-91, and the CDR3, where the conserved Tyr (three amino acids upstream of Trp-103) plays a central role (6Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Dao-Thi M.-H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The W103R substitution found here in cAb-CA05 renders this ‘former VL side’ of the VHH even more hydrophilic. It also allows a shift of the Phe-37 side chain toward the Tyr-91 and Arg-103 (Fig.3 D). As a result, the backbone of the long CDR3 approaches the former VL-side even more closely (Fig.4 D). All these modifications occur in the absence of distortions of the framework structure. In contrast, the partial camelization of a human VH in this area by L45R and W47I substitutions makes the isolated domain more soluble but induces backbone deformations at positions 37–38 and 45–47 (36Riechmann L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 957-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, the side chain of Trp-103 takes a completely new position (Fig. 3 B).Figure 4Structure of the antigen-binding loops in cAb-CA05.

Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 16Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Gherardi E. Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 799-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This canonical loop structure is shaped by a sharp turn at Gly-26, clustering of the hydrophobic side chains of Ala-24, Phe-27, Phe-29, and Met-34 (Fig. 4 A), and the hydrophobic part of the Arg-94 side chain (Cδ-Cε of Lys-94 in Pot VH) (16Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Gherardi E. Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 799-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The sequence composition of the cAb-CA05 H1 loop harbors the key elements for a type-1 structure except for the R94G and conservative F27Y and F29V substitutions (Fig. 1). These substitutions lead to a slightly different organization of the side chains forming the hydrophobic core of the loop but do not influence the main chain conformation of the loop (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, all previously solved camel or llama VHH structures had their H1 loop folded into completely different main chain architectures. Residues 52–56 form a hairpin loop (denoted H2) that constitutes the antigen-binding region of the second hypervariable region (15Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 16Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Gherardi E. Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 799-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Canonical structures of the H2 loop are described for loops with sizes of five, six, or eight amino acids. We previously showed that VHH H2 loops of six amino acids adopt conformations not yet observed in VH structures (19Decanniere K. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here, we are facing an H2 loop with only four amino acids (Fig. 1) that adopts a regular β-hairpin structure (Fig.4 B) known as type II′ (37Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). A comparison of four- and five-amino acid-long H2 loops indicates that the addition of a fifth amino acid introduces a bulge at position 55 and converts the loop to an H2 canonical structure type-1 (Fig. 4, B andC). The CDR3 (residues 95–102) of a VHH is on average longer than that of a VH (17 versus 12 residues) (4Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A.R.G. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), although a notable fraction of llama VHHs were found with ‘short’ CDR3 loops (20Vu K.B. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 38Harmsen M.M. Ruuls R.C. Nijman I.J. Niewold T.A. Frenken L. de Geus B. Molec. Immunol. 2001; 37: 579-590Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Another remarkable feature of the CDR3 of VHHs is the frequent presence of a cysteine forming a disulfide bond with a cysteine in the CDR1 (4Muyldermans S. Atarhouch T. Saldanha J. Barbosa J.A.R.G. Hamers R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,6Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Dao-Thi M.-H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In this respect, the cAb-CA05 with a 19-amino acid-long CDR3 loop and cysteines at positions 33 and 100c forming a disulfide bond is comparable with cAb-Lys3 (6Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Dao-Thi M.-H. Poortmans F. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) (Figs. 1 and 4 D). The cysteine at position 100c can be considered to divide the CDR3 region into an N-terminal and a C-terminal part. The C-terminal part of the CDR3 loop folds back onto the side of the VHH domain corresponding to the side of the VH interacting with VL (1Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) (see TableII for a list of contacting residues) (39Padlan E.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Large parts of the former VL-side are apparently shielded from the solvent by the C-end of the CDR3. A similar location and function has been observed for the C-terminal part of the cAb-Lys3 CDR3-loop (Fig. 4 D) (6Desmyter A. Transue T.R. Arbabi Ghahroudi M. Dao-Thi M.-H. Poortmans F. Hamers R.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal part of the CDR3 of cAb-CA05 and cAb-Lys3 are in a different environment. In cAb-Lys3, it forms a protruding loop (Fig.4 D) inserting in the catalytic site of the lysozyme (21Transue T.R. De Genst E. Ghahroudi M.A. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Genetics. 1998; 32: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In cAb-CA05, this part of the loop does not extend into the solvent but associates with the residues of the remaining hypervariable loops (Table II). Thus, the N-terminal and C-terminal half of the CDR3 of cAb-CA05 contact different parts of the domain. Furthermore, the entire (long) CDR3 of cAb-CA05 appears to be well fixed by these abundant contacts and by the covalent Cys33-Cys100c disulfide bond. In addition to the antigen-free cAb-CA05 crystal, crystals of the complex of cAb-CA05 with its antigen, carbonic anhydrase, were obtained and diffracted to 3.5 Å using synchrotron radiation. The structure was solved by molecular replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the data and refinement statistics for the antibody-antigen complex structure are shown in Table I.

The mutations were selected based on sequence homology with the large subunit of [NiFe] hydrogenases. None of the mutations affected assembly of complex I, all decreased or abolished ubiquinone reductase activity. Several mutants exhibited decreased sensitivities toward ubiquinone-analogous inhibitors. Unexpectedly, seven mutations affected the properties of iron-sulfur cluster N2, a prosthetic group not located in the 49-kDa subunit. In three of these mutants cluster N2 was not detectable by electron-paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The fact that the small subunit of hydrogenase is homologous to the PSST subunit of complex I proposed to host cluster N2 offers a straightforward explanation for the observed, unforeseen effects on this iron-sulfur cluster. We propose that the fold around the hydrogen reactive site of [NiFe] hydrogenase is conserved in the 49-kDa subunit of complex I and has become part of the inhibitor and ubiquinone binding region. We discuss that the fourth ligand of iron-sulfur cluster N2 missing in the PSST subunit may be provided by the 49-kDa subunit.

Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). During this process electrons pass through a series of membrane-bound multiprotein complexes that translocate protons across the membrane. The resulting proton motive force is used by ATP synthase to make ATP (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first of these electron transfer complexes and accounts for up to 40% of the pumped protons. In human mitochondria, complex I is regarded as a major source of deleterious reactive oxygen species. Hereditary and acquired defects affecting this multiprotein complex have been implicated in numerous degenerative diseases and seem to promote aging (3Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). The physiological and medical importance of complex I contrasts sharply with our still rather limited knowledge about the molecular structure and the catalytic mechanism of this multisubunit membrane protein with a total mass close to 1000 kDa (4Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 85-86Google Scholar). The core of complex I is formed by 14 central subunits of which in animals and most fungi seven are encoded by the mitochondrial genome (5Gray M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial enzyme contains up to 29 additional “supernumerary” subunits. As bacterial enzymes comprise only the 14 central subunits, these must contain all functional modules required for electron and proton transfer. Except for the electron entry point that is formed by FMN and iron-sulfur center N3 in the 51-kDa subunit, the organization of these functional modules, the location and number of prosthetic groups, and the location of the ubiquinone substrate binding site are largely unknown. In particular, the function of nine of the 14 central subunits that carry none of the known prosthetic groups of complex I is obscure. One of these proteins, the 49-kDa subunit, was found to be homologous to the large subunit of [NiFe] hydrogenases, a diverse family of enzymes found in archaebacteria and eubacteria (6Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 167-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). More recently, a “classical” mutation of Rhodobacter capsulatus selected for resistance to quinone analogous complex I inhibitors was found to affect this subunit (7Darrouzet E. Issartel J.P. Lunardi J. Dupuis A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Prompted by these findings and guided by a more detailed analysis of the homology between the large [NiFe]-carrying subunit of hydrogenases and the 49-kDa subunit, we characterized site-directed mutations in the 49-kDa subunit using the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica as our newly developed model to study complex I (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We show that specific domains of the 49-kDa subunit are in fact of critical functional importance. Based on structural homology to water soluble, two-subunit [NiFe] hydrogenases, we propose that the protein fold around the [NiFe] active site of hydrogenases has been retained in the catalytic core of complex I (9Kerscher S.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) exhibits significantly higher homology to the 49-kDa subunit of complex I than to the large subunit of its water soluble counterpart. This allowed for a reliable alignment of the regions around the [NiFe]-ligating cysteines that are arranged in two pairs located near the N terminus and the C terminus of the sequences (Fig.1). The four [NiFe] ligating cysteines in the hydrogenase sequence are substituted by two acidic residues, a small residue (serine, glycine, or alanine), and a valine in all known 49-kDa subunit sequences. Remarkably, the valine is the residue that was found to be mutated to methionine in an inhibitor-resistant mutant in R. capsulatus (7Darrouzet E. Issartel J.P. Lunardi J. Dupuis A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). An arginine two positions upstream of the N-terminal domain cysteine pair and an aspartate two positions upstream of the C-terminal cysteine pair were found to be invariant in all known [NiFe] hydrogenase and 49-kDa subunit sequences. This arginine is part of a RGXEX16R XCGXCXXXH motif reported by Albracht (17Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to be present in most sequences of the large [NiFe] hydrogenase subunit. Based on this sequence analysis, we reasoned that the domains around the [NiFe] active site of hydrogenase, despite the loss of the prosthetic group, may have retained an important catalytic function in the 49-kDa subunit of complex I. To test this hypothesis we constructed and characterized a series of site-directed mutations in the homologous domains of the 49-kDa subunit of Y. lipolytica complex I. The inhibitor-resistant mutant found in R. capsulatus (7Darrouzet E. Issartel J.P. Lunardi J. Dupuis A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggested a possible involvement of the 49-kDa subunit in forming the ubiquinone binding site of complex I. As histidine is known to be in a critical position in all ubiquinone binding sites that have so far been characterized in detail based on molecular structures (19Rich P. Fisher N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Lancaster C.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we included the mutagenesis of three histidines that are strictly conserved in all complex I sequences. The first of these histidines (His-120) is located immediately before the RGXE motif. The second histidine (His-226) is in the middle of a pattern of glycines (G X3HX6GG) found invariably in complex I and all [NiFe] hydrogenases (Fig. 1). The third histidine (His-384) lies in a 30-amino acid-long insertion of the 49-kDa subunit that is missing in the sequences of the large subunit of [NiFe] hydrogenases. Mutation V460M, a reconstruction of the inhibitor-resistant mutant in R. capsulatus, resulted in a 70–80% loss of complex I activity and a 3-fold increase in the IC50-value for the ubiquinone-analogous inhibitor DQA (TableI). EPR-spectra of the isolated mutant enzyme revealed that the signal of iron-sulfur cluster N2 was significantly decreased. The signals of all other EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters (16Djafarzadeh R. Kerscher S. Zwicker K. Radermacher M. Lindahl M. Schägger H. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were unchanged (Fig.2 A). The more drastic mutation V460A led to complete loss of activity. With all other iron-sulfur clusters unaffected, cluster N2 was not detectable in the EPR spectra of isolated complex I from this mutant. Mutations D143C, D143E, and E463Q also led to a 70–80% decrease in complex I activity and a 2-fold resistance to the ubiquinone-analogous inhibitor DQA with normal or slightly increased IC50 values for rotenone. Mutation D143E resulted in destabilized iron-sulfur cluster N2 that was lost from the complex upon purification if high concentrations of detergent were used. If in complex I preparations from this mutant iron-sulfur cluster N2 was detectable by EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 2), it exhibited an altered gxy region. Although this finding is difficult to interpret as several clusters contribute to this part of the EPR spectrum, it was probably due to heterogeneity of the sample. Complex I from mutant E463Q consistently exhibited a significantly decreased electron paramagnetic resonance signal of cluster N2 (Fig.2). Again, no effects on other EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters were observed. Mutation R141A resulted in more than 80% loss of complex I activity, but sensitivities toward DQA and rotenone were unaffected. In complex I from this mutant iron-sulfur cluster N2 was not detectable, and all other EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters were unchanged (Fig. 2). Mutation D458A also resulted in about 70% loss of activity, and EPR spectra of complex I from D458A were normal. With IC50 value increases of 30-fold for DQA and 10-fold for rotenone, this mutant exhibited by far the most pronounced inhibitor resistance (Table I; Fig. 3). Exchanging the fully conserved Tyr-144 with histidine resulted in complete loss of activity. With all other iron-sulfur clusters unchanged, this mutation changed the EPR spectrum of iron-sulfur cluster N2 as characterized by a general broadening of the signal and significant increase of the gz value (Fig.2). Mutations H120A and H384A resulted in moderately decreased complex I activities (Table I) but did not affect the spectra of the EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters. Except for a slightly elevated IC50 value for DQA in H120A, no changes in inhibitor sensitivity were observed in these two mutants (Table I). Membranes from mutant H226A exhibited a 75% loss of activity and normal sensitivity toward DQA and rotenone. However, in the otherwise unchanged EPR spectra of complex I from this mutant, the signal of iron-sulfur cluster N2 was not detectable (Table I, Fig. 2). Guided by sequence homology to the hydrogen reactive subunit of [NiFe] hydrogenases, we have characterized a series of 11 point mutations in the 49-kDa subunit of Y. lipolytica complex I. Complete loss of activity was caused by two mutations, V460A and Y144H. One mutation, D458A, increased the IC50 values for DQA and rotenone dramatically, while five other exchanges, D143E, D143C, V460M, E463Q, and H120A, caused moderate resistance to DQA. Although no effects on any other EPR-detectable iron-sulfur clusters were observed, isolated complex I from seven mutants exhibited changes in the EPR spectrum of iron-sulfur cluster N2; in V460M and E463Q cluster N2 was decreased, and in V460A, R141A, and H226A it was not detectable. In D143E this iron sulfur cluster was destabilized and in Y144H a broadening of the N2 EPR spectrum and a specific shift of the gz value was observed. The fact that some of these mutations had pronounced, but specific effects on ubiquinone reductase activity, inhibitor sensitivity, or the EPR spectrum of iron-sulfur cluster N2 demonstrated that the 49-kDa subunit plays a central functional role in complex I. Some amino acid exchanges near or at the residues corresponding to the cysteine pairs ligating the [NiFe] center in hydrogenase had rather severe consequences on complex I function, whereas two of the histidine to alanine exchanges further away (H120A, H384A) had only very minor effects. This strongly supports the notion that domains around the hydrogen reactive [NiFe] site of hydrogenase have been retained as a functionally critical module in the 49-kDa subunit of complex I. The Fe4S4 cluster N2 is assumed to be the immediate electron donor to ubiquinone in complex I. By virtue of its pH-dependent redox potential (21Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) it has been suggested to be an important component of the proton-translocating machinery (22Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,23Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). There has been conflicting evidence whether this redox group resides in the TYKY (24Chevallet M. Dupuis A. Lunardi J. van Belzen R. Albracht S.P.J. Issartel J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or in the PSST subunit (25Friedrich T. Abelmann A. Brors B. Guenebaut V. Kintscher L. Leonard K. Rasmussen T. Scheide D. Schlitt A. Schulte U. Weiss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In either case one would not have expected mutations in the 49-kDa subunit to have pronounced and specific effects on iron-sulfur cluster N2, as was observed in this study. A straightforward explanation became obvious when we combined information from the molecular structure of the water soluble [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans (26Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) and the sequence homology to model the arrangement of the mutated residues in the 49-kDa subunit of Y. lipolytica complex I (Fig. 4, 9): In hydrogenase, the [NiFe] site is located at the interface between the large and small subunit adjacent to the proximal iron-sulfur cluster of the small subunit. The small subunit of hydrogenase is homologous to the PSST subunit of complex I (17Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Three of the cysteines ligating the proximal iron-sulfur cluster are conserved in the PSST subunit (Cys-86, Cys-150, and Cys-180) and are therefore expected to ligate iron-sulfur cluster N2 of complex I (if this subunit in fact binds this redox group). It is immediately obvious from Fig. 4 that the effects on iron-sulfur cluster N2 by the mutations analyzed here correlate well with the proximity of the corresponding residues in water soluble hydrogenase to the proximal iron-sulfur cluster. It is most remarkable, that H226A, the only mutation studied here with a sequence position distant from the residues corresponding to the [NiFe]-ligating cysteines, exhibited such a pronounced effect on complex I abolishing the EPR signal of iron-sulfur cluster N2. In the hydrogenase structure the corresponding residue His-228 resides at the tip of a loop flanked by three invariant glycines (cf. Fig. 1). Thus in the light of the molecular structure of [NiFe] hydrogenase, analysis of our data strongly suggests that the proximal iron-sulfur cluster has in fact become cluster N2 in the PSST subunit of complex I and resides at the interface to the 49-kDa subunit. However, as one of the cysteines ligating the proximal iron-sulfur cluster is missing in PSST, it remains an unsolved question which residue may serve as the fourth ligand of cluster N2. Glu-89 had been proposed as a possible candidate (22Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but could be excluded recently by site-directed mutagenesis (8Ahlers P. Zwicker K. Kerscher S. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23577-23582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on the structural homology outlined above one is tempted to speculate that the fourth ligand of N2 actually resides on the 49-kDa subunit. Possible candidates are the invariant His-226, which already in hydrogenase makes a hydrogen bond to the proximal iron-sulfur cluster (26Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar), and fully conserved Tyr-144, which corresponds to a conserved glycine in hydrogenase (cf. Fig. 1). Observations were made that may lend support to either option; mutant H226A in the 49-kDa subunit did not exhibit an EPR signal for iron-sulfur cluster N2 and Y144H led to a total loss of complex I activity along with a shift in the gzvalue of iron-sulfur cluster N2. It should be noted that although no iron-sulfur cluster N2 was detectable in complex I from mutants R141A and H226A, complex I in these two mutants exhibited significant residual ubiquinone reductase activity of around 20–30%. This seems difficult to explain if iron-sulfur cluster N2 is in fact an essential component of the electron pathway of complex I. However, as both residues are predicted to be in close vicinity to iron-sulfur cluster N2, the mutations may have shifted the midpoint potential to very negative values. This may prevent reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster by NADH necessary for detection by EPR spectroscopy. Although this is one possible explanation, further studies will be needed. Several of the mutations analyzed here exhibited resistance to ubiquinone-analogous inhibitors of complex I that was most pronounced for the residue most distant from the predicted position of iron-sulfur cluster N2. We conclude that this part of the 49-kDa subunit contributes to the inhibitor (and ubiquinone) binding pocket of complex I and has evolved from the [NiFe]-binding fold of hydrogenase. The very recent identification of two additional inhibitor resistant point mutations G409A and D412E (Gly-462 and Asp-465 in Y. lipolytica) in the 49-kDa subunit in R. capsulatus (27Prieur I. Lunardi J. Dupuis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) by Dupuis and co-workers corroborates this view. Also the finding that the PSST subunit is labeled specifically by a derivative of pyridaben, another ubiquinone-analogous inhibitor of complex I (28Schuler F. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Yagi T. Yankovskaya V. Singer T.P. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4149-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) fits well with the structural model of Fig.4. A recent report from the Nijmegen Center for Mitochondrial Disorders that two independent point mutations on the loop carrying the possible fourth ligand of cluster N2 cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalomyopathy in humans (29Loeffen J. Elpeleg O. Smeitink J. Smeets R. Stöckler-Ipsiroglu S. Mandel R. Sengers R. Trijbels F. Van den Heuvel L. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), provides further support for this paradigm. It seems inevitable to conclude that the 49-kDa and the PSST subunit form a central part of the catalytic core of complex I and contribute to the ubiquinone binding domain. Our results demonstrate a remarkable degree of structural conservation between a homologous subunit from two classes of quite functionally different enzymes on a molecular level. We conclude that not only the overall fold of the active site is the same in [NiFe] hydrogenase and complex I but also that both enzyme families share a number of functionally important residues that are invariant in all known sequences. This is of particular significance as a central part of the catalytic core of complex I itself seems to have evolved from a hydrogen reactive [NiFe] center to a site reducing the much larger ubiquinone that may comprise the proton pumping module as well. We suggest that the residues invariant between the large subunit of hydrogenase and the 49-kDa subunit of complex I may be involved in electron and proton pathways serving the active site as these functions have to be present in both enzymes. We thank Gudrun Beyer and Franz J. Streb for excellent technical assistance."

The latter is often described as being due to breaking internal waves. Here we reconcile the difference between theoretical and observed estimates of vertical mixing in the deep ocean by presenting a revised view of the thermohaline circulation, which allows for additional upwelling in the Southern Ocean and the separation of the North Atlantic Deep Water cell from the Antarctic Bottom Water cell. The changes also mean that much less wind and tidal energy needs to be dissipated in the deep ocean than was originally thought."

To understand better the role of HSP27, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library for HSP27-interacting proteins.

Throughout the animal, plant, and microbiotic kingdoms, members of this protein superfamily share the so-called α-crystallin domain in their C-terminal part, whereas other parts of the sequence (N-terminal halves and extreme C-terminal tails) are more variable.

Phosphorylation of HSP27 is an early and prominent event in many cells when stimulated by a variety of mitogenic and stress factors. For example, contraction of smooth muscle cells in response to bombesin or endothelin-1 involves phosphorylation of HSP27 (12Bitar K.N. Kaminski M.S. Hailat N. Cease K.B. Strahler J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Yamboliev I.A. Hedges J.C. Mutnick J.L.-M. Adam L.P. Gerthofer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1899-H1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Sertoli cells respond to germ cells (14Pittenger G.L. Gilmont R.R. Welsh W.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3207-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and pancreatic acinar cells to cholecystokinin (15Schäfer C. Clapp P. Welsh M.J. Benndorf R. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1032-C1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by rapid phosphorylation of HSP27. Another characteristic of sHSPs is their ability to form supramolecular structures (complexes). The basic structural units of sHSP complexes are dimers that are formed by interaction of segments of the α-crystallin domain (16Liu C. Welsh M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The formation of structures of higher orders, such as tetramers, octomers, etc., appears to require additional sites of interaction that have been located to the N-terminal region of the molecules (17Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Besides homo-oligomeric complexes, sHSPs can also form hetero-oligomeric complexes if different sHSP species are present (16Liu C. Welsh M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol.

The molecular mass of cellular sHSP complexes varies over a wide range (50–1000 kDa), with complexes of increasing size being predominant under stress conditions. Complex formation is believed to be a key feature in regulating the activity of sHSPs in vivo, although details are not understood (20Preville X. Schultz H. Knauf U. Gaestel M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 69: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Also, the reported in vitro activities of HSP27, chaperoning and inhibition of actin polymerization, depend positively or negatively, respectively, on complex formation, which itself appears to depend, to a certain extent, on the degree of phosphorylation (21Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov Z. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.-P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol.

It is not known which factors control the interaction of sHSPs with themselves or with other proteins. In recent years, evidence has been obtained for the crucial role of some of the sHSPs in muscle function. A point mutation in the αB-crystallin gene causes a severe desmin-related cardiomyopathy in humans (32Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.-C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F.

Whereas in most cell types HSP27 and αB-crystallin have a diffuse cytosolic location, the situation in striated muscles is different. Both proteins have been found in specific locations such as the I-band (33Lutsch G. Vetter R. Offhauss U. Wieske M. Gröne H.-J. Klemenz R. Schimke I. Stahl J. Benndorf R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3466-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Z-disc (34Golenhofen N. Htun P. Ness W. Koob R. Schaper W. Drenckhahn D. J. Mol. Cell.

The highly specific location of sHSPs in myocytes and the stress-related relocation of sHSPs led us to hypothesize that HSP27 interacts with other proteins in muscle. It is also hypothesized that the observed relocation of HSP27 involves a regulatory mechanism able to respond to physiological signals. In an effort to identify proteins that interact with HSP27 in muscle cells, we screened a human heart cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid method. In order to obtain data related to the regulation of the binding preference of HSP27 in dependence on its phosphorylation, we used as “bait” proteins both human wild-type HSP27 (wthHSP27) and a mimic of phosphorylated human HSP27 in which the three serines phosphorylated by MAPKAPK-2 (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82) had been substituted by aspartate (3DhHSP27). Here we report the identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of a novel sHSP we designated HSP22 and that is expressed in striated and smooth muscle tissues. This protein binds preferentially to 3DhHSP27 rather than to wthHSP27. Thus, HSP22 matches the requirements of the initial hypothesis. It is a new binding partner of HSP27 occurring in muscles, and the HSP27-HSP22 interaction is regulated by phosphorylation of HSP27. In order to create two-hybrid bait vectors, the cDNAs encoding the human (h)wthHSP27 and 3DhHSP27 were amplified by PCR using the vectors pBS-wthHSP27 and pBS-3DhHSP27 (obtained from L. A. Weber, University of Nevada, Reno) as template. The sense and antisense primers were 5′-cagccatcatgaccgagcgccgcgtc-3′ (restriction siteBspHI underlined) and 5′-caactcgaggtggttgctttgaactttatttg-3′ (restriction siteXhoI underlined), respectively. The PCR products (∼730 bp) were digested with the restriction enzymes BspHI andXhoI and fused in frame with the Gal4-DNA binding domain of the vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) using the restriction sites NcoI and SalI. The resulting bait constructs, designated pAS2-1-wthHSP27 and pAS2-1-3DhHSP27, were used in the two-hybrid screening. Full-length hHSP22 cDNA was constructed on the basis of the isolated “prey” plasmid pACT2-hHSP22δNT (see below) and of the ESTs 874 288, 1 579 386, and 1 962 578. Two synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-gatccatggctgacggtcagatgcccttctcctgccactacccaagccgcctgcgccgagaccccttccggg-3′ and 5′-agtcccggaaggggtctcggcgcaggcggcttgggtagtggcaggagaagggcatctgaccgtcagccatg-3′) were hybridized yielding the double-stranded DNA fragment F1 (representing the 5′-end of hHSP22 cDNA) with the upstreamBamHI-compatible end 5′-gatc … and the downstreamHinfI-compatible end … tga-5′. From the vector pACT2-hHSP22δNT a 576-bp HinfI fragment (F2) was excised containing most of the translated sequence of hHSP22. Fragments F1 and F2 were ligated yielding F3, which contained the complete sequence of the translated part of hHSP22 cDNA. F3 was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pRSET.B (Invitrogen) using the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI and taking advantage of the fact that the downstream HinfI-compatible end of F3 ( … tta-5′) could be ligated at low frequency to theEcoRI end of the vector. The resulting construct pRSET.B-hHSP22 was used for expression of hHSP22 inEscherichia coli and for PCR (see below). In order to create an eukaryotic expression vector, the full-length hHSP22 sequence was amplified from pRSET.B-hHSP22 by PCR using the primers 5′-cggaattcaacatggctgacggtcagatgcccttct-3′ (restriction site EcoRI underlined) and 5′-agccctcgagcttcgaatcaaagaagcccta-3′ (restriction siteXhoI underlined). The PCR fragment was digested withEcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) yielding the construct pcDNA3.1-hHSP22 which was used for transfection of COS-7 cells and for PCR. In order to create a full-length hHSP22 cDNA in the vector pACT2 (CLONTECH), the hHSP22 sequence was amplified from the construct pcDNA3.1-hHSP22 by PCR using the primers 5′-gccagtgtggccgtggtggccatggctgacggtcagatgcccttctcctgc-3′ (restriction site SfiI underlined) and 5′-ccacaagagctcatctcaggtacaggtgacttcctg-3′ (restriction site Ecl136II underlined). The PCR fragment was digested with SfiI and Ecl136II and fused in frame with the Gal4 transcription activation domain of the vector pACT2 (using the restriction sites SfiI and SmaI) yielding the construct pACT2-hHSP22 which was used for two-hybrid experiments. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. The human heart cDNA library (representing the cDNA of three human hearts, CLONTECH) in the prey vector pACT2 with the Gal4-transcription activation domain was propagated as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Two-hybrid screening (covering ∼1.6 × 106 independent clones for each bait construct) was performed by transforming the yeast strain Y190 first with the bait plasmids (pAS2-1-wthHSP27 or pAS2-1-3DhHSP27), followed by a second transformation with the library plasmids. Primary positive clones were obtained with nutrition deficiency (-Trp,-Leu,-His) selection and the reporter gene expression assay (β-galactosidase lift assay) according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). The primary positive colonies were depleted of the bait vectors and mated with yeast strain Y187 carrying the vector pAS2-1 with the unrelated bait γ-interferon cDNA as insert. This procedure permits identification and elimination of false positive clones. From the remaining “true” positive clones the plasmids were recovered, and proteins interacting with wthHSP27 or 3DhHSP27 were identified by sequencing the inserts, either full-length cDNA or N-terminally truncated fragments. To establish the correct sequence of hHSP22, both strands of the isolated plasmid pACT2-hHSP22δNT were sequenced three times. In order to test interaction between hHSP22 and different forms of HSP27, yeast strain Y190 was transformed first with the plasmid pACT2-hHSP22. In a second transformation step the yeast was transformed with the plasmid pAS2-1-wthHSP27, pAS2-1-wtrHSP27 (25Liu C. Gilmont R.R. Benndorf R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18724-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or pAS2-1-3DhHSP27. Small scale transformation and selection procedures were as described in the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Total RNA was prepared from mouse and rat hearts with TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the HSP22 cDNAs were amplified by RT-PCR. The primers were designed on the basis of alignment with hHSP22 cDNA of several mouse and rat ESTs as follows (nucleotides complementary to the cDNAs are in uppercase): mouse sense, 5′-ttgagctccAAGCTCCGACCAACATCATGGCTGA-3′ (restriction site SacI underlined); mouse antisense, 5′-tttgccatGGCTGACGTCTTAGGAACAGGTGA-3′ (restriction siteNcoI underlined); rat sense, 5′- TGGCTCgagCTCTCTGAGCCTCTGTTTC-3′ (restriction siteXhoI underlined); and rat antisense, 5′-GGAattcAGAAGGACCAAGGCTGACGTC-3′ (restriction siteEcoRI underlined). The RT-PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes SacI and NcoI (mouse) andXhoI and EcoRI (rat), ligated into the vector pRSET.A (Invitrogen) using the corresponding restriction sites, and processed for DNA sequencing. Northern blotting was performed using human multiple tissue blots (Invitrogen) as described (35van de Klundert F.A.J. Gijsen M.L.J. van den IJssel P.R.L.A. Snoeckx L.H.E.H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The probe, a gel-purified 0.6-kilobase pair EcoRI-XhoI fragment from plasmid pACT2-hHSP22δNT, was labeled with [32P]dATP in a random primer reaction (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The vector pRSET.B-hHSP22 was used to transform the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen). Synthesis of hHSP22 was induced by isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside, and the recombinant His-tagged protein was purified on a nickel column according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant hHSP22 was used to raise a specific antibody in sheep. One mg of protein was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into a sheep. Two weeks after a boost with another milligram of the protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, serum was collected from the sheep. The IgG fraction of the immunoglobulins was isolated using protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). The antibody was tested using transfected COS-7 cells expressing hHSP22 (cf. Fig. 4). COS-7 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 24 h prior to transfection, 5 × 104 cells were seeded into 35-mm Petri dishes. Transfection was with 3 µl of FuGENE 6 and 1 µg of plasmid DNA dissolved in 100 µl of serum-free medium. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and processed for Western blotting using the anti-hHSP22 antibody. SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional-PAGE, and IEF-PAGE were performed according to standard procedures (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar, 37O'Farrell P.H.

For Western blotting, proteins were extracted from COS-7 cells in suitable sample buffer (depending on the electrophoretic system), separated on SDS gels, two-dimensional gels, or IEF gels and transferred onto a PVDF membrane as described (25Liu C. Gilmont R.R. Benndorf R. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18724-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38Benndorf R. Engel K. Gaestel M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 431-445PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of hHSP22, the purified anti-hHSP22 IgG fraction was used at a dilution of 1:10.000. Visualization was with a secondary anti-sheep antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Incubation of purified recombinant hHSP22 and hHSP27 (Stressgen) with protein kinases was in a total volume of 10 µl as follows. PKC incubation mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 µg of either sHSP, and 5 ng of PKC catalytic subunit from rat brain (Calbiochem). CK-2 incubation mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 µg of either sHSP, and 250 units of human recombinant CK-2 (Calbiochem). MAPKAPK-2 and p44 MAPK (Erk1) incubation mixtures contained 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 10 mm K3PO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 µg of either sHSP, and 0.5 µg MAPKAPK-2δCT (Stressgen), or 0.5 µg of p44 MAPK (Erk1) (Calbiochem), respectively. Assays to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE were initiated with 1 mm (10 µCi) [γ-32P]ATP and terminated by addition of 10 µl of 2× concentrated SDS sample buffer. Assays to be analyzed by IEF-PAGE were initiated with 1 mm ATP and terminated by addition of 10 µl of IEF sample buffer according to Ref. 38Benndorf R. Engel K. Gaestel M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 431-445PubMed Google Scholar. 20 µg of recombinant hHSP22 was phosphorylated with either PKC or p44 MAPK (Erk1) as described above. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of 500 µl of ethanol (−20 °C). The protein was pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), washed with 70% (v/v) ethanol, reduced, and alkylated with iodoacetamide prior to overnight digestion at 37 °C with trypsin (Promega) in 2 m urea, 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. Peptides were desalted using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) and eluted into 3 µl of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 3% (v/v) formic acid. The eluate was placed into a static nanoflow probe tip (Micromass) and introduced into a Micromass Q-TOF mass spectrometer using a Z-spray ionization source. Comparison of a theoretical hHSP22 tryptic digest to the observed spectra was used to identify putative phosphopeptides. Putative phosphopeptides were analyzed by MS/MS to identify sites of phosphorylation, using collision voltages over the range of 20–35 V. In order to identify HSP27-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system, hHSP27 cDNA was fused with the Gal4-DNA binding domain of the vector pAS2-1 and used as bait. We used both the full-length human wild-type HSP27 (wthHSP27) and a triple mutant of this protein in which the serine residues at positions 15, 78, and 82 were substituted with aspartate residues in order to mimic phosphorylation (3DhHSP27). After transformation of the yeast, the expression of these fusion proteins was verified by Western blotting using anti-HSP27 monoclonal antibody (not shown). After a second transformation of the yeast with the library plasmid representing the cDNA of three human hearts fused with the Gal4 transcription activation domain in the vector pACT2, a total of ∼1.6 million yeast colonies each were screened. After eliminating false positive colonies by yeast mating, 17 colonies were obtained as true positives. By using wthHSP27 as bait, hαB-crystallin (5 times) and hHSP20 (2 times) were identified as binding proteins. By using 3DhHSP27 as bait, hHSP27 (6 times), hαB-crystallin (2 times), human mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit III (1 time), and a novel protein (1 time), later designated hHSP22, were identified as binding proteins. With the exception of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit III, all identified proteins, including hHSP22 (see below), are members of the superfamily of sHSPs. The identified cDNA consisted of the sequence between positions 71 and 1511 as shown in Fig. 1 A. A BLAST search of nucleotide and protein data bases did not reveal any known protein with this sequence, although similarity with sHSPs was evident. However, several human EST sequences (cf. “Experimental Procedures”) were found with 95% or greater identity, most of them derived from various muscle tissues. Alignment with these ESTs suggested that the novel sequence was 5′-truncated and also permitted the establishment of the complete cDNA sequence. The open reading frame has a translation start codon in a Kozak context, an in-frame translation stop codon, and, after an extended 3′-non-translated stretch, several polyadenylation signals (Fig. 1 A). Since all ESTs extending into the 5′-direction have an in-frame stop codon 15 bp upstream of the translation start codon (not shown), a further 5′-extension of the translated sequence can be excluded. Translation of this sequence results in a putative protein composed of 196 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 21.6 kDa and a calculated pI of 5.0. Alignment of this protein with hHSP27 reveals ∼33% overall identity with the highest similarity in the C-terminal half of the molecule, the α-crystallin domain. (cf. Fig.1 D). From these data it is evident that the novel protein belongs to the superfamily of mammalian sHSPs, and consequently we have named it HSP22. While this work was ongoing, other groups submitted the identical protein sequence to GenBankTM(GenBankTM accessions AAF09481, NP055180, and AAD55359), and in one report (39Smith C.C., Yu, Y.X. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25690-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) the protein was described (see “Discussion”). Based on the sequence of hHSP22 we identified a number of ESTs derived from several mouse and rat tissues. Alignment of these ESTs permitted us to define the sequences of mouse (mHSP22) and rat HSP22 (rHSP22) cDNAs. According to these sequences, primers comprising the complete translated parts were designed, and the mouse and rat HSP22 cDNAs were amplified by single step RT-PCR using mouse and rat heart RNA preparations. The sequences of the mHSP22 and rHSP22 cDNAs are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. The translated part of the hHSP22 cDNA is 87.1 and 88.5% identical with the mHSP22 and rHSP22 cDNA, respectively. The rodent HSP22 cDNAs are 94.8% identical. Translation of these cDNAs results in the amino acid sequences for mHSP22 and rHSP22 as shown in Fig. 1 D. hHSP22 and mHSP22 share 94.4% sequence identity, with 11 different amino acid residues, whereas the rodent sequences share 98.5% identity, with 3 different amino acid residues. The fact that HSP22 was identified by two-hybrid screening using3DhHSP27 as bait raised the question of whether it interacts preferentially with this form of the protein or if it also interacts with wthHSP27. This question was addressed in a two-hybrid experiment comparingwthHSP27 and 3DhHSP27 for their ability"
https://openalex.org/W1615063671,"One of the ways that we perceive shape is through seeing motion. Visual motion may be actively generated (for example, in locomotion), or passively observed. In the study of the perception of three-dimensional structure from motion, the non-moving, passive observer in an environment of moving rigid objects has been used as a substitute for an active observer moving in an environment of stationary objects; this 'rigidity hypothesis' has played a central role in computational and experimental studies of structure from motion. Here we show that this is not an adequate substitution because active and passive observers can perceive three-dimensional structure differently, despite experiencing the same visual stimulus: active observers' perception of three-dimensional structure depends on extraretinal information about their own movements. The visual system thus treats objects that are stationary (in an allocentric, earth-fixed reference frame) differently from objects that are merely rigid. These results show that action makes an important contribution to depth perception, and argue for a revision of the rigidity hypothesis to incorporate the special case of stationary objects."

The heat released during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule varies depending on whether or not a Ca2+ gradient is formed across the vesicle membrane. After Ca2+accumulation, a part of the Ca2+-ATPase activity is not coupled with Ca2+ transport (Yu, X., and Inesi, G. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4361–4367). I now show that both the heat produced during substrate hydrolysis and the uncoupled ATPase activity vary depending on the ADP/ATP ratio in the medium. With a low ratio, the Ca2+ transport is exothermic, and the formation of the gradient increases the amount of heat produced during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule cleaved. With a high ADP/ATP ratio, the Ca2+ transport is endothermic, and formation of a gradient increased the amount of heat absorbed from the medium. Heat is absorbed from the medium when the Ca2+ efflux is coupled with the synthesis of ATP (5.7 kcal/mol of ATP). When there is no ATP synthesis, the Ca2+ efflux is exothermic (14–16 kcal/Ca2+mol). It is concluded that in the presence of a low ADP concentration the uncoupled ATPase activity is the dominant route of heat production.

The biological preparation used was vesicles derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit white skeletal muscle. These vesicles retain a membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase, which is able to interconvert different forms of energy. During Ca2+ transport, the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is used by the ATPase to pump Ca2+ across the vesicle membrane, leading to the formation of a transmembrane Ca2+ gradient (see reactions 1–6 forward in Figs. 1 and 2). In this process, chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is converted into osmotic energy. After Ca2+ accumulation, the catalytic cycle of the enzyme can be reversed, and the accumulated Ca2+ leaves the vesicles through the Ca2+-ATPase synthesizing ATP from ADP and Pi (read reactions 6 to 1 backward in Figs. 1 and 2). During synthesis, osmotic energy is converted back into chemical energy (1Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2de Meis L. Vianna A.L.

In the steady state, the Ca2+ concentrations inside the vesicles and in the assay medium remain constant, but the ATPase operates simultaneously forward (ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+uptake) and backwards (Ca2+ efflux and ATP synthesis), and chemical and osmotic energy are continuously interconverted by the ATPase.Figure 2The catalytic cycle of the Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of a transmembrane Ca2+ concentration gradient. The characteristics of the enzyme forms E 1 andE 2 are the same as those of Fig. 1. This sequence is observed when the Ca2+ concentration on the outer surface of the membrane is inferior to 50 μm and the concentration in the vesicle lumen is higher than 1 mm. The high intravesicular Ca2+ concentration permits the reversing of reactions 4 and 3. As a result, the catalytic cycle can be reversed, leading to ATP synthesis and Ca2+ efflux (reactions 5 to 1 backwards). The uncoupled Ca2+ efflux is mediated by reactions 7–9 flowing forward. The uncoupled ATPase activity is mediated by reaction 10 (10–15).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The catalytic cycle of the ATPase varies depending on the Ca2+ concentration in the vesicle lumen.

The enzyme cycles through two more sets of intermediary reaction when intact vesicles are used, and the Ca2+concentration inside the vesicles rises to the millimolar range (see Fig. 2). These are ramifications of the catalytic cycle and are denoted as dashed lines in Fig. 2. In one of them, a part of the Ca2+ accumulated by the vesicles leaks through the enzyme without catalyzing the synthesis of ATP. This is referred to as uncoupled Ca2+ efflux and is represented by reactions 7–9 in Fig. 2 (11Gould G.W. McWhirter J.M. Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) observed that the progressive rise in the luminal Ca2+ concentrations promotes another ramification of the catalytic cycle sequence leading to ATP hydrolysis without Ca2+ translocation. According to these authors, the uncoupled ATP hydrolysis is derived from the cleavage of the phosphoenzyme form 2Ca:E 1∼P (reaction 10 in Fig. 2). In recent reports (16de Meis L. Bianconi M.L. Suzano V.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17de Meis L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1738-C1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mitidieri F. de Meis L. J.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it was shown that chemical and osmotic energy are not the only two forms of energy interconverted by the ATPase. During the steady state, a fraction of both chemical and osmotic energy is converted by the ATPase into heat. The total amount of energy released during ATP hydrolysis is always the same, but the fraction of the total energy that is converted into either chemical or osmotic energy or heat seems to be modulated by the ATPase. The main experimental finding that led to this conclusion was that the amount of heat released during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule varies depending on whether or not a transmembrane gradient is formed across the vesicle membrane. In the absence of a Ca2+ gradient (leaky vesicles; see Fig. 1) between 10 and 12 kcal are released for each mol of ATP cleaved, and in the presence of a Ca2+gradient (intact vesicles; see Fig. 2) the amount of heat released increases to the range of 20–24 kcal/mol of ATP cleaved. At present, it is not clear why the amount of heat produced during the hydrolysis of each ATP molecule increases after Ca2+ accumulation. One of the catalytic routes involved in heat production seems to be the uncoupled Ca2+ efflux (20de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this case, the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is first converted into osmotic energy (reactions 1–4 in Fig. 2), and then during the uncoupled Ca2+ efflux (reactions 7–9), osmotic energy is converted into heat. This work now raises the possibility that the uncoupled ATP hydrolysis discovered by Yu and Inesi (10Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) may represent a second route of heat production. If the hydrolysis of ATP is completed before Ca2+ translocation through the membrane (reaction 10 in Fig. 2), then there is no conversion of chemical into osmotic energy, and during catalysis more chemical energy should be left available to be converted into heat. In order to test this hypothesis, I measured the rates of uncoupled Ca2+ efflux and uncoupled ATP hydrolysis in the presence of different ADP concentrations. It is known (3de Meis L. Bittar E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum: Transport and Energy Transduction. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar, 4Tanford C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 17: 123-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Ebashi S. Lipmann F. J. Cell Biol. 1962; 14: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) that reaction 2 in Fig. 2 is highly reversible (K eq ≅ 1). Therefore, during catalysis, the fraction of enzyme that accumulates in the form 2Ca:E 1∼P depends on the ratio between the ADP and ATP concentrations available in the medium. While ATP phosphorylates the enzyme form 2Ca:E 1 (reaction 2 forward), ADP drives the reversal of the reaction converting 2Ca:E 1∼P back to 2Ca:E 1. The rise in the intravesicular Ca2+ concentration promotes inhibition of the ATPase activity and an increase in the steady state level of the enzyme form 2Ca:E 1∼P. This is referred to in the bibliography as back inhibition (1Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 23-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3de Meis L. Bittar E. The Sarcoplasmic Reticulum: Transport and Energy Transduction. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981Google Scholar, 4Tanford C. CRC Crit. Rev.

Chem. 1964; 14: 169-222Google Scholar), and it is the increase of 2Ca:E 1∼P level noted during the back inhibition that promotes the uncoupled ATP hydrolysis through reactions 2 and 10 in Fig. 2 (10Yu X. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4361-4367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Fortea M.I. Soler F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12521-12529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because reaction 2 is highly reversible, it should be expected that an increase of the ADP concentration in the medium should prevent the accumulation of 2Ca:E 1∼P, and if in fact the uncoupled ATP hydrolysis proceeds through reaction 10 (10, 15) and if this cleavage produces more heat than the coupled ATP hydrolysis (reactions 3–5 in Figs. 1 and 2) as I hypothesize, then both the uncoupled ATP hydrolysis and the amount of heat produced during the cleavage of each ATP molecule should decrease in the presence of a high ADP concentrations. This working hypothesis was tested in this report using different ATP-regenerating systems. These were derived from the longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit hind leg white skeletal muscle and were prepared as previously described (22Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The vesicles were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. The efflux of Ca2+ measured with these vesicles was not altered by ryanodine, indicating that they did not contain significant amounts of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ channels. The vesicles also did not exhibit the phenomenon of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release found in the heavy fraction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (13Inesi G. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5929-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Vesicles were preloaded with either 40Ca2+ or45Ca2+ using different assay media as described in the figure legends for Figs. 3 to 10. After 30–40 min of incubation at 35 °C, the vesicles were centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 40 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was kept in ice and resuspended before starting the experiment in a small volume of the loading mixture to reach the final vesicle concentration of 1.0–1.5 mg of protein/ml. The vesicles loaded with45Ca2+ were used for measurement of Ca2+ efflux, and the vesicles loaded with40Ca2+ were used for calorimetric measurements and for measurement of ATP synthesis from ADP and32Pi.Figure 10Uncoupled Ca2+ efflux (A) and heat release (B).

Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For45Ca uptake, trace amounts of 45Ca were included in the assay medium. For 45Ca efflux, vesicles previously loaded with 45Ca were used. The reaction was arrested by filtering samples of the assay medium in Millipore filters. After filtration, the filters were washed five times with 5 ml of 3 mm La(NO3)3, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. For the Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange the assay medium was divided in two samples. Trace amounts of 45Ca2+ were added to only one of the samples, and the reaction was started by the simultaneous addition of vesicles to the two media. The sample containing the radioactive Ca2+ was used to determine the incubation time where the vesicles were filled and the steady state of45Ca2+ uptake was reached. The rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange was measured after that steady state was reached by adding a trace amount of 45Ca2+ to the second sample containing vesicles loaded with nonradioactive Ca2+. The exchange of the radioactive Ca2+ from the medium with the nonradioactive Ca2+ contained inside the vesicles was measured by filtering samples of the assay medium in Millipore filters 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 120 s after the addition of45Ca2+. These were assayed using either a colorimetric method or by measuring the release of 32Pi from either [γ-32P]ATP, [32P]Glc-6-P, or [1-32P]Fru-1,6-P (24de Meis L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Monteiro-Lomeli M. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1829-1883PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ramos R.C.S. de Meis L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The32Pi produced was extracted from the medium with ammonium molybdate and a mixture of isobutyl alcohol and benzene. When the colorimetric method was used, Pi was not included in the assay medium. In the various experimental conditions used, the same results were obtained with either the colorimetric method or with the use of radioactive substrate, regardless of the ATP concentrations and ATP-regenerating system used. The values of ATPase activity shown in the figures and tables are the Ca2+-dependent activity responsible for Ca2+ transport. The Mg2+-dependent activity was measured in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. The Ca2+-dependent activity was determined by subtracting the Mg2+-dependent activity from the activity measured in the presence of both Mg2+ and Ca2+. In the different experimental conditions used, the Mg2+-dependent activity represented 2–10% of the total activity measured. This was measured using32Pi as previously described (24de Meis L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This were measured using an OMEGA Isothermal Titration Calorimeter from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA) (16de Meis L.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The calorimeter cell (1.5 ml) was filled with reaction medium, and the reference cell was filled with Milli-Q water. After equilibration at 35 °C, the reaction was started by injecting vesicles into the reaction cell, and the heat change during either Ca2+ uptake or Ca2+ efflux was recorded for 20–30 min. The volume of vesicle suspension injected in the cell varied between 0.02 and 0.03 ml. The heat change measured during the initial 2 min after vesicle injection was discarded in order to avoid artifacts such as the heat derived from the dilution of the medium containing the loaded vesicles into the efflux medium and the binding of ions to the Ca2+-ATPase. The duration of these events is less than 1 min. The calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH cal) was calculated by dividing the amount of heat released by the amount of either substrate hydrolyzed or Ca2+ released by the vesicles. The units used were moles for substrate hydrolyzed and Ca2+ released and kcal for the heat released. A negative value indicates that the reaction is exothermic, and a positive value indicates that it is endothermic. All experiments were performed at 35 °C. In a typical experiment, the assay medium was divided into five samples, which were used for the simultaneous measurement of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange, substrate hydrolysis, ATP synthesis, and heat release. The syringe of the calorimeter was filled with the vesicles, and the temperature difference between the syringe and the reaction cell of the calorimeter was allowed to equilibrate, a process that usually took between 8 and 12 min. After equilibration, the reaction was started by injecting the vesicles into the reaction cell. During equilibration, the vesicles used for measurements of Ca2+ uptake, Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+out exchange, ATP hydrolysis, and ATP synthesis were kept at the same temperature, length of time, and protein dilution as the vesicles kept in the calorimeter syringe. The different reactions were started simultaneously using either empty vesicles or Ca2+-loaded vesicles. For the experiments where the unidirectional Ca2+ efflux was measured, the heat released during the efflux was corrected for the heat derived from both the binding of Ca2+ to EGTA and the heat derived from the formation of Glc-6-P from ATP and glucose as previously described (20de Meis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NaN3, an inhibitor of ATP synthase, and P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′) pentaphosphate, a specific inhibitor of adenylate kinase, were added to the assay medium in order to avoid interference from possible contamination of the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with these enzymes. The free Ca2+ concentration in the medium was calculated using the association constants of Schwartzenbach et al. (27Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helvetia Chimica Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar) in a computer program described by Fabiato and Fabiato (28Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. ( Paris ). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Sorenson et al. (29Sorenson M.M. Coelho H.S.L. Reuben J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A large excess of pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, or phosphofructokinase was used in order to assure that ATP was regenerated at a faster rate than it was cleaved by the Ca2+-ATPase. In control experiments, the rates of substrate hydrolysis and Ca2+ uptake were measured in the presence of different concentrations of the ATP-regenerating enzymes, and the concentration of enzyme used in all experiments described was 5–10 times higher than that needed for maximal activity (25Monteiro-Lomeli M. de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1829-1883PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ramos R.C.S. de Meis L. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Most of the measurements performed in this work were made after the Ca2+ uptake reached the steady state. When the vesicles are still being filled, the rate of Ca2+ uptake measured represents a balance between the Ca2+ pumped inside the vesicles by the ATPase and the rate of Ca2+ that leaves the vesicles driven by the gradient formed across the membrane. During the initial minutes of incubation, these two rates are different and cannot be measured separately. Thus, the stoichiometry between the fluxes of Ca2+ through the membrane and the rates of either ATP cleavage or ATP synthesis cannot be evaluated with precision. After the steady state is reached, the rate of efflux is the same as that of Ca2+ uptake, and by measuring the rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange it is possible to determine the value of the two rates. The exchange represents the fraction of Ca2+ that leaves the vesicles and is pumped back inside the vesicles by the ATPase. The initial velocities of Ca2+ uptake measured with 1 mm ATP and 50 μm ATP plus PEP as the ATP-regenerating system were the same (see Fig. 3A). However, when the steady state was reached, the amount of Ca2+ retained by the vesicles with PEP was larger than that accumulated with 1 mm ATP. In six experiments, the steady state levels of Ca2+ uptake were 3.90 ± 0.25 μmol/mg with PEP and 2.73 ± 0.07 μmol/mg with 1 mm ATP. These values are the mean ± S.E. The rate of Ca2+in ⇔ Ca2+outexchange measured in the presence of PEP was slower than that measured with 1 mm ATP and no ATP-regenerating system (TableI). The time course of ATP hydrolysis was found to vary depending on the condition used. With the use of PEP, the rate of hydrolysis did not vary with the incubation interval, being practically the same before and after the steady state of Ca2+ uptake was reached. With 1 mm ATP, however, a significant decrease in the ATPase activity was detected after the vesicles were filled with Ca2+ (see Fig.3B). This difference was probably related to the accumulation of ADP in the medium during the course of the reaction that drives reaction 2 in Fig. 2 backwards (1Hasselbach W. Biochim. Biophys.

In the incubation interval of 10–40 min (see Fig. 3), 15–40% of the ATP added was cleaved (i.e. the ADP concentration rose from 0.15 to 0.40 mm), being therefore sufficient to promote the reversal of reaction 2 shown in Fig. 2.

These results emphasize the modular character of the rapsyn structural domains. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor tetratricopeptide repeat human Son of Sevenless polymerase chain reaction monoclonal antibody green fluorescent protein Rapsyn, a 43-kDa peripheral membrane protein expressed in skeletal muscle, plays a critical role in organizing the structure of the nicotinic postsynaptic membrane (for review, see Ref. 1Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). Rapsyn is colocalized with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)1 in the postsynaptic membrane from the earliest stages of innervation (2Noakes P.G. Phillips W.D. Hanley T.A. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and this precise colocalization is a characteristic feature of the adult neuromuscular junction (3Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 163-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In rapsyn(−/−) mutant mice, which die at birth because of a failure of neuromuscular transmission, nAChRs are expressed by the subsynaptic nuclei and targeted to the postsynaptic plasma membrane, but they are not clustered (4Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). These mice are characterized by a general disorganization of the postsynaptic membrane, as utrophin (a cytoskeletal protein that is normally colocalized with nAChRs) and β-dystroglycan (the transmembrane protein that binds utrophin) are no longer enriched in the postsynaptic membrane. Biochemical studies using nAChR-rich membranes from Torpedo electric organ indicate that rapsyn can be cross-linked to the nAChR β-subunit (5Burden S.J. DePalma R.L. Gottesman G.S. Cell. 1983; 35: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and bind to the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan (6Cartaud A. Coutant S. Petrucci T.C. Cartaud J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11321-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When expressed in non-muscle cells, rapsyn forms membrane-associated clusters and recruits nAChRs to these clusters (7Froehner S.C. Luetje C.W. Scotland P.B. Patrick J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Phillips W. Kopta C. Blount P. Gardner P. Steinbach J.-H. Merlie J. Science. 1991; 251: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The nAChR domain necessary for this interaction has been located within a region of primary structure between the M3 and M4 hydrophobic segments, which is known to be exposed at the cytoplasmic aspect of the nAChR (9Maimone M.M. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1993; 11: 53-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10Maimone M.M. Enigk R.E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 340-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In non-muscle cells, rapsyn can also cluster β-dystroglycan (11Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, rapsyn may function as a direct link between nAChRs and the dystrophin/utrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (12Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13Winder S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 118-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) that extends from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton. Although the three-dimensional structure of rapsyn is not known, its primary structure suggests the presence of distinct structural domains: a myristoylated amino terminus (14Frail D.E. McLaughlin L.L. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as many as eight tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) within rapsyn6–319 (15Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), a coiled-coil domain (rapsyn298–331) (16Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a cysteine-rich domain (rapsyn363–402) predicted to be a RING-H2 domain (17Ponting C.C.P. Phillips C. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C (rapsyn403–406). Previously, in studies of rapsyn and rapsyn mutants expressed transiently in 293T cells along with nAChRs, we identified the rapsyn structural domains involved in its membrane targeting, self-association, and nAChR-clustering properties (16Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Ramarao M.K. Bianchetta M.J. Lanken J. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7475-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Rapsyn plasma membrane targeting requires amino-terminal fatty acylation, whereas rapsyn self-association requires at least two TPRs. Rapsyn clustering of nAChRs depends upon the presence of the putative coiled-coil domain within rapsyn, and a construct containing as few as 3 TPRs and the coiled-coil domain was sufficient for nAChR clustering. Deletion of the rapsyn coiled-coil domain prevented rapsyn clustering of nAChRs. These studies clearly established that neither the rapsyn RING-H2 domain nor the adjacent phosphorylation sites were necessary for membrane targeting, self-association, or nAChR clustering. We report here a further analysis of rapsyn functional domains using a yeast two-hybrid assay as well as additional studies of rapsyn mutants expressed in 293T cells. To test for interactions at the plasma membrane between rapsyn structural domains and rapsyn-associated proteins, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay (19Aronheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) that depends upon the recruitment of human Son of Sevenless (hSos) to the plasma membrane to rescue Ras-mediated signal transduction. We tested for interactions between rapsyn domains fused to hSos and candidate protein domains anchored in the plasma membrane by fusion with theN-myristoylated v-Src amino terminus. With this assay we looked for interactions within rapsyn and for interactions of the rapsyn domains with the membrane-anchored cytoplasmic domain of the nAChR β-subunit or of β-dystroglycan. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase and oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out in 100 μl using 20 ng of the templates described below, 50–100 pmol of each primer, 250 μm each dNTP, and 5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. All constructs were tested both by restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing across the full length of the inserted fragments. Yeastcdc25H Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the vectors pSos and pMyr were purchased from Stratagene. The vector p5′Sos (19Aronheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr A. Aronheim (Technion, Haifa, Israel). The plasmids pCDNA3-dystroglycan (mouse) and pCDNA3-dystroglycan (rabbit) were provided by Drs. S. Carbonetto (McGill University) and K. P. Campbell (University of Iowa), respectively. Human Sos was fused at its COOH terminus to full-length rapsyn (Sos-rapsyn1–412), to the rapsyn RING-H2 domain (Sos-rapsyn361–412), and to the rapsyn coiled-coil domain (Sos-rapsyn298–333). For Sos-rapsyn1–412 the primers GCCACCATGCGGCCGC ACCAGACAA and GGAAACCCAAGGCGGCCGCTGAAG (nucleotides in bold are mismatched to create the underlined NotI site) were used along with the template pGL-rapsyn1–412 (16Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in a PCR to amplify rapsyn amino acids 1–412. The PCR product was digested withNotI, and the fragment containing the rapsyn sequence was cloned into pSos vector linearized with NotI. For Sos-rapsyn361–412, the primers GTGGAGGAGACTGGGATCC ACTGCGGCCTC and AGATGGCCGCTGAGCTCACACAAAGCCCGG (nucleotides in bold are mismatched to create the underlinedBamHI and SacI sites) were used with the same template to amplify rapsyn amino acids 361–412. For Sos-rapsyn298–333 the primers CAAGTGCTGGATCC CCCGGAAGG and GCGGTAGATGAGCTCACTCAGG also containingBamHI and SacI sites were used along with the template to amplify rapsyn amino acids 298–333. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and SacI, and the fragments containing the rapsyn sequences were cloned into the pSos vector. Rapsyn domains lacking the rapsynN-myristoylation consensus sequence were fused at the NH2 terminus of human Sos in rapsyn1–360-Sos, which lacks the RING-H2 domain, and in rapsyn1–287-Sos, encoding the first seven TPRs of rapsyn. For rapsyn1–360-Sos the primers GATCCCAAGCTTACCATGGAGATCATGGCGCAGGACCAGAC and GAGGATCCTCACCCGGGAGTCTCCTCCAGCACTC (underlined are theHindIII and XmaI sites) were used along with the template pGL-rapsyn1–412G2A-GFP (which encodes a rapsyn Gly2Ala mutation (16Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)) in a PCR to amplify rapsyn amino acids 1–360. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega), the plasmid was digested with HindIII and XmaI, and the fragment containing rapsyn was subcloned into the p5′Sos vector. To make rapsyn1–287-Sos, rapsyn1–360-Sos was digested with PmlI and SmaI, and the vector fragment was religated. Rapsyn domains were targeted to the plasma membrane by fusion with the amino terminus of v-Src (MGSSKSKPKDPSQRRSREF), which contains the NH2-terminal myristoylation and membrane-targeting sequences. For Myr-rapsyn5–412 the cDNA encoding full-length rapsyn1–412 was excised with EcoRI from the pSLAN-rapsyn vector 2M. Bartoli, unpublished information. and then inserted into the pMyr vector linearized by EcoRI. Due to the restriction site used in the pSLAN-rapsyn vector, the first four amino acids of rapsyn (MGQD) were replaced by the sequence KRPH. Myr-rapsyn5–412 was digested with NotI andSacI, and the vector fragment was blunted and then religated to create Myr-rapsyn360–412 containing the rapsyn RING-H2 domain. Myr-rapsyn5–412 was digested with SacI and XhoI, and the vector fragment was blunted and then religated to form Myr-rapsyn5–360, which lacks the RING-H2 domain. This construct encodes amino acids of the nAChR β subunit between the M3 and M4 hydrophobic segments fused to the v-Src amino terminus. The primers TCAACCCTGCATGAATTCTCACCCCACACC and GAATGTCCACAGCTCGAGACGGTCCACAAC (underlined are theBamHI and XhoI sites) were used to amplify nAChR β subunit amino acid sequence 336–469. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-easy, the plasmid was digested with BamHI andXhoI, and the fragment containing the nAChR β-subunit sequence was subcloned into the pMyr vector. This construct encodes the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan fused at the amino terminus of hSOS. The primers GATCCCAAGCTTACCATGGAGATCTATCGC and GAGGATCCTCACCCGGGAGGGGGAACATACGGAGG (underlined are theHindIII and XmaI sites) were used along with the template pCDNA3-dystroglycan (mouse) in a PCR to amplify β-dystroglycan amino acids 776–893. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM T-easy, the plasmid was digested with HindIII andXmaI, and the fragment containing β-dystroglycan was subcloned into the p5′Sos vector. β-Dystroglycan domains were targeted to the plasma membrane by the v-Src NH2-terminal membrane-targeting sequence. Myr-dystroglycan778–893 encodes the complete cytoplasmic domain, whereas Myr-dystroglycan778–814 encodes the proximal, and Myr-dystroglycan813–893 encodes the distal cytoplasmic domain. For Myr-dystroglycan778–893, primers U (AGCTAAGCTTATCCGCAAGATGGGGAAGGG) and B (TCGACCCGGGAAGGGGAACATACGG) were used to amplify dystroglycan amino acids 778–893 (the HindIII andXmaI sites are underlined). For Myr-dystroglycan778–814 we used the primer U and the primer TCGACCCGGGCGGCATGCTGGAAGAGGG (the XmaI site is underlined) to amplify dystroglycan amino acids 778–814. For Myr β-dystroglycan813–893 we used the primer CGTAAGCTTTTCCAGCAATGGGGCTCATCTTG (the HindIII site is underlined) and primer B to amplify dystroglycan amino acids 813–893. The PCR products were cloned in pGEM T-easy, the resulting plasmids were digested with HindIII andXmaI, and the fragments containing β-dystroglycan were subcloned into pMyr vector. pGL-rapsyn (16Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was digested with eitherBstUI (for 1–90; includes N-Myr-TPRs1+2), EcoRV (for 1–254; includes N-Myr-TPRs1–6), or PmlI (for 1–287; includes N-Myr-TPRs1–7) andNotI. The vector fragment was isolated in each case and ligated with the BsaAI-NotI fragment of rapsyn, which encodes rapsyn 351–411 containing the RING-H2 domain. All media were made as described (19Aronheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) with reagents from Bio 101. The yeast strain cdc25H was cotransfected with 1 μg of each plasmid using the alkali-cation yeast kit from Bio 101. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of SOC medium and plated on glucose minimal medium lacking leucine and uracil. To test for protein interactions, yeast cells were picked and spotted onto plates containing glucose or galactose and incubated for 4 days at 25 or 37 °C. Plates were scanned to obtain digitized images. For colonies where no growth on galactose was seen after 4 days at 37 °C, no growth was observed after incubation for several days longer. Transfection of 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method, cell staining, and immunofluorescence experiments were done as described (18Ramarao M.K. Bianchetta M.J. Lanken J. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7475-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), except that after fixation, the cells were usually permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked with blocking buffer for 30 min before incubation with the primary antibody. Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope with a Nikon 100X Plan Fluor objective (NA1.3). Images were acquired with a Micromax CH250 CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) using MetaMorph software. Rapsyn or its fragments were visualized by the binding of either anti-rapsyn (1–16), an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal 16 amino acids of rapsyn (non-myristoylated) (at 2 μg/ml), or mouse monoclonal mAb 22F10 (20Carr C. Fischbach G.D. Cohen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (1:1000 dilution of ascites), followed by the appropriate ALEXATM488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:300 dilution, Molecular Probes). mAb 22F10 was prepared by using Torpedo rapsyn as immunogen. Based upon epitope-mapping studies mAb 22F10 recognizes N-myristoylated rapsyn amino acids 1–11 with >1000-fold greater affinity than the non-myristoylated peptide. 3J. Cohen, unpublished data. The distribution of dystroglycan was visualized by binding to one of the antibodies listed below followed by the appropriate ALEXATM594- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody. 1) Affinity-purified sheep polyclonal FP-B directed against a bacterial expressed fusion protein encoding amino acids 367–863 of rabbit α/β-dystroglycan (Ref. 21Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar; a gift from Dr. K. P. Campbell) was used at a dilution of 1:10 to visualize transfected dystroglycan in 293T cells that were fixed and permeabilized. No fluorescence signal was seen in transfected cells without permeabilization or in non-transfected cells. 2) Mouse monoclonal NCL-b-DG (1:100 dilution of hybridoma supernatant, Novocastra Laboratories) was raised against the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids of human β-dystroglycan. 3) Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody P-20 (4 μg/ml, a gift from Dr. T. Petrucci, Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy) was directed against the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids of β-dystroglycan (22Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 4) Anti-α-dystroglycan mouse monoclonal mAb 1B7 (1:100 dilution of ascites, a gift from Dr. S. Carbonetto) was raised against a 33-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to mouse dystroglycan amino acids 572–604 at the α-dystroglycan COOH terminus (23Moukhles H. Roque R. Carbonetto S. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 420: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 5) Anti-α-dystroglycan mouse monoclonal antibody IIH6 (Ref. 21Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar; IgM, a gift from Dr. K. P. Campbell) was used undiluted or at a dilution 1:5 of hybridoma supernatant. Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at a 1:300 dilution. Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (1:200 dilution, Chemicon) was used to detect mAb IIH6. For experiments involving expression of rapsyn or its mutants and dystroglycan in 293T cells, quantification of dystroglycan clusters relative to rapsyn clusters was done as follows. In each experiment, 100 cells positive for both rapsyn and dystroglycan expression were identified. For these we quantified the number of cells with dystroglycan that colocalized with rapsyn clusters. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, cells were scored as above, and the results are presented as the % of cells with (or without) clustered dystroglycan. To provide a further analysis of the properties of the rapsyn structural domains, we wanted to identify the binding properties of the individual domains, and we were particularly interested in identifying proteins interacting with the RING-H2 domain. However, we were concerned that RING domains often have a strong tendency to aggregate (24Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 25Borden K.L.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 26Kentsis A. Borden K.L.B. Curr. Pept. Prot. Sci. 2000; 1: 49-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and some self-activate when tested in transcription factor yeast two-hybrid assays (27Okumoto K. Abe I. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25700-25710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As an alternative, we tested for the interactions of rapsyn domains with potential partners by use of a yeast two-hybrid assay that identifies protein interactions at the plasma membrane (19Aronheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The assay takes advantage of a yeast strain that is temperature-sensitive for the Ras exchange factor cdc25. At the permissive temperature of 25 °C, the temperature-sensitive mutantcdc25H is functional, and the yeast grow well, but at 37 °C, cdc25H is nonfunctional, and the yeast fail to grow. The expression of hSos, the mammalian homologue of cdc25, is able to complement the cdc25 mutation only if it can be localized to the plasma membrane. hSos membrane localization can be accomplished if it is expressed as a hybrid protein fused to a bait protein that interacts with a partner which is localized at the plasma membrane. Localization of the partner to the plasma membrane is achieved by fusing it to the myristoylated amino terminus of v-Src. The expression of the partner is driven by the Gal1 promoter, which is induced by galactose. When the bait and the partner are both expressed and interact, the Ras-signaling pathway is rescued, allowing the growth of yeast at 37 °C on plates containing galactose. Fig.1 presents the results obtained using individual domains of rapsyn fused with hSos as bait and full-length rapsyn or the cytoplasmic domain of the nAChR β-subunit or β-dystroglycan as target. As negative controls each construct tested was cotransfected with either a myristoylated transcription factor (Myr-MafB) or hSos alone, and no growth at 37 °C was seen with any construct. Based upon the growth seen under selective conditions, Myr-rapsyn5–412 interacted with Sos-rapsyn1–412, rapsyn1–360-Sos, and rapsyn1–287-Sos but not with Sos-rapsyn298–333 or Sos-rapsyn361–412 (Fig.1, third row). These data indicate that the rapsyn TPR domain (rapsyn1–287) can associate with full-length rapsyn, whereas the coiled-coil domain or the RING-H2 domain cannot. Although the RING-H2 and coiled-coil domains did not interact with rapsyn, they were each able to interact with domains of other proteins (see below). Sos-rapsyn298–333 containing only the rapsyn coiled-coil domain interacted with Myr-nAChR β336–469, the membrane-targeted β-subunit cytoplasmic domain. This interaction of the nAChR cytoplasmic domain with the rapsyn coiled-coil domain was very selective, because it also only interacted with rapsyn constructs containing the coiled-coil domain (Sos-rapsyn1–412 and rapsyn1–360-Sos) but not with rapsyn1–287-Sos (comprising TPR 1–7) or with Sos-rapsyn361–412, containing the RING-H2 domain (Fig. 1, second row). Sos-rapsyn361–412, interacted with Myr-dystroglycan778–893, containing the full COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan, and Myr-dystroglycan778–893 interacted with full-length rapsyn (Sos-rapsyn1–412) but not with rapsyn constructs lacking the RING-H2 domain (rapsyn1–360-Sos, rapsyn1–287-Sos, or Sos-rapsyn298–333) (Fig.1, first row). These results indicate that the rapsyn RING-H2 domain is directly involved in the interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan and that neither the TPR domain nor the coiled-coil domain of rapsyn can bind to the β-dystroglycan cytoplasmic domain. To confirm these results, we determined that not only can β-dystroglycan recruit rapsyn or its RING-H2 domain to the plasma membrane but that membrane associated domains of rapsyn containing the RING-H2 domain can also recruit the β-dystroglycan cytoplasmic domain to the plasma membrane (Fig.2A). Dystroglycan776–893-Sos was able to interact only with the RING-H2 domain (Myr-rapsyn360–412) or full-length rapsyn (Myr-rapsyn5–412) but not with Myr-rapsyn5–360. To further define the region within the β-dystroglycan cytoplasmic domain that was involved in binding the rapsyn RING-H2 domain, we tested for interactions between rapsyn domains fused with Sos and Myr-β-dystroglycan778–814, which encodes the membrane proximal domain, or Myr-β-dystroglycan813–893, encoding the membrane distal domain (Fig. 2 B). Myr-dystroglycan778–814 interacted with the rapsyn RING-H2 domain (Sos-rapsyn361–412) as well as with full-length rapsyn (Sos-rapsyn5–412) but not with rapsyn1–360-Sos, which lacks the RING-H2 domain. In contrast, Myr-dystroglycan813–893 did not interact with full-length rapsyn or with rapsyn1–360-Sos, but when expressed with the Sos-RING-H2 domain there was evidence of limited yeast growth at 37 °C. When expressed in QT-6 fibroblasts, dystroglycan is distributed uniformly at the cell surface, but when co-expressed with rapsyn, dystroglycan is colocalized with clustered rapsyn (11Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We wanted to identify the rapsyn domains required to recruit dystroglycan to rapsyn clusters. We initially planned to express rapsyn-GFP constructs (16Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Ramarao M.K. Bianchetta M.J. Lanken J. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7475-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with dystroglycan in 293T cells and visualize the expressed rapsyn domains by the fluorescence of GFP and dystroglycan by the binding of appropriate antibodies. We were surprised to find, however, that rapsyn-GFP was not able to cluster dystroglycan (data not shown) and that even with full-length rapsyn, the clustering of dystroglycan could be seen only with one of the five dystroglycan antibodies tested, the FP-B polyclonal antibody that had been used in previous studies of dystroglycan clustering (11Apel E.D. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For cells coexpressing rapsyn and dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan appeared diffusely distributed at the cell surface and not associated with rapsyn clusters when visualized by a monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3,a and b) or polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3,c and d) directed against the β-dystroglycan COOH-terminal 15 or 20 amino acids. For both antibodies, β-dystroglycan was detected only in transfected cells, and antibody binding was not seen in fixed, nonpermeabilized cells (data not shown). Similarly, when α-dystroglycan was visualized either by mAb IIH6 (Fig. 3, e and f) or mAb 1B7 (Fig. 3,g and h), α-dystroglycan was distributed diffusely at the surface and was not associated with rapsyn clusters. For these antibodies, staining was also seen in nonpermeabilized, transfected cells (data not shown). For these four antibodies, dystroglycan immunostaining associated with rapsyn clusters was seen in less than 1% of cells expressing both proteins. Dystroglycan clustering by rapsyn was readily apparent in >95% of cells expressing both proteins when the transfected dystroglycan was detected using the FP-B antibody under permeabilized conditions (Fig.3, i (rapsyn) and j (dystroglycan)). For 293T cells transfected with dystroglycan in the absence of rapsyn, dystroglycan was distributed diffusely at the cell surface as seen with the other α- or β-dystroglycan antibodies, and for cells transfected with rapsyn only but incubated after permeabilization with FP-B antibody and fluorescent secondary antibody, no fluorescence above background was seen (data not shown). In additional experiments, when rapsyn and dystroglycan were coexpressed in QT-6 fibroblasts and dystroglycan was visualized by the FP-B antibody, it was clustered with rapsyn. When dystroglycan was visualized by the other antibodies, the staining was seen to be distributed diff"
https://openalex.org/W2162498826,"Fibrate treatment in mice is known to modulate high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism by regulating apolipoprotein (apo)AI and apoAII gene expression. In addition to alterations in plasma HDL levels, fibrates induce the emergence of large, cholesteryl ester-rich HDL in treated transgenic mice expressing human apoAI (HuAITg). The mechanisms of these changes may not be restricted to the modulation of apolipoprotein gene expression, and the aim of the present study was to determine whether the expression of factors known to affect HDL metabolism (i.e. phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, and hepatic lipase) are modified in fenofibrate-treated mice. Significant rises in plasma PLTP activity were observed after 2 weeks of fenofibrate treatment in both wild-type and HuAITg mice. Simultaneously, hepatic PLTP mRNA levels increased in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast to PLTP, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase mRNA levels in HuAITg mice were not significantly modified by fenofibrate despite a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol esterification activity. Fenofibrate did not induce any change in hepatic lipase activity. Fenofibrate significantly increased HDL size, an effect that was more pronounced in HuAITg mice than in wild-type mice. This effect in wild-type mice was completely abolished in PLTP-deficient mice. Finally, fenofibrate treatment did not influence PLTP activity or hepatic mRNA in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-deficient mice. It is concluded that 1) fenofibrate treatment increases plasma phospholipid transfer activity as the result of up-regulation of PLTP gene expression through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α-dependent mechanism, and 2) increased plasma PLTP levels account for the marked enlargement of HDL in fenofibrate-treated mice.

This finding has generated much interest in elucidating HDL structure, function, and metabolism. To date, the structural heterogeneity of HDL is well established especially in terms of size distribution. This heterogeneity may be of physiopathological relevance with HDL size distribution being more strongly related with the presence of coronary heart disease than absolute HDL levels (1Cheung M.C. Brown B.G. Wolf A.C. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several factors have been reported to influence HDL particles such as lecithin:cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) (2Daerr W.H. Greten H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 710: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), hepatic lipase (HL) (3Newnham H.H. Hopkins G.J. Devlin S. Barter P.J.

Deckert V. Gambert P. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) favors the continuous remodeling of HDL in the blood stream. As shown by in vivo and in vitrostudies, PLTP can modulate the levels, the size, and the composition of HDL (7Tu A.Y. Nishida H.I. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23098-23105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pahlman R. Blomqvist S. Van Tol A. Ehnholm C. J. Biol.

Huang Y. Metso J. Langer C. Pussinen P. Wu S. Ehnholm C. Assmann G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In support of the physiological relevance of the latter observations, increases in αHDL and pre-βHDL were observed in human PLTP and apoAI transgenic mice (11Jiang X. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fibrates constitute a class of frequently used normolipidemic drugs that efficiently decrease triglycerides and increase HDL plasma levels in humans (12Salter A.M. Bugaut M. Saxton J. Fisher S.C. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 13Shepherd J. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 110: S55-S63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). They exert their effect, at least in part, through alterations in transcription of genes encoding for proteins that control lipoprotein metabolism (14Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). Indeed, fibrates activate specific transcription factors termed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a subfamily of the nuclear receptors (15Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Particularly, the PPARα form mediates fibrate action on HDL cholesterol levels via transcriptional induction of the synthesis of the major HDL apolipoproteins, i.e. apoAI and apoAII (16Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar,17Vudac N. Schoojans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In human apoAI transgenic (HuAITg) mice, treatment with fenofibrate led to large increases in human apoAI and HDL cholesterol and large qualitative modifications of HDL with the appearance of large and cholesteryl ester-enriched αHDL (16Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the structural modification of HDL in HuAITg mice treated with fenofibrate are, however, not yet understood. Because HDL structure and metabolism partly depend on a few plasma enzyme and lipid transfer activities, we assumed that fenofibrate may modulate these activities, which would account for the changes in HDL structure. The goals of the present study were to evaluate the effect of fenofibrate on the expression and activity of PLTP, LCAT, and HL. In a second part of the study, the relative contribution of PLTP to the fenofibrate-mediated alterations in HDL size distribution was specifically addressed in PLTP-deficient mice. Finally, because PPARα has been shown to mediate the effects of fenofibrate on several genes, we sought to test the hypothesis that PPARα is involved in the observed changes using PPARα-deficient mice. Mice used in this study were nontransgenic C57BL/6 mice, heterozygous HuAITg mice, PLTP-deficient mice (PLTP−/−) and their wild-type controls (PLTP+/+), and homozygous PPARα-deficient mice (PPARα−/−) and their wild-type controls (PPARα+/+). HuAITg mice contained 21 copies of an 11-kilobase pair human apoAI genomic DNA fragment and the liver-specific enhancer of the human apoAI gene promoter necessary to drive hepatic apoAI expression (18Rubin E.M. Ishida B.Y. Clift S.M. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). PLTP−/− were obtained by deletion of part of the PLTP gene containing exon 2. Because this exon contains the translation initiation codon and the signal peptide, mice were null PLTP animals (19Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). PPARα−/− mice were obtained by disrupting the ligand-binding domain of the PPARα by homologous recombination (20Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 21Peters J.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). 10–12-week-old mice were caged in an animal room with alternating 12-h light (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and dark (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) cycles and were fed either the control or fenofibrate (Sigma) diet ad libitum for 2 weeks. Fenofibrate was mixed in mouse chow at 0.02 and 0.2% (w/diet w), two dosages commonly used in mice (16Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Body weight and food intake of the mice were regularly checked during the treatment period. No toxic side effect of fenofibrate treatment as checked by alterations in body weight was observed. Blood was taken from the retroorbital plexus of the mice after a 2-h fast. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Lipoproteins were purified by sequential ultracentrifugation using a TL 100.4 rotor with a tabletop TL 100 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). HDL was purified between the densities 1.063 and 1.210 g/ml in all animals with the exception of HDL from HuAITg mice treated with the higher dose of fenofibrate (0.2%), which was purified between 1.019 and 1.210 g/ml because analysis of lipoproteins by density gradient ultracentrifugation showed that apoAI-containing lipoproteins fell within these density limits (data not shown). Lipoprotein size was determined by gradient gel electrophoresis (4–20% polyacrylamide gels, Novex gel, Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) under nonreducing conditions. The migration was carried out for 12 h, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and destained with a solution of methanol/acetic acid/water (30:58:12, v/v/v). The gels were then scanned with a densitometer (GS-300 scanning densitometer, Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). The size of lipoproteins was determined from a curve built from standards of known size (high molecular weight standards,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that were migrated simultaneously. PLTP activity was measured in total plasma as the transfer of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine from [14C]phosphatidylcholine liposomes to an excess of exogenous human HDL3 (22Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µmol of [14C]l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.1 µmol of butylated hydroxytoluene were mixed, and the lipids were dried under nitrogen, suspended in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), sonicated, and centrifuged to remove lipid aggregates and metallic debris. Plasma samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with radiolabeled liposomes (50 nmol of phospholipid) and isolated human HDL3 (250 µg of protein) in a final volume of 400 µl with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). At the end of the incubation, liposomes were precipitated with dextran sulfate. The supernatant (0.5 ml) was used for radioactivity determinations. Plasma volumes were chosen to keep PLTP activity in the linear range of the assay. PLTP activity was expressed as micromoles of phosphatidylcholine transferred from liposomes to exogenous human HDL3 per milliliter of plasma. LCAT activity was determined using an exogenous substrate according to the method described by Chen and Albers (23Chen C. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse plasma (50 µl) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a proteoliposome substrate containing apoAI, [14C]cholesterol, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. After incubation, lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates using a solvent system composed of petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (90:10:5, v/v/v). Cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol radioactivity were measured on a PhosphorImager. LCAT activity was expressed as the percentage of free cholesterol esterified during incubation. HL activity was measured according to the method described by Henderson et al. (24Henderson A.D. Richmond W. Elkeles R.S. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in postheparin plasma. Postheparin plasma was obtained 5 min after an intravenous bolus injection of 60 IU of sodium heparin/kg of body weight. Blood was immediately centrifuged at 4 °C and frozen at −80 °C until assay. The assay mixture for HL was prepared with 5 µCi of tri-[1-14C]oleoylglycerol, 5.68 ml of 90 g/liter Arabic gum in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mg of unlabeled triolein, and 2.75 ml of 200 g/liter bovine serum albumin. After sonication, 2.58 ml of 3.24 m NaCl in 0.2 mTris buffer, pH 8.5, was added to the mixture. Triglyceride hydrolysis was started by adding postheparin plasma and allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Triglyceride hydrolysis was stopped by adding 3.25 ml of chloroform/methanol/heptane (50:56:40, v/v/v) and 1 ml of 0.1 m carbonate borate buffer, pH 10.5. Reaction tubes were shaken for 5 min and centrifuged. A 0.5-ml aliquot of the upper phase was removed and counted in a scintillation counter. After correction for recovery, results were expressed in micromoles of fatty acids liberated per milliliter of plasma per hour. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62896) Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridizations were performed as previously described (26Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the cDNA fragments of LCAT (27Staels B. Van Tol A. Skretting G. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 727-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PLTP and 28 S rRNA as probes. PLTP cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-TCG GCG GAG GGT GTG TCC AT-3′ and 5′-CAT GGC AGA GTC AAA GAA GA-3′ (fragment size 477 base pairs). Quantification was performed by phosphorimaging with the Molecular AnalystTM software (Bio-Rad). The relative levels of PLTP and LCAT were determined by normalizing to the level of 28 S rRNA. As expected (16Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), fenofibrate treatment induced marked alterations in the plasma HDL profile in HuAITg mice. As measured by native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, the mean apparent diameter of the most prominent HDL subpopulation rose from 11.7 nm in untreated HuAITg mice toward 15.0 and 18.0 nm in animals treated with 0.02 and 0.2% fenofibrate, respectively (Fig.1). To determine whether the modifications observed in HDL physicochemical characteristics induced by fenofibrate were linked to those of activities of lipoprotein modifying enzymes, we measured PLTP, LCAT, and HL in the plasma of HuAITg mice. PLTP activity measured in treated and nontreated mice is shown in Fig.2 a. Fenofibrate significantly increased PLTP activity in a dose-dependent fashion from 7 µmol/ml/h in nontreated mice to 22 and 37 µmol/ml/h in mice fed with 0.02 and 0.2% fenofibrate, respectively. LCAT activity was measured in the same animals using an exogenous substrate. The low dose of fenofibrate did not significantly modify LCAT activity as compared with controls, whereas enzyme activity was 3-fold lower with the high dose of fenofibrate as compared with the nontreated animals (Fig. 2 a). HL activity measured in postheparin plasma was not modified by fenofibrate treatment (results not shown). Phospholipid transfer and cholesterol esterification activities measured in the present study reflect plasma PLTP and LCAT concentrations, respectively. We thus checked whether the modifications of the enzyme plasma levels induced by fenofibrate were due to changes in their gene expression levels. As shown in Fig.2 b, the levels of hepatic PLTP mRNA significantly rose in a dose-dependent manner in fenofibrate-treated HuAITg mice with approximately 4- and 10-fold increases in PLTP mRNA levels observed in animals treated with 0.02 or 0.2% fenofibrate, respectively. Unlike for the PLTP gene, fenofibrate did not produce significant changes in the levels of LCAT mRNA in the livers of HuAITg treated mice (Fig. 2 b). Given that the expression of both human apoAI and murine PLTP genes are increased concomitantly in HuAITg animals, the contribution of PLTP induction to the fenofibrate-induced changes in HDL size was assessed using nontransgenic mice. In nontreated wild-type C57BL/6 mice, the analysis of HDL size showed a monodisperse population of HDL with a mean apparent diameter of 11.0 nm (Fig.3). As observed in HuAITg mice (see above), fenofibrate treatment of wild-type mice produced a shift of plasma HDL toward the large size range. One new discrete subfraction of 12.9-nm diameter appeared in mice treated with 0.02% fenofibrate, and 13.1-nm-diameter particles became predominant in mice treated with 0.2% fenofibrate. In nontransgenic C57BL/6 mice, fenofibrate significantly increased PLTP activity in a dose-dependent fashion from 5 µmol/ml/h in nontreated mice to 15 and 25 µmol/ml/h in mice fed with the 0.02 and 0.2% doses of fenofibrate, respectively (Fig.4 a). LCAT activity decreased significantly in C57BL/6 mice treated with 0.02% fenofibrate and even to a greater extent at the highest dose tested (0.2%) (Fig.4 a). HL was not significantly modified by treatment with fenofibrate (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 b, the levels of PLTP mRNA in mouse liver rose significantly in a dose-dependent manner in fenofibrate-treated C57BL6 mice as compared with nontreated controls with approximately 7- and 10-fold increases at the 0.02 and 0.2% doses, respectively (Fig. 4 b). Unlike for the PLTP gene, the levels of LCAT mRNA in the liver from C57BL6 mice were only marginally altered after treatment with fenofibrate with approximately 20 and 30% decreases at the 0.02 and 0.2% doses, respectively (Fig.4 b). Because fenofibrate exerts a marked effect on the expression of PLTP in both HuAITg and wild-type mice, the relative contribution of PLTP to the observed alterations in HDL structure was determined by comparing the effect of fenofibrate treatment on HDL size distribution in wild-type and PLTP-deficient mice. In agreement with data presented above, treatment of wild-type mice with 0.2% fenofibrate produced a marked 2-fold rise in plasma PLTP activity (data not shown). As expected (19Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), PLTP activity was undetectable in homozygous PLTP-deficient mice whether they were treated or not with fenofibrate (data not shown). HDL size was measured in both wild-type and PLTP-deficient mice (n = 4/group). A representative profile of an animal of each group is shown in Fig.5. In treated wild-type mice, two types of HDL of 12.8 ± 0.5 and 11.4 ± 0.1 nm were observed, whereas HDL was monodisperse in nontreated wild-type mice (11.0 ± 0.5 nm). In contrast, fenofibrate treatment did not produce any detectable effect on the size distribution of plasma HDL (9.7 ± 0.6 and 9.3 ± 0.4 nm in nontreated versus treated PLTP-deficient mice). Because fenofibrate has been shown to exert its effect by modifying the expression of a number of genes via activation of the nuclear receptor PPARα, we examined whether the observed change in PLTP was dependent on PPARα activation by carrying out experiments in PPARα-deficient mice. Wild-type and PPARα-deficient mice were treated with the same dose of fenofibrate (0.2%). Treatment of PPARα+/+ mice with fenofibrate increased PLTP activity from 4 to 13 µmol/ml/h, whereas no increase in PLTP activity was observed in treated PPARα−/− mice (Fig. 6 a). As shown in Fig.6 b, basal PLTP mRNA levels were comparable in wild-type and PPARα−/− mice. By contrast, fenofibrate treatment induced a significant 4-fold increase in PLTP mRNA levels in livers of wild-type mice, whereas no changes in PLTP mRNA levels were observed in PPARα−/− animals. HDL structure and metabolism are modulated by fibric acid derivatives in humans as well as in rodents. Whereas most attention has been paid to the effects of fibrates on apoAI and apoAII, their effects on the expression of other proteins involved in HDL metabolism have not been studied previously. LCAT is associated with HDL in that it generates cholesteryl esters and lysophospholipids with phospholipids and free cholesterol as substrates, driving as such the further influx of free cholesterol into HDL. As a result of the LCAT-mediated influx of core lipids, HDL tends to enlarge (28Hamilton R.L. Williams M.C. Fielding C.J. Havel R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 667-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Conversely, shrinkage of HDL as the consequence of phospholipid and triglyceride hydrolysis by HL leads to the emergence of small HDL (29Deckelbaum R.J. Eisenberg S. Oschry Y. Butbul E. Sharon I. Olivecrona T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6509-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLTP by facilitating phospholipid transfer between lipoproteins plays an important role in HDL remodeling, favoring the appearance of both large and lipid-poor apoAI-containing particles (9Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F.T. Lok S. Tu A.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, plasma HDL metabolism in mice (i.e. a cholesteryl ester transfer protein-deficient species) is mainly dependent on LCAT, HL, and PLTP activities. Given that HDL was previously shown to undergo significant structural changes as the result of fenofibrate treatment in HuAITg mice (16Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we postulated that one or several enzyme/transfer activities involved in HDL metabolism are modulated by fenofibrate. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to search for potential alterations in LCAT, PLTP, and HL in several mouse lines treated or not with fenofibrate. The most striking finding of the present study is the marked dose-dependent increase in PLTP activity and hepatic mRNA in HuAITg and wild-type mice treated with fenofibrate. The increase in HDL size was the initial finding associated with fenofibrate treatment in HuAITg mice (16Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouet S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.C. Rubin E. Denefle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and consistent observations were made in the present study in both HuAITg and nontransgenic mice (Figs. 1 and 3). Based on previous in vivo and in vitro observations, the increase in PLTP activity due to fenofibrate would predictably have resulted in increased αHDL size. In further support of the latter view, incubation of purified PLTP with isolated HDL induced the appearance of a population of larger HDL particles (8Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pahlman R. Blomqvist S. Van Tol A. Ehnholm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4032-4036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a positive relationship between PLTP activity and HDL size was observed in different inbred mouse strains (30Albers J.J. Pitman W. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Kennedy H. Tu A.Y. Marcovina S.M. Paigen B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 295-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However,in vivo studies in genetically engineered mice yielded somewhat controversial data with regard to the role of PLTP in determining the size distribution of αHDL (11Jiang X. Francone O.L.

This, heterogeneity of experimental data concerning the role of PLTP in HDL structure might relate at least in part to marked differences in the plasma levels and tissue expression of PLTP in the distinct mouse models (11Jiang X.

Res. 1996; 26: 262-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this respect, stimulation of PLTP expression by fenofibrate in wild-type as well as in HuAITg mice indicates that pharmacological modification of PLTP expression results in pronounced alterations in HDL structure and metabolism. Although in the present studies fenofibrate treatment led to increases in HDL size in both HuAITg and nontransgenic mice, clear differences in HDL size distribution appeared between the two mouse lines (Figs. 1 and3). In HuAITg mice treated with the high dose of fenofibrate, very large HDL, almost of human LDL size, was observed much similar to those recently described in HuAITg mice strongly expressing human PLTP after receiving an adenovirus infection (32Ehnholm S. Vandijk K.W. Vanthof B. Vanderzee A. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Hofker M. Havekes L. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1248-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nontransgenic wild-type mice, fenofibrate led to weaker changes in HDL size distribution. Interestingly and as already observed (11Jiang X. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Ehnholm S. Vandijk K.W. Vanthof B. Vanderzee A. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Hofker M. Havekes L. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1248-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PLTP activity is clearly higher in HuAITg mice than in nontransgenic animals. Thus, higher PLTP activity in HuAITg mice could account for the greater increase in HDL size as compared with control animals (11Jiang X. Francone O.L. Bruce C. Milne R. Mar J. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Ehnholm S. Vandijk K.W. Vanthof B. Vanderzee A. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Hofker M. Havekes L. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1248-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of PLTP in HuAITg versus nontransgenic mice may be due to the fact that PLTP displays a higher affinity for large HDL than for small HDL (35Speijer H. Groener J.E. van Ramshorst E. Van Tol A. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 90: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, even though fenofibrate exerts a similar effect on PLTP gene expression in both HuAITg and nontransgenic mice, the overexpression of human apoAI would clearly emphasize the PLTP-mediated HDL changes. Fenofibrate decreased plasma LCAT activity, but unlike PLTP gene expression LCAT gene expression was only marginally reduced in wild-type mice, and no change in LCAT mRNA levels was observed in HuAITg mice. Because LCAT activity values in the present study mainly reflect LCAT mass concentration, the results indicate that fenofibrate significantly decreased the concentration of LCAT in the plasma of fenofibrate-treated animals. Interestingly, decreased LCAT activity has already been noted in mice overexpressing PLTP (32Ehnholm S. Vandijk K.W. Vanthof B. Vanderzee A. Olkkonen V.M. Jauhiainen M. Hofker M. Havekes L. Ehnholm C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1248-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is conceivable that LCAT has a lower affinity for large HDL than for small particles. Although to our knowledge no study has directly examined this point in mice, it is noteworthy that the shift in HDL size toward small HDL in mice transgenic for both human apoAI and cholesteryl ester transfer protein as compared with HuAITg mice was associated with a concomitant increase in LCAT mass (36Francone O.L. Royer L. Haghpassand M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1268-1277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All together, these data suggest therefore that a substantial increase in the mean HDL size would secondarily result in lower plasma LCAT levels because of a weaker lipoprotein affinity (and thus a faster catabolism) of the enzyme. In other words and in contrast to increased plasma PLTP levels, decreased plasma LCAT levels would be the consequence and not the cause of the HDL enlargement in fenofibrate-treated mice. In direct support of a key role of PLTP in the HDL enlargement in treated mice, the present study demonstrated for the first time that the HDL size redistribution induced by fenofibrate is completely abolished in homozygous PLTP-deficient animals. Although fibric acid derivatives are known to affect mouse lipoprotein metabolism in several distinct ways, in particular through the regulation of the expression of a number of proteins, the lack of HDL size redistribution in fenofibrate-treated PLTP-deficient mice clearly indicates that PLTP overexpression is the most important if not the sole mechanism that accounts for the observed HDL enlargement. Nevertheless and as demonstrated in the present studies in HuAITg mice, the impact of PLTP on HDL size can be markedly modulated by the level of apolipoprotein gene expression. Because fibrates exert their effects through activation of the transcription factor PPARα (15Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), it has been postulated that the increase in hepatic PLTP mRNA was mediated through a PPARα-dependent mechanism. It can be concluded from the present study that fenofibrate affects PLTP gene expression via the activation of the nuclear receptor PPARα. Several other genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism are transcriptionally induced by PPARα activation. Indeed, fibrates activate PPARα, which after heterodimerization with another nuclear receptor, the retinoid X receptor, interacts with specific response elements termed peroxisome proliferator response elements in the regulatory sequences of target genes. The binding of PPARα-retinoid X receptor heterodimer to a peroxisome proliferator response element leads to altered gene expression (37Fruchart J.C. Duriez P. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It can, therefore, be suggested that the promoter of the mouse hepatic PLTP gene contains a functional peroxisome proliferator response element, but a direct demonstration of its presence remains to be done. In conclusion, results of the present study established for the first time that fenofibrate induces the expression of murine PLTP in liver through a PPARα-dependent mechanism. The resulting rise in plasma PLTP activity was shown to account for the HDL size enlargement in plasma from treated animals. Finally, the absence of HDL size changes in PLTP-deficient mice clearly demonstrated that PLTP is a key factor in determining the size distribution of αHDL in vivo. We thank Drs. Jeffrey M. Peters and Frank J. Gonzalez from the Laboratory of Molecular Carcinogenesis, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD for PPARα-deficient mice.

The bacterial SSB and the eukaryotic RPA bind to single-stranded DNA as a homotetramer and a heterotrimer, respectively. Although there is little amino acid sequence similarity between SSB and RPA, recent analyses of the three-dimensional structures revealed that these proteins have a structurally similar domain (4Raghunathan S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The presence of this common structure in SSB and RPA, and also in the RNA binding domain of Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (8Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V.

In contrast, eukaryotic RPA is a stable heterotrimer composed of 70, 32, and 14 kDa subunits. The largest subunit, RPA70, contains two tandem repeats of an OB fold that are responsible for the major interaction with a single-stranded DNA in the central region (5Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A.

The archaeal RadA protein sequence is more similar to the eukaryotic Rad51 than to the bacterial RecA and can mediate the strand-exchangein vitro. Although the RadA-mediated strand-exchange ability is very weak, like the case of eukaryotic Rad51, stimulating factors have not yet been identified in Archaea. The RPAs fromMethanococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) (MJ1159 and MTH1385, respectively) have been reported (39Chedin F. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These proteins have amino acid sequence similarity to the eukaryotic RPA70 and contain four or five repeated domains containing the putative OB fold and one putative zinc finger motif. The M. jannaschii RPA exists as a monomer in solution and has single-strand DNA binding activity. However, it is not yet known whether the archaeal RPA is required for DNA replication and recombination. To understand the biological functions of the archaeal RPA, especially in DNA replication and recombination, we have characterized the RPA from the hyperthermophilic archaeon,Pyrococcus furiosus. Similar to the eukaryotic RPA, P. furiosus RPA (PfuRPA) forms a complex consisting of three distinct subunits. The PfuRPA strikingly stimulated the RadA-promoted strand-exchange reaction in vitro. These analyses will contribute to the complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of homologous recombination in Archaea.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we identified the RPA from P. furiosusand showed that PfuRPA forms a stable complex consisting of three proteins, RPA41, RPA14, and RPA32. In contrast to the M. jannaschii RPA, which has four repeats of the putative OB fold domain, the P. furiosus RPA41 has only one corresponding sequence. Eukaryotic RPA and bacterial SSB, which have stable binding ability to single-stranded DNA, contain at least four OB fold domains in their complexes. Indeed, RPA41 by itself did not show stable binding to single-stranded DNA. The RPA41/32 complex bound to single-stranded DNA, and furthermore, the RPA41/14/32 complex shows more stable binding to the DNA (Fig. 4 A). P. furiosus RPA14 and RPA32 are not similar to any known ORFs in the current data base. However, a putative OB fold domain is present in both proteins, as shown in Fig.1 A. These domains may be necessary for stable DNA binding. The zinc finger motif, which was recently shown to be important for RPA to modulate its DNA binding (14Lin Y.-L. Shivji M.K. K Chen C. Koloddner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), is also conserved between the eukaryotic RPA70 and archaeal RPA41 homologues. However, the fourth residue of four repeats of cysteine in the putative zinc finger motif is substituted with histidine in the archaeal RPA homologs, except for those of M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicus. Currently, the genome sequences of seven euryarcheaotes and one crenarchaeote have been published. We found RPA41 and RPA32 homologues in seven and six euryarchaeal genomes, respectively. Pyrococcus abyssi and Pyrococcus horikoshii contain an operon corresponding to RPA41, RPA14, and RPA32, like that in P. furiosus. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Thermoplasma acidophilum, two RPA41 homologues, one with a putative zinc finger motif (AF0780 and Ta0387) and the other without the motif (AF0382 and Ta1149), were found, in addition to one RPA32 homologue (AF0779 and Ta0388). Interestingly, the RPA41 homologue containing the zinc finger motif and the RPA32 homologue are arranged in tandem in both genomes, suggesting that these proteins functionally associate. Furthermore, Halobacteriumsp. NRC1 has four RPA41 homologues, two with a zinc finger motif (Vng1255c and Vng2160c) and the other two without it (Vng0133 g and Vng6403 h). Two homologs were also found for RPA32 (Vng1253c and Vng2162c) in the genome of this haloarchaea, and they were arranged in tandem with each of the RPA41 homologs containing a zinc finger motif. These findings imply that in euryarchaeotes, except for methanogens, the RPA complex consists of three subunits, one subunit with a zinc finger motif and two subunits without a zinc finger motif. Interestingly, we found an ORF (MJ1654), with a sequence similar to that of RPA32, in M. jannaschii. To compare it with that RPA in M. thermoautotrophicus, which contains five repeats of the OB fold domain (39Chedin F. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), MJ1654 may associate with MJ1159 (RPA; see Ref. 40Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14634-14639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), resulting in five repeats of the domain in the M. jannaschii RPA molecule. We found the RPA41 homolog in the two crenarchaeal genomes, Aeropyrum pernix and Sulfolobus solfataricus; however, no RPA32 homolog has been found in these crenarchaeotes. During the preparation of this manuscript, the S. solfataricus RPA41 was published (53Wadsworth R.I. White M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It would be very interesting to understand the evolutional relationships of the archaeal RPA subunits. Further detailed analyses will give us some interesting insight regarding this matter.The in vitro strand-exchange ability of the archaeal RadA is weak, as also reported for the eukaryotic Rad51 proteins. SSB and RPA are thought to help the DNA strand exchange by removing the secondary structure of the single-stranded DNA. However, E. coli SSB and yeast RPA failed to stimulate the reaction mediated by S. solfataricus RadA, probably because of the high temperature used for the reaction (35Seitz E.M. Brockman J.P. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our results show that the RPA complex fromP. furiosus clearly stimulates the strand-exchange reaction promoted by P. furiosus RadA (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the RPA41/32 complex stimulated the strand exchange better than the RPA41/14/32 complex. It is possible that the two-subunit complex dissociates from the DNA more easily than the three-subunit complex, because the RPA41/32-DNA complex is less stable than the RPA41/14/32-DNA complex, as shown in Fig. 4 A. This less stable interaction of RPA41/32 may be favorable for the reaction, because it may interfere with the processing of the strand pairing and exchange by RadA. The role of the eukaryotic RPA14 in DNA binding is still not clear, and it is now believed that the eukaryotic RPA14 has a structural role in the assembly of the RPA heterotrimer. Further analyses of P. furiosus RPA14 will help to reveal the exact function of the smallest subunit of RPA. In this study, we purified three subunits independently and prepared PfuRPA by mixing. As described above, soluble RPA32 was difficult to purify, and therefore, it was prepared as the histidine-tagged form. Construction of the co-expression system of the three genes in one cell may provide a better PfuRPA complex without the His-tag on RPA32. The PfuRPA produced by the co-expression system might stimulate the RadA-mediated strand-exchange reaction with more extent.It is interesting that PfuRPA interacts with Hjc, the Holliday junction resolvase that we identified recently in P. furiosus (43Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our preliminary analysis showed that PfuRPA neither stimulated nor inhibited the junction-cleaving activity of Hjc in vitro. If a direct interaction with Hjc occurs in the cells, then PfuRPA is probably involved in the archaeal resolvasome. We are now searching for the branch-migrating enzyme in P. furiosus, and further progress will provide many clues to elucidate the complete molecular mechanism of the homologous recombination.According to immunoprecipitation experiments, RPA interacts with various proteins related to DNA replication in P. furiosuscells (Fig. 6 B). Studies on the in vitro SV40 replication system have shown that RPA interacts with SV40 T-antigen (which has helicase activity) and works in the denaturation of the replication origin (54Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Then, the DNA polymerase α-primase complex is recruited to synthesize primers. The interaction between RPA and the DNA polymerase α-primase complex is direct, via the primase (20Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, as well as in our previous report (50Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), RPA41 was significantly co-precipitated with primase when we used an anti-primase antibody from P. furiosus cells. In the elongation step of eukaryotic replication, the Pol α-primase remains attached to its priming site by contacting RPA, and RFC replaces it via a competitive interaction with RPA. RFC assembles PCNA onto the primed site, which Pol δ can access by contacting RPA (55Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M.

Our immunoprecipitation experiments support the idea that PfuRPA interacts with RFC and two DNA polymerases (Pol I and Pol II), respectively.

Furthermore, the similarity of its molecular composition to that of the eukaryotic RPA will let us use PfuRPA as a good model to understand the structure-function relationships of eukaryotic proteins in more detail. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB)1 in Bacteria and replication protein A (RPA) in Eukarya play essential roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. (1Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu.

Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The bacterial SSB and the eukaryotic RPA bind to single-stranded DNA as a homotetramer and a heterotrimer, respectively. Although there is little amino acid sequence similarity between SSB and RPA, recent analyses of the three-dimensional structures revealed that these proteins have a structurally similar domain (4Raghunathan S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). The presence of this common structure in SSB and RPA, and also in the RNA binding domain of Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase (8Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), suggests that the mechanism of single-stranded nucleic acid binding appears to be conserved in the biological domains. Bacterial SSB is a homotetramer of a 20-kDa peptide with one OB fold. In contrast, eukaryotic RPA is a stable heterotrimer composed of 70, 32, and 14 kDa subunits. The largest subunit, RPA70, contains two tandem repeats of an OB fold that are responsible for the major interaction with a single-stranded DNA in the central region (5Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A.

The N-terminal and C-terminal regions of RPA70 mediate interactions with many cellular or viral proteins and RPA32, respectively (12Braun K.A. Lao Y. He Z. Ingles C.J. Wold M.S.

The RPA interacts with the SV40 T-antigen and the DNA polymerase α-primase complex, resulting in the formation of an initiation complex at the replication origin (20Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar).

In homologous recombination, RecA in Bacteria and Rad51 in eukarya play a central role in homologous pairing and strand exchange between single-stranded DNA and homologous double-stranded DNA (reviewed in Refs. 23Radding C.M.

Recently, several laboratories have reported a RecA/Rad51 family protein, called RadA, in Archaea, the third domain of life (35Seitz E.M. Brockman J.P. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 36Kil Y.V. Baitin D.M. Masui R. Bonch-Osmolovskaya E.A. Kuramitsu S. Lanzov V.A. J.

The archaeal RadA protein sequence is more similar to the eukaryotic Rad51 than to the bacterial RecA and can mediate the strand-exchangein vitro. Although the RadA-mediated strand-exchange ability is very weak, like the case of eukaryotic Rad51, stimulating factors have not yet been identified in Archaea. The RPAs fromMethanococcus jannaschii and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum) (MJ1159 and MTH1385, respectively) have been reported (39Chedin F. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28751-28761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These proteins have amino acid sequence similarity to the eukaryotic RPA70 and contain four or five repeated domains containing the putative OB fold and one putative zinc finger motif. The M. jannaschii RPA exists as a monomer in solution and has single-strand DNA binding activity. However, it is not yet known whether the archaeal RPA is required for DNA replication and recombination. To understand the biological functions of the archaeal RPA, especially in DNA replication and recombination, we have characterized the RPA from the hyperthermophilic archaeon,Pyrococcus furiosus. Similar to the eukaryotic RPA, P. furiosus RPA (PfuRPA) forms a complex consisting of three distinct subunits. The PfuRPA strikingly stimulated the RadA-promoted strand-exchange reaction in vitro. These analyses will contribute to the complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of homologous recombination in Archaea. DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we identified the RPA from P. furiosusand showed that PfuRPA forms a stable complex consisting of three proteins, RPA41, RPA14, and RPA32. In contrast to the M. jannaschii RPA, which has four repeats of the putative OB fold domain, the P. furiosus RPA41 has only one corresponding sequence. Eukaryotic RPA and bacterial SSB, which have stable binding ability to single-stranded DNA, contain at least four OB fold domains in their complexes. Indeed, RPA41 by itself did not show stable binding to single-stranded DNA. The RPA41/32 complex bound to single-stranded DNA, and furthermore, the RPA41/14/32 complex shows more stable binding to the DNA (Fig. 4 A). P. furiosus RPA14 and RPA32 are not similar to any known ORFs in the current data base. However, a putative OB fold domain is present in both proteins, as shown in Fig.1 A. These domains may be necessary for stable DNA binding. The zinc finger motif, which was recently shown to be important for RPA to modulate its DNA binding (14Lin Y.-L. Shivji M.K. K Chen C. Koloddner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), is also conserved between the eukaryotic RPA70 and archaeal RPA41 homologues. However, the fourth residue of four repeats of cysteine in the putative zinc finger motif is substituted with histidine in the archaeal RPA homologs, except for those of M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicus. Currently, the genome sequences of seven euryarcheaotes and one crenarchaeote have been published. We found RPA41 and RPA32 homologues in seven and six euryarchaeal genomes, respectively. Pyrococcus abyssi and Pyrococcus horikoshii contain an operon corresponding to RPA41, RPA14, and RPA32, like that in P. furiosus. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Thermoplasma acidophilum, two RPA41 homologues, one with a putative zinc finger motif (AF0780 and Ta0387) and the other without the motif (AF0382 and Ta1149), were found, in addition to one RPA32 homologue (AF0779 and Ta0388). Interestingly, the RPA41 homologue containing the zinc finger motif and the RPA32 homologue are arranged in tandem in both genomes, suggesting that these proteins functionally associate. Furthermore, Halobacteriumsp. NRC1 has four RPA41 homologues, two with a zinc finger motif (Vng1255c and Vng2160c) and the other two without it (Vng0133 g and Vng6403 h). Two homologs were also found for RPA32 (Vng1253c and Vng2162c) in the genome of this haloarchaea, and they were arranged in tandem with each of the RPA41 homologs containing a zinc finger motif. These findings imply that in euryarchaeotes, except for methanogens, the RPA complex consists of three subunits, one subunit with a zinc finger motif and two subunits without a zinc finger motif. Interestingly, we found an ORF (MJ1654), with a sequence similar to that of RPA32, in M. jannaschii. To compare it with that RPA in M. thermoautotrophicus, which contains five repeats of the OB fold domain (39Chedin F. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), MJ1654 may associate with MJ1159 (RPA; see Ref. 40Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14634-14639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), resulting in five repeats of the domain in the M. jannaschii RPA molecule. We found the RPA41 homolog in the two crenarchaeal genomes, Aeropyrum pernix and Sulfolobus solfataricus; however, no RPA32 homolog has been found in these crenarchaeotes. During the preparation of this manuscript, the S. solfataricus RPA41 was published (53Wadsworth R.I. White M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).

Our results show that the RPA complex fromP. furiosus clearly stimulates the strand-exchange reaction promoted by P. furiosus RadA (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the RPA41/32 complex stimulated the strand exchange better than the RPA41/14/32 complex. It is possible that the two-subunit complex dissociates from the DNA more easily than the three-subunit complex, because the RPA41/32-DNA complex is less stable than the RPA41/14/32-DNA complex, as shown in Fig. 4 A.

P. furiosus RPA14 and RPA32 are not similar to any known ORFs in the current data base. However, a putative OB fold domain is present in both proteins, as shown in Fig.1 A. These domains may be necessary for stable DNA binding. The zinc finger motif, which was recently shown to be important for RPA to modulate its DNA binding (14Lin Y.-L. Shivji M.K. K Chen C. Koloddner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), is also conserved between the eukaryotic RPA70 and archaeal RPA41 homologues. However, the fourth residue of four repeats of cysteine in the putative zinc finger motif is substituted with histidine in the archaeal RPA homologs, except for those of M. jannaschii and M. thermoautotrophicus. Currently, the genome sequences of seven euryarcheaotes and one crenarchaeote have been published. We found RPA41 and RPA32 homologues in seven and six euryarchaeal genomes, respectively. Pyrococcus abyssi and Pyrococcus horikoshii contain an operon corresponding to RPA41, RPA14, and RPA32, like that in P. furiosus. In Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Thermoplasma acidophilum, two RPA41 homologues, one with a putative zinc finger motif (AF0780 and Ta0387) and the other without the motif (AF0382 and Ta1149), were found, in addition to one RPA32 homologue (AF0779 and Ta0388). Interestingly, the RPA41 homologue containing the zinc finger motif and the RPA32 homologue are arranged in tandem in both genomes, suggesting that these proteins functionally associate. Furthermore, Halobacteriumsp. NRC1 has four RPA41 homologues, two with a zinc finger motif (Vng1255c and Vng2160c) and the other two without it (Vng0133 g and Vng6403 h). Two homologs were also found for RPA32 (Vng1253c and Vng2162c) in the genome of this haloarchaea, and they were arranged in tandem with each of the RPA41 homologs containing a zinc finger motif. These findings imply that in euryarchaeotes, except for methanogens, the RPA complex consists of three subunits, one subunit with a zinc finger motif and two subunits without a zinc finger motif. Interestingly, we found an ORF (MJ1654), with a sequence similar to that of RPA32, in M. jannaschii. To compare it with that RPA in M. thermoautotrophicus, which contains five repeats of the OB fold domain (39Chedin F. Seitz E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 273-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), MJ1654 may associate with MJ1159 (RPA; see Ref. 40Kelly T.J. Simancek P. Brush G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14634-14639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), resulting in five repeats of the domain in the M. jannaschii RPA molecule. We found the RPA41 homolog in the two crenarchaeal genomes, Aeropyrum pernix and Sulfolobus solfataricus; however, no RPA32 homolog has been found in these crenarchaeotes. During the preparation of this manuscript, the S. solfataricus RPA41 was published (53Wadsworth R.I. White M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It would be very interesting to understand the evolutional relationships of the archaeal RPA subunits. Further detailed analyses will give us some interesting insight regarding this matter. The in vitro strand-exchange ability of the archaeal RadA is weak, as also reported for the eukaryotic Rad51 proteins. SSB and RPA are thought to help the DNA strand exchange by removing the secondary structure of the single-stranded DNA. However, E. coli SSB and yeast RPA failed to stimulate the reaction mediated by S. solfataricus RadA, probably because of the high temperature used for the reaction (35Seitz E.M. Brockman J.P. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1248-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Our results show that the RPA complex fromP. furiosus clearly stimulates the strand-exchange reaction promoted by P. furiosus RadA (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the RPA41/32 complex stimulated the strand exchange better than the RPA41/14/32 complex. It is possible that the two-subunit complex dissociates from the DNA more easily than the three-subunit complex, because the RPA41/32-DNA complex is less stable than the RPA41/14/32-DNA complex, as shown in Fig. 4 A. This less stable interaction of RPA41/32 may be favorable for the reaction, because it may interfere with the processing of the strand pairing and exchange by RadA. The role of the eukaryotic RPA14 in DNA binding is still not clear, and it is now believed that the eukaryotic RPA14 has a structural role in the assembly of the RPA heterotrimer. Further analyses of P. furiosus RPA14 will help to reveal the exact function of the smallest subunit of RPA. In this study, we purified three subunits independently and prepared PfuRPA by mixing. As described above, soluble RPA32 was difficult to purify, and therefore, it was prepared as the histidine-tagged form. Construction of the co-expression system of the three genes in one cell may provide a better PfuRPA complex without the His-tag on RPA32. The PfuRPA produced by the co-expression system might stimulate the RadA-mediated strand-exchange reaction with more extent. It is interesting that PfuRPA interacts with Hjc, the Holliday junction resolvase that we identified recently in P. furiosus (43Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our preliminary analysis showed that PfuRPA neither stimulated nor inhibited the junction-cleaving activity of Hjc in vitro. If a direct interaction with Hjc occurs in the cells, then PfuRPA is probably involved in the archaeal resolvasome. We are now searching for the branch-migrating enzyme in P. furiosus, and further progress will provide many clues to elucidate the complete molecular mechanism of the homologous recombination. According to immunoprecipitation experiments, RPA interacts with various proteins related to DNA replication in P. furiosuscells (Fig. 6 B). Studies on the in vitro SV40 replication system have shown that RPA interacts with SV40 T-antigen (which has helicase activity) and works in the denaturation of the replication origin (54Bullock P.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Then, the DNA polymerase α-primase complex is recruited to synthesize primers. The interaction between RPA and the DNA polymerase α-primase complex is direct, via the primase (20Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, as well as in our previous report (50Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), RPA41 was significantly co-precipitated with primase when we used an anti-primase antibody from P. furiosus cells. In the elongation step of eukaryotic replication, the Pol α-primase remains attached to its priming site by contacting RPA, and RFC replaces it via a competitive interaction with RPA. RFC assembles PCNA onto the primed site, which Pol δ can access by contacting RPA (55Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our immunoprecipitation experiments support the idea that PfuRPA interacts with RFC and two DNA polymerases (Pol I and Pol II), respectively. These findings suggest that PfuRPA probably associates with these replication proteins and plays important roles at the initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication in P. furiosus cells. RPA is one of the key proteins in DNA replication and recombination. Identification of the RPA complex in P. furiosus will contribute to the progress of archaeal molecular recognition in these essential processes in DNA metabolism. Furthermore, the similarity of its molecular composition to that of the eukaryotic RPA will let us use PfuRPA as a good model to understand the structure-function relationships of eukaryotic proteins in more detail.

Shimura, the director of Biomolecular Engineering Research Institute, for continuous encouragement."

However, the proteases responsible for the processing of CgA and release of bioactive peptides have not been established. Recently, we found that chromaffin cells express components of the plasmin(ogen) system, including tissue plasminogen activator, which is targeted to catecholamine storage vesicles and released with CgA and catecholamines in response to sympathoadrenal stimulation, and high affinity cell surface receptors for plasminogen, to promote plasminogen activation at the cell surface. In the present study, we investigated processing of CgA by plasmin and sought to identify specific bioactive CgA peptides produced by plasmin proteolysis. Highly purified human CgA (hCgA) was produced by expression in Escherichia coli and purification using metal affinity chromatography. hCgA was digested with plasmin. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry identified a major peptide produced with a mass/charge ratio (m/z) of 1546, corresponding uniquely to hCgA-(360–373), the identity of which was confirmed by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and amino-terminal microsequencing. hCgA-(360–373) was selectively liberated by plasmin from hCgA at early time points and was stable even after prolonged exposure to plasmin. The corresponding synthetic peptide markedly inhibited nicotine-induced catecholamine release from pheochromocytoma cells. These results identify plasmin as a protease, present in the local environment of the chromaffin cell, that selectively cleaves CgA to generate a bioactive fragment, hCgA-(360–373), that inhibits nicotinic-mediated catecholamine release. These results suggest that the plasminogen/plasmin system through its interaction with CgA may play a major role in catecholaminergic function and suggest a specific mechanism as well as a discrete CgA peptide through which this effect is mediated.

Neuroscience. 1976; 1: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). CgA is found ubiquitously in secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine cells (2O'Connor D.T. Parmer R.J. Deftos L.J. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1984; 97: 242-250PubMed Google Scholar) and may be an example of a prototypical prohormone precursor (3Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated to suggest that CgA may function as a precursor of several small, biologically active, secretion-inhibitory peptides that play an important autocrine regulatory role in neuroendocrine secretion from a variety of cell types (4Tatemoto K.

In the case of catecholaminergic cells, CgA serves as a precursor from which peptides are released that modulate catecholamine secretion, contributing to an autocrine, homeostatic (negative feedback) mechanism for regulating catecholamine responses during stress (9Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10Galindo E. Rill A. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteolytic processing of CgA may take place intracellularly as well as extracellularly (i.e. after secretion into the extracellular space (9Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)), and indeed, extracellular processing appears to be particularly important for generation of catecholamine release-inhibitory activity from the CgA molecule in the vicinity of the chromaffin cell (9Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest a major role for the plasminogen/plasmin protease system in CgA processing. Plasminogen, the zymogen for the serine protease and major fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin, circulates at high concentration (2 μm (13Collen D. Verstraete M. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1975; 34: 403-408PubMed Google Scholar, 14Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar)) in plasma and extracellular fluid and is present in the local environment of the chromaffin cell. We recently demonstrated that catecholaminergic cells express components of the fibrinolytic system, including tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) (15Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Mahata S. Sebald M.T. O'Connor D.T. Miles L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the major activator of this system, as well as high affinity, high capacity binding sites for plasminogen and t-PA, consistent with the presence of a local, cellular fibrinolytic system on chromaffin cells (16Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Gong Y. Mahata S.K. Jiang Q. O'Connor D.T. Xi X.P. Miles L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that perturbation of the local cellular fibrinolytic system results in profound alterations in secretagogue-mediated exocytotic release of catecholamines, suggesting a major role for fibrinolytic molecules in the regulation of catecholamine secretion (16Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Gong Y. Mahata S.K. Jiang Q. O'Connor D.T. Xi X.P. Miles L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Plasmin readily cleaves CgA, and binding of plasminogen to its cellular binding sites promotes activation of plasminogen to plasmin and plasmin-mediated CgA processing (16Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Gong Y. Mahata S.K. Jiang Q. O'Connor D.T. Xi X.P. Miles L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the peptide mixture resulting from the interaction between plasmin and CgA markedly inhibits nicotinic cholinergic stimulation of catecholamine release from catecholaminergic cells (16Parmer R.J. Mahata M. Gong Y. Mahata S.K. Jiang Q. O'Connor D.T. Xi X.P. Miles L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 907-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the specific peptide(s) released from CgA by plasmin, in particular those that modulate catecholamine secretion, have not been identified. In the present study, we have focused on the identification of regulatory peptide(s) produced by the interaction of CgA with plasmin. We utilized a combined approach that included development of an expression and purification system for obtaining highly purified human CgA (hCgA) substrate and controlled plasmin-specific proteolysis, coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, reverse phase HPLC, and amino-terminal amino acid sequencing, to identify specific cleavage sites and specific CgA peptide fragments resulting from the interaction of CgA and plasmin. Our results demonstrate that processing of CgA by plasmin is sufficient to selectively liberate a discrete CgA fragment with a pronounced inhibitory effect on catecholamine secretion. These results suggest that the plasminogen/t-PA system through its interaction with CgA may play a major role in catecholaminergic function and suggest a specific mechanism as well as a discrete CgA peptide fragment through which this effect is mediated. These interactions between catecholaminergic and fibrinolytic pathways thus have important implications for cardiovascular regulation. Human CgA cDNA encoding the mature protein (minus the 18-residue signal peptide) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA clone, pGEM-hCgA (from Dr. Lee Helman, NCI, National Institutes of Health) (17Helman L.J. Ahn T.G. Levine M.A. Allison A. Cohen P.S. Cooper M.J. Cohn D.V. Israel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11559-11563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The 5′ primer, 5′-CATGCCATGGCTCCCTGTGAACAGCCTAT-3′, encoded the N-terminal portion of the mature protein (amino acid residues 1–6) preceded by aNcoI site (underlined). The 3′ primer, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGCCCCGCCGTAGTGCCTGCAGC-3′, was complementary to the 3′-end of the coding region (encoding amino acid residues 433–439) and contained an XhoI site (underlined). For amplification, 10 ng of cDNA were added to 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, with the two oligonucleotide primers (each at 50 μm), dNTPs (Life Technologies, Inc.) (each at 25 mm) and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a total volume of 100 μl. Twenty-five polymerase chain reaction cycles were carried out in three steps consisting of a 1-min denaturation step at 94 °C, 2-min annealing at 60 °C, and 2-min extension at 72 °C using a PTC-100 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NcoI and XhoI (Life Technologies) and gel-purified. The resulting fragment of 1326 base pairs was directionally cloned into the expression vector, pET-28b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The final construct was designated pET-(hCgA-6his) and encoded mature human CgA (439 residues) with the addition of the residues MPW at the amino terminus and the residues LEHHHHHH at the C terminus (total of 450 residues for the final recombinant protein). The nucleotide sequences of the polymerase chain reaction products and the junction regions between the insert and the vector were verified from both strands using an Applied Biosystems 373 Automated DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One liter of a suspension of Escherichia coli, BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), was transformed with the pET-(hCgA-6his) expression vector, and grown in LB broth containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) at 37 °C until an A 590 of 0.4 was reached. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Three hours following IPTG induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in 100 ml of buffer A (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) by stirring at 4 °C for 18 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (1.5 × 4 cm), preequilibrated with 5 column volumes (25 ml) of buffer A. The column was washed at a flow rate of 15 ml/h, with 30 ml of buffer A, followed by 20 ml of buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) until the effluent had an A 280 of <0.01. The bound proteins were eluted with a pH gradient of 5.9–4.5 (composed of 8 ml of buffer B adjusted to pH 5.9 and 4 ml of buffer B adjusted to pH 4.5) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and 5 μl of each fraction were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The affinity-purified recombinant hCgA was identified based on the reported apparent molecular mass for native CgA, 70 kDa (17Helman L.J. Ahn T.G. Levine M.A. Allison A. Cohen P.S. Cooper M.J.

The peak fractions were pooled and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa was cut out and placed into a sample trap with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis membrane. The gel slices were soaked in 10 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6. The proteins were eluted at 4 °C in electrophoresis buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) following the manufacturer's instructions (ISCO, Inc., Lincoln, NE). After electroelution, hCgA was dialyzed into 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The purified hCgA was concentrated, and its concentration was determined using the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad protein assay). Recombinant hCgA was iodinated using a modified chloramine-T procedure as described previously (22Miles L.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4303-4311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline). Human Glu-plasminogen, the native circulating form of the molecule, was isolated from fresh human blood collected into 3 mm benzamidine, 3 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin (Miles, Kankakee, IL), and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The plasma was subjected to affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose (23Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm benzamidine, 0.02% NaN3, and 3 mm EDTA followed by molecular exclusion chromatography on Ultrogel AcA44 (IBF Biotechnics, Villeneuve-la-Garennem, France). The plasminogen concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 16.8 (24Wallen P. Wiman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 257: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Urokinase (u-PA) was obtained from Calbiochem. Purified hCgA was digested with plasmin, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry (25Siuzdak G. Mass Spectrometry for Bio/Technology.

The plasmin digests were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of 10 μm. Either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or sinapinic acid was used as the UV laser desorption matrix depending on the mass ranges included in the analysis. Samples of 5–10 pmol were loaded onto the mass spectrometer sample probe and dried at ambient temperature. Mass spectra were acquired using a Voyager-Elite mass spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Houston, TX). Mass spectra obtained from the MALDI analyses were compared with values generated from a theoretical digest of mature hCgA by a protease with specificity for cleavage at the C-terminal side of basic amino acids, performed using the program “Sherpa: Your Guide to the Peaks” (27Taylor J.A. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This program calculates the molecular weight and the charge-state mass value m/z (mass/charge ratio) for all possible fragments generated from a theoretical proteolytic digestion and orders the fragments by molecular mass. Fifty micrograms of plasmin-digested hCgA were separated on a Supelcosil LC-318 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm; Supelco). The column was equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (eluent A), and the peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (eluent B). The effluent was monitored at 214 nm, and fractions were collected at 0.5-min intervals. Peak fractions were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed using automated Edman microsequencing (Applied Biosystems Precise Sequencer, model 494, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) Peptides were synthesized at 10–100-μmol scale using Fmoc protection chemistry and purified to >95% homogeneity by RP-HPLC on a C-18 column. Authenticity and purity of the peptides were verified by electrospray ionization or MALDI mass spectrometry. PC12 cells (28Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, PC12 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated polystyrene dishes (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and labeled withl-[3H]norepinephrine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 1 μCi/ml in the PC12 cell culture medium. After a 3-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with release buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) and further incubated in release buffer at 37 °C for 30 min in either the presence or absence of the secretagogue, nicotine (60 μm). The release buffer was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in release buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The amounts of [3H]norepinephrine in the medium and cell lysates were measured by liquid scintillation counting. Results were expressed as percentage of secretion (amount released/(amount released + amount in cell lysate)) × 100. Net release is secretagogue-stimulated release minus basal release, where basal norepinephrine release is typically 5.8 ± 0.36% of total cellular [3H]norepinephrine released over 30 min (n = 10 separate secretion assays). We sought to obtain highly purified CgA in order to precisely characterize the peptide products generated by plasmin proteolysis. Results of expression and purification of recombinant hCgA using the construct pET-(hCgA-6his) are shown in Fig. 1. Aliquots from cultures of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring plasmid pET-(hCgA-6his) were removed at the indicated times following IPTG induction, and total cellular proteins were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A protein band, with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, corresponding to the recombinant hCgA was observed 30 min after IPTG induction (Fig. 1, lane 2). 2CgA has a highly anomolous electrophoretic mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Whereas the predicted molecular mass of CgA is 50 kDa, the apparent molecular mass by SDS-PAGE is 70–75 kDa (17Helman L.J. Ahn T.G. Levine M.A. Allison A. Cohen P.S. Cooper M.J. Cohn D.V.

The recombinant hCgA was estimated to comprise ∼20–25% of the total cellular protein 3 h after IPTG induction (Fig. 1, lane 5) based on the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. E. coli cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peak fraction containing purified recombinant hCgA (Fig. 1,lane 6) was electrophoresed, and the 70-kDa band was cut out and electroeluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Based on Coomassie Blue staining, the human CgA (Fig. 1,lane 7) was 99.9% pure. When the recombinant hCgA was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry, the entire spectra encompassing the mass range of 1000–80,000 Da showed only singly charged and doubly charged signals at m/z of 50,976 and 25,495 (see below; Fig. 3, A–C). The observed mass value of 50,976 × 1 for the singly charged signal (or 25,495 × 2 for the doubly charged signal) is consistent with the molecular mass calculated from the primary sequence of the 450-residue recombinant hCgA. 3m/z, the mass/charge ratio, depends on the number of charges on the protein generated by ionization, such that a given protein generates more than one ion signal detected by the mass spectrometer. Thus, the detectedm/z ratios of 50,976 and 25,495 represent the 450-residue recombinant hCgA with charge states of 1+ and 2+, respectively. These results (Fig. 3, A–C) demonstrated that the hCgA substrate obtained was highly purified (without contaminating small peptides) for subsequent proteolytic studies. We examined whether recombinant hCgA could be processed by plasmin. Plasmin readily digested the recombinant hCgA, and the extent of the digestion was dose-dependent (Fig. 2). Major products were sequentially produced with apparent molecular masses of 65, 55, and 43 kDa, as detected using SDS-PAGE. To identify the peptides produced by plasmin proteolysis of hCgA, mass spectrometric analysis was applied. The mixture of proteolytic products of hCgA after digestion with plasmin for 4 h was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. The resulting mass spectra are shown in Fig. 3(D–F). The most prominent peak was observed atm/z = 1546. A time course of proteolysis of hCgA by plasmin was performed, and the proteolytic products were analyzed on the mass spectrometer (Fig.4). The 1546 m/zpeptide was the predominant species observed at 15 min (Fig.4A) and was still the predominant species with an even stronger signal after incubation for 45 and 120 min (Fig. 4,B and C). Additional time course experiments demonstrated the appearance of this peptide at even earlier time points (5 min) and also demonstrated that this peptide was stable to further cleavage even after prolonged incubation for 8 h (data not shown). In control experiments, MALDI analysis of plasminogen plus urokinase alone incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and incubation of hCgA alone for 2 h at 37 °C gave no peaks in the m/zrange of 500–5000, showing that neither of these control incubations generated any detectable peptides (data not shown). Thus, the observed 1546 m/z peak was specifically generated by the interaction between plasmin and hCgA. To investigate the identity of the 1546 m/z hCgA peptide produced by the interaction of plasmin and hCgA, these data were analyzed and compared against specific mass information generated from a theoretical digest, using the program Sherpa (27Taylor J.A. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This program calculates molecular weight and the charge statem/z values for all possible fragments generated from a theoretical proteolytic digest and orders them by molecular mass. Based on the known primary sequence of mature hCgA, a theoretical digest was carried out, cleaving at basic (arginine or lysine) residues (known recognition sites for plasmin (30Weinstein M.J. Doolittle R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) within hCgA and allowing for partial digests (with up to 7 basic residue skips). This analysis generated 403 possible peptides ranging in size from 75.04m/z (a single glycine residue) to 13,519.21m/z. Among these peptides within the primary sequence of hCgA, the observed 1546 m/z peak corresponded uniquely to the 14-mer, hCgA-(360–373) (ARAYGFRGPGPQLR) (calculated molecular mass = 1545.77 Da). We next synthesized this 14-mer peptide, using Fmoc protection chemistry, and purified the peptide to >95% homogeneity by reverse phase-HPLC on a C-18 column. Mass spectrometric analysis of the peptide resulting from this synthesis using both MALDI-MS (see below; Fig.6A) and electrospray (data not shown) revealed an observedm/z of 1546, coinciding with its theoretical mass and identical to the experimental mass (determined by MALDI-MS) of the peptide recovered from our plasmin digest of hCgA (Figs. 3 and 4). To confirm the identity of the 1546 m/z peptide generated from the interaction between plasmin and hCgA, we applied RP-HPLC in combination with MALDI mass spectrometry and microsequencing. The plasmin-digested hCgA mixture was first separated by RP-HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-318 column. A major peak (marked with anarrowhead in Fig.5A) was identified at a retention time of 19.5–20 min, a retention time that corresponded to that of the synthetic 14-mer, hCgA-(360–373), determined in parallel experiments. The peak fraction from the plasmin digest was collected and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. The detected molecular mass of the major peptide peak in this HPLC fraction was 1546 (Fig.5B). This same eluted RP-HPLC fraction was also subjected to amino-terminal microsequencing. Using Edman degradation microsequencing"

Their distinct cellular functions must result from specificity of interaction with different effectors and regulators, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). ARF nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO), and EFA6 are analogous ARF-GEFs, both comprising a catalytic “Sec7” domain and a pleckstrin homology domain. In vivo ARNO, like ARF1, is mostly cytosolic, with minor localizations at the Golgi and plasma membrane; EFA6, like ARF6, is restricted to the plasma membrane. However, depending on conditions, ARNO appears active on ARF6 as well as on ARF1. Here we analyze the origin of these ARF-GEF selectivities. In vitro, in the presence of phospholipid membranes, ARNO activates ARF1 preferentially and ARF6 slightly, whereas EFA6 activates ARF6 exclusively; the stimulation efficiency of EFA6 on ARF6 is comparable with that of ARNO on ARF1. These selectivities are determined by the GEFs Sec7 domains alone, without the pleckstrin homology and N-terminal domains, and by the ARF core domains, without the myristoylated N-terminal helix; they are not modified upon permutation between ARF1 and ARF6 of the few amino acids that differ within the switch regions.

ADP-ribosylation factor myristoylated ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factor pleckstrin homology 5)PIP2, phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid brefeldin A The small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs),1 originally identified as cofactors for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin, form a distinct six-member subgroup within the small G proteins (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Like all G proteins, the ARFs cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, which differ mainly by the conformation of two regions called switch I and switch II. These two switches constitute a major site of interaction with regulator and effector proteins, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factors. But the ARFs differ from all other small G proteins by a myristoylatedN-terminal amphipathic helix, which also changes conformation between the ARF-GDP and ARF-GTP states and is responsible for the GTP-dependent binding of ARF to the phospholipid membrane (2Franco M.

The best characterized members of the family, ARF1 and ARF6, are the most distant and appear to have very distinct functions. ARF1, which is mostly cytosolic, is clearly involved in intra-Golgi transport by regulating coat protein recruitment onto the Golgi membranes (5Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); an additional possible role of ARF1 in focal adhesion assembly in regulating paxillin recruitment onto the plasma membrane has recently been suggested (7Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ARF6, which localizes mostly at the cell periphery, has been implicated in regulating endocytosis and the organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (8D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 9Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) mediate the activation of G-proteins by stimulating the dissociation of the bound GDP that rate-limits the binding of GTP. About 10 ARF-GEFs have been identified. They all share a conserved domain of about 200 amino acids, homologous to a portion of the Sec7 protein (11Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), which bears the nucleotide exchange catalytic activity (12Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 13Peyroche A. Paris S. Jackson C.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 479-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The ARF GEFs can be divided into two major classes based on their size and primary sequence; one is a high molecular weight class composed of the GEA/GBF and Sec7/BIG subgroups, and the other is a low molecular weight class. This latter class shares a common structure organization in which the catalytic Sec7 domain is always linked to a PH domain specifically interacting with membrane-embedded polyphosphoinositides. This small ARF-GEF class can be further divided in the ARNO/cytohesin and EFA6 subclasses. The human ARNO/cytohesin subclass includes four members that are more than 77% identical: ARNO, cytohesin-1, ARNO3, and cytohesin-4; their N-terminal region contains a coiled-coil domain. The EFA6 subclass includes three members: EFA6 and two close analogs, Tic and the coding sequence KIAA0942, which have been deposited in data bank but not yet characterized. The N-terminal domain of EFA6 contains a proline-rich motif, and the long C-terminal extension to the PH domain contains a coiled-coil and two proline-rich motifs.Within one cell several ARF proteins coexist with several GEFs, raising the question of the different functions of the various ARFs and of the specificities of their interactions with the various GEFs. We and others (14Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Monier S. Chardin P. Robineau S. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observe that overexpression of ARNO leads to fragmentation and loss of function of the Golgi complex, which suggests a role for ARNO in ARF1 activation in the Golgi. This suggestion was reinforced by the observation of a Golgi localization for the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of ARNO fused to green fluorescent protein (16Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar). But another experiment indicated a recruitment to the plasma membrane of adipocytes of full-length ARNO fused to green fluorescent protein and of a green fluorescent protein-PH domain of ARNO upon insulin stimulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (17Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar); moreover, a small fraction of overexpressed ARNO and ARF6 appeared in epifluorescence microscopy to partially colocalize at the plasma membrane (18Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Overall these results suggest that the ARNO/cytohesins are able to localize at and probably act on both Golgi and plasma membranes, but their ARF substrates at these two localizations are not clearly identified. On the other hand EFA6 localizes at the plasma membrane, where it couples actin cytoskeleton remodeling with endocytic trafficking (19Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This is compatible with a role of EFA6 in ARF6 activation. Indeed, exogenous expression of EFA6 or of ARF6-Q67L, a constitutively active ARF6 mutant, induces large plasma membrane invaginations enriched in polymerized actin where both proteins localize (9Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 19Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Likewise, both EFA6 and ARF6-Q67L decrease the rate of transferrin uptake. This phenotype is dependent on the nucleotide exchange activity of EFA6, as a mutant devoid of exchange activity has no effect on transferrin internalization (19Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar).In the present study, we analyze in vitro, but in the presence of lipid membrane, the specificities for ARF1versus ARF6 of ARNO and EFA6 constructs. We also study the influence of the PH domain of ARNO on the substrate specificity. Finally, we try to determine by site-directed mutagenesis within the switch regions of the ARFs the molecular basis of their specificity of interaction with their GEF.DISCUSSIONDetermining the specificities of the various ARF-GEFs for their substrates is fundamental for deciphering the cellular functions of the different ARF proteins. The very different cellular functions of ARF1 and ARF6 must be related to their distinct cellular localizations and to specificities of interactions with different GEFs. In contrast with ARF1 and all the other ARFs, ARF6 appears mainly membrane-bound in the cells (28Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

The cellular localizations of the ARF-GEFs of the small ARNO/cytohesin and EFA6 types seemed to coincide, respectively, with that of ARF1 and ARF6. This strongly suggested that ARNO would be specific to ARF1 and EFA6 specific to ARF6, as was proposed in the initial studies characterizing ARNO and EFA6 (14Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S.

D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, depending on the cellular context ARNO has been found to also partially localize with and activate ARF6 (17Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol.

We first noticed that, at physiological magnesium concentration and in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, myristoylated ARF6-GDP is soluble and that its spontaneous GDP/GTP exchange rate is 15 times higher than that of ARF1-GDP. We then demonstrated that the full-length ARNO catalyzes the GDP-GTP exchange reaction preferentially for ARF1, and the full-length EFA6 catalyzes the GDP-GTP exchange reaction exclusively for ARF6. It is also worth noting that the two GEFs have very comparable activities on their specific substrate.Next, we attempted to determine whether the PH domains of ARNO and EFA6 are implicated in the GEF specificities for the ARFs. The PH domain of ARNO has been shown to mediate membrane association via specific interaction with polyphosphoinositides (12Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 23Macia E. Paris S. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Nagel W. Schilcher P. Zeitlmann L. Kolanus W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1981-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we observed that (4,5)PIP2 incorporated into lipid vesicles does not modify the selectivity of ARNO towards ARF proteins. These data demonstrate that the PH domain participates in the membrane localization of ARNO but is not involved in the specificity of the interaction of ARNO with ARF1. Recently, Knorr et al. proposed that the interaction of cytohesin-1 with phosphoinositides could regulate its GEF activity and control its ARF specificity (33Knorr T. Nagel W. Kolanus W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They observed that the addition of PIP2 or phosphatidyl inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) into liposomes strongly suppressed the activity of cytohesin-1 on ARF6, whereas it increased its activity on ARF1. Since ARNO and cytohesin-1 are 82% identical and 90% in their PH domain, it is surprising that they behave differently in the presence of PIPs. The differences may arise from the methods of purification and the preparation of the ARF proteins used in the assay. We further confirmed that the catalytic Sec7 domains of ARNO and EFA6 alone, without their adjacent PH domain and N- and C-terminal extensions, contain all the determinants of their specificities for ARF1 and ARF6.The coiled-coil motif of ARNO seems to be a Golgi-targeting signal (16Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a green fluorescent protein fusion of the coiled-coil domain predominantly localizes to the Golgi apparatus. A single substitution of one of the hydrophobic residues is sufficient to alter this localization. These results suggest that the localization at the Golgi apparatus of ARNO is regulated by the coiled-coil domain, whereas its localization at the plasma membrane is controlled by the PH domain via phosphatidyl inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) binding. EFA6 also contains both a PH and a coiled-coil domain. It has been clearly demonstrated that the PH domain is responsible for the strong association of EFA6 to the plasma membrane (19Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, no information is available regarding the precise function of the coiled-coil domain. In addition, EFA6 contains some other adaptor modules such as a few proline-rich regions. All these domains may be involved in the formation of a multi-protein complex serving as a central platform to coordinate the plasma membrane dynamics with the actin cytoskeleton remodeling.As for the ARF1 and ARF6 substrates, their differential recognition by the GEF Sec7 domains is not related to their very different N-terminal amphipathic helix motifs. Thus the specificity determinants must be contained within the “core” of the ARFs, most probably within the effector region, including the switch I and switch II domains that are known to strongly interact with the GEF (27Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of these two switch regions is strictly identical in ARF1 and ARF6, except for seven residues. We investigated whether these few differences were sufficient to account for the different substrate specificities we observed. Individual substitutions of each of these different residues between ARF1 and ARF6 do not affect the specificity of the ARF1-Sec7 interaction. Thus these seven distinct residues do not define the different selectivities of interaction of the ARFs with the Sec7 domains. The recently resolved crystallographic structure of ARF6 in the GDP-bound form (34Menetrey J. Macia E. Pasqualato S. Franco M. Cherfils J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) appears similar to that of ARF1-GDP, except in the switch regions; the two switch I regions have comparable conformations but are markedly displaced by several Angströms, and the switch II of ARF6-GDP is structurally ordered, in contrast to the switch II of ARF1-GDP, which is flexible. Thus the specificity of the ARF-GEF interaction does not result from primary sequence within the switch regions but rather from a folding difference dictated to the switch regions from elsewhere in the protein.In situ ARF6 appears mainly membrane-bound, in contrast with the other ARFs, which appear mainly cytosolic (28Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Galas M.C.

Mueckler M.M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4006-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). But in our hands, in vitro myristoylated ARF6 remained fully soluble when fully converted to the GDP form, even in the presence of lipid membrane. This could suggest that in situ the membrane-associated ARF6 is primarily in its GTP-bound form. However, it seems unlikely that ARF6 could be constitutively activated in vivo. Indeed, we have previously shown that the effects of overexpression of EFA6 are mediated through the activation of ARF6 and can be mimicked by the expression of ARF6-Q67L, a constitutively activated form of ARF6 (19Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Therefore, we rather propose that in vivo a large pool of ARF6-GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) is responsible for retaining ARF6-GDP at the membrane and slowing down the GDP dissociation rate.Our in vitro studies provide information as to how the GEFs could control in vivo the specific functions mediated by their cognate ARF. Our previous studies demonstrated that the formation of the complex between ARF1 and ARNO, which precedes the activation of ARF1 by GDP/GTP exchange, occurs at the membrane (35Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1573-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 36Beraud-Dufour S. Paris S. Chabre M. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37629-37636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo ARF proteins appear soluble in their inactive GDP-bound state, whereas the GTP form is strongly associated with the phospholipid membranes, suggesting that the specific localization of the GEF determines the membrane site where the ARF protein will be activated and consequently anchored to the membrane.Regarding ARNO, different laboratories using various cellular models and assays led to controversial conclusions as to its role of GEF for ARF6 (14Franco M.

Although it is well accepted thatin vitro ARNO works better on ARF1, two observations on the effects of the fungus toxin brefeldin A (BFA) have been used to support its role on ARF6; it was observed long ago that the Golgi localization of ARF1 is BFA-sensitive, whereas ARF6 localization at the cell periphery is not affected by BFA (9Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Then, in vitro studies demonstrated that the GEF activity of ARNO was not sensitive to BFA (12Chardin P. Paris S. Antonny B. Robineau S. Beraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 39Meacci E. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1999; 3: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The conjunction of these two observations suggested that ARNO is the BFA-insensitive ARF6 GEF. However, a high molecular weight BFA-insensitive ARF-GEF, GBF1, which does not localize at the periphery but to the Golgi apparatus, has recently been found (41Claude A. Zhao B.P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S. Berger S.J. Yan J.P. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melancon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus BFA-insensitive GEFs are probably not restricted to the activation of ARF6.Several groups have detected by subcellular fractionation or immunofluorescence a fraction of ARNO at the plasma membrane together with ARF6 (18Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15637-15644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, although ARF1 is enriched in the Golgi area, it is predominantly a soluble protein. Therefore, one cannot exclude that the fraction of ARNO detected at the plasma membrane could recruit ARF1 onto it as well. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been recently described a role for ARF1 in the recruitment of paxillin to the focal adhesion complexes (7Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A thorough localization analysis of ARF1 at the cell periphery is needed.In conclusion, our results suggest that EFA6 and/or its two close analogs Tic and the coding sequence KIAA0942 are the major GEFs for ARF6 and that ARNO is mostly involved with ARF1 activation. The first indication is that in vitro but in the presence of phospholipid membranes at a physiological magnesium concentration, full-length ARNO is less efficient on ARF6 than on ARF1. This specificity of ARNO for ARF1 is not affected by the interaction of its PH domain with (4,5)PIP2, which implies that in vivo it would not depend on the phosphoinositide composition of the membrane. The specificity of ARNO for ARF1 is entirely contained within the Sec7 domain of ARNO, and the Sec7 domain of EFA6, which is very different from that of ARNO (only 30% identity), achieves a markedly better activity on ARF6. Moreover, the analysis of thisin vitro study appears consistent with our earlier results on the effects of the overexpression of these two GEFs in vivo (14Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of EFA6, but not of ARNO, mimics the effects of expression of constitutively activated ARF6,i.e. cortical actin reorganization and inhibition of transferrin uptake. Conversely, ARNO, but not EFA6, affects the morphology and the function of the Golgi apparatus where ARF1 plays a major role. The small GTP-binding protein ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs),1 originally identified as cofactors for the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin, form a distinct six-member subgroup within the small G proteins (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Like all G proteins, the ARFs cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states, which differ mainly by the conformation of two regions called switch I and switch II. These two switches constitute a major site of interaction with regulator and effector proteins, including the guanine nucleotide exchange factors. But the ARFs differ from all other small G proteins by a myristoylatedN-terminal amphipathic helix, which also changes conformation between the ARF-GDP and ARF-GTP states and is responsible for the GTP-dependent binding of ARF to the phospholipid membrane (2Franco M.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The ARFs are key regulators of vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells. The best characterized members of the family, ARF1 and ARF6, are the most distant and appear to have very distinct functions. ARF1, which is mostly cytosolic, is clearly involved in intra-Golgi transport by regulating coat protein recruitment onto the Golgi membranes (5Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 6Orci L. Palmer D.J. Amherdt M. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); an additional possible role of ARF1 in focal adhesion assembly in regulating paxillin recruitment onto the plasma membrane has recently been suggested (7Norman J.C. Jones D. Barry S.T. Holt M.R. Cockcroft S. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1981-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ARF6, which localizes mostly at the cell periphery, has been implicated in regulating endocytosis and the organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (8D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I.

Mn2+ binding to the high affinity site, which occurs with a half-time of less than 10 s at 1.5 mm Mn2+, dramatically shifts the monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium in the direction of the dimer, further activates the dimer, and allows substantial activity (60–180 s−1) against calcium pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of family I PPases.

Owing to the simplicity of its substrate, PPase is a convenient system to study the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer from polyphosphates, including nucleoside triphosphates, to water, an essential but still incompletely understood biochemical transformation. Soluble PPase is essential for life (1Chen J. Brevet A. Formant M. Leveque F. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5686-5689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lundin M. Baltscheffsky H. Ronne H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12168-12172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), since it provides a thermodynamic pull for biosynthetic reactions (3Kornberg A. Kasha M. Pullman B. Horizons in Biochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1962: 251-264Google Scholar). Until recently, only one family (family I) of soluble PPases had been known, of which the PPases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae andEscherichia coli are the most extensively characterized representatives (4Cooperman B.S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 262-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 5Baykov A.A. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Lahti R. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 23: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite variability of subunit size and of quaternary structure (eukaryotic PPases are dimers of 30–35 kDa subunits, whereas prokaryotic PPases are hexamers of ∼ 20 kDa subunits), PPases of family I have a highly conserved active site structure formed by 14–16 amino acid residues and 3–4 Mg2+ ions and very similar catalytic properties. Catalysis by these enzymes proceeds via direct attack of water on a phosphorus atom without formation of a covalent intermediate. The metal ions are the key to catalysis and mediate the major protein-PPiinteractions, which serve to shield the charge on the electrophilic phosphorus, activate the nucleophilic water molecule, and increase the acidity of the leaving phosphate group (6Heikinheimo P.

Recently, a long-known PPase of Bacillus subtilis (9Tono H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2375-2382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was found to have a completely different amino acid sequence and therefore to belong to a different family (family II) of soluble PPases (10Young T.W.

Hachimori A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).B. subtilis PPase is similar to family I PPases in requiring divalent metal ions for activity (9Tono H. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2375-2382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but unlike bacterial family I PPases, it is formed by large subunits (34 kDa) and displays 10–20 times greater activity (9Tono H.

Another unique property of B. subtilis PPase is its preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ as the activator. A search through GenBankTM revealed four more putative prokaryotic members of family II (two streptococcal and two archeal), showing 40–57% identity in amino acid sequence (10Young T.W. Kuhn N.J.

Wadeson A. Ward S. Young T.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanism employed by family II PPases and the structural basis for their remarkable activity remain to be elucidated. In this work, we cloned and overexpressed in E. coli the putative genes for family II PPases from Streptococcus mutans, implicated together with dietary sugars as the principal cause in the development of dental caries (14Loesche W.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 353-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Streptococcus gordonii, another human oral bacterium. The recombinant proteins were purified and shown, along with the B. subtilis PPase, to be highly active dimeric PPases with a unique requirement for Mn2+. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania), and Dynazyme polymerase was purchased from Finnzymes (Espoo, Finland). The plasmid vector pET-15b was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI), and primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were from Medprobe (Oslo, Norway). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and a Wizard DNA Clean-up system was from Promega(Madison, WI). DEAE fast flow, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and Superdex 200 prep grade columns were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. E. coli XL2blueb (Stratagene) and E. coli C43(DE3) (15Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) were used as hosts in the cloning and expression, respectively. S. gordonii ATCC 10558 andS. mutans ATCC 25175 were obtained from the Culture Collection of the University of Göteborg (Sweden) and the Institute of Dentistry (University of Turku, Finland), respectively. The E. coli strains were grown in 2× YT broth or on LA plates (16Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added when required. Genes for Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase were expressed in E. coli under the inducible phage T7 promoter by making use of the pET system. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from both streptococcal strains as described by Ushiroet al. (17Ushiro I. Lumb S.M. Aduse-Opuku J. Ferretti J.J. Russell R.R.B. J. Dent. Res. 1991; 70: 1422-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The open reading frames encoding Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase were amplified by PCR using a 5′-sense oligonucleotide primer containing a restriction site for NcoI and a 3′-reverse complement primer with a BamHI site. The PCR product was purified by using the Wizard DNA Clean-up system, digested withNcoI and BamHI, and ligated into the vector pET-15b. In creating the NcoI site, a T → G mutation after the initiation codon (ATG) was made both in S. gordonii andS. mutans PPase genes. After ligating the PCR products into the vector, the mutations were reversed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, and the produced DNA constructions were transformed into E. coli XL2blueb and E. coli C43(DE3) for DNA sequencing and expression, respectively. The expression was induced for 5–6 h by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. B-PPase was expressed in E. coli as described by Shintani et al. (11Shintani T. Uchiumi T. Yonezawa T. Salminen A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Hachimori A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase were purified to homogeneity by DEAE fast flow ion exchange column chromatography in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2 followed by gel filtration on Superdex 200 prep grade in 0.15 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 15 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm MnCl2. B-PPase was additionally chromatographed on a phenyl-Sepharose column that was equilibrated with 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4 in the buffer used for the ion exchange chromatography and eluted with a downward gradient of (NH4)2SO4 concentration. Enzyme purity was checked by electrophoresis in 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.55% SDS using the Phast System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Metal ions were removed from the enzyme stocks (30–50 mg/ml) as follows. The enzyme solution was diluted 20-fold with 83 mmTES/KOH buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2 mm EDTA and 17 mm KCl, incubated for 2 days (B-PPase) or 4 days (Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase) at 4 °C and subjected to two 40-fold dilution/reconcentration cycles in a Centricon YM-30 centrifugal filter device (Amicon) using 83 mm TES/KOH buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 μm EGTA and 17 mm KCl. Stock PPase solutions and other solutions used in experiments involving long incubations were sterilized by passing them through a 0.2-μm filter. Concentrations of B-PPase, Sg-PPase, and Sm-PPase were determined on the basis of extinction coefficients ∈2800.1% of 0.264, 0.343, and 0.307, calculated from the amino acid composition using the program ProtParam and the subunit molecular masses of 34.0, 33.5 and 33.4 kDa, respectively, calculated from the amino acid sequences (11Shintani T. Uchiumi T. Yonezawa T. Salminen A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Hachimori A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The above value of ∈2800.1% for B-PPase was confirmed by direct measurement of the absorbance of the solution prepared from dried and weighed enzyme. The Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), standardized against the above method, was sometimes employed as an alternative to direct measurement of the absorbance. Rates of PPi hydrolysis were determined from continuous recordings of Pi liberation obtained using an automatic Pi analyzer (19Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by adding enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out in a Spinco E instrument (Beckman) with scanning at 280 nm. Sedimentation velocity was measured at 48,000–60,000 rpm, and the sedimentation coefficient, s 20,w, was calculated using a standard procedure (20Chervenka C.H. Methods for the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Spinco Division of Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA1972Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium was attained at 16,000 rpm for 16 h or at 24,000 rpm for 10 h, and the molecular mass was calculated according to Chernyak and Magretova (21Chernyak B.Ya. Magretova N.N. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume at 25 °C was calculated from the amino acid composition and found to be 0.735, 0.729, and 0.730 cm3/g for B-PPase, Sg-PPase, and Sm-PPase, respectively. Mg2+ and Mn2+binding was assayed by equilibrium microdialysis in combination with atomic absorption spectroscopy to measure Mg2+ and Mn2+ content in the dialysis chambers (22Käpylä J. Hyytiä T. Lahti R. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Except where noted, all activity and binding measurements were performed at 25 °C in the medium containing 83 mmTES/KOH buffer, pH 7.2, 50 μm EGTA, and 17 mmKCl. For incubations with Mg2+, EGTA concentrations were increased to 0.5 mm. Bovine serum albumin was added at a concentration of 1 mg/ml to all incubation media, except for those used in sedimentation and equilibrium dialysis. Equations 1 and 2, derived from Scheme I, describe the activity (A) of an equilibrium mixture of dimer (D) and monomer (M) as a function of enzyme concentration at a zero or fixed concentration of divalent metal ion. A Dand A M are the specific activities of dimer and monomer, respectively, [E]t is the total enzyme concentration, expressed in monomers, αD is the fraction of dimeric enzyme, k d andk a are the rate constants, andK d =k d/k a is the dissociation constant. ka2M⇌Dkd SCHEME I.

Equation 5 is an implicit extended mass balance equation for metal. The second and third terms on the right side of Equation 5 correspond to protein-bound and EGTA-bound metal, respectively, [EGTA]t is the total concentration of EGTA in the system (50 μm), and K MEGTA is the dissociation constant for its complex with Mn2+. This treatment implies that only dimer can bind Mn2+, which has a dual effect on activity;Mn2+ both increases the amount of dimer (by decreasing K d ) and further activates it (by increasing A d). Equations 1 and 2 or Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 were simultaneously fit to data with the program SCIENTIST (MicroMath).

Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). The putative open reading frames of Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase were amplified by PCR. By sequencing the genes we noticed Sg-PPase to have four differences from the gene-deduced amino acid sequences found from GenBankTM; positions 109, 135, 137, and 166 are occupied by Ser, Gly, Pro, and Val (the corresponding codons are AGT, GGC, CCA, and GTC), respectively, rather than by Asn, Ser, Ser, and Ala, as found in GenBankTM. These differences were reproduced in two independent PCR amplifications, ruling out possible mutations during gene manipulations. The PCR products expressed under phage T7 promoter in E. coli yielded transformants with about 100-fold higher PPase activity than the host strain, clearly indicating that the two open reading frames encode PPases. Because of the high expression level, the recombinant enzymes were easily purified to homogeneity by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, the first of these steps readily separating the chromosome-encoded E. coli PPase from the streptococcal PPases. From 50 to 100 mg of pure enzymes were obtained from 1 liter of cell culture, corresponding to about 5 g of cell paste. The sedimentation coefficients measured for the B. subtilis and the two streptococcal PPases in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ by the sedimentation velocity method were within 3.5–4.1 S (TableI). In the absence of the divalent metal ions (2 mm EDTA present), s 20,wdecreased markedly for B-PPase and less markedly for Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase, indicating dissociation into lower molecular mass species.Table ISedimentation coefficientsEnzymeEnzyme concentrations 20,w2 mm EDTA1.5 mm MgCl21.5 mm MnCl210 mm MnCl2μmSB-PPase262.43.53.93.8Sg-PPase203.13.93.84.0Sm-PPase232.93.94.1Before each run, the enzymes were preincubated for 1–3 h (B-PPase) or 3 days (Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase) in the buffer containing the indicated additions.

Open table in a new tab Before each run, the enzymes were preincubated for 1–3 h (B-PPase) or 3 days (Sg-PPase and Sm-PPase) in the buffer containing the indicated additions. The s 20,w values are precise to ±0.2 S. The sedimentation equilibrium method gave molecular masses of 63 ± 3 kDa for B-PPase and 68 ± 5 kDa for Sg-PPase in the presence of 1.5 mm MnCl2 (Fig.1) and 32 ± 2 kDa for B-PPase in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. The molecular masses of B-PPase and Sg-PPase dimers predicted from their amino acid sequences (11Shintani T. Uchiumi T. Yonezawa T. Salminen A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Hachimori A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are 68.0 and 67.1 kDa, respectively. These proteins are therefore clearly dimers in the presence of MnCl2, but B-PPase dissociates into monomers in the absence of the metal ions. The assumption of a monomeric or trimeric structure in the presence of MnCl2resulted in a poor fit (Fig. 1). The equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of enzyme can be studied by measuring its specific activity as a function enzyme concentration if the specific activities of the oligomeric forms differ and their interconversion is slow on the time scale of enzyme assay (24Kurganov B.I. Allosteric Enzymes: Kinetic Behavior. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 151-248Google Scholar). Earlier, we used this approach in studies of E. coli PPase variants with weakened quaternary structure (25Baykov A.A. Dudarenkov V.Yu. Käpylä J. Salminen T. Hyytiä T. Kasho V.N. Husgafvel S.

The specific activities of the three PPases under study increased with increasing enzyme concentration in the stock solution containing 2 mmEDTA (no free divalent metal ion) or 1.5 mmMg2+ and remained unchanged if the stock solution contained 1.5 mm Mn2+ (Fig.2). The activity values shown, except for the Sm-PPase-EDTA curve (see below), correspond to equilibrium, as indicated by comparison with similar curves obtained after 1 and 2 days of incubation (not shown; see also Fig. 4 below). Three sources of evidence indicated that the profiles for B-PPase and Sg-PPase incubated with EDTA and the profiles for all three PPases incubated with Mg2+ in Fig. 2 describe a monomer-dimer equilibrium. First, they obeyed Equations 1 and 2 derived for such an equilibrium. Second, the enzymes preincubated at low concentration could be completely reactivated upon the addition of 3.5 mm MnCl2, as illustrated in Fig. 3 for Sg-PPase. Moreover, the reactivation rate increased with increasing enzyme concentration, exhibiting half-times of 14 and 1.4 min at enzyme concentrations of 1.8 and 18 nm, respectively, as expected for the second-order reaction of dimer formation from monomers. By contrast, the half-times would be similar for a first-order reaction, involving only one molecule of the reactant. Third, these findings agree with the sedimentation data above, showing thats 20,w is greater in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ than in the presence of EDTA at 20–26 μm enzyme concentration (Table I).Figure 4Time courses of PPase activity during incubation with Mg2+ (open circles), Mn2+ (triangles), or EDTA (closed circles). For the incubation with Mn2+, stock solution of B-PPase (2.4 mm) was diluted to 26 μm using the buffer supplemented with 1.5 mmMnCl2, and aliquots were withdrawn over time for activity assay as in Fig. 2. In all other cases, stock solutions of B-PPase, Sg-PPase, and Sm-PPase (2.4, 3.2, and 1.1 mm enzyme concentrations, respectively) were diluted to 20 μm with the buffer supplemented with 50 μm EGTA and then further diluted within 2 min to 0.1 μm with the buffer supplemented with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm MnCl2, or 2 mm EDTA.

Aliquots were withdrawn in time and assayed for PPase activity as in Fig. 2. Thelines are drawn according to second-order kinetics using thek a values given in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activity of Sm-PPase preincubated with EDTA was only partially restored upon the addition of MnCl2, indicating irreversible inactivation during the incubation. Interestingly, the inactivation was significant only at [E]t > 50 μm and increased with increasing [E]t , suggesting the occurrence of enzyme aggregation. This explanation is supported by the observation that Sm-PPase, but not B-PPase or Sg-PPase, could be precipitated by heating its solution above 30 °C. Three immediate inferences can be made from the data in Figs. 2 and 3and the parameter values listed in TableII. First, dimers are more active than monomers. Second, Mg2+ and, especially, Mn2+stabilize dimer versus monomer (compare theK d values), primarily due to a change ink a. Dimer stability is the lowest with B-PPase. Third, the A D values are low and similar in magnitude with Mg2+ and EDTA (at least for B-PPase and Sg-PPase) but high with Mn2+, indicating that Mn2+ activates dimer, whereas Mg2+ does not.Table IIParameters for monomer-dimer equilibriumMetal ion presentA MA DK dk dk as−1s−1μmh−1μm−1h−1B-PPaseNone2.2 ± 0.1130 ± 20440 ± 1009.5 ± 1.00.022Mg2+2.5 ± 0.4140 ± 100.46 ± 0.032.9 ± 0.46.3Mn2+900 ± 40<0.001<0.12120 ± 10Sg-PPaseNone3.8 ± 0.7310 ± 1093 ± 100.27 ± 0.010.0029Mg2+<30270 ± 100.028 ± 0.0040.10 ± 0.023.6Mn2+1170 ± 80<0.001<11210 ± 60Sm-PPaseNone5 ± 10.22 ± 0.01Mg2+<2092 ± 20.008 ± 0.002Mn2+780 ± 40<0.001<0.6540 ± 100Parameter values were calculated from the dependencies shown in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, except for the values of k d in the presence of Mn2+ and values of k a in the presence of EDTA and Mg2+, which were calculated ask a K d andk d /K d , respectively. Open table in a new tab Parameter values were calculated from the dependencies shown in Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, except for the values of k d in the presence of Mn2+ and values of k a in the presence of EDTA and Mg2+, which were calculated ask a K d andk d /K d , respectively. Fig.4 shows the time courses of activity upon dilution of the EDTA-treated PPases into media containing EDTA, Mg2+, or Mn2+. In all cases EDTA stimulated inactivation, and Mn2+ stimulated activation, whereas the effect of Mg2+ was variable and much smaller. The inactivation by Mg2+ and EDTA proceeded on the time scale of hours, whereas the activation by Mn2+ was complete in 30 s, except for a small slower phase seen with Sm-PPase. Importantly, the enzymes were predominantly dimeric at the start of incubation (Fig. 2); therefore the major activation is not due to stimulation of dimer formation, except for the slower phase seen with Sm-PPase (Fig. 4). By contrast, the inactivation clearly results from dimer dissociation into monomers because the data in Fig. 2 indicated that the PPases equilibrated with EDTA or Mg2+ at the concentrations used for Fig. 4 represent a mixture of dimer and monomer. A similar pattern of inactivation by EDTA was reported for wild-type B-PPase (12Kuhn N.J. Ward S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Values for k d (Scheme I) estimated from the data in Fig. 4 are summarized in Table II. The Mn2+ concentration dependence of the equilibrium activity (Fig. 5) could be described by assuming that Mn2+ selectively binds to dimer (with a dissociation constant of K M1), thus shifting the equilibrium in Scheme I in the direction of dimer, and further activates it. Estimates of K M1 (TableIII) were obtained by fitting EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 to the data in Fig. 5. Values of A D“ andK M1 were treated as adjustable parameters in these fittings, and values of A M,A D′. and K d,0 were constrained to the values of A M,A D, and K d determined above in the presence of EDTA (Table II). For Sm-PPase, noK d,0 and A D′ values are available (see above); therefore, K d,0 was set to zero, and A D′ was also treated as an adjustable parameter, allowing estimation of the upper limit forK M1. Remarkably, the values ofK M1 estimated for all three PPases are extremely low (Table III), characteristic of metalloenzymes.Table IIIMetal binding constants for the high affinity siteEnzymeKM1Mn2+3-aEstimated from Fig. 5.K M1, obs3-bEstimated from Fig. 6 for Sg-PPase and similar dependencies for other PPases using only the data measured at <1 and <100 μm free Mn2+ and Mg2+concentrations, respectively.Mn2+Mg2+nmnmμmB-PPase0.50 ± 0.074.7 ± 2.288 ± 6Sg-PPase0.20 ± 0.061.7 ± 0.69 ± 2Sm-PPase<30.7 ± 0.216 ± 33-a Estimated from Fig. 5.3-b Estimated from Fig. 6 for Sg-PPase and similar dependencies for other PPases using only the data measured at <1 and <100 μm free Mn2+ and Mg2+concentrations, respectively. Open table in a new tab As measured by equilibrium dialysis, dimeric Sg-PPase has one high affinity and two or three low affinity sites for Mn2+ and Mg2+ per subunit (Fig.6). The binding curves for both cations exhibited saturation, not clearly seen in Fig. 6 because of the logarithmic scaling of the metal concentration axis. The high affinity site demonstrated a marked preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+, whereas the low affinity sites bound Mn2+with only slightly greater strength than they bound Mg2+. Very similar binding curves were obtained for B-PPase and Sm-PPase (not shown). The dissociation constant K M1,obscharacterizing metal binding to the high affinity site was estimated from these data using only points measured at <1 μm for Mn2+ and <100 μm for Mg2+ (TableIII). The values of K M1,obs thus obtained did not vary much between the three PPases, and the values ofK M1,obs for Mn2+ binding to B-PPase and Sg-PPase were slightly greater than the corresponding values ofK M1 determined above. This difference appears to result from the presence of appreciable amounts of monomer, which lacks the high affinity site possessed by the dimer, at low metal ion concentrations. For the same reason, values ofK M1,obs for Mg2+ shown in Table IIImay also excee"
https://openalex.org/W1583795182,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an important component of galaxies because it fuels star formation and the accretion of gas onto active galactic nuclei (AGN), the two processes that can generate the large infrared luminosities of gas-rich galaxies. Observations of spectral-line emission from the tracer molecule carbon monoxide (CO) are used to probe the properties of this gas. But the lines that have been studied in the local Universe-mostly the lower rotational transitions of J = 1 --> 0 and J = 2 --> 1-have hitherto been unobservable in high-redshift galaxies. Instead, higher transitions have been used, although the densities and temperatures required to excite these higher transitions may not be reached by much of the gas. As a result, past observations may have underestimated the total amount of molecular gas by a substantial amount. Here we report the discovery of large amounts of low-excitation molecular gas around the infrared-luminous quasar APM08279+5255 at redshift z = 3.91, using the two lowest excitation lines of 12 CO (J = 1 --> 0 and J = 2 --> 1). The maps confirm the presence of hot and dense gas near the nucleus, and reveal an extended reservoir of molecular gas with low excitation that is 10 to 100 times more massive than the gas traced by the higher-excitation observations. This raises the possibility that significant amounts of low-excitation molecular gas may exist in the environments of high-redshift (z > 3) galaxies."

Outward currents generated by reverse NCKX2 exchange depended on external Ca2+ with a K 12 of 1.4 or 101 µm without or with 1 mm Mg2+, and on external K+ with a K 12 of about 12 or 36 mm with choline or Li+ as counter ion, respectively. Na+ inhibited outward currents with aK 12 of about 60 mm. Inward currents generated by forward NCKX2 exchange depended upon external Na+ with a K 12 of 30 mmand a Hill coefficient of 2.8.

Na+/Ca2+ exchanger tetramethylammonium K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger tetraethylammonium picofarad Cytosolic Ca2+ plays a key role in intracellular signaling in virtually all types of animal cells.

The second member of the K+-dependent family of Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, NCKX2 (geneSLC24A2), was cloned first from rat brain (18Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J.

NCKX2 and NCX1 are co-expressed in many brain regions, and in some cases are probably present together within the same neurons (18Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar), however, is not yet clearly understood and will depend upon a detailed knowledge of their individual transport properties. Functional information for rat brain NCKX2 is quite limited, and many properties have been inferred largely from the similarity of this molecule to the retinal rod exchanger, NCKX1. Although NCKX1 function has been characterized extensively in situ (6Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Schnetkamp P.P.M. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C153-C157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the properties of the isolated protein molecule are not as well understood. Indeed, expression from cloned NCKX1 has resulted in a number of reports of quite different properties, ranging from K+-independent exchange currents (25Navangione A. Rispoli G. Gabellini N. Carafoli E. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to functional silencing of the bovine clone (26Cooper C.B. Winkfein R.J. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe experiments designed to characterize the transport and electrophysiological properties of rat brain NCKX2. Whole-cell patch clamp analysis was used on transfected cells to characterize the cation dependences of NCKX2 and to measure its ionic stoichiometry. A preliminary account of these findings has been presented previously in abstract form (27Lytton J. Dong H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 18AGoogle Scholar). All chemicals were of analytical grade or better and were obtained from either Fisher, BDH, or Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. The rat brain NCKX2 cDNA tagged near the N terminus with the FLAG epitope in the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) was as described previously (18Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4115-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the green fluorescent protein was from Life Technologies, Inc. (pGreen Lantern-1). Rat heart NCX1.1 cDNA was in the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney cells (the tsA201 variant of HEK293 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Co-transfection of Qiagen-purified FLAG-NCKX2 and green fluorescent protein cDNAs was performed using a standard calcium-phosphate precipitation protocol with BES buffer essentially as described previously (18Tsoi M. Rhee K.-H. Bungard D. Li X.-F. Lee S.-L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4115-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The FLAG-NCKX2 cDNA, cloned in the reverse orientation in the pMT2 vector, was used in control transfections. After co-transfection, the cells were cultured for 24 h, washed once to remove the precipitate, and provided with fresh medium, and the culture was continued for an additional 24 h to allow efficient protein expression from plasmid DNA. Finally, the cells were trypsinized, re-plated into 35-mm dishes, and used for electrophysiological recordings 2 h to 3 days later. Electrophysiological measurements were carried out using the conventional whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp recording technique (28Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15145) Google Scholar). Pipettes were prepared using a pipette puller (Sutter model P-87 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller) from borosilicate glass capillaries (Corning 8161 glass, outer diameter, 1.5 mm; inner diameter, 1.1 mm, from Warner Instrument Co.) and fire-polished to a resistance of 3–4 megohms (Narishige MF-830 microforge) when filled with pipette solution (see below). A seal resistance of 2–10 gigaohms was formed by first applying gentle negative pressure, and then a brief stronger suction, to the inside of the pipette to rupture the patch membrane and enter whole-cell mode. Voltage clamp was conducted with a patch amplifier (Axopatch 200B; Axon Instruments, Inc). Reverse and forward Na+/Ca2++ K+ exchange currents were recorded using a holding potential of 0 mV unless specified otherwise. Gluconate-containing, but not chloride-containing, pipette solutions (see below) resulted in a liquid junction potential of −10 mV that was unaffected by the nature of the bath perfusion solution and was corrected for in the applied potentials. Current traces were low pass-filtered at 100 Hz and sampled at 1 kHz using pClamp software (version 8.0, Axon Instruments, Inc.). Changes in current were normalized with respect to either cell size as judged from cell capacitance (the average capacitance of 50 cells examined in this study was 32.5 ± 1.0 pF) or percentage of maximal current. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were recorded from a holding potential of −20 mV with a ramp voltage protocol (dV/dt = 0.5 V/s) over the range −100 to +80 mV. Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchange currents were isolated by digital subtraction of currents elicited under conditions where the exchanger does not function (bath perfusion of LiCl and EGTA) from currents elicited under conditions compatible with exchanger function. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). External solutions contained various combinations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl (and in some cases, choline Cl) totaling 145 mm, either 0 or 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, 10 mmHEPES/tetramethylammonium (TMA), and 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 (free [Ca2+] about 1 nm). External [Ca2+] was varied from 0.3 to 30 µm using 10 mm EGTA (osmotically balanced by reducing the LiCl concentration appropriately) and various amounts of CaCl2, calculated using the method described by Fabiato (29Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) or by unbuffered addition of CaCl2 above this range. For the experiments examining the influence of external K+ on inward currents and for reversal potential experiments, 20 mmtetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) was included in the external solution (replacing LiCl). TEA-Cl had no influence on the magnitude of Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchange currents (data not shown). In all cases, the osmolarity was measured and maintained at 280 mOsm/kg (5100C Vapor Pressure Osmometer; Wescor, Inc.) by altering the precise concentration of LiCl used. Reverse exchange (outward) currents were recorded using a pipette solution containing 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm TEA-Cl, 1 mm Na2ATP, 8 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES/TMA, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. Free [Ca2+] under these condition is less than 0.5 nm. In some experiments a free [Ca2+] of 1 µm was generated by adding 4.28 mm CaCl2 to the above solution and readjusting the pH. Forward exchange (inward) currents were measured with a pipette solution containing 100 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm TEA-Cl, 1 mmNa2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, 9.68 mmCaCl2 ([Ca2+]free = 5 µm), 10 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES/TMA, pH 7.2. For studies on the influence of external K+ on inward currents using near-physiological conditions, the above pipette solution was supplemented with 3 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2. Reversal potential experiments employed a pipette solution containing 18 mm NaCl, 100 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm TEA-Cl, 1 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm EGTA, 6.40 mm CaCl2([Ca2+]free = 0.3 µm), 10 mmd-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES/TMA, pH 7.2. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using pClamp software (Clampfit, version 8.0, Axon Instruments, Inc.). Currents were measured at the peak, and all data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using an unpaired Student's t test. The ionic dependence of currents was fit using non-linear regression to various models with either Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) or MacCurveFit (Kevin Raner Software, Victoria, Australia). Equation 1 shows a cooperative activation model, I=Imax/(1+(K1/2/[Ion])nH)(Eq. 1) where I is current (usually normalized); Imax is the maximum current; K 12 is the concentration of ion causing half-maximal activation of current; [Ion] is the concentration of the ion being varied, and n H is the Hill coefficient. In some cases, a simple activation model was used, in which n H in Equation 1 was set to unity. Equation 2 gives a cooperative inhibition model,I=(Imax−I∞)/(1+[Ion]/K1/2)nH)+I∞(Eq. 2) where the terms have the same meaning as in the activation model, except that K 12 is the concentration giving half-maximal inhibition, and I∞ is the plateau current at infinite ion concentration. The thermodynamic equilibrium of NCKX2, when the net work per transport cycle is 0, leads to a reversal potential (E Na-Ca-K), equal to the weighted sum of the Nernstian membrane potentials for the transported ions according to the Equation 3 (Ref. 3Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) as follows,ENa−Ca−K=nNaENa−2nCaECa−nKEK(nNa−2nCa−nK)(Eq. 3) where E Na, E Ca, and E K are the Nernstian equilibrium potentials, and n Na, n Ca, andn K are the number of ions that bind and are moved per unitary transport cycle for Na+, Ca2+, and K+, respectively. Substituting for the individual Nernst potentials in Equation 3 gives Equation 4,ENa-Ca-K=1(nNa−2nCa−nK)2.303RTF(nNalog([Na]o/[Na]i)−nCalog([Ca]o/[Ca]i)−nKlog([K]i/[K]o))(Eq. 4) where R, T, and F are the gas constant, temperature in K, and Faraday's constant, respectively. To determine the stoichiometry, nX, for an individual ion, X, the strategy is to measureE Na-Ca-K at various different extracellular (bath) concentrations of X ([X]o), while holding the concentrations of all other ions constant on both sides of the membrane. Under these conditions, Equation 4 can be recast as Equation 5,ENa-Ca-K=nX(nNa−2nCa−nK)2.303RTFlog([X]o)+B(Eq. 5) where B is an experimental constant, determined by the stoichiometry and the relevant set of fixed ionic concentrations. The denominator term in this equation (n Na − 2n Ca − n K) is the net number of charges moved per transport cycle. Thus, a plot ofE Na-Ca-K against log([X]o) will have a slope that is a measure of n X, the number of ions X, that move per unitary charge in each transport cycle. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to record currents attributable to rat brain NCKX2 expressed in HEK293 cells. Large outward currents were generated when cells internally dialyzed with high Na+ concentrations were held at 0 mV and exposed to bath solutions containing both 1 mmCa2+ and 40 mm K+ together but not with either alone (Fig. 1). The NCKX2 currents, which could be elicited repetitively, reached a peak magnitude of 51 ± 6 pA (n = 10) in about 1 s and then decayed over a few tens of seconds. NCKX2-induced currents were not significantly affected by external application of 20 mm TEA-Cl, 1 µm verapamil, or 1 mm BaCl2 (data not shown). When HEK293 cells were transfected with rat heart NCX1.1, Ca2+-dependent outward currents recorded under the same conditions were independent of K+ (Fig. 1). The NCX1.1 currents usually had a larger peak magnitude than those of NCKX2 but also reached peak very quickly and decayed slowly with time. When either untransfected or control-transfected (NCKX2 cloned in the reverse orientation) HEK293 cells were analyzed under identical conditions, they did not produce any obvious steady-state currents (Fig. 1), although sometimes a 1–2 pA solution change artifact was observed. The voltage dependence of outward currents was examined as illustrated in Fig. 2. NCKX2 and control transfected cells held at 0 mV and perfused as described above were subjected to a voltage ramp protocol ranging from −80 to +80 mV. Under these conditions, which only permit outward Na+/Ca2++ K+ exchange currents, NCKX2-transfected cells displayed currents with an ohmic dependence on voltage, their magnitude increasing toward positive potentials. We did not observe any significant voltage-dependent currents in control or untransfected cells, as illustrated by the very shallow steady-state current-voltage (I-V) relationship with a reversal potential of 0 mV. Thus, the outward current observed in NCKX2-transfected cells appears to correspond to the electrogenic movement of Na+ through the molecule in exchange for Ca2+ and K+. Furthermore, under the conditions used to examine NCKX2 currents, control HEK293 cells had no significant potentially interfering membrane ion conductances. To evaluate whether intracellular Ca2+ played a role in the regulation of Na+/Ca2+ + K+exchange currents generated by the rat brain NCKX2, as observed for NCX1 using giant excised patches (30Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), two different concentrations of free Ca2+ were included in the pipette solutions for outward current recordings. Fig. 3 shows the [Ca2+]i dependence of both rat heart NCX1.1 and rat brain NCKX2 outward currents elicited by a switch from Li+ solution to one containing 40 mmK+ plus 1 mm Ca2+. Significant currents were observed in NCX1.1-transfected cells only when the pipette contained 1 µm Ca2+ but not when [Ca2+] in the pipette was essentially 0 (<0.5 nm). In contrast, large outward currents were observed with NCKX2-transfected cells regardless of the presence or absence of Ca2+ in the pipette. Nevertheless, the presence of Ca2+ in the pipette resulted in a small, but significant, increase in the magnitude of the observed NCKX2 currents. This pipette Ca2+-dependent difference persisted using a variety of different extracellular K+ and Ca2+concentrations (data not shown). The kinetic cation dependence of NCKX2 at the extracellular face of the molecule was examined by subjecting NCKX2-transfected cells to a series of perfusion switches between solutions in which either K+ or Ca2+was varied and recording outward currents carried by Na+movement (reverse transport mode) using pipette solutions containing 1 µm [Ca2+]free. Fig.4 illustrates the external Ca2+ dependence of outward currents generated by NCKX2 in the presence of constant external K+ (40 mm) and either the presence or the absence of 1 mmMgCl2. Under these conditions, Ca2+ activated outward currents in a dose-dependent manner that fitted very well with a model for a single Ca2+ activation site with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.4 or 101 µm[Ca2+], in the absence or presence of Mg2+, respectively. Mg2+ alone (together with K+) was unable to induce outward currents, indicating that it could not substitute for Ca2+ at the transport site. Furthermore, Mg2+ was without any significant effect on the maximum peak current (1.4 ± 0.2 pA/pF (n = 10)versus 1.2 ± 0.2 pA/pF (n = 9);p > 0.25) measured in 0 mmMg2+ and 0.1 mm Ca2+ or in 1 mm Mg2+ and 5 mm Ca2+, respectively. This influence on apparent affinity and not on maximum current is consistent with a competitive interaction between Ca2+ and Mg2+, as reported previously for the bovine rod Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchanger (31Schnetkamp P.P.M. Li X.B. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments were carried out to examine the external K+ dependence of NCKX2 function, recording outward currents under constant and saturating external Ca2+ (1 mm), using LiCl or choline Cl to maintain osmolarity, either with or without 1 mm MgCl2. As illustrated in Fig. 5, raising external [K+] in the presence of LiCl increased the outward currents in a dose-dependent fashion. However, it appeared that the K+ effect did not reach saturation, even when external [K+] was raised to 120 mm. The K+ dependence was not significantly altered by the presence or absence of 1 mm Mg2+ in the solution (data not shown). To evaluate the possibility that external Li+might affect the K+ dependence of Na+/Ca2++K+ exchange currents as suggested for rod NCKX1 (31Schnetkamp P.P.M. Li X.B. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration-response curve for K+ was repeated with LiCl replaced by choline Cl. As shown in Fig. 5, this substitution shifted the concentration-response curve for K+ to the left, reducing the apparentK 12 about 3-fold. These data are consistent with a model where K+ interacts at a single site on the external face of NCKX2 with an apparent dissociation constant of 12 mm and that Li+ can compete for binding to this site, although only K+ is competent for transport. We also investigated the ability of externally applied Na+to inhibit outward NCKX2 currents recorded under constant external [Ca2+] (1 mm) and [K+] (40 mm). As illustrated in Fig.6, raising external [Na+] resulted in a concentration-dependent decreased in the outward current, with a K 12 of about 60 mm that may reflect competition of Na+ at the Ca2+- and/or K+-binding sites, as anticipated from earlier studies on the rod NCKX (31Schnetkamp P.P.M. Li X.B. Basu D.K. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schnetkamp P.P.M. Szerencsei R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic external ionic dependence of inward NCKX2 currents (forward transport mode) was also investigated. Fig. 7 illustrates the external Na+ dependence of the inward currents generated by NCKX2. The data were fit to a cooperative activation model that resulted in a calculated K 12 for Na+ of 30 mm and a Hill coefficient (n H) of 2.8. Such Na+-dependent inward currents were never observed with untransfected HEK293 cells or in recordings from NCKX2-transfected cells in which the patch pipette solution contained 5 mm EGTA. Thus, the currents we observed under these conditions must arise from the electrogenic inward movement of Na+ through the forward mode of NCKX2 transport. Local concentrations of extracellular K+ can rise significantly above the resting level of about 3–5 mm, close to actively firing neurons (33Ransom C.B. Ransom B.R. Sontheimer H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 522: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As extracellular K+has the potential to influence Ca2+ homeostasis through a kinetic effect on NCKX2, we decided to examine the K+dependence of forward NCKX2 exchange (inward currents) using two different conditions. The first was chosen, based on the data of Fig. 7above, to optimize stable inward currents. The second was chosen to mimic, as closely as practically possible, physiological levels of ions and membrane potential. As shown in Fig.8, increasing [K+] reduced inward currents by a maximum of 40%. The maximal effect of K+ was already seen at 1 mm under close-to-physiological conditions and did not change upon further addition. Under conditions optimized for inward currents, the K+ response was shifted to the right, but maximal effects were still seen by 10 mm. These data indicate that, in the physiological range of [K+] likely to be experienced close to the surface of neurons (3–10 mm or higher), there is only a modest kinetic effect of K+ on NCKX2 function. The overall operation of the rat brain NCKX2 exchanger depends not only on the kinetic properties examined above but also on thermodynamic properties. As we have demonstrated, NCKX2 function displayed absolute requirements for Na+, in exchange for Ca2+ and K+. Thus, the reversal potential of Na+/Ca2+ + K+ exchange (E Na-Ca-K, the thermodynamic equilibrium point, at which no net transport takes place) is dependent only on the transport stoichiometry of the molecule, as described by Equations (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5)under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine the stoichiometry,n X, for an individual ion, X, the strategy is to measure the dependence ofE Na-Ca-K on the bath concentration ofX ([X]o). Under these conditions a plot of E Na-Ca-K against log of [X]o will have a slope that provides a measure of the number of ion"

Schwab U. Lemke H. Stein H. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 31: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). As a result, it is assumed that pKi-67 is involved in mitotic chromosome organization. pKi-67 is a convenient cell proliferation marker, since its expression is restricted to growing cells (2Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). Although the recent identification and characterization of a marsupial counterpart of pKi-67, which is referred to as chmadrin, suggests that pKi-67 plays some type of role in the organization of higher order chromatin structure (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J.

It was originally reported that the FHA domain constituted a region that has been conserved in a subset of forkhead-type transcription factors (4Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

The sequence profile has been reported for a variety of proteins with diverse functions (transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, etc.). In several instances, the FHA domain preferentially recognizes partner proteins when they are present in the phosphorylated form (5Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 6Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 7Boudrez A.

Moreover, the strong specificity of the FHA domain for phosphopeptides has been clearly demonstrated by binding assays with synthetic phosphopeptides (9Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is currently thought that the FHA domain is a general phosphopeptide recognition motif that is involved in certain phosphopeptide-mediated signal transduction pathways (10Li J. Lee G. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A search for the interaction partner(s) of the FHA domain of pKi-67, which could exist in the phosphorylated form, is an intriguing issue, since such interactions would constitute a significant component of the regulation of the cell cycle progression.In order to investigate this issue further, a two-hybrid screening from a HeLa cDNA library was carried out using the N-terminal portion of pKi-67 as bait. As a result, two novel molecules that bind to the FHA domain of pKi-67 have been isolated. In our previous study, we revealed that one of them was a novel kinesin-like protein, Hklp2 (8Sueishi M. Takagi M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28888-28892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, we report on the characterization of the other protein, which we refer to as NIFK (nucleolar protein interacting with the FHA domain of pKi-67). The interaction between human NIFK (hNIFK) and the FHA domain of pKi-67 occurs in a manner that is dependent on the mitosis-specific modification of hNIFK, which could include the phosphorylation of Thr-234 and Thr-238. Although the concrete function of hNIFK remains to be examined, the interaction found here provides some clues to our understanding of the relationship between the expression of pKi-67 and cell cycle progression. Moreover, the findings herein represent an example of a phosphopeptide recognition of the FHA domain and will contribute to a better understanding of the mode of action of the FHA domain.DISCUSSIONA novel protein, hNIFK, has been identified as a binding partner of the FHA domain of pKi-67. We also cloned the probable mouse counterpart, mNIFK. NIFK-related proteins from other organisms exist and include those from Saccharomyces cerevisiae(Z71386), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (AL023777),Caenorhabditis elegans (Z35663), Drosophila melanogaster (AE003739), and Arabidopsis thaliana(T48456). All these proteins show considerable similarity with respect to the RNA binding domains and moderate similarity in the flanking regions. It should be noted that Z71386, AL023777, and T48456lack the regions that correspond to the Ki-FHA binding region of hNIFK. Given the fundamental function of hNIFK, pKi-67 might have no function at all. The issue what is the “fundamental” function of hNIFK could be addressed by the analyses in genetically amenable organisms. From recent functional genomic analyses carried out after genome sequencing projects, aspects of the functions of hNIFK might be deduced. In fact, the systematic disruption of each gene in S. cerevisiae (19Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar) and the systematic RNA-mediated interference of each gene on chromosome III of C. elegans (20Gonczy P. Echeverri G. Oegema K. Coulson A. Jones S.J. Copley R.R. Duperon J. Oegema J. Brehm M. Cassin E. Hannak E. Kirkham M. Pichler S. Flohrs K. Goessen A. Leidel S. Alleaume A.M. Martin C. Ozlu N. Bork P. Hyman A.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) showed that NIFK-related molecules of both organisms were essential for viability. The detailed cellular function, however, remains to be determined. Considering the existence of the putative RNA binding domain and the nucleolar localization in interphase, hNIFK is thought to function in rRNA metabolism. Our preliminary observation indicates that hNIFK forms protein complexes, both in interphase and mitotic cell extracts. The identification of the components of such a complex might allow for a better understanding of the fundamental function of hNIFK.The findings here show that hNIFK interacts with Ki-FHA efficiently in mitosis, although a small population of hNIFK, which was uncharacterized, also interacts with Ki-FHA in other phases of the cell cycle. It is most likely that the Thr-234 and Thr-238 residues of hNIFK and their phosphorylation(s) are crucial for the interactions during mitosis. Since the interaction with pKi-67, as discussed above, appears to be dispensable for the fundamental function of NIFK-related proteins, NIFK-related proteins might have begun to utilize pKi-67 for some regulatory reasons or luxurious functions, as evolution progressed. Since pKi-67 harbors a potent activity for driving chromatin compaction at its C-terminal portion (LR domain) (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar), the putative activity of hNIFK might be regulated via chromatin compaction mediated by the LR domain of pKi-67. In vertebrate cells, entry into mitosis is accompanied by a global inhibition of transcription. Ribosomal genes (rDNA) are also silenced during mitosis, which is mainly under the control of Cdc2-cyclin B kinase (21Kuhn A. Vente A. Doree M. Grummt I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Heix J. Vente A. Voit R. Budde A. Michaelidis T.M. Grummt I.

It is tempting to speculate that hNIFK plays a role in rRNA synthesis and that the silencing of rDNA transcription during mitosis is accomplished through the mitosis-specific and phosphorylation-dependent interaction of hNIFK with pKi-67.The FHA domain has generated considerable interest, not only because of its nature as a signaling module, which functions through interactions with phosphorylated target molecules (10Li J.

Although the issue of whether this knowledge fits situations that actually occur in cells requires further testing, the identification of actual ligands of FHA domains and the mapping of biologically relevant FHA domain binding sites on these ligands have been accomplished only in a limited number of cases (5Stone J.M.

Further analysis of the interactions between Ki-FHA and NIFK, along with past studies (10Li J. Lee G. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might result in a much more general understanding of the mode of phosphopeptide recognition of FHA domains and thereby provide the basis for the development of novel classes of therapeutic agents that target FHA-mediated signal transduction pathways. The Ki-67 antigen (pKi-67), originally identified as the antigen for a monoclonal antibody raised against the nuclear extract from a Hodgkin's lymphoma-derived cell line, was characterized as a class of proteins that localize around mitotic chromosomes (1Gerdes J. Schwab U. Lemke H. Stein H. Int. J. Cancer. 1983; 31: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). As a result, it is assumed that pKi-67 is involved in mitotic chromosome organization. pKi-67 is a convenient cell proliferation marker, since its expression is restricted to growing cells (2Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). Although the recent identification and characterization of a marsupial counterpart of pKi-67, which is referred to as chmadrin, suggests that pKi-67 plays some type of role in the organization of higher order chromatin structure (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar), the actual role of pKi-67 in the cell cycle progression remains unclear. The N-terminal portion of pKi-67 is well conserved between human pKi-67 and chmadrin (62% identical) and contains a forkhead associated (FHA)1 domain. It was originally reported that the FHA domain constituted a region that has been conserved in a subset of forkhead-type transcription factors (4Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 347-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).

In fact, the systematic disruption of each gene in S. cerevisiae (19Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E. Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar) and the systematic RNA-mediated interference of each gene on chromosome III of C. elegans (20Gonczy P. Echeverri G. Oegema K. Coulson A. Jones S.J. Copley R.R. Duperon J. Oegema J. Brehm M. Cassin E. Hannak E. Kirkham M. Pichler S. Flohrs K. Goessen A. Leidel S. Alleaume A.M. Martin C. Ozlu N. Bork P. Hyman A.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) showed that NIFK-related molecules of both organisms were essential for viability. The detailed cellular function, however, remains to be determined. Considering the existence of the putative RNA binding domain and the nucleolar localization in interphase, hNIFK is thought to function in rRNA metabolism. Our preliminary observation indicates that hNIFK forms protein complexes, both in interphase and mitotic cell extracts. The identification of the components of such a complex might allow for a better understanding of the fundamental function of hNIFK. The findings here show that hNIFK interacts with Ki-FHA efficiently in mitosis, although a small population of hNIFK, which was uncharacterized, also interacts with Ki-FHA in other phases of the cell cycle. It is most likely that the Thr-234 and Thr-238 residues of hNIFK and their phosphorylation(s) are crucial for the interactions during mitosis. Since the interaction with pKi-67, as discussed above, appears to be dispensable for the fundamental function of NIFK-related proteins, NIFK-related proteins might have begun to utilize pKi-67 for some regulatory reasons or luxurious functions, as evolution progressed. Since pKi-67 harbors a potent activity for driving chromatin compaction at its C-terminal portion (LR domain) (3Takagi M. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2463-2472PubMed Google Scholar), the putative activity of hNIFK might be regulated via chromatin compaction mediated by the LR domain of pKi-67. In vertebrate cells, entry into mitosis is accompanied by a global inhibition of transcription. Ribosomal genes (rDNA) are also silenced during mitosis, which is mainly under the control of Cdc2-cyclin B kinase (21Kuhn A. Vente A. Doree M. Grummt I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Heix J. Vente A. Voit R. Budde A. Michaelidis T.M. Grummt I.

It is tempting to speculate that hNIFK plays a role in rRNA synthesis and that the silencing of rDNA transcription during mitosis is accomplished through the mitosis-specific and phosphorylation-dependent interaction of hNIFK with pKi-67. The FHA domain has generated considerable interest, not only because of its nature as a signaling module, which functions through interactions with phosphorylated target molecules (10Li J. Lee G. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but because of a link with cancer; genes that are mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS1) and the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (CHK2) encode FHA domain-containing proteins (24Bell D.W.

Although the issue of whether this knowledge fits situations that actually occur in cells requires further testing, the identification of actual ligands of FHA domains and the mapping of biologically relevant FHA domain binding sites on these ligands have been accomplished only in a limited number of cases (5Stone J.M.

Further analysis of the interactions between Ki-FHA and NIFK, along with past studies (10Li J. Lee G. Van Doren S.R. Walker J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4143-4149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might result in a much more general understanding of the mode of phosphopeptide recognition of FHA domains and thereby provide the basis for the development of novel classes of therapeutic agents that target FHA-mediated signal transduction pathways.

Interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin (IL)-1β play important, although not completely defined, roles in these mechanisms. Here, using the highly differentiated βTc-Tet insulin-secreting cell line, we showed that IFN-γ dose- and time-dependently suppressed insulin synthesis and glucose-stimulated secretion. As described previously IFN-γ, in combination with IL-1β, also induces inducible NO synthase expression and apoptosis (Dupraz, P., Cottet, S., Hamburger, F., Dolci, W., Felley-Bosco, E., and Thorens, B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 37672–37678). To assess the role of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in IFN-γ intracellular signaling, we stably overexpressed SOCS-1 (suppressor of cytokinesignaling-1) in the β cell line. We demonstrated that SOCS-1 suppressed cytokine-induced STAT-1 phosphorylation and increased cellular accumulation. This was accompanied by a suppression of the effect of IFN-γ on: (i) reduction in insulin promoter-luciferase reporter gene transcription, (ii) decrease in insulin mRNA and peptide content, and (iii) suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, SOCS-1 also suppressed the cellular effects that require the combined presence of IL-1β and IFN-γ: induction of nitric oxide production and apoptosis. Together our data demonstrate that IFN-γ is responsible for the cytokine-induced defect in insulin gene expression and secretion and that this effect can be completely blocked by constitutive inhibition of the Janus kinase/STAT pathway.

The activation of leukocytes, following interactions with β cells autoantigens, results in the synthesis of cell-surface and secreted mediators such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-1β. These participate in the induction of the insulin-secreting β cell dysfunction and destruction (2Kay T.W.H. Thomas H.E. Harrison L.C. Allison J. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that these cytokines have been found in the insulitis of non-obese diabetic mice and in the pancreas of type I diabetic patients, their exact role in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes remain unclear (for a review, see Ref. 3Rabinovitch A. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Insulitis in non-obese diabetic mice (4Katz J.D. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 1995; 268: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) as well as in patients with type I diabetes (5Kallmann B.A. Huther M. Tubes M. Feldkamp J. Bertrams J. Gries F.A.

The role of IFN-γ in the development of type I diabetes has been evaluated in several studies, but its role in diabetes induction is not clearly defined. For instance, β cell injury was limited, and diabetes did not occur in the RIP-LCMV diabetic mouse model when the mice were deficient in IFN-γ (7von Herrath M.G. Oldstone M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Similarly, Wang et al.(8Wang B. Andre I. Gonzalez A. Katz J.D. Aguet M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13844-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) reported that non-obese diabetic mice lacking IFN-γ receptor showed a marked inhibition of insulitis and no signs of diabetes. In contrast, others have shown that deficiency in IFN-γ (9Hultgren B. Huang X. Dybdal N. Stewart T.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in IFN-γ receptor (10Thomas H.E. Parker J.L. Schreiber R.D. Kay T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) impact only mildly on the onset of diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice. Whether IFN-γ affects islet β cells directly or indirectly through the activation of other cells such as cytotoxic T-cells or through the up-regulation of other cytotoxic factors is also not firmly established. In vitro, many direct effects of IFN-γ on β cells have been demonstrated, including the up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class I (11Campbell I.L. Harrison L.C. Mol. Biol. Med. 1990; 7: 299-309PubMed Google Scholar, 12Baldeon M.E. Neece D.J. Nandi D. Monaco J.J. Gaskins H.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (13Yagi N. Yokono K. Amano K. Nagata M. Tsukamoto K. Hasegawa Y. Yoneda R. Okamoto N.

Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that NO production could cause β cells destruction. However, in human β cells, the role of NO is not established and may be in fact only partly, or not at all, involved in cell death (15Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Welsh N. Cetkovic-Cvrlje M. Nieman A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In mouse β cells or insulinomas, NO appears to be only one of the mechanisms by which these cells are destroyed (18Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Strynadka K. Schulz R. Rabinovitch A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1006-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Zumsteg U. Frigerio S. Hollander G.A. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Another effect of IFN-γ is to impair insulin secretion, as shown with rodent islets testedin vitro (12Baldeon M.E. Neece D.J. Nandi D. Monaco J.J. Gaskins H.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Rabinovitch A. Suarez-Pinzon W.L. Shi Y. Morgan A.R. Bleackley R.C. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In human islets, however, no decrease in insulin mRNA and peptide levels has been observed, whereas a weak reduction in GSIS was measured (15Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Welsh N. Cetkovic-Cvrlje M. Nieman A. Geller D.A. Pipeleers D.G. Bendtzen K. Hellerstrom C. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1968-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway initiated by binding of IFN-γ to its receptor leads first to JAK1 and JAK2 activation and their association with the IFN-γ receptor (21Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 22Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

JAK kinases then phosphorylate IFN-γ receptor on specific tyrosines, which serve as docking sites for the transcription factor STAT-1. Upon activation by phosphorylation, STAT-1 molecules homodimerize and translocate into the nucleus to activate the transcription of target genes. Negative regulation of JAK/STAT signaling has just begun to be studied, and recently a family of proteins has been identified as the SOCS (suppressor of cytokinesignaling) family. The first member of this family was denoted CIS, for cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein, and has been shown to bind to phosphorylated tyrosines on multiple cytokine receptors (24Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 25Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Subsequently, three groups have independently identified the second family member denoted SOCS-1, JAB (JAK-binding protein), and SSI-1 (Stat-induced Statinhibitor-1), respectively (26Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A.

Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). SOCS-1 has been shown to inhibit JAK kinase by binding to its activation loop, thus preventing the access of substrates and/or ATP to the enzyme catalytic pocket (29Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Moreover, IFN-γ itself has been shown to be a potent inducer of SOCS-1 in a wide variety of cell lines (30Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A.

Studies with SOCS-1 knockout mice have revealed its important role in negative regulation of IFN-γ action; animals deficient in SOCS-1 showed severe defects, the most prominent features being growth retardation, impaired T-cell and B-cell development, excessive IFN-γ responses, and early mortality (32Naka T.

In the present study, we evaluated the role of IFN-γ on inducing β cell dysfunction and apoptosis. We used as a model system the conditionally immortalized βTc-Tet cells. These cells display a normal glucose dose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, they can be growth-arrested in the presence of tetracycline, and, when transplanted in diabetic mice, they can maintain normoglycemia for several months (36Efrat S. Fusco-DeMane D. Lemberg H. al Emran O. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We previously genetically modified these cells to express the Bcl-2 gene. These modified cells, referred to as CDM3D, display improved resistance to stress-induced apoptosis, show increased viability at high cell density, and grow more vigorously in cell culture than the parental cells (37Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1160-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, we further engineered the CDM3D cells for overexpression of proteins interfering with the IL-1β signaling pathway. These proteins were dominant-negative mutants of MyD88 (MyD88-Toll and MyD88-lpr), an adaptor protein linking the IL-1 receptor to downstream signaling molecules. We demonstrated an increased resistance of these cells to IL-1β/IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitrite production and an increased resistance to cytokine-induced apoptosis but no resistance to impaired GSIS induced by cytokines (1Dupraz P. Cottet S. Hamburger F. Dolci W. Felley-Bosco E. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37672-37678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that in CDM3D cells, IFN-γ alone is sufficient to induce a sustained, time- and dose-dependent decrease in insulin mRNA levels, peptide cellular content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We show that the stable expression of SOCS-1 in CDM3D cells blocks IFN-γ-induced STAT-1 phosphorylation and increased cellular accumulation and prevents the negative effect of the cytokine on insulin gene expression and stimulated secretion. Furthermore, the continuous expression of SOCS-1 also blocks the cellular effects that require the combined presence of IFN-γ and IL-1β: an increase in NO production and an induction of apoptosis. These data characterize the role of IFN-γ on β cell dysfunction and identify a molecular way of preventing these negative cytokine effects. CDM3D cells are βTc-Tet cells (36Efrat S. Fusco-DeMane D. Lemberg H. al Emran O. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3576-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that have been modified to overexpress Bcl-2 (37Dupraz P. Rinsch C.

For nitrite secretion measurements, medium was changed to RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), which has a lower level of nitrite content.

High titer stocks of lentiviral vectors packaged by the multiply attenuated lentivirus CMVΔR8.91 and pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope protein (plasmid pMD-G) were prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells as described (37Dupraz P.

SOCS-1 virus titer was determined by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CDM3D cells were transduced with a multiplicity of infection of 10–20. Selection of the pool of infected cells was initiated 48 h after infection by adding 800 µg/ml of G418 for 1 week, followed by 400 µg/ml of the drug for an additional week. Cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 105 cells/well 48 h before incubation with cytokines. Following cytokine exposure for 48 h, cells were then incubated for 1 h in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin with 2.8 mm glucose and 200 µm isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma). The medium was changed, and cells were incubated again for 1 h in Hepes-buffered Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer/0.5% bovine serum albumin containing 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose and isobutylmethylxanthine. Secreted insulin was quantitated by radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, Labodia, Yens, Switzerland) as described (37Dupraz P. Rinsch C. Pralong W.F. Rolland E. Zufferey R. Trono D. Thorens B.

Briefly, cells were lysed in 250 µl of 75% ethanol, 1.5% concentrated hydrochloric acid. Aliquots of cell lysates were also analyzed for DNA content (44Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) to normalize the secretion data. The lysates in acid ethanol were neutralized with 110 volume of 1m Na2CO3, and DNA content was determined by fluorescence using a Fluoroskan-II microplate fluorometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) with an excitation filter set at 355 nm and an emission filter set at 460 nm. Nitrite accumulation in the conditioned culture medium was detected spectrophotometrically (at 540 nm) by the Griess reaction in the presence of 1 mmsulfanilamide and 0.1 m HCl (45Green L.C.

The concentrations (pmol of NO2−/mg protein) were calculated from the absorption before (A1) and after (A2) the addition of 70 mm naphthylethylenediamine and compared with a standard curve derived from NaNO2 (0–20 µm). The values shown are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. At determined times, cytokine-stimulated or untreated cells were lysed on ice in 200 µl of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) with 4 mm Na3VO4and 10 mm NaF, complemented with 50 µg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 µg/ml of aprotinin. Cell lysates were incubated for 15 s in 50 µl of buffer A with 2.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 s in a microcentrifuge (2000 rpm). The recovered supernatant constitutes the cytoplasmic extract. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended for 15 min in 100 µl of buffer A with 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 300 mm NaCl and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min in a microcentrifuge (13,000 rpm), the recovered supernatant corresponding to the nuclear extract. The amount of total proteins in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was determined by colorimetric dosage with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were immunoassayed as described previously (46Gremlich S. Roduit R. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3216-3222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to detect both total and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT-1 proteins, using a rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT-1 antibody (diluted 1:200) and a mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-STAT-1 antibody (diluted 1:100), respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The SOCS-1 protein level was determined in cell lysates prepared in 5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, with 50 µg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 µg/ml of aprotinin. SOCS-1 protein was detected in immunoblot using the anti-FLAG-M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Cells were seeded in 24-well dishes at a density of 105 cells/well 48 h before transfection with the indicated plasmids using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A total of 1 µg of DNA was transfected, which consisted of 0.8 µg of insulin-luciferase reporter plasmid containing fragment −326 to +30 of the human insulin gene promoter linked to luciferase (47Olson L.K. Redmon J.B. Towle H.C. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. A. Abderrahmani, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland) and 0.2 µg of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter), which was used to correct for transfection efficiency. 72 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with cytokines for 18 h, and relative activity of luciferase and β-galactosidase was determined as described (1Dupraz P. Cottet S. Hamburger F. Dolci W. Felley-Bosco E. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37672-37678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two days before induction of apoptosis, cells were seeded in a polylysine-treated 96-well microtiter plate (104 cells/well). The medium was changed, and the cells were left untreated or treated for 36 h with a combination of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ (103 units/ml each). Cytokine-induced cell death was assessed using a cytotoxicity assay based on tetrazolium dyes (CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, Madison, WI). MTS tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by metabolically active cells into a colored formazan product that is proportional to the number of viable cells. 20 µl/well of MTS tetrazolium reagent were added in the culture medium of the determined cell lines. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader, and the percentage of viable cells was determined. We previously reported that βTc-Tet cells expressing Bcl-2, referred to as CDM3D cells, had impaired GSIS when exposed to IL-1β and IFN-γ. We proposed that this was mostly due to an effect of IFN-γ on total insulin content (1Dupraz P. Cottet S. Hamburger F. Dolci W. Felley-Bosco E. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37672-37678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), because IL-1β alone had no effect, whereas IFN-γ induced the full inhibition. Here we first evaluated the dose dependence of the IFN-γ inhibitory effect. Fig. 1 A shows the insulin secreted by CDM3D cells pre-exposed to different concentrations of cytokines for 48 h and then kept in the presence of 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose for 1 h. IFN-γ markedly inhibited insulin secretion at both basal and high glucose concentrations. A very significant effect was detected with doses as low as 5 units/ml. The defect in insulin secretion was correlated with a parallel decrease in cellular insulin content (Fig. 1 B). Secretion of insulin, expressed as a percentage of insulin content, was not reduced by IFN-γ treatment (not shown), suggesting that the defect in secretory response may be due to a decrease in insulin content. A separate role of IFN-γ directly on inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can, however, not be excluded. Next, to determine whether the IFN-γ effect on cellular insulin content correlated with a decrease in insulin mRNA level, CDM3D cells were treated with IFN-γ or with IFN-γ plus IL-1β for 48 h, and insulin mRNA was assessed by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 4 A shows that IFN-γ alone or in combination with IL-1β reduced the insulin mRNA content by ∼70%. To determine the rate at which IFN-γ reduced the cellular insulin mRNA content, cells were exposed for different periods of time to IFN-γ, and the insulin to actin mRNA levels were determined. Fig.4 B shows that the insulin mRNA levels decreased progressively to reach a minimal value after 48 h. Treatment for up to 5 days did not induce a more extensive reduction of this mRNA level. Because the half-life of the insulin mRNA in these cells is ∼24 h (not shown), this indicates that the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ is probably taking place immediately after the addition of IFN-γ to the cells. To evaluate whether the IFN-γ pathway in CDM3D cells could be regulated by the suppressor of cytokine signaling-1, we overexpressed the SOCS-1 protein with a recombinant lentivirus. Pools of transduced cells were selected in the presence of G418 and SOCS-1 transcripts, and proteins were detected by Northern and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). We then verified that these cells were still able to secrete insulin in response to glucose. A 4–6-fold stimulation of insulin secretion was observed in response to high glucose concentrations (data not shown and see Fig. 6).Figure 6SOCS-1 protects CDM3D cells against cytokine-mediated reduction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The cells were treated for 48 h with IFN-γ alone (150 units/ml), IFN-γ in combination with IL-1β (10 units/ml), or IFN-γ with IL-1β plus TNF-α (100 units/ml) or left untreated. Insulin secretion was then evaluated following an 1-h incubation in the presence of 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose. A, at low and high glucose concentrations in CDM3D cells, GSIS is markedly reduced by IFN-γ alone or by the combinations of cytokines, whereas cytokine-induced reduction of secretion was prevented in cells expressing SOCS-1. *, p < 0.005; ¶,p < 0.05 versus untreated cells.B, intracellular insulin content was strongly reduced (60–70%) in CDM3D cells exposed to cytokines, whereas expression of SOCS-1 prevented this inhibitory effect. *, p < 0.0001versus untreated cells; ¶, p < 0.0001versus IFN-γ-treated cells; §, p < 0.005versus untreated cells. C, secretion of insulin at 16.7 mm glucose, expressed relative to insulin content, was not significantly modified following treatment with cytokines. The data are the means ± S.E. of two independent experiments, each done in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the role of SOCS-1 on IFN-γ-induced activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, we assessed the level of STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in CDM3D and SOCS-1 CDM3D cells exposed to IFN-γ in the presence or the absence of IL-1β. Fig. 3 shows that phospho-STAT-1 could be easily detected in the cytosol and nuclear fraction of CDM3D cells as early as 3 h (Fig. 3 A) and up to 72 h after initiation of treatment (Fig. 3 B). At 72 h of treatment, a large induction of total STAT-1 was observed in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions of control cells. In contrast, in SOCS-1 CDM3D cells, no phospho-STAT-1 could be detected at either time of analysis, and only a very small increase in total STAT-1 was visible. The band migrating slightly below STAT-1 is probably STAT-1β (an alternative splicing product of STAT-1"

Eukaryotic cells exposed to mammalian ribonucleases are protected from their cytotoxic action by the intracellular inhibition of ribonucleases by RI. Human pancreatic ribonuclease (HPR) is structurally and functionally very similar to bovine RNase A and interacts with human RI with a high affinity. In the current study, we have investigated the involvement of Lys-7, Gln-11, Asn-71, Asn-88, Gly-89, Ser-90, and Glu-111 in HPR in its interaction with human ribonuclease inhibitor. These contact residues were mutated either individually or in combination to generate mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, E111A, N88R, G89R, S90R, K7A/E111A, Q11A/E111A, N71A/E111A, K7A/N71A/E111A, Q11A/N71A/E111A, and K7A/Q11A/N71A/E111A. Out of these, eight mutants, K7A, Q11A, N71A, S90R, E111A, Q11A/E111A, N71A/E111A, and K7A/N71A/E111A, showed an ability to evade RI more than the wild type HPR, with the triple mutant K7A/N71A/E111A having the maximum RI resistance. As a result, these variants exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than wild type HPR. The mutation of Gly-89 in HPR produced no change in the sensitivity of HPR for RI, whereas it has been reported that mutating the equivalent residue Gly-88 in RNase A yielded a variant with increased RI resistance and cytotoxicity. Hence, despite its considerable homology with RNase A, HPR shows differences in its interaction with RI. We demonstrate that interaction between human pancreatic ribonuclease and RI can be disrupted by mutating residues that are involved in HPR-RI binding. The inhibitor-resistant cytotoxic HPR mutants should be useful in developing therapeutic molecules. Mammalian ribonucleases interact very strongly with the intracellular ribonuclease inhibitor (RI).

These include a group of homologous proteins isolated from many mammalian, avian, reptilian, and amphibian sources and are collectively known to be part of the RNase A superfamily (1Beintema J.J. Breukelman H.J. Carsana A. Furia A. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases : Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 245-269Crossref Google Scholar). The current resurgence of interest in RNases is the result of the discovery of RISBASES (RNases with Special Biological Actions), which have been identified to influence tumor cell growth, neurological development, and biological differentiation (2D'Alessio G. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 106-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An important biological function of mammalian RNases may be host defense, as has been observed in the case of the two eosinophil RNases, eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, which exhibit antiviral, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and neurotoxic activities (3Domachowske J.B.

Human pancreatic ribonuclease (HPR) is secretory in nature and has been considered as a counterpart of bovine pancreatic RNase A (12Beintema J.J. Wietzes P. Weickmann J. Glitz J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 48-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Seno M. Futami J. Kosaka M. Seno S. Yamada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although HPR shares 70% homology with RNase A and possesses similar key structural and catalytic residues, it displays some unique features (14Weickmann J.L. Elson M. Glitz D.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HPR possesses substantial activity against double-stranded RNA, contains a higher proportion of basic residues, its activity is differentially influenced by ionic strength and divalent ions, and compared with RNase A it has a carboxyl-terminal extension of four residues, EDST (15Bardon' A. Sierakowska H. Shugar D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 438: 461-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Sorrentino S. Libonati M. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14859-14865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported earlier that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal EDST extension enhances the RNase activity and thermostability of HPR (18Bal H.P. Batra J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although both RNase A and HPR catalyze RNA degradation efficiently, they have not been associated with any special biological action, and hence their physiological role, especially that of HPR, is not clearly defined. RNases have much potential as chemotherapeutics. Onconase is presently undergoing phase III human clinical trials for the treatment of malignant mesothelemia (19Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type I replication in chronically infected human cells (20Saxena S.K. Gravell M. Wu Y.-N. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. Ardelt W. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20783-20788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A majority of pancreatic RNases, with the exception of BS-RNase and onconase, are not cytotoxic. The major apparent reason for this poor cytotoxicity is the neutralization of the ribonucleolytic activity of RNases by the cytosolic RNase inhibitor (RI). Hence, affinity of a RNase for the intracellular RI could play an important role in defining its cytotoxic potency. HPR holds tremendous promise as a therapeutic agent for humans, and compared with other RNases it is likely to be less immunogenic and thus more efficacious. When the RI-sensitive “noncytotoxic” RNases are injected directly into Xenopusoocytes, which lack strong inhibitors to mammalian RNases, they display cytotoxic activity comparable to ricin and diphtheria toxin (21Saxena S.K. Rybak S.M. Winkler G. Meade H.M. McGray P. Youle R.J. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21208-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the two classes of RNases with anticancer activity, onconase and BS-RNase, are found to be resistant to cytosolic RI protein, and their cytotoxic activities appear to be a consequence of their abilities to escape inactivation by RI. (22Wu Y.N. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Murthy B.S. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). BS-RNase is a naturally occurring homodimer that is stabilized by two intersubunit disulfide bridges. The BS-RNase monomer is highly homologous to RNase A; however, the dimeric form has a much lower affinity for RI than the free monomer (23Murthy B.S. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Onconase evades RI as a monomer because of a lack of amino acid residues that are responsible for making contact with RI. Only three residues that contact RI in RNase A are conserved in onconase (19Ardelt W. Mikulski S.M. Shogen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). RI is a 50-kDa protein that constitutes 0.01% of the total cytosolic protein and is a highly conserved protein in various mammalian species (25Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases : Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). RI forms a 1:1 noncovalent complex with RNase A; and as seen from the three-dimensional structure of pRI·RNase A complex, one-third of the enzyme, including its active site, sits within the horseshoe-shaped structure of the inhibitor (27Kobe B. Diesenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A similar interaction has been observed with angiogenin and human RI (hRI); however, the intermolecular contacts in the RI·RNase complex differ because of the differences in the sequences of the two RNases (28Papageorgiou A.C. Shapiro R. Acharya K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5162-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of a variant of HPR, having five amino-terminal residues replaced by those in the BS-RNase, has been determined (29Pous J. Canals A. Terzyan S.S. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribo M. Vilanova M. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The structure of this HPR variant shares the overall size and characteristic V shape of the other RNases of its family; however, it differs significantly from RNase A in various loop regions (29Pous J. Canals A. Terzyan S.S. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribo M. Vilanova M. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated recently that RNase A can be engineered as a cytotoxin by mutating the specific contact residue Gly-88, which led to a decrease in its susceptibility to RI inactivation (30Leland P.A. Wayne Schultz L. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because the potency of a cytotoxic RNase can be defined in terms of its affinity for the RI, it is possible that HPR could be transformed into a cytotoxin by lowering its sensitivity to RI inactivation. In the current study we have investigated the role of four plausible contact residues in HPR in its interaction with the hRI with an aim to generate cytotoxic HPR variants. We have generated variants of HPR which have enhanced resistance toward inactivation by the hRI and are more cytotoxic. HPR is a protein consisting of 128 amino acid residues. pHPR, a plasmid containing the 384- base pair HPR gene, cloned downstream of a T7 promoter (18Bal H.P. Batra J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was used as template to mutate the target residues Lys-7, Gln-11, Asn-71, and Glu-111 to Ala. Similarly, the residues Asn-88, Gly-89, and Ser-90 were mutated to arginine. Except for K7A, all of the mutations were carried out by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Uracil containing DNA template was prepared by infecting CJ236 strain ofEscherichia coli with the recombinant phage and growing it in the presence of uridine and chloramphenicol (31Kunkel T.A.

Mutagenesis was performed using DNA primers JKB 8, JKB 9, JKB 10, JKB 11, JKB 15, JKB 16, and JKB 29 containing the mutations G89R, N88R, K7A, Q11A, N71A, E111A, and S90R, respectively. Sequences of various primers used are shown in Table I. Primer extension products were transformed into E. coli strain DH5α by standard methods. The mutant K7A was constructed by polymerase chain reaction using pHPR as the template, JKB 10 as the forward primer, and a universal EcoRI reverse primer. The primers were designed such that the amplified HPR fragment carrying the mutation K7A had recognition sites for NheI at the 5′-end andEcoRI at the 3′-end. The amplified fragment was digested with NheI and EcoRI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and cloned into a T7 promoter based-E. coliexpression vector pVEX11 restricted with the same enzymes. pVEX11 is a pUC-based vector that has a phage T7 promoter, multiple cloning sites, and a T7 transcription terminator.Table ISequence of primers used for mutagenesis of the putative residuesMutantPrimerSequenceK7AJKB 105′-ATGGCTAGCAAGGAATCCCGGGCCAAGgctTTCCAGCGG-3′Q11AJKB 115′-ACTGTCTGAGTCCATATGagcCCGCTGGAATTTCTTGGC-3′N71AJKB 155′-GGAGTTGCTCTTGTAGCAagcGCCCTGCCCGTTCTTGCA-3′E111AJKB 165′-TGGCACATATGGGCTCCCagcACAGGCCACAATGATGTG-3′N88RJKB 95′-GTTGGGGTACCTGGAGCCcctTGTCAGGCGGCAGTCTGT-3′G89RJKB 85′-ACAGTTGGGGTACCTGGAcctGTTTGTCAGGCGGCAGTC-3′S90RJKB 295′-TGCACAGTTGGGGTAcctACGGCCGTTTGTCAGGCGGCA-3′The underlined letters in lower case represent the nucleotides mutated. Open table in a new tab The underlined letters in lower case represent the nucleotides mutated. For constructing the double mutants K7A/E111A, Q11A/E111A, and N71A/E111A, mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, and E111A were digested withNheI (present at the 5′-end) and KpnI (present at position 292 in the HPR gene), and the 290-base pair fragment released from the mutants was ligated with the NheI-KpnI vector fragment obtained from the E111A mutant. The triple mutant K7A/N71A/E111A was prepared by mutating the Lys-7 to Ala by polymerase chain reaction as mentioned above, using the double mutant N71A/E111A as the template. The triple mutant Q11A/N71A/E111A was created by oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using the double mutant N71A/E111A as the template and primer JKB 11. For the construction of the quadruple mutant K7A/Q11A/N71A/ E111A, the triple mutant Q11A/N71A/E111A was used as the template, and the K7A mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (32Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). HPR has been overexpressed earlier in E. coli and purified from the inclusion bodies to obtain functionally active enzyme (18Bal H.P. Batra J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The HPR mutant proteins were prepared similarly from the cultures of E. coli strain BL21(λDE3), transformed with appropriate plasmid, and grown in superbroth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (18Bal H.P. Batra J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All HPR mutants were found to accumulate in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that were processed further as described (33Buchner J. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The solubilization of the inclusion body pellet was achieved in 6 m guanidium HCl. Renaturation of the solubilized protein was done by diluting the protein in a refolding buffer containing l-arginine and oxidized glutathione. The renatured protein, after dialysis, was loaded on an S-Sepharose cation exchange column. The protein was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl and purified further by gel filtration chromatography (18Bal H.P. Batra J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CD-spectra of purified proteins were recorded using a Jasco J720 (Easton) dichrograph in the far UV region (190–250 nm). Each protein, 33 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, was used in a cell with a 1-cm optical path to record the spectra. The spectra were acquired at a scan speed of 50 nm/min with a sensitivity of 50 mdeg and response time of 1 s. The spectra measured were an average of 10 accumulations, and the results are presented as mean residual ellipticity values. The ribonucleolytic activity of various mutants was assayed on substrates poly(C), poly(U), yeast tRNA, and poly(A·U) as described by Bond (34Bond M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Each substrate (40 μg) was incubated separately with different concentrations of the wild type HPR or its mutants in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 1 h at 37 °C. The undigested large molecular weight RNA was precipitated with perchloric acid and uranyl acetate on ice and removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The acid-soluble product was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The hydrolytic activity of HPR and its mutants on cyclic CMP was assayed according to the method of Crook et al. (35Crook E.M. Mathias A.P. Rabin B.R. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In a reaction buffer consisting of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.02 m EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml cyclic CMP was mixed with 40 μg/ml of the enzyme, and the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically at 284 nm at 25 °C. The RNase activity of various proteins on dinucleotide substrates CpA, UpA, and UpG was measured by using the procedure of Witzel and Barnard (36Witzel H. Barnard E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The appropriate substrate, 50 μm in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, was incubated with HPR or its mutants (final concentration 5 μm) at 25 °C. The change in absorbance at 284 nm was monitored spectrophotometrically. The HPR mutants were screened for ribonucleolytic activity in the presence of hRI by using an agarose gel-based assay (30Leland P.A. Wayne Schultz L. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a total volume of 10 μl, 10 ng of enzyme was mixed with 4 μg of total rat liver RNA and 20 units of recombinant hRI in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing10 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C; the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of gel loading buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, glycerol (30% v/v), xylene cyanol FF (0.25% w/v), and bromphenol blue (0.25% w/v) and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The RNase activity of the mutants, in the presence of RI, was studied quantitatively by assaying their activity on the most preferred RNA homopolymer substrate, poly(C), in an assay described above (34Bond M.D. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The inhibition constants (K i ) for the RI-HPR mutant interactions were determined by measuring the steady-state rate of poly(C) cleavage in the presence of RI. Reactions were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2.8 nm enzyme and 50–300 μm poly(C). RI concentrations in the range 300–700 pm were used, and the initial velocity data were used to prepare Lineweaver-Burk plots, from which K i was calculated. The cytotoxicity assays were performed on five different cell lines: U373MG (human glioblastoma), J774A.1 (mouse monocyte-macrophage), K562 (human erythroleukemia), A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma), and A549 (human lung carcinoma). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring [3H]leucine incorporation into newly synthesized protein. Cells were incubated with RNases for 40 h, followed by a 3-h pulse with 0.75 μCi/well [3H]leucine. The cells were then harvested onto glass fiber filters using a cell harvester. The filters were dried, and counts were taken using a liquid scintillation counter. The ID50 values represent the concentration of the RNase which inhibited the cellular protein synthesis by 50%. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the affinity of HPR for RI could be reduced by mutating specific contact residues, presumably involved in the binding of HPR to RI. We selected target residues in HPR based on two criteria. First, the residue must be involved in binding of HPR with RI by either forming a hydrogen bond or van der Waal contact with RI, as defined by the crystal structure of the RI·RNase complex. Second, the target residue must not be involved in the active site of HPR. On the basis of homology studies with the residues involved in the RI binding of several RNases, especially RNase A, we selected four target residues in HPR: Lys-7, Gln-11, Asn-71, and Glu-111. We replaced these residues in HPR with alanine to yield mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, and E111A. Alanine was chosen because it eliminates the side chain beyond the β-carbon without altering the main conformation. We combined the single mutations to form three double mutants, K7A/E111A, Q11A/E111A, and N71A/E111A; two triple mutants, K7A/N71A/E111A and Q11A/N71A/E111A; and a quadruplet mutant, K7A/Q11A/N71A/E111A. In RNase A mutation of Gly-88 to Arg has been shown to decrease its sensitivity to RI inactivation and consequently increase the cytotoxic potency by many fold (30Leland P.A. Wayne Schultz L. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Gly-88 in RNase A is homologous to Gly-89 in HPR. In the current study we individually mutated Gly-89 and also Asn-88 and Ser-90 to Arg, yielding three single mutants, N88R, G89R, and S90R. The mutants were expressed in E. coli, and the overexpressed proteins, isolated from the inclusion bodies, were purified to homogeneity through a two-step purification scheme comprised of cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified HPR mutants migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as single bands corresponding to their expected molecular weights (Fig.1 A). A polyclonal antibody against HPR reacted with all 13 mutant proteins equally well as shown by the Western blots (Fig. 1 B). Typical final yields of the purified recombinant proteins were in the range of 10–20 mg/liter of culture. Structural characterization was carried out by CD spectral analysis to study the effect of mutations on the overall conformation of HPR. As shown in Fig. 2, the recombinant HPR appears to be folded compactly with an α+β conformation. The CD spectra of the mutant proteins K7A, Q11A, N71A, and E111A (Fig. 2 A); K7A/E111A, Q11A/E111A, and N71A/E111A (Fig. 2 B); K7A/N71A/E111A, Q11A/N71A/E111A, and K7A/Q11A/N71A/E111A (Fig. 2 C); and N88R and G89R (Fig.2 D) indicated a modest alteration; however, the overall structure appears to be similar to that of the wild type protein. The conformation of S90R (Fig. 2 D) was found to be altered compared with the wild type HPR, showing a significant decrease in the α-helical content of the mutant. The RNase activity of the seven single alanine mutants was assayed on three different RNA substrates: poly(C), yeast tRNA, and cyclic CMP. Pancreatic RNases have a preference for pyrimidine-rich RNA substrates. On the single-stranded, pyrimidine homopolymer substrate, poly(C), the mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, and E111A displayed a similar or higher activity compared with wild type HPR (TableII). On yeast tRNA, the mutant K7A showed 78% activity compared with the wild type enzyme, whereas the mutants Q11A, N71A, and E111A displayed about 50% lower activity (Table II). The hydrolytic activity of HPR and its mutants was studied by spectrophotometrically monitoring the breakdown of the cyclic CMP to 3′-monophosphate. The mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, and E111A were found to possess hydrolytic activity similar to that of the wild type HPR (TableII).Table IICatalytic activity of HPR mutantsProteinΔA/min/mg proteinPoly(C)Yeast tRNAcCMPCpAUpAUpGHPR227,000 (100)16,300 (100)0.37 (100)0.1400.138NDK7A241,000 (106)12,800 (78)0.45 (121)0.1480.130NDQ11A186,000 (82)7,950 (48)0.29 (78)0.1300.020NDN71A313,000 (140)7,600 (46)0.67 (181)0.1200.0500.280E111A508,000 (224)8,800 (53)0.54 (145)0.1300.0770.070Substrates poly(C), yeast tRNA, and cCMP were incubated separately with different concentrations of the wild type HPR or its mutants for 1 h at 37 °C.

The mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, and E111A exhibited activity similar to the wild type enzyme on the most favored dinucleotide substrate CpA (Table II). On UpA, the mutant K7A showed activity similar to that of HPR, but there was a significant loss in activity of the mutants Q11A, N71A, and E111A (Table II). On the dinucleotide substrate UpG, like HPR, mutants K7A and Q11A also were found to be inactive, whereas mutants N71A and E111A displayed RNase activity, with N71A being more active (Table II). On poly(C), compared with HPR the mutant N71A/E111A was found to have a 3-fold higher activity (Table III).

Although previously characterized as a regulator of the stability of cytoplasmic proteins, hRPF1/Nedd4 has also been suggested to have a role in the nucleus. However, in light of the cytoplasmic localization of hRPF1/Nedd4, it is unclear whether bona fide nuclear substrates of hRPF1/Nedd4 exist, and if so, what mechanism may allow a cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase to manifest nuclear activity. Our search for nuclear substrates led to the identification of the human proline-rich transcript, brain-expressed (hPRTB) protein, the ubiquitination and degradation of which is regulated by hRPF1/Nedd4. Interestingly, hPRTB colocalizes with the splicing factor SC35 in nuclear speckles. Finally, we demonstrate that hRPF1/Nedd4 is indeed capable of entering the nucleus; however, the presence of a functional Rev-like nuclear export sequence in hRPF1/Nedd4 ensures a predominant cytoplasmic localization.

Covalent attachment of the 76-amino acid polypeptide ubiquitin to a substrate protein is a catastrophic signal, targeting the substrate for rapid degradation (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 2Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The specific enzymes involved in this process, E1,1 E2, and E3, have been studied in great detail (3Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). A human ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) is responsible for the ATP-dependent activation of the ubiquitin polypeptide. Activated ubiquitin is subsequently transferred to a downstream ubiquitin carrier protein (E2), and in many cases to a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), which mediates the final transfer of activated ubiquitin to a substrate protein. Evidenced by the numerous examples of cellular dysregulation resulting from aberrant ubiquitination (4Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 5Spataro V. Norbury C. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), this ultimate enzyme-substrate recognition step is crucial for cellular homeostasis. Accordingly, there is of late a heightened level of interest in defining the mechanisms that govern the target specificity of the various E3 ligases and how this event is regulated in target cells. The experiments that have formed the foundation of our understanding of the role of E3 ligases were those that describe E6-associated protein and its ability to cooperate with the viral E6 protein in ubiquitinating p53 following human papillomavirus infection (6Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). This work led to the discovery of a family of proteins with sequence homology to E6-associated protein, the homology toE6-associated protein at the carboxylterminus (hect) family of proteins (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), and the observation that the amino terminus is the primary determinant of target specificity. Recent work demonstrating RNA polymerase II ubiquitination by yeast RSP5, Smad ubiquitination by Smurf1, and Notch ubiquitination by Itch confirm the importance of the amino terminus in target selection (8Huibregtse J.M.

Nedd4 is a hect E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme the transcript of which was originally identified to be developmentally down-regulated in neural precursor cells (11Kumar S. Tomooka Y. Noda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The domain structure of hRPF1/Nedd4 places this E3 ligase in the WWhect subclass of ubiquitin ligases. This subclass of enzymes is characterized by 2–4 copies of a WW protein-protein interaction domain (12Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), followed by a conserved hect domain. The hect domain is the catalytic domain responsible for ubiquitination, an activity that is absolutely dependent upon an invariant cysteine residue located within the active site (7Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Similar to many other human WWhect E3 ligases, hRPF1/Nedd4 contains a C2/CaLB domain at the amino terminus, which is responsible for mediating membrane localization in response to calcium (13Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although hRPF1/Nedd4 contains a hect domain, implying that it is involved in ubiquitination, many studies performed thus far with putative targets have not been illuminating with respect to the function of the enzyme or how the activity is regulated. To date, the best characterized substrate of Nedd4 is the rat sodium epithelial channel (14Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D.

Invest. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). These studies, which demonstrate that Nedd4 can interact with and regulate the turnover of the sodium epithelial channel, imply a nonnuclear function of this enzyme. This contention is supported by additional work that indicates that Nedd4 and the cytoplasmic adapter protein mGrb10 interact (17Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, recent studies from our laboratories have demonstrated that hRPF1/Nedd4 may have roles in the nucleus. Specifically, it has been shown that 1) a Nedd4 homolog, yeast RSP5, is responsible for the ubiquitination of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II in response to DNA damage (18Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and 2) overexpression of hRPF1/Nedd4 alters the transcriptional activity of the progesterone receptor (19Imhof M.O. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, an erythroid-specific transcription factor, NF-E2, has been shown to physically associate with hRPF1/Nedd4 (20Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.-K.J. J. Biol.

Cumulatively, these data suggest that hRPF1/Nedd4 can modulate target protein ubiquitination in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. However, because hRPF1/Nedd4 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (21Anan T. Nagata Y. Koga H. Honda Y. Yabuki N. Miyamoto C. Kuwano A. Matsuda I. Endo F. Saya H. Nakao M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the physiological significance of the interaction between hRPF1/Nedd4 and nuclear proteins is unclear. In an effort to evaluate the potential roles of hRPF1/Nedd4 in the nucleus and how these activities are manifest, we have undertaken a strategy to identify additional nuclear substrates of hRPF1/Nedd4 with a view to (a) confirming that this enzyme can interact with and regulate the stability of nuclear proteins and (b) defining a mechanism by which this cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase can exert its activity in the nucleus. Splicing factor SC35 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies, horse serum, and VectaShield with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The complete 5′ coding sequence of hRPF1/Nedd4 (aa 1–900) was obtained using 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, polymerase chain reaction-amplified, and subcloned into an incomplete RPF1/Nedd4 cDNA (derived from pBKC-hRPF1) (19Imhof M.O. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using standard subcloning procedures. hRPF1/Nedd4 deletion constructs encoding C2 (aa 1–192), WW (aa 173–564), hect (aa 507–900), aa 293–900, aa 309–900, and aa 404–900 were subcloned by polymerase chain reaction from full-length hRPF1/Nedd4 constructs, and all sequences were verified by sequence analysis. To create the hRPF1/Nedd4-C867A mutant, we utilized the SacI site just upstream of amino acid 867 for construct preparation. Briefly, a primer was designed (5′-gccaagagctcataccgcttttaatcgcc-3′) that allowed polymerase chain reaction amplification of amino acids 862–900, resulting in the incorporation of a two-base substitution that changed cysteine 867 to alanine. The SacI-NotI fragment containing the C867A amino acid change was incorporated into the context of the full-length hRPF1/Nedd4 using standard subcloning procedures. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the PY mutation in hPRTB (P40A/Y42A), and the mutant nuclear export sequence (NES) (L307A/I309A) in hRPF1/Nedd4-C867A. Primers used were as follows: PRTB-PYmut, 5′-ccgatgctccagctgccgcctcagagctc-3′(sense) and 5′-gagctctgaggcggcagctggagcatcgg-3′ (antisense); hRPF1/Nedd4-C867A-mutNES, 5′-gaattgaatgccagagccaccgcttttggaaattcagccg-3′ (sense) and 5′-cggctgaatttccaaaagcggtggctctggcattcaattc-3′ (antisense). The integrity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion constructs were the result of subcloning hPRTB (from the library vector pGADGH) into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). To create Myc-tagged fusions, we inserted a BamHI-BamHI fragment of hPRTB cDNA (containing extra 5′ BamHI-EcoRI linker sequence: ggatccccgaattc) into the BamHI site of pcDNA3–5×Myc vector. HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h and allowed to recover for 24–48 h prior to harvest and analysis. A cDNA encoding the amino terminus of hRPF1/Nedd4 (NW, aa 26–506) was subcloned into the vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH) and introduced by standard lithium acetate protocol into HF7c cells (CLONTECH). A HeLa Matchmaker library was sequentially transformed, and colonies were grown on selective plates containing 1 mm 3-aminotriazole. A HeLa cervical carcinoma cDNA library was chosen based upon previous observations (19Imhof M.O. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2594-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and immunodetection of endogenous hRPF1/Nedd4 protein product in HeLa cells. His+ clones were isolated after 10 days of growth at 30 °C, restreaked onto selective plates (1 mm 3-aminotriazole), and grown for 3 days prior to β-galactosidase filter lift assays. Library and bait plasmids were subsequently cotransformed into Y190 yeast cells to verify phenotype and to quantitate interaction using a liquid β-galactosidase assay. Briefly, a mid-logarithmic phase culture (A 600 = 0.5–0.8) was pelleted, washed, and subjected to two cycles of freeze-thaw lysis. The β-galactosidase activity of the lysate was measured at A 578 and quantitated using CPRG (chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside) as a substrate. hPRTB was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), in vitro transcribed/translated, and radiolabeled in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega). hRPF1/Nedd4 or deletions thereof (C2, aa 1–192; WW, aa 173–564; hect, aa 507–900) were fused to GST, expressed, and purified from bacteria. Purified GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated with radiolabeled hPRTB in NETN-A (25 mm Tris 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed in NETN-B (150 mm NaCl), eluted, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Assays were performed essentially as described previously (18Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, an in vitro translated, radiolabeled substrate was incubated with BL21 bacterial extracts overexpressing E1 and an E2 (UbcH5B). Reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 µg of bovine ubiquitin (Sigma), and 500 ng of purified E3 enzyme (either yRSP5 or hRPF1/Nedd4-whect). In some cases, an ATP regenerating system was also included, consisting of 0.1 m phosphocreatine, 3.5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase. After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, reactions were terminated with 3× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved, and detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Following a previously published procedure (15Staub O. Gautschi I. Ishikawa T. Breitschopf K. Ciechanover A. Schild L. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6325-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), HeLa cells were transiently transfected with mammalian expression plasmids for His-tagged ubiquitin and a Myc-tagged substrate (hPRTB or PY mutant). Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). The insoluble fraction was removed by a high speed spin, and the clarified supernatant was denatured by addition of 2% SDS followed by boiling for 5 min. Denatured extract was diluted with 12 volumes of lysis buffer and incubated with 50 µl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for 4 h at 4 °C. After thorough washing with lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 40 mm imidazole, His-tagged proteins were eluted with 3× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western immunoblot analysis using an anti-c-Myc antibody, 9E10. HeLa cells (∼70–80% confluency) that had been plated in 60 mm dishes were transiently transfected with 2.7 µg of a Myc-hPRTB or Myc-hPRTB-PYmut expression plasmid and 20 ng of the internal control Myc-EGFP. In experiments assaying the effect of exogenous hRPF1/Nedd4 on PRTB stability, 1.3 µg of pc:RPF1 or pc:RPF1-C867A (or an equimolar amount of empty pcDNA3 vector) was cotransfected as well. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium for 30 min. A radioactive mixture of methionine and cysteine (175 µCi of Tran35S-Label, ICN) was used to metabolically label cells for 2 h, after which the medium was removed and replaced with cold medium containing an excess of methionine and cysteine (3 and 1 mm, respectively) to chase for indicated time points. At each time point, cells were harvested in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors, flash-frozen, and subsequently immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the Myc tag (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography and quantitated using a phosphorimager. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for an EGFP-hPRTB (or PY mutant) fusion protein and plated onto 25-mm round glass coverslips. Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Samples were blocked in PBS containing 10% horse serum and then incubated with anti-SC35 (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000 in PBS/2% horse serum, followed by incubation with anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:75 dilution in PBS/2% horse serum. Coverslips were mounted in VectaShield plus DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Localization of transfected Myc-hRPF1/Nedd4 deletion or mutation constructs was performed essentially as described above, only using the anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) at a 1:2000 dilution. Indicated samples were treated with 20 ng/ml of leptomycin B for 4 h prior to fixation and sample preparation. A Zeiss LSM410 laser scanning confocal microscope with a krypton/argon laser (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) was used for confocal microscopy. Several nuclear proteins have been shown to be ubiquitinated by hRPF1/Nedd4 in vitro; however, a validated target of this enzyme in the nucleus has not been established in intact mammalian cells. With the goal of identifying bona fide cellular substrates of the catalytic activity of hRPF1/Nedd4, we used the amino terminus of hRPF1/Nedd4 in a yeast two hybrid screen to identify novel binding partners, a subset of which we would predict to be ubiquitination substrates. As a result of our screen, six cDNAs were isolated, all encoding a 17-kDa proline-rich protein, which specifically interact with aa 26–506 of hRPF1/Nedd4 (Fig.1 A). Homology searches using BLAST programs indicated that this 17-kDa protein is identical to KIAA0058, a cDNA isolated from a myeloid cell line, KG-1. We and others have termed this human cDNA, hPRTB (Fig. 1 B), based upon its high amino acid identity with mouse proline-rich transcript, brain-expressed (PRTB) protein, which was isolated in a gene trap screen as a transcript expressed in the developing mouse inner ear (22Yang W. Mansour S.L. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 215: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although its amino acid sequence does not share significant sequence homology with that of other proteins, the most notable feature of hPRTB is its proline-rich composition (18%). To independently verify that hPRTB does indeed interact with full-length hRPF1/Nedd4, we assayed the ability of in vitrotranslated, [35S]methionine-labeled Myc-hPRTB to interact with recombinant GST fusions of hRPF1/Nedd4 (see schematic in Fig.1 C). Myc-hPRTB was able to interact with full-length hRPF1/Nedd4 or yRSP5, a yeast homolog that has a domain structure similar to that of hRPF1 (containing only three WW domains). The WW domains of hRPF1/Nedd4 were sufficient for interaction with hPRTB; it is important to note that the greater hPRTB signal associated with GST-WW (Fig. 1 D) is likely a reflection of the greater molar amount of GST-WW used. Neither the hect domain nor the C2 domain resulted in any detectable interaction (Fig. 1 D). WW domains are predicted to interact with proline-containing consensus sequences, which are either PPXY, PPLP, or PGM (12Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Examination of the proline-rich regions within hPRTB revealed a consensus PPAY motif located in the central portion of the protein (Fig. 1 B). It is interesting to note that the WWhect ligase, Smurf1, similarly binds to a PPAY motif in its substrate, Smad1 (9Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). With the prediction that this conserved motif may mediate the interaction of hPRTB with hRPF1/Nedd4, we substituted the second proline and subsequent tyrosine with alanine and assayed for the ability of this PY mutant to interact with hRPF1/Nedd4. The two-amino acid substitution within the PPAY motif in hPRTB was able to disrupt the ability of hPRTB to bind to hRPF1/Nedd4 (Fig. 1 D), further demonstrating that the WW domains of hRPF1/Nedd4 directly interact with the PPAY motif of hPRTB. The direct association of a WW domain-containing enzyme and a substrate with a PPXY motif is ideal for an enzyme-substrate interaction in that WW domains typically bind with high specificity rather than high affinity (26Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), a property that may explain our inability to isolate hRPF1/Nedd4-hPRTB complexes from cellular extracts (data not shown). Given our interest in a possible nuclear function of hRPF1/Nedd4, we next sought to determine the subcellular localization of the potential ubiquitination substrate hPRTB. To this end, we fused hPRTB to EGFP and analyzed its subcellular localization using fluorescence confocal microscopy. EGFP-hPRTB and the corresponding PY mutant (P40A/Y42A) have identical fluorescence patterns and are localized to the nucleus in a discrete speckled pattern (Fig.2). We were intrigued by our observation of the localization of hPRTB to spots in the nucleus, reminiscent of “nuclear speckles,” which are enriched in splicing factors and contain a population of hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (27Fu X.-D. Maniatas T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 28Bregman D.B. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Using fluorescent confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that both hPRTB and the PY mutant indeed colocalize with the splicing factor, SC35, in nuclear speckles (Fig. 2), suggesting that hPRTB may have a role in the transcription and/or splicing of RNA transcripts. Thus, in addition to identifying a potential nuclear substrate of hRPF1/Nedd4, we have localized hPRTB to splicing factor-rich speckles, a subnuclear localization where a population of RNA polymerase II, another WWhect E3 substrate, is known to reside. Given that hPRTB specifically binds to hRPF1/Nedd4, we next wanted to determine whether it could serve as a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of this enzyme. A recombinant hRPF1/Nedd4 (whect) derivative lacking the amino-terminal C2 domain was used in enzymatic assays, as full-length protein is not active under the conditions tested (18Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Efficient multi-ubiquitination of hPRTB was observed when assayed in the presence of purified hRPF1/Nedd4 (whect) or yRSP5, but not the hect E3 ligase E6-AP, which lacks WW domains in its amino terminus (Fig. 3 A). Additionally, no ubiquitination was observed when either the E2 (UbcH5B) or E3 (RPF1/Nedd4-whect) enzyme was omitted from the reaction mixture (data not shown and Fig. 3 A). With the prediction that substrate binding is necessary for E3 ligase activity, we next tested the hypothesis that the hPRTB-PYmut would not be ubiquitinated in this assay. Indeed, mutation of two key residues within the PPAY motif of hPRTB was able to completely abrogate ubiquitination of hPRTB by either hRPF1/Nedd4 (whect) (Fig. 3 B) or yeast RSP5 (data not shown). Thus, a strong correlation between binding of hPRTB to hRPF1/Nedd4 and its ability to be ubiquitinated in vitro was established. Having confirmed that hPRTB is an efficient substrate for Nedd4 in vitro, we next turned to evaluating whether hPRTB is a physiological substrate for ubiquitination. Specifically, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids expressing a His-tagged ubiquitin protein and Myc-tagged hPRTB. In theory, ubiquitination substrates should be modified by His-ubiquitin, and the resultant conjugates can be isolated on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. As indicated in Fig.3 C, lanes 4–6, His-ubiquitin conjugates were detected upon cotransfection of His-ubiquitin and wild type Myc-hPRTB. The migration of these 40–60-kDa ubiquitin conjugates differs from the slower migrating multi-ubiquitinated conjugates observed in vitro(Fig. 3, A and B), perhaps due to the regulated activity of an endogenous (rather than purified) E3 enzyme, coupled with the efficient cellular degradation of multi-ubiquitinated species within cells. Transfection of either Myc-hPRTB alone (Fig.3 C, lane 4) or cotransfection of Myc-hPRTB-PYmut and His-ubiquitin (lane 6) was unable to produce His-ubiquitin hPRTB conjugates. Western analysis (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–3) was used to verify that all proteins were expressed in HeLa cellular lysates. It was observed that Myc-hPRTB-PYmut accumulates to a higher steady state level than Myc-PRTB (Fig. 3 C, comparelane 3 with lanes 1 and 2), a finding that led us to consider that the stability of wild type and PY mutant hPRTB proteins may be different. Consequently, we analyzed the half-lives of Myc-hPRTB and Myc-hPRTB-PYmut in HeLa cells using pulse-chase analysis. As shown in Fig.4 A, wild type hPRTB has a significantly shorter half-life than the hPRTB-PYmut, the mutant that is unable to support ubiquitination. Averaging the data from several independent experiments, we conclude that mutation of two key residues within the PPAY motif of hPRTB results in a 3.5-fold increase in the half-life of hPRTB (2 h to 7 h) (Fig. 4 B). Cumulatively, these observations provide compelling evidence that hPRTB is a physiological substrate of an endogenous WW-hect E3 ubiquitin ligase, such as hRPF1/Nedd4. It has previously been shown that nuclear proteins such as the large subunit of RNA polymerase II and the transcription factor NF-E2 bind to or are able to be ubiquitinated by mammalian Nedd4 family members in vitro (18Beaudenon S.L.

Given our data thus far, we suspected that the WW-hect E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of PRTB was hRPF1/Nedd4. Thus, we sought to establish that exogenous hRPF1/Nedd4 was able to alter the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of hPRTB. Using pulse-chase analysis, we demonstrated that the degradation of PRTB was accelerated in samples containing transiently transfected hRPF1/Nedd4 but not in samples transfected with the catalytic mutant hRPF1/Nedd4-C867A or an empty expression plasmid (Fig.5 A). Specifically, the half-life of PRTB in the presence of overexpressed hRPF1/Nedd4 was 70 min, compared with a t 12 of 150 min in"

Plasmin, a serine protease, is involved in the dissolution of extracellular matrix and basement membrane during tissue degradation.

Urokinase is mainly involved in extravascular proteolysis in stromal remodeling in acute and chronic lung injury (8Idell S. New Horizons. 1994; 2: 566-574PubMed Google Scholar, 9Idell S.

Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 13Blasi F. Vassalli J.D. Dano K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Receptor-bound uPA can be inhibited by PAI-1 and PAI-2, and uPAR provides a mechanism for internalization of PAI-1-inactivated uPA. The uPAR therefore plays an important role both in localizing and modulating cell surface plasminogen activation. Human uPAR is heavily glycosylated and is attached to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Both uPA and uPAR as well as PAI-1 and -2 are expressed by lung epithelial cells (19Idell S. Kumar A. Zwieb C. Holiday D. Koenig K.B. Johnson A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L693-L703PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gross T.J. Simon R.H. Kelly C.J. Sitrin R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L286-L295PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gross T.J. Simon R.H. Sitrin R.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 3: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), indicating that autocrine regulation of this fibrinolytic system by the epithelium could influence the course of either lung injury or lung cancer. Expression of uPA and uPAR controls several cellular functions, including epithelial cell adhesion, signaling, and mitogenesis, and most of the biological activities of uPA are dependent on its association with the uPAR (4Vassalli J.D. Sappino A.P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 13Blasi F. Vassalli J.D. Dano K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 22Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). uPA is reported to generate intracellular signals either by uPAR-dependent or uPAR-independent mechanisms (23Ghiso J.A.A. Alonso D.F. Farias E.F. Gomez D.E. Bal de Kier Joffe E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The expression of these components by the lung epithelium is tightly regulated during normal physiological processes and is disordered in lung injury or lung cancer. It is noteworthy that the signaling pathways activated by uPA/uPAR seem to be the same pathways that induce their own expression (23Ghiso J.A.A. Alonso D.F. Farias E.F. Gomez D.E. Bal de Kier Joffe E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that interactive regulation between uPA and uPAR was plausible, although not previously described. This possibility was investigated using cultured Beas2B cells and primary bronchial epithelial cells as a model system. In these studies, we describe a novel regulatory pathway by which uPA induces uPAR expression by Beas2B as well as primary bronchial epithelial cells. Culture media, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; tissue culture plastics were from Becton Dickinson Labware (Lincoln Park, NJ). α-Thrombin, herbimycin, genistein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, Tris-base, aprotinin, dithiothreitol (DTT), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, silver nitrate, ammonium persulfate, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) were from Sigma. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and nitrocellulose were from Bio-Rad. Recombinant high molecular weight (HMW) uPA was a generous gift from Drs. Jack Henkin (Abbott) and Andrew Mazar (Angstrom Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). The low molecular weight (LMW), amino-terminal fragment (ATF), anti-uPA, and anti-uPAR antibodies were obtained from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT). A5 and B428 compounds were generous gifts from Dr. Andew Mazar. XAR x-ray film was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas2B) or lung epithelial tumor cells, including H1395 and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, H157 human lung squamous cells, H460 large cell lung carcinoma cells, and H146 human lung small cell lung carcinoma cells were obtained from the ATCC. Human pleural mesothelial (MeT5A) and spindle-shaped (M33K) or epithelioid (M9K) pleural malignant mesothelioma cells were obtained from Dr. Brenda Gerwin, National Institutes of Health. These cells, as well as primary cultures of human pleural mesothelial cells obtained from pleural fluid aspirates, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% antibiotics as described previously (24Idell S. Zwieb C. Kumar A. Koenig K.B. Johnson A.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence were serum-starved overnight with RPMI-glutamine media containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were treated with or without various agents for indicated times and were washed with PBS. Receptor-bound uPA was removed by glycine HCl treatment as described earlier (25Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Idell S. Antisense Res. Dev. 1995; 5: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We used SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting to measure functional uPAR at the cell surface. Membrane proteins isolated as described earlier (26Shetty S. Idell S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 199: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) from Beas2B, SAEC, MeT5A, selected lung tumor cell lines, and pleural mesothelioma cell lines were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in wash buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight hybridization with uPAR monoclonal antibody in the same buffer at 4 °C and washed, and uPAR proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Recombinant uPA (5 μg/ml) was treated with 2 mCi of 125I-Na and 50 mg IODO-GEN for 5 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of excess KI, and unincorporated label was removed by passage through a Sephadex-25 column as described earlier (27Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate experiment, membrane proteins of Beas2B cells treated with uPA for varying times (0–24 h) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described above. The nitrocellulose membrane was subjected to ligand blotting assay, using125I-uPA as described earlier (27Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982PubMed Google Scholar). We also measured binding of 125I-uPA by the method of Waltzet al. (28Waltz D.A. Sailor L.Z. Chapman H.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1541-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with modifications. Beas2B cells grown to confluence in 24-well plates were treated with or without uPA for 24 h in serum-free media containing 0.5% BSA. The cells were acid-treated and subjected to 125I-uPA binding as we described earlier (27Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982PubMed Google Scholar). The nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 400-fold molar excess of cold uPA. Activation of plasminogen by Beas2B cells was measured by a modification of the esterolytic method as we described previously (27Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid uPAR/pBluescript was obtained from the ATCC. The human uPAR mRNA template containing a complete sequence of uPAR cDNA (nucleotides −16 to 1144) from uPAR pBluescript was subcloned to HindIII and XbaI sites of pRC/CMV (Invitrogen), and the sequences of the clones were confirmed by sequencing. The uPAR insert was released byHindIII or XbaI, purified on 1% agarose gels, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and used as a cDNA probe for Northern blotting. The full-length template of uPAR was released with HindIII or XbaI, purified on 1% agarose gels, and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a RediPrime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Passage through a Sephadex G-25 column removed unincorporated radioactivity. The specific activity of the product was 6 × 108 cpm/μg. Cells grown to confluence in two T182 flasks were serum-starved overnight in RPMI/BSA media. The cells were later treated with PBS, uPA, or TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 12 h at 37 °C and then washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The cells were homogenized and incubated on ice for 1 h to release the nuclei. The nuclear pellet was subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation by careful layering on top of 7.5 ml of sucrose buffer (1.3 m) followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer. The nuclei (10–20 × 106) were subjected to the transcription reaction in the presence of 250 μCi of [32P]UTP at 30 °C for 30 min. 32P-Labeled nuclear RNA was isolated using TRI-reagent, and unincorporated radioactivity was removed by repeated precipitation and washing by cold ethanol. RNA pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of RNase-free water. Recombinant plasmid DNA (10 μg/slot) was denatured by heating at 95 °C in NaOH/EDTA solution for 5 min and chilling on ice. Denatured DNA solution was spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane using a slot blot apparatus under vacuum. The membranes were vacuum-baked, prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in a hybridization buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 2× Denhardt's solution, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.225 mg/ml tRNA, 0.1 mg/ml poly(A)+, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA).32P-Labeled RNA (10 × 106 cpm/ml) was added to the hybridization solution, and the membranes were incubated in a hybridization oven for 48 h. The filters were washed with 2–0.1× SSC with in-between RNase digestion, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film. A Northern blotting assay was used to assess the level of uPAR mRNA. Beas2B cells grown to confluence were serum-starved overnight in RPMI/BSA media and then treated with uPA for varying times (0–24 h) in the same media. Total RNA was isolated using TRI-reagent. RNA (20 μg) was isolated on agarose/formaldehyde gels. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Prehybridization and hybridization were done at 65 °C in NaCl (1 m)/SDS (1%) and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed with a uPAR cDNA probe (1 ng/ml) labeled to ∼6 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA overnight. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice for 15 min at 65 °C with 2× SSC, 1% SDS; 1× SSC, 1% SDS; and 0.1% SSC, 1% SDS, respectively. The membranes were next exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C overnight. The intensity of the bands was measured by densitometry and normalized against that of β-actin. The uPA cDNA (29Axelrod J.H. Reich R. Miskin R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was subcloned to eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV2 (Invitrogen) containing the CMV promoter atHindIII/NotI sites. The orientations and sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Beas2B cells were transfected with the prepared chimeric plasmid constructs by lipofection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable cell lines were made by treating Beas2B cells with neomycin for 3 months. Cells carrying plasmid DNA that survived after neomycin treatment were scraped off from 6-well plates and grown in T75 flasks, and the presence of plasmid DNA was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers. The overexpression of uPA by cDNA-transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting Beas2B cell lysates as well as conditioned media using a uPA monoclonal antibody. The effect of endogenous uPA overexpression on uPAR expression was measured by Western blotting for uPAR as described above. Since we previously found that MeT5A mesothelial cells and MS-1 mesothelioma cells both express uPAR in vitro (25Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Idell S. Antisense Res. Dev. 1995; 5: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982PubMed Google Scholar), we initially wanted to determine if uPAR is differentially expressed in cultured nonmalignant, bronchial epithelial (Beas2B) cells or small airway epithelial (SAE) cells versus an array of malignant lung carcinoma-derived cells. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were also analyzed. Western blotting assays were used to determine the level of uPAR expression at the surface of primary cultures of lung small airway epithelial cells, Beas2B cells, human lung carcinoma-derived cells (H1395, A549, H157, H460, and H146), and from human pleural malignant mesothelioma cells (M33K, M9K, and MS-1). Basal expression of uPAR in unstimulated cells was greatest in H157, H460, and A549 cells among the lung cancers (Fig.1). Signaling pathways activated by the uPA/uPAR system could be the same pathways that induce their own expression (23Ghiso J.A.A. Alonso D.F. Farias E.F. Gomez D.E. Bal de Kier Joffe E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the possibility that expression of uPA/uPAR in epithelial cells leads to a nested signaling loop and/or activation of additional mechanisms that could contribute to enhanced uPAR expression. We used Beas2B epithelial cells as a lung epithelial cell model system to initiate these studies. We treated these cells with uPA (the high molecular weight, two-chain form) for varying times (0–24 h). uPAR expression at the cell surface was assessed by Western blotting using an anti-uPAR antibody. Results of these experiments (Fig.2 a) demonstrate that uPA induces uPAR in Beas2B cells in a time-dependent manner and that the induction starts between 3 and 6 h after addition of uPA. Maximal induction of uPAR by uPA was achieved around 12 h, and the elevated level is maintained for at least 24 h. uPA also induced uPAR expression in primary bronchial epithelial cells but not in uPAR over-producing H157 or A549 cells (Fig. 2 b). We also confirmed expression of increased functional uPAR in uPA-treated Beas2B cells by ligand blotting assay, demonstrating receptor binding consistent with the results of Western blotting experiments (data not shown). To see if the high molecular weight uPA (HMW uPA) preparation we used in this study contains lipopolysaccharides (LPS), we used the Limulus Amebocyte lysate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. We found that this HMW uPA preparation contains very negligible amounts (about 1 pg/ml) of LPS. We next treated Beas2B cells with the same concentration, 1 pg/ml as well as a 10-fold increment, 10 pg/ml LPS, and measured uPAR expression by Western blotting as we described above. We found that these concentrations of LPS failed to induce uPAR expression, indicating that the induction of uPAR by uPA could not be attributable to LPS contamination. We next prepared stable uPA-overexpressing Beas2B cells and vector-treated controls by transfecting these cells with the eukaryotic expression vector PRc\CMV2 containing uPA cDNA or PRc\CMV2 cDNA using lipofection. We analyzed the uPA expression of the stable cell lines by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.3 a, Beas2B cells transfected with uPA cDNA expressed a relatively large amount of uPA in both the conditioned media and at the cell surface, in comparison to vector-transfected or non-transfected controls. We then measured the uPAR expression by these cells by Western blotting using a uPAR monoclonal antibody, and we confirmed that Beas2B cells transfected with uPA cDNA produced large amounts of uPAR at the cell surface. Vector-transfected or non-transfected control did not demonstrate increased uPAR expression, suggesting that induction of increased uPAR expression was attributable to stimulation effected by increased endogenous uPA (Fig. 3 b). We next wanted to determine the specificity of uPA binding to the surface of uPA-stimulated Beas2B cells. Accordingly, we treated PBS or uPA-stimulated Beas2B cells with 0–61 nm125I-uPA for 2 h at 4 °C with or without a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled uPA. The specific binding was calculated from the difference between total and nonspecific counts (30Shetty S. Idell S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 show that exogenously added uPA bound progressively with increasing concentration. Unstimulated Beas2B cells demonstrated functional uPAR; however, uPA stimulation enhanced125I-uPA binding at least 2–3-fold (Fig. 4 a). Binding of 125I-uPA was competed for by increasing concentrations of unlabeled uPA, and ∼60% was accounted for specific binding (Fig. 4 b). This observation is consistent with our previous finding that 30–35% of 125I-uPA binding is nonspecific in PMA-treated mesothelial cells (25Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Idell S. Antisense Res. Dev. 1995; 5: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982PubMed Google Scholar). Because the binding experiments in this study were performed at 4 °C, it is unlikely that the magnitude of the nonspecific binding is attributable solely to internalization of uPA·uPAR·PAI-1 complexes. To determine if uPA enhances plasminogen activation through induction of functional uPAR, unstimulated or uPA-treated cells were preincubated with uPA for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with plasminogen (6 μg) for 20 min at 37 °C. The rate of plasminogen activation was obtained by measuring the liberated plasmin. uPA induced plasmin generation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 c). By having determined that uPA mediates time-dependent uPAR expression at the lung epithelial cell surface, we wanted to confirm that the increased cell surface uPAR is attributable to an increased level of uPAR mRNA. We next measured the levels of uPAR mRNA in uPA-treated Beas2B epithelial cells by Northern blotting using a uPAR cDNA probe and densitometric scanning. As shown in Fig. 5, uPA induces uPAR mRNA, and the induction is observed as early as 3 h after the treatment. Maximum accumulation of uPAR mRNA is achieved between 12 and 24 h after the treatment. These data confirm the induction of uPAR expression by uPA as determined by Western blot. The level of uPAR mRNA was quantitated by densitometric scanning and normalized against β-actin loading controls. As shown in Fig. 5, resting Beas2B cells express small amounts of uPAR mRNA. However, uPAR mRNA levels increase about 20-fold by 24 h after uPA treatment. In order to determine whether uPA enhances uPAR gene transcription, we treated Beas2B cells with uPA for 6 and 12 h and isolated nuclei, and 32P-labeled RNA was hybridized with uPAR cDNA immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. The results of nuclear run-on transcription analyses demonstrated that uPA did not induce transcriptional activation of the uPAR gene (n = 3 data not shown). We next treated Beas2B cells with varying amounts (0–3 μg/ml) of two-chain uPA for 24 h and then measured cell surface uPAR expression by Western blot assay. Fig. 6 shows that uPA induced uPAR in a concentration-dependent manner. Induction is apparent with as low as 10 ng/ml uPA. Maximal uPAR expression was observed with 500 ng/ml uPA, beyond which there was a steady decline in uPAR expression. The steady decrease in uPAR expression at higher uPA concentration could be due to degradation of uPAR by uPA (31Hoyer-Hansen G. Ploug M. Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the induction of uPAR by uPA is specific and concentration-dependent. To determine whether uPA-mediated uPAR expression involves cellular signaling, we pretreated Beas2B cells with herbimycin A (2 μm) and genistein (6 μg/ml), protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors, separately or in combination with uPA. As shown in Fig. 7, neither herbimycin A nor genistein alone induced uPAR expression (Fig. 7,lanes 3 and 5). However, when Beas2B cells were treated with uPA, pretreatment with these inhibitors reversed uPA-mediated uPAR expression (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and6). Pretreatment of cells with vanadate (10 μm) (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor), on the other hand, did not block uPA-induced uPAR expression but appeared to enhance the uPA-mediated effect. These data suggest protein phosphorylation may be involved in the process. We next sought to determine if uPA interacts with cell surface uPAR to induce the receptor. To investigate this possibility, we pretreated Beas2B cells with anti-uPAR antibody for 2 h and then treated with uPA for 24 h. As shown in Fig.8 a, uPAR antibody (2 μg/ml) alone failed to induce cell surface uPAR expression, and pretreatment of Beas2B cells with this antibody failed to block uPA-induced uPAR expression (Fig. 8 a). To confirm that uPA-mediated uPAR expression does not involve uPAR, we next treated Beas2B cells with A5 (1 μg/ml) compound (a receptor agonist that blocks association of uPA with uPAR) (32Bhat G.J. Gunaje J.J. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L301-L309PubMed Google Scholar) alone or in combination with uPA. As shown in Fig.8 a, A5 alone minimally induced uPAR expression but, in combination with uPA, did not inhibit expression of uPAR at the cell surface. By using a third independent approach, we removed uPAR from cells by treating with PI-PLC (10 units/ml) and then tested to see if uPA would stimulate uPAR expression. It is known that uPAR is a GPI-linked protein, and PI-PLC completely removes GPI-linked proteins, including uPAR from the cell surface. Under these conditions, we still observed uPAR induction by uPA (Fig. 8 a). In a separate experiment, we found that PI-PLC completely cleaved uPAR from the cell surface by Western blotting of membrane fractions (data not shown), providing further evidence that the induction of uPAR by uPA is not mediated by their association at the cell surface. By having confirmed that uPA-mediated uPAR induction is not mediated through interaction with uPAR, we next wanted to determine if enzymatic activity of uPA is required for uPA-mediated uPAR induction. To address this possibility, we tested the ability of an anti-uPA monoclonal antibody to inhibit uPA expression. As shown in Fig. 8 b, an anti-uPA antibody (2 μg/ml) did not induce uPAR expression, whereas inactivation of uPA catalytic activity by this antibody reversed the effect. Similarly PAI-1 (4 μg/ml) (Fig. 8 b) inhibited uPA-mediated uPAR induction, indicating that uPA activity is required. uPA antibody or PAI-1 are large molecules and could therefore be inhibiting uPA-mediated functions b"

We have characterized the nuclear export motif of the adenoviral VA1 RNA, a small cytoplasmic RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Using a large panel of VA1 mutants in both transfected COS cells and injectedXenopus oocytes, we showed that the terminal stem of VA1 is necessary and sufficient for its export. Surprisingly, we found that the nucleotide sequence within the terminal stem is not important. Rather, the salient features of this motif are its length and its relative position within the RNA. Such stems thus define a novel and degenerate cytoplasmic localization motif that we termed the minihelix. This motif is found in a variety of polymerase III transcripts, and cross-competition analysis in Xenopus oocytes revealed that export of one such RNA, like hY1 RNA, is specifically competed by VA1 or artificial minihelix. Taken together these results show that the minihelix defines a new cis-acting export element and that this motif could be exported via a novel and specific nuclear export pathway.

Cytoplasmic or nuclear localization of RNA results from a balance between two opposing mechanisms, nuclear retention and transport through the nuclear pores (1Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Geraghty F.

Analyses of RNA export inXenopus oocytes have shown that the export machinery relies on saturable factors (4Bataille N. Helser T. Fried H.M. J.

Many essential transport factors have now been identified, such as Ran, exportins of the importin β family, and TAP (7Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Izaurralde E. Adam S. RNA. 1998; 4: 351-364PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev.

Exportins and TAP are transporters that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to transport a new cargo at each cycle. They can bind their cargo directly or via adaptor molecules. Ran is a small GTPase able to switch between GDP- and GTP-bound states, Ran-GTP is formed in the nucleus, whereas conversion into Ran-GDP is catalyzed in the cytoplasm. RCC1, the Ran GDP exchange factor (RanGEF), is exclusively nuclear whereas the Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP) as well as the co-stimulatory factors RanBP1 and RanBP2 are cytoplasmic or at the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex. This is thought to provide a gradient of Ran within the cell with RanGTP in the nucleus and RanGDP in the cytoplasm. Exportins bind their substrates in a RanGTP-dependent way and in the cytoplasm, stimulation of GTP hydrolysis on Ran triggers dissociation of the cargo from its receptor. A well characterized example of a Ran-dependent export pathway is illustrated by the tRNA export. RanGTP, but not RanGDP, can form, in the nucleus, a stable trimeric complex containing Ran, tRNA, and the tRNA exportin, Xpo-t, (11Arts G.J. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W. Curr.

Following translocation through the nuclear pores, the cytoplasmic Ran-GTPase-activating proteins promote GTP hydrolysis and disassembly of the complex (14Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J.

The tRNA is thus released, and the other factors can be recycled for another round of export. Despite our knowledge of export mechanisms, the actual RNA elements that promote export are still not well characterized. These elements are however critical because they are responsible for the specificity of transport; they are the initial trigger of the export process, and they determine which RNA will be selected from the nuclear RNA population. To date, the best example characterized is that of snRNAs, for which the export determinant was shown to consist of the 5′-cap structure and is thus identical for all the RNAs of this family (16Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A common export determinant probably also exists for tRNAs because Xpo-t recognizes a conserved feature of the structure that is formed by acceptor and T stems (11Arts G.J. Fornerod M. Mattaj I.W.

In the case of mRNAs, a variety of sequences could be involved in addition to the 5′-cap and the poly(A) tail (1Custodio N. Carmo-Fonseca M. Geraghty F. Pereira H.S. Grosveld F. Antoniou M.

Biol. 1983; 163: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, many mRNA-binding proteins shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (22Caceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 23Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 24Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and could be adaptors between mRNA and the export machinery. As suggested by these examples, it is likely that cytoplasmic RNAs of different classes bear specific cis-acting export elements, many of them remaining uncharacterized. In the present study, we focused on polymerase III transcripts (pol III),1 and we have analyzed in detail the adenovirus VA1 RNA (VA1). VA1 is a small viral RNA, which accumulates in large amounts in the cytoplasm of adenovirus-infected cells (25Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5083-5099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mathews M.B. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5657-5662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its function is to inhibit the double-stranded-dependent kinase, PKR, which otherwise blocks translation of the viral mRNAs (27O'Malley R.P. Mariano T.M. Siekierka J. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1986; 44: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our study led us to identify a new cis-acting RNA export motif that we termed the minihelix motif. Interestingly, this motif is encountered in a large family of small viral and cellular transcripts, which all are transcribed by pol III. The sequences of U1ΔSm, U6Δss, hY1, and tRNAPhe have been previously described (16Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 28O'Brien C.A.

The different mutations introduced into the terminal stem of the VAΔIV gene were obtained through the specific annealing of two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into blunted restriction sites of the VAΔIV (EcoRV andEco47III) (30Barcellini C.S. Fenard D. Bertrand E. Singer R.H. Lefebvre J.C. Doglio A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Artificial sequences were obtained by cloning polymerase chain reaction fragments downstream of the human U6 promoter. All constructs containing artificial sequences were derived from the pU6+1 plasmid (31Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). All relevant sequences are shown in the figures, except for the loop of the artificial RNAs (base number 2321–2364 of LacZ, starting from the ATG). Purified recombinantSchizosaccharomyces pombe Rna1p and RanBP1 were provided by A. Wittinghofer (Max Planck Institute, Dormund, Germany). RanQ69L-GTP was expressed and purified essentially as described (54Klebe C. Bishoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) using an expression vector provided by C. Dingwall (Stony Brook, N.Y.). Monkey COS1 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf fetal serum. Cells were transformed by the calcium-phosphate co-precipitation procedure and analyzed 24 h after transfection (31Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed on polymerase chain reaction products using the Ampliscribe T7 transcription kit (Epicentre Technologies) (see also Ref. 30Barcellini C.S. Fenard D. Bertrand E. Singer R.H. Lefebvre J.C. Doglio A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Labeled RNAs were synthesized by adding 80 µCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by gel filtration. Capped U1ΔSm RNA was transcribed in the presence of 3 mm of m7G(5′)pppG. The sequence of the RNA injected into Xenopus oocytes corresponded exactly to the one expressed in mammalian cells, except that the first three bases (GUC) were replaced by GGG to allow for an efficient in vitro transcription. The complementary bases in the RNA structure were also modified to compensate for these changes. Nuclear injections were performed inXenopus oocytes as previously described (32Terns M.P. Goldfarb D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 559-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a total volume of 20 nl of RNA mixture per nucleus. To control nuclear injection, samples were mixed with trypan blue (0.5 mg/ml). After nuclear injection, oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for the indicated time in modified bath medium, then transferred into ice-cold 1% trichloroacetic acid. After manual dissection, only oocytes with blue nuclei were used for further analysis. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were homogenized in solubilization buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5% SDS). Samples were then shaken for 30 min at 4 °C before digestion by proteinase K (2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 56 °C. RNAs were purified using conventional molecular biology techniques (phenol extraction and ethanol concentration) then analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. For each sample, five oocytes were pooled and 2 oocyte equivalents were loaded by lane. As artificial minihelices are highly structured RNAs, they migrate faster than expected and Stem17 (90 nt) migrates faster than tRNAPhe(76 nt) unless gels are prerun for 30 min at 25 watts before loading. When indicated results were quantified using the Bioprint acquisition system and Bioprofil program (Vilbert Lourmat, France). In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (30Barcellini C.S. Fenard D. Bertrand E. Singer R.H. Lefebvre J.C. Doglio A.

VA1 has been previously dissected into three different functional domains (Refs. 25Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5083-5099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mellits K.H. Mathews M.B.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3534-3543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.1 A): an apical stem-loop, required for PKR binding; a central domain, responsible for PKR inhibition; and a terminal stem, which brings together the 5′- and 3′-ends of the RNA. In previous studies, several VA1 mutants, having well defined secondary structure, had been generated (30Barcellini C.S. Fenard D. Bertrand E. Singer R.H. Lefebvre J.C. Doglio A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 34Mellits K.H. Mathews M.B.

Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3534-3543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced in the apical or central domains but maintained an intact terminal stem (Fig. 1 B). Intracellular localization of these VA1 mutants was analyzed in transiently transfected COS1 cells using in situ hybridizations. These mutant RNAs (dl2, dl4, dl7, VAΔIV, ls1, ls2, ls5) accumulated in large amounts in the cytoplasm, similarly to the parental VA1 (Fig.1 C and see Table I for quantifications). Thus, neither the apical domain nor the central domain appeared to be required for the cytoplasmic localization of VA1. Some sequences were, however, necessary, because a construct for which the 3′-half of VA1 was replaced by some unrelated lacZ sequence remained nuclear (Fig. 1 C, VA-Z).Table IQuantification of the localization of the different constructs used in this study and characterization of their intracellular stabilityRNA1-aThe different VA1 RNA mutants tested are described in detail in Figs. 2 and 4.In situ localization in COS1 cells1-bCOS1 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated RNA, and their intracellular distribution was analyzed by in situ hybridization.

Open table in a new tab To test whether the terminal stem was necessary for export, we created a new set of mutants. Mutations were inserted into a VA1 derivative (VAΔIV) that despite the lack of the central domain localized in the cytoplasm (Refs. 30Barcellini C.S. Fenard D. Bertrand E. Singer R.H. Lefebvre J.C. Doglio A. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1998; 8: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37Cagnon L. Cucchiarini M. Lefebvre J.C. Doglio A. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1995; 9: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig.2 A, some mutations introduced mismatches within the stem (Mut4, Mut5, Mut6), whereas others interrupted it (Mut8, Mut10). It was expected that the design of these mutations might profoundly affect the secondary structure of the VA1 terminal stem. Mut4, Mut5, and Mut10 were not exported to the cytoplasm and remained mostly nuclear, while Mut6 and Mut8 showed an intermediary phenotype (Fig. 2 B and see Table I for quantifications). It thus appeared that mutations affecting the terminal stem structure had profound effects on VA1 cytoplasmic localization. Changes in either the export process itself, or in RNA stability, can affect the steady-state cellular localization of RNA. Indeed, some mutations could selectively impair VA1 stability in the cytoplasm and to result in a global change of nucleocytoplasmic partitioning. Steady-state expression levels, of all the tested VA1 RNA mutants, were however very similar in different cell types (293, COS1) as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of transiently transfected cells (data not shown). We also measured VA1 RNA mutant half-life in 293 cells treated with actinomycin D (Table I). With the exception of Mut10, which was significantly less stable (half-life: 40 min), half-lives of all the VA1 mutants were very similar, independent of the nuclear or the cytoplasmic localization of the mutant. Half-lives of these RNAs were similar to that of the parental VA1 ranging between 2.5 and 6.5 h (Table I). Thus, it appeared that the terminal stem was required for export per se and not for cytoplasmic RNA stability. To unambiguously prove that the VA1 terminal stem was acis-acting export element, we turned to the model ofXenopus oocyte, which allows direct kinetic analyses of transport. Different radiolabeled RNAs were injected into oocyte nuclei, and their nucleocytoplasmic distribution was analyzed at different times after injection (Fig.3 A). Consistent with earlier findings, tRNAphe and hY1 RNA were gradually exported to the cytoplasm, whereas a U6Δss RNA remained nuclear (6Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6436-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Hamm J. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4179-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 39Simons F.H. Rutjes S.A. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. RNA. 1996; 2: 264-273PubMed Google Scholar). VA1 and VAΔIV were also gradually exported, and about half of the RNA was detected in the cytoplasm 3 h after nuclear injection. Subsequently, the export of several of the VA1 RNA mutants, previously used in COS1 cells (see Fig. 2), was analyzed in Xenopusoocyte (Fig. 3 B). VA1 RNA mutants having no terminal stem (Mut10) or a strong alteration of the stem structure (Mut5), and which were shown to remain nuclear in COS1 cells (Fig. 2 B), were also not exported in Xenopus (Fig. 3 B). This lack of cytoplasmic accumulation did not result from a specific degradation in the oocyte cytoplasm, because decay of the total injected RNA was minimal and also similar for exported RNAs (Fig. 3 B). Previous studies in Xenopus oocytes have shown that all known RNA export pathways can be specifically and independently saturated by an excess of substrate RNA. As shown in Fig.4, co-injection of an excess of VA1 completely inhibited the nuclear export of radiolabeled VA1 (lanes 5 and 6 versus lanes 2 and3). The competition was specific because the export of U1ΔSm was not affected whereas, conversely, an excess of U1ΔSm did not compete for VA1 export (lanes 8 and 9). Taken together, these experiments showed that the VA1 terminal stem was sufficient and necessary to promote the nuclear export of the VA1 both in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocyte through a saturable export pathway. A comparative analysis of all VA1 sequences from human and simian adenoviruses available in databases showed that the overall structure of the VA1 terminal stem was well conserved. This stem was characterized by base pairing of the 5′- and 3′-RNA termini over 20 bases and the presence of two mismatches regularly spaced (Fig.1 A and Ref. 25Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5083-5099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the mismatches were important for export, we converted them into base pairs (Mut1–3, Fig.2 A). After transfection in COS1 cells, these mutants localized in the cytoplasm as efficiently as VA1 (Fig. 2 B). A further analysis of VA1 sequences failed to reveal a particular consensus motif in the sequence of the terminal stem (data not shown). This suggested that the primary sequence of the stem was not important, as long as its structure was conserved. To positively prove this point, we created several artificial RNAs (Fig.5 A). These RNAs were derived from the LacZ sequence, and they were chosen to show no similarity to the primary sequence of VA1. Even though they contained no natural sequences, they were designed to form a terminal stem mimicking that of VA1 at the structural level. In a first step, two RNAs were generated, that formed a terminal stem of either 20 or 17 bases (Fig.5 A, Stem20 and Stem17). Because theVA1 gene contains an intragenic promoter (40Bhat R.A. Metz B. Thimmappaya B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), another pol III promoter, the human U6 promoter, was used to express Stem20 and Stem17 in COS1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, Stem20 and Stem17 efficiently accumulated in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. In addition, injection of Stem20 and Stem17 in Xenopus oocyte nuclei showed that these artificial RNAs were also exported in this system, similar to VAΔIV (Figs. 3 B and 4). Interestingly, export of Stem17 appeared to be a saturable process because it was blocked by an excess of Stem17 (Fig. 4, lane 12 versus lane 3). Furthermore, export of Stem17 was also inhibited by an excess of VA1 competitor (Fig. 4, lane 6 versus lane 3), and, reciprocally, export of VA1 was blocked by an excess of Stem17 (Fig. 4, lane 12 versus lane 3). These competitions were specific because export of U1ΔSm was not affected. These results demonstrated that artificial RNAs displaying a terminal stem with structural features similar to the one of VA1 were localized in the cytoplasm of both mammalian cells and Xenopusoocytes. Remarkably, no specific sequences appeared to be required within the terminal stem, they thus represented a highly degenerate cytoplasmic localization motif that we termed the minihelix. Furthermore, cross-competition experiments indicated that artificial terminal stems and VA1 likely shared the same export pathway. The apparent lack of requirement for a specific sequence in the minihelix motif is paradoxical, because many RNAs that contain helices of similar length are not exported. To delineate the specific features of the minihelix motif, we constructed new mutants, derived from Stem17 and Stem20, to analyze their localization in COS1 cells. First, a conserved feature of minihelices was the length of the stem. We thus created a set of artificial RNAs, which shortened the stem gradually from 20 to 12 bases (Fig. 5 A). A stem of 12 bases was not exported, whereas a stem of 14 bases gave an intermediate phenotype (Fig. 5 B). A second characteristic of minihelices was base pairing of the RNA 5′-end, i.e. its first nucleotides with nucleotides close to the 3′-end (Fig. 1 A). This suggested that the precise position of the RNA 5′- and 3′-ends could be critical for minihelix function. As shown in Fig. 5, a mutation designed to disrupt the first base pair of Stem20 (Fig. 5 A, MM1) was sufficient to significantly decrease Stem20 export (Fig. 5 B and TableI). Furthermore, mispairing of the first three base pairs completely blocked Stem20 export (Fig. 5 B, MM3; and Table I). These results indicated that the RNA 5′-end had to be part of the minihelix in order to promote RNA export. Another set of mutants were designed to maintain the 5′-terminal base pairing, whereas the RNA 3′-end was displaced further downstream from the base of the stem. Insertion of 8 bases had little effect on export (Fig. 5 B, Xt8), but an 18-base insertion blocked it completely (Fig. 5 B, Xt18). This indicated that the minihelix should not only contain the RNA 5′-end, but should also have the 3′-end in its vicinity. The last characteristic of the minihelix that we analyzed was its tolerance to bending. Indeed, mismatches such as the ones found in the terminal stem of VA1 allow stacking of the neighboring helices (41Kim J. Walter A.E. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13753-13761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but with flexibility and bending at the junction (42Zacharias M. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 486-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, we inserted bulges of 3 or 6 As in the middle of the stem of Stem20, because previous in vitro work predicted that these would create bends of 60°"

Associated with all RNA polymerase III transcripts where the 3′-UUU-OH sequence is added as the transcription termination signal, La is thought to play a central role in the metabolism of these RNAs by acting as a molecular chaperone that stabilizes and/or structures them for further processing (3Pannone B.K. Xue D.H. Wolin S.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7442-7453Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In HeLa cell extracts, the 5′- and 3′-end processing of tRNA precursors is influenced by La (4Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Engelke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and in vitro, La activity has been suggested in RNA polymerase termination, recycling, and initiation reactions (5Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 6Maraia R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3383-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Fan H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2147-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Walker A nucleotide-binding motif in La was postulated to confer ATP-dependent RNA/DNA and RNA/RNA helicase activity (9Bachmann M. Pfeifer K. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 85-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Hühn P. Pruijn G.J.M. van Venrooij W.J. Bachmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but recently, the binding of La to double-stranded nucleic acids was shown to be independent of this site, and La does not appear to unwind double-stranded RNA (11James M.C. Jeffrey I.W. Pruijn G.J.M. Thijssen J.P.H. Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Walker A motif has instead been implicated in binding to the 5′-triphosphate ends of nascent tRNAs, with the affinity negatively modulated by phosphorylation of Ser366 (4Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Engelke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Fan H. Sakulich A.L. Goodier J.L. Zhang X.L. Qin J. Maraia R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic functions for La have also been described, including facilitation of translation or replication of viral RNA and stabilization of histone mRNA (12Ali N. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,13McLaren R.S. Caruccio N. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3028-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 46.8-kDa human La antigen is a modular protein (14Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and belongs to the RNA recognition motif (RRM)1 protein or the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) superfamily. The RRM motif is an approximately 80-amino acid RNA-binding domain that contains several well conserved residues. Some of these residues cluster into two short submotifs, the octameric RNP-1 and the hexameric RNP-2 (15Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Several members of the RNP family involved in single- and double-stranded RNA recognition carry multiple copies of the RRM in a tandem arrangement (15Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Protease digestion showed that the La protein can be divided in a N-terminal and a highly charged C-terminal domain connected by a 43-amino acid linker (16Chan E.K.L. Sullivan K.F. Fox R.I. Tan E.M. J. Autoimmun. 1989; 2: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The N terminus is highly conserved and can be subdivided further in a La protein-specific domain (La motif), amino acids 16–75 (17Sobel S.G. Wolin S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3849-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and a RNA-binding motif, RRM1, spanning amino acids 112–184 (18Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 89-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Most of the autoantigenic epitopes are found in this domain of the protein with the immunodominant epitopes mapping to RRM1 (19Pruijn G.J.M. Thijssen J.P.H. Smith P.R. Williams D.G. van Venrooij W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal region of the protein seems to have expanded differentially during evolution. A highly degenerate RNA recognition domain, RRM2, amino acids 230–294, is present in metazoans but absent in yeast (20van Venrooij W.J. Slobbe R.L. Pruijn G.J.M. Mol. Biol. Reports. 1993; 18: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This domain is fused to several auxiliary domains involved in RNA binding and functional specialization, such as a dimerization domain localized within residues 294–348 (22Craig A.W.B. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the putative ATP-binding motif, amino acids 333–340 (23Topfer F. Gordon T. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3091-3100PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphorylation site at Ser366 (4Fan H. Goodier J.L. Chamberlain J.R. Engelke D.R. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3201-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Fan H. Sakulich A.L. Goodier J.L. Zhang X.L. Qin J. Maraia R.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 707-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and a nuclear localization signal in the region of amino acids 382–408 (24Rosenblum J.S. Pemberton L.F. Bonifaci N. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Simons F.H.M. Broers F.J.M. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A bipartite binding model correlating the 5′-end binding activity with the C-terminal part and 3′-end recognition with the N-terminal region of La has been proposed (26Maraia R.J. Intine R.V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but to date, no comparative quantitative study dissecting the contributions of the individual domains to either of these RNA binding activities has been undertaken.K d values for general RNA binding of full-length La under various assay conditions with different RNA substrates have been reported, and they range from 37 to 5 nm (27Chang Y.N. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7008-7020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Investigations with in vitro translated N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of La and human Y RNA localized the RNA binding activity within the N-terminal domain of the antigen (29Pruijn G.J.M. Slobbe R.L. van Venrooij W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similarly, the La motif in conjunction with RRM1 and several additional C-terminal residues were determined to form the minimal structure for high affinity interaction with tRNA precursors and viral RNAs (27Chang Y.N. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7008-7020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, regions within the C-terminal domain of La, distinct from the N terminus, may be critical for recognition of the 3′-end (28Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, through immunoprecipitation and filter binding assays, La phosphorylation primarily occurring at Ser366was reported to impair poly(U) recognition (30Bachmann M. Schröder H.C. Wagner K.G. Mayet W.J. Pfeifer K. Müller W.E.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Pfeifle J. Anderer F.A. Franke M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of ATP was found to abrogate the 3′-UUU-OH affinity (30Bachmann M. Schröder H.C. Wagner K.G. Mayet W.J. Pfeifer K. Müller W.E.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A systematic examination of the 3′-end binding activity of RRM2, also localized within the C-terminal domain of La, is lacking. It could contribute to RNA binding or serve a different function. To understand the role of the individual RRMs in La, as well as the C-terminal region outside these motifs, we constructed and purified two deletion mutants containing one or both RNA-binding units. Our assay system was designed to investigate the contributions of the individual protein regions solely to the 3′-end binding affinity of La. The two parameters, binding affinity and specificity, that characterize the RNA complex formation were determined by gel mobility shift analysis and compared with the truncated proteins under identical assay conditions. Furthermore, the influence of phosphorylation on the binding affinity of full-length La was studied. The effect of ATP on single-stranded RNA recognition was also probed in the presence of ATP or the nonhydrolyzable ATP mimic ATP-γ-S. We describe how our results relate to the binding model postulated for the activity of La in the pre-tRNA maturation pathway (26Maraia R.J. Intine R.V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding the human La antigen in the pET-8c expression vector was a generous gift of G. J. M. Pruijn (University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The nonameric RNA sequences 9nt-U, 5′-UGCUGUUUU-3′, and 9nt-A, 5′-CCGAAAAAA-3′, were synthesized at the Genzentrum (Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität, Munich, Germany). The quantitation of radioactively labeled RNA probes was carried out on a Fuji phosphorus imaging system. DNA fragments encoding the truncated proteins La-RRM1 (amino acid 1–202) and La-RRM1-RRM2 (amino acids 10–300) were derived by polymerase chain reaction. The primers were synthesized on the basis of the published human La sequence (14Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the addition of an NdeI and a EcoRI restriction site and cloned into the pET-22b+ vector (Novagen). The primers used were 5′-AAA AAA ACA TAT GGC TGA AAA TGG TGA TAA TGA AAA GAT GGC T-3′ and 5′-AGA ATT CCT ATT CCA CTT TAT TTT G-3′ for the La-RRM1 mutant and 5′-AAA AAA ACA TAT GGC TGC CCT GG-3′ and 5′-AGA ATT CTC ATT CTT TGT TCC TTA ATT G-3′ for the La-RRM1-RRM2 mutant. The resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and used for recombinant protein production. The full-length and truncated La proteins were overproduced in Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3) plysS (Stratagene). The cells were harvested 3 h after induction, resuspended in 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmEDTA, and 10 mg/ml Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and sonicated. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 × g and 4 °C to yield the supernatant with the overexpressed soluble protein. This supernatant was filtered through a 2-µm filter and loaded onto a Resource Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on an Äkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 0.1 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 9% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A). The flow through fraction was immediately loaded onto a 5-ml Heparin Hitrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted over 10 column volumes with a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing the desired protein were pooled, diluted 5-fold, loaded onto a 10-ml poly(U)-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted over 4 column volumes with the same gradient. The fractions containing pure recombinant protein were concentrated in Millipore Ultrafree 5-kDa molecular weight cut-off filter units. Purity was determined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined fromA 280 by using the calculated extinction coefficients of 40,500 m−1 cm−1for La, 22,100 m−1 cm−1 for La-RRM1, and 28,700 m−1 cm−1 for La-RRM1-RRM2. The purified proteins were stored at 4 °C. All CD studies were performed on a Jasco J-715 spectrophotometer with a 0.1-cm-pathlength cuvette. The proteins were diluted to 200 µg/ml in 0.4 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 3 mm NaCl. The measurements were made at room temperature with a 1-nm bandwidth and 0.1-nm step size. Each spectrum is the average of eight recordings. The synthetic RNA nonamer 9nt-U was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on G25 spin columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the gel mobility shift assays 300 ng (5000 cpm) of this RNA substrate were titrated with 90 pm to 7 µm of the respective protein La, La-RRM1-RRM2, or La-RRM1 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (buffer B). The influence of a ribonucleotide triphosphate was probed in the presence of 90 µm ATP (Sigma) or ATP-γ-S (Sigma), respectively. The binding reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min in a total volume of 23 µl. Upon addition of loading dye (40% sucrose, 0.01% (w/v) xylene cyanol), the solutions were immediately resolved on a prerun, precooled 9% native polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mmTris-HCl, 45 mm boric acid, 0.1 mm EDTA). The gels were run for 1 h at 110 V and then vacuum dried onto Whatman No. 3MM chromatography paper. The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film and quantitated by phosphorus imaging. For each titration reaction the bands corresponding to the bound and the unbound probe were quantitated. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) was estimated from nonlinear least square fits of binding data to the Langmuir isotherm (32Lohman T.M. Mascott D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using KaleidaGraph 3.5 software, where θ is the fraction of bound oligonucleotide probe and P is the total protein concentration. Each K d value is the average of at least two replicates. θ=P/(P+Kd)(Eq. 1) Relative dissociation constants for La, La-RRM1, and La-RRM1-RRM2 were determined in a competition assay. The full-length protein (27 nm), La-RRM1 (9 nm), or La-RRM1-RRM2 (270 nm) were incubated for 10 min on ice with varying concentrations of unlabeled 9nt-U or 9nt-A in a total volume of 22 µl. After addition of 32P-labeled 9nt-U (150 nm), the reaction mixtures were incubated for an additional 10 min to reach equilibrium at concentrations at which 10–80% of the labeled RNA was bound. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis as described for the gel mobility shift assays. Phosphorus imaging analysis was used to quantitate the bands corresponding to bound and unbound probe. The competitive binding of a protein to the labeled RNA probe and the unlabeled competitor RNA can be described by Equation 2 (33Lin S.-Y. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), where K rel is the ratio of K t, the apparent dissociation constant of the labeled probe, to K C, the apparent dissociation constant of the competitor, and P t,T t, and C t are the concentrations of the protein, the radiolabeled probe, and the competitor probe, respectively. Competition data were fit to Equation 2 by using KaleidaGraph 3.5 software. The errors were based on the statistical fit of the data and represent ± S.D. Each data point was determined in two or three independent experiments. θ=12Tt{Kt+KrelCt+Pt+Tt−[Kt+KrelCt+Pt+Tt]2−4TtPt}(Eq. 2) For the phosphorylation reactions 2.8 µg of the full-length La protein was incubated overnight at 30 °C with 500 units of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 300 µm ATP in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer in a total volume of 30 µl. Similarly, 2.8 µg of La protein were incubated with 5 units of protein phosphatase 1 (New England Biolabs). As a control for the loss of RNA binding activity, the same reactions were also carried out in the absence of those enzymes. Subsequent RNA binding assays were performed as described above. Isoelectric focussing was performed on a Phast system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with Servalyt precotes gels (Serva) over a pH range of 3–10. The gels were electrophoresed at 2.5 mA for 30 min with a 300 VAh limit. The pI values were deduced by using the broad pI calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Visualization of the proteins was performed by Coomassie Blue staining. Early studies suggested that La recognizes 3′-terminal uridylates in RNA (2Stefano J.E. Cell. 1984; 36: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 34Mathews M.B. Francoeur A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the full-length La protein contains two distinct RRM domains designated RRM1 (amino acids 112–184) and RRM2 (amino acids 230–294) (Fig.1 A), two deletion mutants were designed, cloned, and overexpressed with the intent to delineate the RNA-binding determinants within the modular protein. The first construct, La-RRM1, was projected to be the minimal unit with specific RNA binding activity. Previous studies had found that neither the isolated La domain (27Chang Y.N. Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Gatignol A. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7008-7020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) nor RRM1 alone (29Pruijn G.J.M. Slobbe R.L. van Venrooij W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) dispose of RNA recognition specificity. Furthermore, high affinity RNA binding by RRM1 in conjunction with the La-specific domain was achieved only in the presence of several subsequent C-terminal residues (28Goodier J.L. Fan H. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, La-RRM1 was chosen to span the N-terminal region of La, comprising the La motif, amino acids 16–111, the RNA-binding domain RRM1, and 17 subsequent amino acids (185) (Fig. 1 A). These amino acids were added based on secondary structure predictions that revealed an α-helical element ending at residue 202. To investigate the additional contributions of RRM2 to RNA affinity, a second mutant comprising amino acids 10–300, La-RRM1-RRM2, was designed. In this construct the putative RNA-binding region in the C-terminal domain was included. The full-length La protein and the truncation mutants were all purified in very high yields in three steps by anion exchange, heparin, and poly-uracil affinity chromatography. UV-visible spectra confirmed that the recombinant protein was obtained RNA free. Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels established the purity to be >95% (Fig.1 B). The identity of the proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Circular dichroism spectra verified that all proteins were folded (data not shown). Equilibrium binding titration experiments were performed to determine the apparent dissociation constantsK d of full-length La and the two deletion mutants La-RRM1 and La-RRM1-RRM2. Increasing amounts of wild-type or mutant protein were added to the nonameric RNA substrate 9nt-U, which carries a poly-uridylate sequence at the 3′ terminus to mimic the binding site on tRNA precursors. Binding titrations for all three proteins were carried out under identical conditions. With increasing protein concentrations, the RNA probe was recruited to slower migrating forms, because of specific complex formation (Fig.2). Whereas for the La-RRM1 fragment only one slower migrating form was identified (Fig. 2 C), for La-RRM1-RRM2 (Fig. 2 B) and the full-length La (Fig.2 A) two distinct bands of retarded mobility were detected, indicating that complexes of different oligomerization states were formed. For quantitation of the fractions of RNA complexed by protein, θ, all shifted bands were quantitated with a phosphorus imaging device. A plot of the binding data is presented in Fig. 2 D. The θ versus protein concentration data were analyzed by a nonlinear least square fit to the Langmuir equation, affording aK d value of 25 ± 10 nm for the full-length protein. The deletion mutant La-RRM1 binds with a 5-fold higher affinity as witnessed by a K d of 6 ± 3 nm, suggesting that it is a sufficient functional unit for RNA recognition. La-RRM1-RRM2, which contains the second putative RRM domain, binds with an ∼3–4-fold lower affinity relative to the full-length protein. The dissociation constant of this construct was determined to be 90 ± 10 nm. AllK d values reported are apparent dissociation constants, with the assumption that the protein binds as a monomer because the oligomerization state was not determined. To assess the ability of La and its truncation mutants to discriminate for the specific RNA substrate 9nt-U, the stability of a protein complex with the 9nt-U substrate was challenged by titrating increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor into the binding reactions prior to the addition of the specific 9nt-U substrate. Either the 9nt-U substrate or a RNA nonamer containing a hexameric adenylate stretch at the 3′-end, 9nt-A, served as the specific or nonspecific competitor, respectively. The competition data were analyzed by a plot of the protein fraction bound to the specific RNA substrate after addition of the competitor RNA versuscompetitor concentration (Fig. 3). A least squares fit of the data for La and its truncation mutants to Equation 2 yielded K d values for the specific competitor probe 9nt-U in excellent agreement with those determined with the binding titration experiments (TableI). The binding affinity for the nonspecific 9nt-A competitor afforded apparent dissociation constants in the micromolar range. The relative binding affinities of the three proteins paralleled the affinities found with the specific probe,K d (La-RRM1) >K d (La) >K d (La-RRM1-RRM2). Thus for all three proteins, the binding specificity is ∼100-fold (Table I).Table IBinding affinities and specificities of human La antigen and two C-terminal deletion mutantsProteinK d for specific probe 9nt-UK d for nonspecific probe 9nt-ASpecificityK d(nonspecific)/K d(specific)nmnmLa25 ± 101-aDetermined by titration.25 ± 151-bDetermined by competition assay.2100 ± 9801-bDetermined by competition assay.84La-RRM16 ± 31-aDetermined by titration.5 ± 31-bDetermined by competition assay.1250 ± 2501-bDetermined by competition assay.250La-RRM1-RRM290 ± 101-aDetermined by titration.50 ± 71-bDetermined by competition assay.4200 ± 3001-bDetermined by competition assay.841-a Determined by titration.1-b Determined by competition assay. Open table in a new tab The basic region of human La contains the sequence 333GRRFKGKG340 representing a potential NTP-binding site of the consensus sequence GXXXXGKX Walker A motif found in a number of ATP-binding proteins (23Topfer F. Gordon T. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3091-3100PubMed Google Scholar). Inconsistent results have been reported for the RNA binding affinity of La in the presence of ATP. Although no influence of ATP was found in filter binding assays (31Pfeifle J. Anderer F.A. Franke M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), abrogation of RNA binding in the presence of ATP was reported with immunoprecipitated complexes (30Bachmann M. Schröder H.C. Wagner K.G. Mayet W.J. Pfeifer K. Müller W.E.G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus the complex stability in the presence of a 10-fold excess of ATP was investigated under the conditions established for the binding titration experiments described in the previous sections, and the results of these experiments are presented in Fig.4. The RNA binding affinity of full-length La is maintained at 25 nm ATP. Similar results were obtained with the nonhydrolyzable ATP mimic ATP-γ-S (data not shown). An influence of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis in mediating the sequence-specific 3′-end recognition of RNA can thus be excluded. The residue Ser366of La resides within a conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site with the consensus sequence (S/T)XX(D/E) (31Pfeifle J. Anderer F.A. Franke M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 928: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Pizer L.I., J.-S., D. Stenberg R.M. Tan E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

In this study, we examine the mechanism of mouse fertilin α's in adhesion of sperm to the egg plasma membrane during fertilization. We find that recombinant forms of fertilin α corresponding to either the disintegrin-like domain or the cysteine-rich domain and the EGF-like repeat can perturb sperm-egg binding, suggesting that both of these domains can participate in fertilin α-mediated adhesion events. In further examination of the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain, we find that a subdomain of disintegrin-like domain with the sequence DLEECDCG outside the putative disintegrin loop but with homology to the fertilin β disintegrin loop can inhibit the binding of both sperm and recombinant fertilin α to eggs, suggesting that this is an adhesion-mediating motif of the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain. This sequence also inhibits the binding of recombinant fertilin β to eggs and thus is the first peptide sequence found to block two different sperm ligands. Finally, a monoclonal antibody to the tetraspanin protein CD9, KMC.8, inhibited the binding of recombinant fertilin α to eggs in one type of binding assay, suggesting that, under certain conditions, fertilin α may interact with a KMC.8-sensitive binding site on the egg plasma membrane.AF167406U22056 Fertilin α (also known as ADAM1) is a member of the ADAM (Adisintegrin and Ametalloprotease domain) family of proteins.

To date, ∼30 ADAMs have been identified in a variety of animal species, including several mammals, Xenopus laevis,Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans (1Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 83-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The conserved domain structure of ADAMs (see Fig.1 A) and functional analyses of these proteins indicate that members of this family have functions as proteases and/or as cell adhesion molecules. In the ADAMs that have been described to function as cell adhesion molecules, the adhesive activity generally appears to be attributable to the disintegrin-like domain, a domain with homology to integrin ligand-like snake venom polypeptides. These venom polypeptides, known as disintegrins, contain an RGD tripeptide, presented at the end of an extended loop structure called the “disintegrin loop” (3McLane M.A. Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Niewiarowski S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although ADAMs share significant sequence homology in their disintegrin-like domains to snake venom disintegrins, they do not have RGD sequences in their putative disintegrin loops (with the exception of human ADAM15). Various studies have shown that the adhesion-mediating sequence of several ADAMs appears to be a short sequence within the putative disintegrin loop, such as the ECD-containing sequences in fertilin β (4Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A.C. Osburne L. White J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ADAM23 (7Cal S. Freije J.M.P. Lopez J.M. Takada Y. Lopez-Otin C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1457-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), or the QCD-containing sequence in cyritestin (8Yuan R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Among the cell adhesion events that are mediated by ADAMs are the interactions between mammalian gamete plasma membranes during fertilization. On mouse sperm, there are at least three ADAMs that appear to participate in sperm-egg binding: fertilin α (ADAM1), fertilin β (ADAM2), and cyritestin (ADAM3) (reviewed in Ref. 9Evans J.P. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D114-D131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, fertilin β and cyritestin, as well as several other ADAMs, appear to mediate cell adhesion through short peptide sequences within the putative disintegrin loop of the disintegrin-like domain (4Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar,5Bigler D. Takahashi Y. Chen M.S. Almeida E.A.C. Osburne L. White J.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). With regard to fertilin α, studies of the putative disintegrin loop have been inconclusive, with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the fertilin α disintegrin loop (AEDVCDLP) having a modest inhibitory effect on sperm-egg interactions but with the scrambled control peptide (PDCEVADL) also having some effect (8Yuan R. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are data that imply that the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain participates in cell adhesion but also that the cysteine-rich domain can mediate adhesion as well. A recombinant form of fertilin α corresponding to the complete extracellular domain (i.e. the disintegrin-like domain, the cysteine-rich domain, and the EGF-like repeat) inhibits sperm-egg binding more effectively than does a shorter form with a truncated disintegrin-like domain (10Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that the presence of disintegrin-like domain in recombinant fertilin α enhances the ability of the recombinant fertilin α protein to inhibit sperm-egg binding. However, this truncated recombinant fertilin α, containing only the last C-terminal 20 amino acids of the disintegrin-like domain, along with the cysteine-rich domain, and the EGF-like repeat (designed with respect to the original N-terminal sequence data (11Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar)), still binds to mouse eggs and inhibits sperm-egg binding (12Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, an antibody against a similar construct of recombinant rabbit fertilin α, with a truncated disintegrin-like domain, inhibits rabbit in vitro fertilization (IVF) (13Hardy C.M. Clarke H.G. Nixon B. Grigg J.A. Hinds L.A. Holland M.K. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data suggest that domains in fertilin α other than the disintegrin-like domain, namely the cysteine-rich domain and/or the EGF-like repeat, participate in sperm-egg adhesion. Interestingly, this is similar to another member of the ADAM family, ADAM12, which appears to be able to utilize multiple domains to mediate cell adhesion, based on the observation that recombinant forms of the ADAM12 cysteine-rich domain (14Iba K. Albrechtsen R. Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Wewer U.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1489-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and the ADAM12 disintegrin-like domain (15Eto K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Sheppard D. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Zhang X.-P. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34922-34930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) can support cell adhesion in vitro. The primary purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain contains amino acids that interact with egg-binding sites. Our results with recombinant fertilin α disintegrin-like domain (hereafter referred to as recombinant fertilin αD) suggest that the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain participates in fertilin α-mediated sperm-egg binding. An examination of candidate subdomains of the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain to characterize what region(s) of the disintegrin-like domain had adhesive activity identified a short adhesion-mediating sequence that has homology to the fertilin β disintegrin loop but is in a location distinct from the putative disintegrin loop region of fertilin α. In light of this finding and other studies demonstrating that function-blocking antibodies against the α6 integrin subunit or against the tetraspanin protein CD9 inhibit sperm and fertilin β binding to eggs (16Chen M.S.

White J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11830-11835Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we also investigated the possibility that function-blocking antibodies against either of these proteins on eggs (GoH3 against α6; KMC.8 against CD9) would inhibit the binding of the recombinant fertilin αD to eggs. We find that GoH3 has no effect but that KMC.8 reduces recombinant fertilin αD binding detected by one type of assay. This observation suggests that the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain could interact with a KMC.8-sensitive site on the egg membrane but also indicates that the mode of presentation of recombinant fertilin α affects the sensitivity of fertilin α to inhibition by KMC.8. The complete extracellular portion of fertilin α (recombinant fertilin αDCE) included amino acids 406–708 (counting the start Met as amino acid 1) and was encoded by nucleotides 1216–2124 (counting the start ATG codon of full-length mouse fertilin α, assembled from the two partial cDNA sequences (accession numbers AF167406 and U22056), as nucleotides 1–3). This cDNA region was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using a 5′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 1216–1232 engineered with a XbaI restriction site (GGTCTAGAGCTGCCAATTGTGGGAA) and a 3′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 2109–2124 engineered with a stop codon and aSalI restriction site (TTTTGTCGACTTATTTCAGGTTTACCTCT). The region encoding the extracellular portion of fertilin α lacking the disintegrin domain (recombinant fertilin αCE, amino acids 493–708, encoded by nucleotides 1477–2124) was prepared by PCR amplification using a 5′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 1477–1493 engineered with a XbaI restriction site (GGTCTAGACAGTGTGATAGGATTTA) and a 3′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 2109–2124 engineered with a stop codon and a SalI restriction site (TTTTGTCGACTTATTTCAGGTTTACCTCT). The region encoding the fertilin α disintegrin-like domain (recombinant fertilin αD, amino acids 406–493, encoded by nucleotides 1216–1478) was prepared by PCR amplification using 5′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 1216–1232 engineered with a XbaI restriction site (GGTCTAGAGCTGCCAATTGTGGGAA) and a 3′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 1463–1479 engineered with a stop codon and aSalI restriction site (TTTTGTCGACTTACTGTGTGCCATCCTGCA). PCR amplifications using mouse fertilin α cDNA (pVAC-α.2) as template were performed in a PEC 2400 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with Pfu I polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR products were then digested with XbaI andSalI and cloned into pMAL-p.2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously (10Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were sequenced to verify that the DNA sequence encoded the correct amino acid sequence. All recombinant fertilin-maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α Escherichia colicells with induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, then purified on an amylose affinity column, and renatured by reduction and oxidation as previous described (10Evans J.P.

Peptides corresponding to different parts of the disintegrin domain of fertilin α were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to ≥95% purity. The N termini were acetylated, and the C termini were amidated. The sequences were chosen based on sequence alignment to the RGD-containing disintegrin loops of snake venom disintegrins (peptide a-1; AEDVCDLP, amino acids 465–472 of full-length mouse fertilin α), because of conservation between fertilin α and cyritestin (peptide a-2; DLPEYCDG, amino acids 470–477) or because of homology to the disintegrin loop of fertilin β (peptide a-3; DLEECDCG, amino acids 416–423). The scrambled peptide controls contained the same eight amino acids in rearranged order (a-1s, EPCVDALD; a-2s, EGDCPLDY; a-3s; CELDGDCE), respectively. Peptides were resuspended in degassed, sterile water to a stock concentration of 5 mm and then lyophilized in aliquots such that a 25-μl resuspension in Whitten's culture medium (20Whitten W.K. Adv. Bio. Sci. 1971; 6: 129-139Google Scholar) would yield a final peptide concentration of 1 mm. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase (BAP)-presented peptides were generated as described previously (4Zhu X.

In brief, complementary oligonucleotides were annealed to each other and ligated into theXbaI and BglII restriction sites in the multiple cloning site of the plasmid pHNAP, which includes a 6-histidine tag. Fusion proteins were expressed and purified on a nickel column as described previously (4Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol.

Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All gamete cultures were performed in Whitten's medium (20Whitten W.K. Adv. Bio. Sci. 1971; 6: 129-139Google Scholar) containing 22 mmNaHCO3 and 15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Albumax I; Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air. For most experiments, the zona pellucida (ZPs) were removed from eggs via solubilization with a very brief incubation (≤15 s) in acidic medium-compatible buffer (4Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For experiments using the monoclonal antibody GoH3 (anti-α6 integrin subunit), the ZP were removed by incubating the eggs in medium containing 10 μg/ml chymotrypsin (Sigma) for 5 min, allowing the ZP to swell, and then shearing off the ZP with a thin bore pipette. This treatment is used because GoH3 does not bind to eggs from which the ZP has been removed by acid solubilization (19Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Following ZP removal, the eggs were allowed to recover for 60 min in Whitten's medium. Sperm were collected from the caudae epididymides of (C57BL/6J × SJL/J)F1 male mice (8–10 weeks old; Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) and capacitated in vitro for 2.5–3 h. To examine the effects of recombinant fertilin α proteins on sperm-egg interactions, ZP-free eggs (20–25 eggs/5–6.5-μl drop) were incubated for 60 min prior to insemination in Whitten's medium containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP, recombinant fertilin αDCE, recombinant αD, or recombinant αCE. To examine the effects of synthetic peptides on sperm-egg interactions, ZP-free eggs (20–25 eggs/5–6.5-μl drop) were incubated for 60 min prior to insemination in Whitten's medium containing 1.0 mm of synthetic peptide a-1, a-1s, a-2, a-2s, a-3, or a-3s for 60 min. After incubation of eggs in either the peptide or the recombinant fertilin α protein, 5–6.5 μl of a suspension of capacitated sperm were added so that the final sperm concentration was 500,000 sperm/ml (adapted from Ref. 21Redkar A.A. Olds-Clarke P.J. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 500-508PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentration of the peptides during insemination was 0.5 mm, and the final concentration of the recombinant proteins during insemination was 0.25 mg/ml. After a 15-min insemination, the eggs were washed three times to remove loosely attached sperm (adapted from Ref. 21Redkar A.A. Olds-Clarke P.J. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 500-508PubMed Google Scholar). The eggs were then fixed in 3.7–4.0% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and mounted in VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) containing 1.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) to stain the sperm DNA. The average number of sperm bound per egg was determined. The values from each experiment were normalized with respect to the appropriate control (i.e. the MBP control or the no peptide control was defined as 100%). The data from multiple IVF experiments were analyzed by analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference post-hoc testing using StatView version 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To determine the effects of synthetic peptides or BAP-presented peptides on the binding of recombinant fertilin α or fertilin β, ZP-free eggs were first incubated in the indicated synthetic peptide (at 0.5 mm) or BAP-presented peptide at the indicated concentration (20, 40, or 80 μm) in Whitten's medium containing 15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 60 min and then in Whitten's medium containing both 0.5 mg/ml of the indicated form of recombinant fertilin α or fertilin β and the indicated BAP-presented peptide for an additional 60 min. During these incubations, the culture medium was supplemented so that the final concentrations of CaCl2 and MgSO4 were 2.4 and 1.2 mm, respectively. The binding of MBP recombinant fertilin fusion proteins to ZP-free eggs was quantified as described previously (4Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar), using an anti-MBP polyclonal rabbit antiserum (diluted 1:750; New England Biolabs), followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 0.12 μg/ml; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Egg-associated alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using the photon-emitting AP substrate disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro(1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan)-4-yl)phenyl phosphate (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Photon emission was measured in raw light units/10 s in a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). The data were normalized with respect to the appropriate control (indicated in the figure legends). Statistical analyses by analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference post-hoc testing were performed using StatView version 5.0 (SAS Institute). Fluorescent beads (0.2-μm yellow-green sulfate-derived latex FluoSpheres; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) were coated with recombinant fertilin αD (see Fig.1 C) or recombinant fertilin βD (4Zhu X. Bansal N.P. Evans J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7677-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as follows. The beads (5 μl of a 2% bead suspension) were incubated with 5 μl of 2 mg/ml anti-MBP IgG (purified by chromatography on protein G beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) from monoclonal clone MBP-17 ascites fluid (Sigma)) for 2 h. The beads were then washed once by resuspending them in phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation at 4500 ×g for 20 min. Recombinant fertilin αD or βD was then added to the beads (at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in a total volume of 15 μl), and the beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then incubated with rabbit IgG (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended to a concentration of a 0.2% bead suspension in Whitten's medium compatible buffer (109.5 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 7 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES; WHITCO). The 0.2% bead suspension was sonicated three times for 30 s immediately prior to use and then diluted to 0.02% in Whitten's medium containing 15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100 μm of the indicated BAP-presented peptide. This 0.02% bead suspension was used to make 20-μl culture drops, to which ZP-free eggs were added, following a 60-min incubation in medium containing the indicated BAP-presented peptide at 100 μm. The eggs were co-cultured with beads for 60 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The eggs were washed four times through 100-μl drops of Whitten's medium to remove unbound beads and were then mounted on a microscope slide in Whitten's medium and viewed on a Nikon Eclipse fluorescent microscope. The digital images were captured with a Princeton 5-mHz cooled interlined CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ) using IP Lab (Scananalytics, Fairfax, VA) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA) software. The bead binding levels were assessed qualitatively, estimated as compared with binding levels in control groups, by examining eggs from the entire experimental series (three experiments/series, with 10–20 eggs/group/experiment examined). The level of recombinant fertilin βD-coated bead binding to control eggs (see Fig. 7) appeared to be higher than the level of binding of recombinant fertilin αD-coated beads (see Fig. 6); this is in agreement with results using the quantitative luminometric assay. 2X.

The eggs were then cultured in a 20–30-μl drop of Whitten's medium containing a 0.02% suspension of fluorescent 0.2-μm beads coated with recombinant fertilin αD and 40 μm of the indicated BAP-presented peptide for 60 min. The eggs were then washed, and bead binding to eggs was then viewed on a fluorescent microscope. The egg treatments were as follows: no BAP-presented peptide (A and B), control BAP (C andD), BAP-a-3 (E and F), BAP-a-3s (G and H), and BAP-a-3m (I andJ).

In that study, we also tested a form of mouse fertilin α that corresponded to the originally reported N-terminal sequence of guinea pig fertilin α (11Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G.

Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) comprising a truncated disintegrin-like domain (the C-terminal most 20 amino acids), the cysteine-rich domain, and the EGF-like repeat (amino acids 474–708). This recombinant protein also perturbed sperm-egg binding, although not as effectively as the longer form encompassing amino acids 409–708 (10Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To follow up on this observation, we used a recently developed, improved assay for sperm-egg binding (21Redkar A.A. Olds-Clarke P.J. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 500-508PubMed Google Scholar) and generated three forms of recombinant fertilin α to examine more closely the role of the disintegrin-like domain in fertilin α-mediated sperm-egg adhesion. Our updated form of recombinant fertilin αDCE corresponded to amino acids 406–708, based on the corrected N-terminal sequence of guinea pig and the N-terminal sequence of bovine fertilin α (22Lum L. Blobel C.P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 23Waters S.I. White J.M. Biol.

Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Our updated form of recombinant fertilin αCE corresponded to the cysteine-rich domain and the EGF-like repeat of mouse fertilin α (amino acids 493–708) (Fig.1 C); please note that the form of αCE used in these experiments does not include any portion of the disintegrin-like domain and thus differs from the form we used in previous experiments (10Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Evans J.P. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which contained a truncated disintegrin-like domain based on the original N-terminal sequence data for guinea pig fertilin α (11Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Recombinant fertilin αD corresponded to the 88 amino acids (amino acids 406–493) of disintegrin-like domain of mouse fertilin α (Fig. 1 C). In IVF experiments using these proteins, we observed that sperm-egg binding was reduced in the presence of the three recombinant fertilin α forms (αDCE, αD, and αCE) as compared with sperm-egg binding in the presence of the control protein, MBP (Fig.2). (We have previously demonstrated that sperm-egg binding and fusion are not affected by the presence of MBP in the IVF culture medium (19Evans J.P. Kopf G.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).) In these studies, the levels of sperm-egg binding in the presence of recombinant fertilins αDCE, αD, and αCE were not statistically significantly different from each other. Because recombinant fertilin αD had an inhibitory effect on sperm-egg binding (Fig. 2), we became interested in the possibil"

In the current study, it is demonstrated that ET-1 treatment of GMC results in serine phosphorylation of the 66-kDa isoform of the adapter protein Shc (p66Shc). ET-1-induced serine phosphorylation of p66Shc requires activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling module and is efficiently inhibited by both a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-selective inhibitor and adenovirus-mediated transfer of a dominant interfering MEK1 mutant. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated transfer of a constitutively active MEK1 mutant was found to markedly increase p66Shc serine phosphorylation. Adenoviruses encoding constitutively active mutants of MAPK kinases 3 and 6 (upstream kinases of p38MAPK) and 7 (upstream kinase of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) failed to induce serine phosphorylation of this adaptor protein. Serine phosphorylation of p66Shc resulted in its association with the serine binding motif-containing protein 14-3-3. ET-1-induced phosphorylation of a serine encompassed in the 14-3-3 binding motif of p66Shcwas confirmed in experiments employing anti-phospho-14-3-3 binding motif antibodies. These studies are the first to demonstrate that G protein-coupled receptors stimulate serine phosphorylation of p66Shc and the first to report the formation of a signaling complex between p66Shc and 14-3-3.

ET-1 binds to specific G protein-coupled receptors and evokes a wide variety of cellular responses via activation of tyrosine and serine-threonine protein kinases. ET-1-derived intracellular signals are also transduced by channel and transport proteins, as well as by various phospholipases, all of which cooperate in amplifying the biological properties of this peptide (1Schramek H.

Phosphorylation of tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues in target molecules generates recognition motifs for a number of protein-protein interaction domains, thereby promoting the formation of multisubunit signaling complexes and constituting the basis of a complicated network of intracellular signaling pathways (4Lee C.-H. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Bar-Sagi D. Transmembrane Signaling Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 3-31Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues generates recognition motifs for structurally related Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine binding domains, whereas phosphorylation of serine residues produces recognition motifs for phosphoserine binding modules (5Mayer B.J. Gupta R. Pawson A.J. Protein Modules in Signal Transduction. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany1998: 1-22Google Scholar). Stable and finely regulated protein-protein interactions have been extensively investigated, and the fact that adaptor proteins and protein signaling modules play a central role in signal transduction has been widely established (5Mayer B.J.

Although all three Shc proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to many growth factors and all contain a recognition site for the SH2 domain of the adaptor protein Grb2, a number of studies have suggested distinct physiological roles for the three isoforms (8Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.-M.V. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 9Okada S.

Different intracellular localization patterns have been reported for each (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolci P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); moreover, it has been shown that p66Shc and p46Shc/p52Shc exert counter-regulatory effects on the c-fos promoter (8Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.-M.V. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In addition, p66Shcalone has been reported to act as a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated ERK pathway (9Okada S. Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Blaikie P. Margolis B. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28042-28049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Remarkably, p66Shc has been shown to regulate both the oxidative stress response and life span in mammals. Migliaccio et al. (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolci P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that p66Shc −/− mice exhibit enhanced cellular resistance to oxidative stress and a 30% increase in life span. Retrovirally mediated p46Shc/p52Shcoverexpression failed to compensate for p66Shc deficiency, whereas, as expected, overexpression of p66Shc restored normal cellular responses to oxidative stress (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolci P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the p66Shc-mediated response to oxidative stress was highly dependent on serine phosphorylation, as demonstrated by the observation that a non-serine-phosphorylated mutant form of p66Shc was unable to restore the normal stress response in p66Shc−/− cells (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolci P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Recently, p66Shc has been hypothesized to be involved in phenoptosis (programmed death of the organism), which results from the reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis of a vital organ (12Skulachev V.P. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 177-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated the crucial role of p52Shctyrosine phosphorylation in ET-1-mediated Ras activation in GMC (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of p52Shc enables and stabilizes the formation of a Shc-Grb2 complex, the subsequent association of which with the nonphosphorylated form of son-of-sevenless facilitates the biphasic GTP-loading of Ras (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Significantly, p66Shc does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ET-1 in GMC (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence that p66Shc plays an isoform-specific role in this signaling network. In the present study, evidence is presented that ET-1 induces MEK/ERK-dependent p66Shc serine phosphorylation and in this manner promotes the interaction of p66Shc with 14-3-3. The fundamental and unique role of the ERK pathway in effecting p66Shc serine phosphorylation was confirmed in studies employing MAPK-specific adenoviral MEK/MKK constructs. Evidence is also provided that ET-1-induced serine phosphorylation of p66Shcgenerates a serine recognition motif that may be responsible for the direct association of p66Shc with 14-3-3. Purified human ET-1 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). RPMI 1640 medium and routine tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 (also known as p42ERK/p44ERK) antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides (17Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Pouysseguer J. Dunn M.J. Biochem.

Schlessinger (New York Medical Center, New York, NY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-p66Shc and anti-PTP-PEST were kindly provided by Dr. P. Pelicci (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) and Dr. M. L. Tremblay (McGill Cancer Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), respectively. Polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, phospho-p38MAPK, and phospho-14-3-3 binding motif antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-14-3-3ε, which recognizes all 14-3-3 isoforms, and anti-caveolin antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed as described previously (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cell lysates standardized for protein content (bicinchoninic acid assay, Pierce) were either subjected to SDS-PAGE or used for further analysis. Samples were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with the appropriate polyclonal antibody followed by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times with lysis buffer and released from the Sepharose beads by addition of Laemmli buffer followed by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and probed with the appropriate antibody. Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Bio-Rad) followed by extensive washing of the membrane and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Pico, Pierce). ERK immunocomplex assays were carried out as described previously (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates containing 400 µg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 2 µl of p42ERKantibody for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of protein A-Sepharose and incubation for an additional 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate and then incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, containing 50 µm ATP, 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Quiescent GMC were infected for 24 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 60, with the recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing the constitutively active (Ad-MEKCA) and the catalytically inactive (Ad-MEKCI) forms of MEK1, respectively (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In experiments employing Ad-MKK7D and Ad-MKK3bE/Ad-MKK6bE (adenoviruses expressing the constitutively active forms of MKK7, MKK3, and MKK6, respectively) quiescent HMC were infected for 36 h at a MOI of 100 and 50/50, respectively (18McGinty A.

Control cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ) at a MOI of 100, as described previously. Following infection, cells were lysed, and the resultant cell lysates were analyzed by Western analysis. Quiescent GMC were washed twice in phosphate-free medium and incubated for 90 min in serum-free, phosphate-free medium prior to an additional 90-min incubation with 1.5 mCi/ml 32PO4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm) for 15 min and then washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis in 400 µl of lysis buffer containing 20 mmNaF and 1 µm mycrocystin. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies as described above, separated by means of SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. PVDF membranes were exposed to an Rx film (Fuji Medical System, Tokyo, Japan), and the radioactive bands corresponding to p66Shc were excised and hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The hydrolysate was dried and resuspended in 6 µl of water and spotted onto TLC plates. The samples were then electrophoresed, together with phosphoamino acid standards, in pH 3.5 buffer at 1000 V for 90 min, and the plate was exposed to Rx film. Quiescent GMC were washed twice with methionine-free culture medium and incubated for an additional 6 h in serum-free medium containing 100 µCi/ml [35S]methionine. Cells were stimulated with ET-1(100 nm) for 15 min, washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis in 400 µl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm NaF. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p66Shc antibody, separated by means of SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was exposed to Rx film. p66Shc, in common with the other Shc isoforms, possesses three tyrosine residues that undergo phosphorylation in response to extracellular stimuli. However, whether phosphorylation of p46Shc, p52Shc, or p66Shc occurs depends upon the cell type and the applied stimuli. For example, EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of all three Shc isoforms in many cell types. By contrast, angiotensin II and platelet-derived growth factor have been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p66Shc in vascular smooth muscle cells, with minimal phosphorylation of p52Shc and p46Shc (21Heeneman S. Haendeler J. Saito Y. Ishida M. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15926-15932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Conversely, insulin predominantly promotes p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in 3T3L1 adipocytes and in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the insulin receptor (22Kao A.W. Waters S.B. Okada S. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2474-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As we have shown previously, ET-1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of both p52Shc and p46Shc in GMC (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mobility shifts detected by SDS-PAGE generally indicate modification(s) in the shifted molecule, and in many cases reflect a change in phosphorylation status. In the present study, ET-1 stimulation of quiescent GMC was found to result in the delayed mobility of p66Shc on SDS-PAGE, most evident between 2 and 15 min (Fig.1). This was not due to tyrosine phosphorylation, because phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies failed to cross-react with p66Shc immunoprecipitated from ET-1-stimulated GMC lysates (not shown). It must be pointed out, however, that a negative result following immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies cannot completely exclude the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins, because recognition of phosphorylated tyrosines by specific antibodies may be dependent on the amino acid sequence in which these residues are encompassed. Previous papers have reported serine phosphorylation of p66Shc in response to hydrogen peroxide in mouse embryo fibroblasts (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolci P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar), in response to EGF in CHO cells expressing the human EGF receptor (9Okada S. Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P.

Besser D. Nagasawa M. Nagamine Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30599-30602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and in response to insulin stimulation in 3T3L1 adipocytes and CHO cells expressing the insulin receptor (22Kao A.W. Waters S.B. Okada S. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2474-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of p66Shc might result in opposing cell fates, because cytoprotective growth factor stimulation is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas environmental stresses elicit serine phosphorylation of this Shc isoform (10Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolci P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). In the present study, orthophosphate labeling clearly demonstrated that ET-1-induced phosphorylation of p66Shc, p54Shcand p46Shc (Fig.2 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of p66Shc immunoprecipitated from orthophosphate-labeled GMC revealed that ET-1 stimulation led to a 5-fold increase in labeled phosphoserine in comparison to unstimulated cells. Significantly, neither labeled phosphotyrosine nor phosphothreonine residues were detected (Fig. 2, B andC). Taken together, these data confirm that ET-1 induces serine phosphorylation of p66Shc; indeed, the current study is the first to present evidence of serine phosphorylation of this Shc isoform in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation. ET-1 is a potent mitogen for GMC and its mitogenic properties require activation of multiple protein kinases (1Schramek H. Dunn M.J. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.P. Endothelins in Biology and Medicine. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 81-100Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that ET-1-induced activation of the ERK cascade may be crucial for GMC proliferation in renal diseases (24Bokemeyer D. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). ET-1 has been reported to activate the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade by two principal mechanisms, via protein kinases C-dependent activation of Raf (25Clerk A. Pham F.H. Fuller S.J. Sahai E. Aktories K. Marais R. Marshall C. Sugden P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and in a p21ras-dependent manner (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The time course of ET-1-induced p66Shc mobility shift in GMC was found to correlate with the kinetics of ERK1/2 activation (Fig.1). ERK1/2 activation was assessed using three different methodologies, Western blotting of GMC lysates with anti-phospho-ERK-specific antibodies, assessing the delayed mobility shift of phosphorylated ERK on SDS-PAGE, and measuring the ability of immunoprecipitated ERK to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (see under “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 1). The results obtained with all three methods were fully concordant, showing an increase in ERK activity slightly preceding or simultaneous with the observed gel mobility shift of p66Shc. ERK1 and ERK2 are activated by dual specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK1 and MEK2 are themselves activated by phosphorylation on Ser218 and Ser222, with further activation sensitive to the α-helix encompassing residues 32–51 (26Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Herman A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vandewoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 27Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 467-481Google Scholar). Substitution of residues 218 and 222 with glutamic acid and aspartate, respectively, combined with the deletion of residues 32–51, generates a constitutively activated MEK1 mutant (26Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Herman A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vandewoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 27Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 467-481Google Scholar). Conversely, a catalytically inactive form of this kinase is achieved by substitution of the ATP binding site Lys97 with Met (26Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Herman A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vandewoude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive MEK1, by competing with endogenous MEK for Raf, suppresses MEK-dependent ERK activation. Similarly, the MEK-selective inhibitor PD 98059 facilitates the pharmacological blockade of the ERK cascade both in vitro and in vivo (27Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 467-481Google Scholar). In the current study, the complete ablation of both the p66Shc gel shift and ERK activation was observed when GMC were pretreated with PD 98059 prior to addition of ET-1 (Fig.3 A). Because PD 98059 has been reported to have other effects in addition to MEK inhibition, significantly the direct inhibition of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthases 1 and 2 activity (28Borsch-Haubold A.G. Pasquet S. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28766-28772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), adenovirus-mediated transfer of constitutively active and dominant interfering MEK1 mutants was also employed to address the putative involvement of MEK in p66Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A). In both cases, infection of GMC was carried out at MOI of 60, which resulted in 100% of transduced cells (as assessed by parallel infection of cells with Ad-LacZ, not shown) (13Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of the transduced MEK1 mutants to modulate ET-1-mediated ERK1/2 activation was confirmed both by Western blotting with phospho-specific anti-ERK antibodies and by detecting the delayed mobility shift of phosphorylated ERK on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A). Infection of GMC with Ad-MEKCIinhibited both ET-1-induced ERK activation and the p66Shcmobility shift. By contrast, Ad-MEKCA infection resulted in significant ERK activation and p66Shc mobility shift in quiescent GMC (Fig. 3 A). Taken together these data strongly support the involvement of MEK1, and by inference ERK, in ET-1-induced p66Shc serine phosphorylation. In addition to ERK, the two other principal mammalian MAPK pathways are the JNK and p38MAPK cascades (29Cobb M.H. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase FactsBook: Protein-Serine Kinases. Academic Press, New York1995: 214-216Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that ET-1 activates ERK and p38MAPK pathways in mesangial cells. It has also been shown that ET-1 activates JNK in mesangial cell with peak at 15 min (30Araki S. Haneda M. Tagawa M. Kikkawa R. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 631-639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), although we could not detect this activation by means of anti-phospho-specific JNK antibody. In analogy to the activation of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2, MKK3 and MKK6 are upstream activators of p38MAPK, whereas MKK7 is a positive regulator of JNK (31Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MKK3, MKK6, and MKK7, like MEK1/2, are dual specificity kinases, capable of phosphorylating both serine/threonine and tyrosines on p38MAPK and JNK, respectively. Having established the relevance of the MEK-ERK module in ET-1-induced p66Shc serine phosphorylation, we next endeavored to determine whether activation of the JNK and/or p38MAPKpathways contributed to p66Shc serine phosphorylation. To answer this question, a number of approaches were employed; stimulation of cells with anisomycin, a potent activator of both the p38MAPK and JNK signaling cascades; preincubation of cells with the selective p38MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (32Young P.R. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 483-500Google Scholar); and adenovirus-mediated transfer of constitutively active mutants of MKK3 (Ad-MKK3bE), MKK6 (Ad-MKK6bE), and MKK7 (Ad-MKK7D). As expected, stimulation of quiescent GMC with anisomycin resulted in JNK and p38MAPK activation, as determined by Western blotting with anti-phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Anisomycin was also effective in inducing the delayed mobility"

Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 643-691Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, only non-self-peptides,e.g. of viral origin, can activate CTL and thereby trigger an immune response. In contrast to the normal function of the immune system, CTLs can also be activated by self-antigens, which represent a pathological state resulting in severe autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune uveitis (2Singer D.S. Mozes E. Kirshner S. Kohn L.D. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar). The high association of several alleles with autoimmune diseases, e.g. HLA-B*2705 with spondyloarthropathy (3Khare S.D. Luthra H.S. David C.S. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998; 10: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Alvarez I. de Castro J.A.L. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2000; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), is not fully understood yet, but one of the most favored models postulates the allele-specific selection and presentation of autoantigenic peptides (5Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For several of these diseases, self-peptides triggering CTL are described (6Thurau S.R. Diedrichs-Mohring M. Fricke H. Burchardi C. Wildner G. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Paas-Rozner M. Dayan M. Paas Y. Changeux J.P. Wirguin I. Sela M. Mozes E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2168-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas in some cases like rheumatoid arthritis the relevant self-peptides are still unknown. MHC class I molecules are also involved in the acute rejection of allogenic transplants (8Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Lamas J.R. Lopez De Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6060-6064PubMed Google Scholar, 9Magee C.C. Sayegh M.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alloreactive T-cells are stimulated by allogenic MHC molecules and often recognize epitopes containing both the presenting molecule and specific peptides (9Magee C.C. Sayegh M.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Several antigens have been described to be involved in alloreactivity including MHC- and non-MHC-derived peptides. Current therapy for both autoimmune diseases and alloreactivity includes suppression of the entire immune system, e.g. by corticosteroids. However, the utilization of such immunosuppressive drugs is characterized by severe side effects. Consequently, much effort has been undertaken to establish alternative therapies that are based on the selective, antigen-specific modulation of the immune response. Several strategies have been developed including utilization of antibodies, soluble MHC complexes, and peptide vaccines (10Persidis A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Toda M. Totsuka M. Furukawa S. Yokota K. Yoshioka T. Ametani A. Kaminogawa S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 12Spack E.G. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 529-536PubMed Google Scholar). Among these strategies, peptide vaccines are of special interest as they have been reported to induce tolerance in mice and humans (6Thurau S.R. Diedrichs-Mohring M. Fricke H. Burchardi C. Wildner G. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Paas-Rozner M. Dayan M. Paas Y. Changeux J.P. Wirguin I. Sela M. Mozes E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2168-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and, in contrast to protein-based therapeutics, are accessible by solid-phase synthesis. However, the therapeutic application of peptides is hindered by the rapid clearance from the serum because of the degradation by proteases (13Ishioka G.Y. Adorini L. Guery J.-C. Gaeta F.C.A. LaFond R. Alexander J. Powell M.F. Sette A. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4311-4319Google Scholar). Therefore, it would be highly desirable to obtain peptidomimetics, which are enzymatically stable and bind with high affinity to MHC molecules. Furthermore, these compounds have to be recognized by the same pool of CTL as the parent peptide and induce the desired immunomodulatory effect. Many attempts have been undertaken to obtain peptidomimetics that fulfill these requirements, but only few successful results have been reported (14Falcioni F. Ito K. Vidovic D. Belunis C. Campbell R. Berthel S.J. Bolin D.R. Gillespie P.B. Huby N. Olson G.L. Sarabu R. Guenot J. Madison V. Hammer J. Sinigaglia F. Steinmetz M. Nagy Z.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The utilization of β-amino acids represents a systematic approach suited for the successive development of peptidomimetics (15D. Seebach Matthews J. L. (1997)Chem. Commun. 2015; Google Scholar). The side chains of β-amino acids are identical to the parent α-amino acids, which is of particular importance regarding the great influence of side chains on the complex stability (16Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The modification of the backbone by introduction of the methylene moiety results in complete resistance of peptides composed solely of β-amino acids against proteolytic cleavage (15D. Seebach Matthews J. L. (1997)Chem. Commun. 2015; Google Scholar). Successful use of β-homoalanine for the design of non-natural MHC ligands has been reported previously by our group (17Poenaru S. Lamas J.R. Folkers G. López de Castro J.A. Seebach D. Rognan D. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the introduction of the β-amino acid was limited to the middle part of the peptide, which is known to bulge out of the peptide binding groove (18Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and thus only weakly interacts with the host MHC molecule (19Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we report the systematic variation of the HLA-B*2705-restricted self-peptide by single replacement of all amino acids using the corresponding β-amino acid analogues. The presentation of the self-peptide chosen for modification (RRFFVYYV; one-letter code) was shown previously to be restricted by the HLA-B*2705 molecule and specifically recognized by the 27S69 αβ T-cell receptor of an alloreactive T-cell clone (20Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of substitutions on complex stability, ligand affinity, proteolitic degradation, and CTL recognition was evaluated using circular dichroism, fluorescence polarization, HPLC, and a chrome-release cytotoxicity assay. Peptides were obtained by automated solid-phase peptide synthesis on an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (Syro Multi-Syn-Tech, Bochum, Germany) using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protecting strategy. Protected β-amino acids were purchased from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland. For synthesis of fluorescein-labeled peptide GRAFVTIK*K (*, fluorescein) a lysine with a Dde-protected side chain was inserted at position 8. After synthesis and selective deprotection, Lys8 was coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Complete deprotection and cleavage from the resin was achieved by trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were analyzed and purified by mass spectrometry and HPLC as described previously (16Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HLA-B*2705 heavy chain (HC) and human β2-microglobulin (β2m) were cloned, expressed, and analyzed as described previously (16Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were expressed in an Escherichia coliBL21-Codonplus (DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene) as polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. Purification of the proteins was performed by nickel affinity chromatography. The N-terminal polyhistidine tag of β2m was cleaved by thrombin after purification. The thermal denaturation assay was performed as described earlier (16Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the HLA-B*2705-peptide complex was refolded by dialysis of 10 ml of reconstitution buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mm 2,2′-dithiodiethanol, pH 8.0) containing HLA-B*2705 HC (10 μm), β2m (20 μm), peptide (100 μm), and urea (6 m) against 1 liter of reconstitution buffer. After purification and concentration the complex was used immediately for denaturation experiments. The stability of the complex was examined by thermal denaturation, unfolding was monitored by CD spectroscopy at a wavelength of 218 nm. The temperature was raised from 20 to 85 °C by a rate of 40 °C/h. The concentration of the complex was held constant at 1 μm. The melting points were determined following a standard protocol for thermal denaturation experiments (21Pace N.C. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure : A Practical Approach. 2nd Edition. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, New York1997: 299-321Google Scholar). The melting points are averaged from at least two independent refolding experiments, and experimental error was estimated to be lower than 1 °C. The HLA-B*2705-peptide complex was refolded by dilution of HC (1 μm), β2m (2 μm), fluorescent peptide GRAFVTIGK*K (* = fluorescein) (8 nm), and various amounts of competitor (typically 1 nm-100 μm) into 1 ml of dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm CHAPS, 0.3 mm 2,2′-dithiodiethanol, pH 8.0). After 36 h of incubation at room temperature, complex formation was confirmed by a modified size-exclusion HPLC assay (22Ottenhoff T.H. Geluk A. Toebes M. Benckhuijsen W.E. van Meijgaarden K.E. Drijfhout J.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ratio between bound and unbound labeled ligand was determined by fluorescence polarization. Polarization values were measured on a Polarion fluorescence-polarization system (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria) using 200 μl of sample in a 96-well black quartz microtiter plate (Hellma, Müllheim, Germany). Number of flashes was set to 200, and total intensity was held at 65000 relative fluorescence units. IC50 values were obtained by fitting polarization values versus total concentration of competitor to a dose-response model. The IC50 values are averaged from three independent experiments. TAP (transporter in antigenprocessing)-deficient B*2705-T2 transfectant cells were incubated for 18–20 h at 26 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) in the absence of peptide. Cells were then labeled for 90 min at 37 °C with 50 μCi of 51Cr, washed four times, resuspended in the same medium with 1% fetal calf serum, seeded in 96-well plates, blocked previously with bovine serum albumin at 1 mg/ml in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with variable amounts of synthetic peptides. Effector CTL 27S69 cells (20Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar) were then incubated with peptide-sensitized targets for 5 h at 37 °C at an effector:target ratio of 1:1 in the continuous presence of peptide, and the supernatants were subjected to γ-counting. Percent-specific 51Cr release was calculated as follows: (experimental lysis − spontaneous lysis/maximum release − spontaneous lysis) × 100. Recognition of the natural CTL 27S69 epitope was quantified as the peptide concentration required to obtain half of the maximum lysis observed with this peptide in the concentration range used. Recognition of the β-amino acid analogs was measured as the peptide concentration required to obtain the half-maximal lysis of the octamer epitope (LC50). Peptide susceptibility to enzymatic cleavage was assessed using a previously reported protocol (23Ayyoub M. Monsarrat B. Mazarguil H. Gairin J.E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 12: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Human sera were obtained by centrifugation at 2000 × g/g of blood samples collected from two healthy donors. The sera were stored at −20 °C. Prior to use, the sera were incubated for 5 min at room temperature followed by 5 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of serum was added to 20 μl of peptide stock solution (1 mm) and incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 min by addition of 12 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. Precipitated serum proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. Degradation was monitored by HPLC at a wavelength of 218 nm using 50 μl of the supernatants per injection. Separation was performed on a LiChrospher RP-18 column (Merck) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The following solvent system was used: 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water with a gradient of 10 to 40% 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile for 30 min. The presence of the non-degraded peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of the corresponding HPLC peak (data not shown). To characterize the influence of amino acid substitution by corresponding β3-amino acids we mutated separately all positions of the HLA-B*2705-restricted octapeptide RRFFPYYV (Table I). The influence of β3-amino acids on the stability of HLA-B*2705-peptide complexes was evaluated by thermal denaturation experiments using CD spectroscopy to monitor complex unfolding. A typical denaturation curve resulting from unfolding of the B*2705-RRFFPYYV complex is shown in Fig.1 A. The midpoint of unfolding or melting points (Tm) observed for the different complexes are highly variable, which is reflected by differences between the Tm values of up to 12 °C (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the influence of the substitutions depends strongly upon the position of the mutated amino acid. A decreased stability is observed upon modification of the two N-terminal residues of the peptide. For the βRRFFPYYV βR1 peptide, the Tmvalue (39.7 °C) is 9 °C lower than that of the parent peptide. Mutation of the neighboring position 2 (P2) results in only minor destabilization; a Tm value of 46 °C was observed for RβRFFPYYV (βR2), which is a thermal destabilization of 2.5 °C when compared with the parent peptide (Tm = 48.5 °C). All other modifications from P3 to the C terminus result in altered peptides that stabilize the HLA-B27-peptide complex. An increase of stability of about 2 °C is observed for mutation of the amino acids Phe4 (50.2 °C), Pro5 (50.4 °C), and Val8 (50.8 °C). The highest Tm values were measured for the peptides RRβFFPYYV (51.5 °C) and RRFFPYβYV (51.8 °C), which reflects a stabilization of about 3 °C. No significant effect on complex stability is observed for substitution of Tyr6 by its β3-amino acid analogue, the observed Tm of 49.1 °C being comparable with the that of the parent epitope.Table IAmino acid sequence of modified peptidesPeptideSequenceTm, °C1-aMidpoint of unfolding of the B*2705 heavy chain, measured by CD spectroscopy at 218 nm.IC50,μm1-bμm concentration of altered peptide competitor inhibiting 50% of binding of a fluorescent-labeled peptide to recombinant HLA-B*2705.P11-cPn, positionn.P2P3P4P5P6P7P8Ref1-dReference peptide, proteasome component C5, 127–134 (20).ArgArgPhePheProTyrTyrVal48.53.2βR1β-HArg1-eβ3-Homoaminoacid NH-CH(R)-CH2-CO.ArgPhePheProTyrTyrVal39.745.1βR2Argβ-HArgPhePheProTyrTyrVal46.065.0βF3ArgArgβ-HPhePheProTyrTyrVal51.51.9βF4ArgArgPheβ-HPheProTyrTyrVal50.22.2βP5ArgArgPhePheβ-HProTyrTyrVal50.43.5βY6ArgArgPhePheProβ-HTyrTyrVal49.12.4βY7ArgArgPhePheProTyrβ-HTyrVal51.89.3βV8ArgArgPhePheProTyrTyrβ-HVal50.84.21-a Midpoint of unfolding of the B*2705 heavy chain, measured by CD spectroscopy at 218 nm.1-b μm concentration of altered peptide competitor inhibiting 50% of binding of a fluorescent-labeled peptide to recombinant HLA-B*2705.1-c Pn, positionn.1-d Reference peptide, proteasome component C5, 127–134 (20Paradela A.

Open table in a new tab The affinities of the modified peptides for recombinant HLA-B*2705 were evaluated by determination of IC50 values using an fluorescence-polarization-based competition assay. All peptides were able to compete for binding to HLA-B*2705 with the fluorescent peptide, which is reported to be a good binder. 2Unpublished data. The specificity of ligand binding was confirmed by several control experiments (data not shown) and is reflected by the different dose dependences of competition observed for the modified ligands. A typical curve resulting from titration with the βF3 peptide (Table I) is shown in Fig. 2 A. The final fluorescence-polarization value of about 55 millipolarization units corresponds to the value obtained for the free labeled ligand and mirrors complete competition by the non-labeled molecule. As seen in Fig. 2 B and Table I, the effect of the β3-amino acid scan is highly dependent upon the position of the substitution. A significant decrease in affinity is observed for mutations at the N-terminal part of the peptide. For the βR1 and βR2 peptides IC50 values of 45.1 and 65.0 μm have been determined, respectively, which represents a 15–20-fold decreased affinity when compared with the parent peptide. In contrast, the substitution of other positions in the peptide results in IC50 values in the μmrange that are comparable with that of the parent peptide (3.2 μm). The influence of β-amino acid substitutions at individual positions of the alloreactive peptide epitope RRFFPYYV on recognition by CTL 27S69 was analyzed by means of a peptide sensitization assay using the TAP-deficient B*2705-T2 transfectant cell line. All of the β-amino acid analogs were recognized by CTL 27S69 but less efficiently than the natural epitope (Fig. 3). Significant differences were observed in the effect of substitutions at different positions (Table II). The lowest effect, a decrease of about two orders of magnitude in LC50, was obtained with βR1, βP5, and βV8. The most drastic decrease, about four orders of magnitude, corresponded to βY6 and βY7, followed by βF4. Intermediate affects, LC50 about three orders of magnitude lower than the unmodified epitope, were observed with βR2 and βF3.Table IISpecific lysis of B*2705-T2 cells sensitized with the alloreactive peptide or modified analogsPeptideLC50 ± S.D.2-aMolar concentration of peptide required to get the half-maximal target cell lysis obtained with the reference peptide.Molar ratio2-bExcess of peptide analog required to get the same lysis of sensitized targets as the reference peptide.RRFFPYYV2.5 × 10−10βR13.0 ± 3.6 × 10−8120βR21.8 ± 1.0 × 10−7720βF31.9 ± 1.7 × 10−7760βF49.1 ± 0.1 × 10−73640βP53.5 ± 2.5 × 10−8140βY61.9 ± 2.0 × 10−67600βY72.3 ± 3.1 × 10−69200βV86.4 ± 3.5 × 10−82562-a Molar concentration of peptide required to get the half-maximal target cell lysis obtained with the reference peptide.2-b Excess of peptide analog required to get the same lysis of sensitized targets as the reference peptide. Open table in a new tab The effect of β-amino acid substitutions on CTL recognition did not correlate with stability (Tm) or affinity (IC50) of the corresponding B*2705-peptide complexes (TableI). For instance βY6, which was among the analogs recognized with lowest efficiency, had similar Tm and IC50values as the natural epitope. Conversely βR1, which showed the smallest effect on CTL recognition, had significantly lower stability and affinity than the natural epitope for B*2705. Furthermore, significantly decreased recognition of βF3 was observed despite increased stability of the B*2705-βF3 complex. These results indicate that substitutions of β-amino acids at individual positions of an allospecific peptide epitope decrease, but do not abrogate, CTL recognition. The effect is strongly dependent on the peptide position but is not a direct consequence of decreased affinity of the peptide analog for B*2705 or lower stability of the B*2705-peptide complex. The influence of the peptide modification on stability against proteolysis was evaluated by monitoring the successive degradation of the peptides by incubation with human blood serum. The degradation kinetics were followed by HPLC analysis using the corresponding peak area for peptide quantification. The unmodified reference peptide was rapidly degraded, less than 10% of the initial peak area being detected after 18 min. For the modified peptides, the time course of degradation showed to be highly dependent on the position of the substitution. No stabilization was observed for all modifications occurring between P3 and P8 positions of the parent peptide (Fig. 4). However, a significant resistance to proteolytic cleavage is observed for the peptides modified at the first two N-terminal residues (Fig. 4). For the βR2 peptide, about 74% of the initial peak area was recovered after 18 min. The substitution of the first amino acid showed to have the strongest influence on the degradation. For βR1, no significant decrease of the peptide area was observed after 18 min. In this study we investigated the influence of systematic modification of a HLA-B*2705-restricted octapeptide by single substitution of all amino acids with their corresponding β3-amino acid analogues. As the thermal stability of MHC class I-peptide complexes is reported to be a good descriptor of thein vivo immunogenicity of the antigenic complex (24van der Burg S.H. Visseren M.J. Brandt R.M. Kast W.M. Melief C.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3308-3314PubMed Google Scholar), all altered B27-peptide complexes were subjected to thermal denaturation experiments. The Tm values obtained showed to be highly dependent on the position of the mutation within the peptide. Upon modification of the central positions 4–6 a minor stabilization of about 1–2 °C is observed. These results are in agreement with the expected minor contributions of these residues to the total free energy of binding as the middle part of HLA-B*2705-bound peptides bulges out of the peptide binding groove (18Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and does not strongly interact with the host MHC molecule. This structural feature explains why replacing this peptide region by organic spacers (polyesters (25Krebs S. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), β-amino acids (17Poenaru S. Lamas J.R. Folkers G. López de Castro J.A. Seebach D. Rognan D. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2318-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), polyethylene (19Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Krebs S. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)) does not influence either ligand binding or thermodynamic stability of the resulting MHC-ligand complexes. The importance of the correct hydrogen bonding at the N terminus of the peptide (18Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) is reflected by the observed destabilization upon mutation of the first (−9 °C) and the second (−2.5 °C) N-terminal residue. The β-amino acid scan shifts important hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (first two peptide bonds, arginine side chain) in the C-terminal end direction. This effect is more deleterious for the βR1 peptide for which only the terminal ammonium and first side chain could be located in the binding groove, in an orientation similar to that of the reference peptide. All other atoms are translated toward the C-terminal residue in a region (pocket A, pocket B) of HLA-B*2705 very sensitive to small topological changes of the bound ligand. For the βR2 peptide, the destabilization noticed upon β-amino acid substitution is less pronounced as the important arginine side chain at P2, as well as the N-terminal P1 residue, share a bound orientation that should be analogous to that of the parent epitope. The increased stability observed upon substitution at P3 probably results from an improved accommodation of the aromatic side chains in the D pocket of the HLA-B*2705, a subsite known to favor bulky aromatic substituents (19Rognan D. Scapozza L. Folkers G. Daser A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,25Krebs S. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 4: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the substitution of the C-terminal residue induced the opposite effect resulting in an increased stability for RRFFPYβYV (+ 3.3 °C) and RRFFPYYβV (+ 2.3 °C). Some variation around the binding mode of the C-terminal residue has already been showed by x-ray diffraction of class I MHC molecules (18Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The last peptide amino acid can even be partly located outside the binding groove (26Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, alteration of the starting peptide at the C-terminal residues can be well accommodated and even enhance interactions with the binding groove. As the C-terminal residue controls for a large part to the overall thermodynamic stability of the MHC-peptide complex (16Dedier S. Reinelt S. Reitinger T. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27055-27061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β-amino acid substitution represents an interesting alternative for designing altered ligands. In addition to the thermal stability, the affinity of a ligand to its host MHC molecule represents a parameter of high importance for the development of non-natural class I MHC ligands. Thus, we evaluated the IC50 values of the modified peptides using a new fluorescence-polarization-based competition assay. The IC50value of the parent peptide (3.2 μm) is comparable with previously reported affinities for medium binders (27Reinelt S. Dedier S. Asuni G. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18472-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All modified peptides were able to compete for binding with a fluorescent peptide. Structure properties observed for the binding affinity were very similar to that reported previously for the thermal stability of the resulting MHC-peptide complexes. Alteration of the first two N-terminal residues increases IC50 values by a factor of 15–20 (see Fig. 2 and Table I) whereas modification of the peptide sequence from P3 to the C terminus did not alter the binding properties of the altered peptides to the target MHC protein (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, our data are in contradiction with a recent report (28Guichard G. Zerbib A. Le Gal F.A. Hoebeke J. Connan F. Choppin J. Briand J.P. Guillet J.G. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicating that P1, P2, PC-1, and PC residues (PC: C-terminal residue) of an HLA-A2 binding tumoral peptide are not permissive for β-amino acid substitution. The P1 modification was found to be less detrimental for binding than the P2 change, by opposition to measured thermal stabilities of the antigenic complexes. However, this contradiction can be explained by the differing set of protein-ligand interactions contributing to affinity and complex stability (27Reinelt S. Dedier S. Asuni G. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18472-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In our binding assay, competitors compete with the reference peptide for promoting the refolding of the HC-β2m-ligand heterotrimer. Thus, MHC-peptide interactions constitute only one aspect of the multistep refolding procedure in which both entropic and enthalpic contributions of the ligand play an important role. By contrast, thermal unfolding of already formed MHC-peptide complexes only takes into account the ligand release from the peptide binding groove. Our data illustrate a stronger contribution of residue P2 to complex refolding but a lower influence on complex stabilization compared with that of the N-terminal residue. Molecular modeling of the RRFFPYYV epitope in complex with B*2705 (20Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Arg2, Phe3, Tyr6, and Val8 are anchor residues, whereas Arg1, Phe4, Pro5, and Tyr7 are exposed at the surface of the complex. Ala scanning further indicated that Arg1 is not significantly involved in recognition by CTL 27S69, but Phe4, Pro5, and Tyr7 are critical for allorecognition (29Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Albar J.P. López de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5680-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There was no correlation between the effect of β-amino acid substitutions on CTL recognition and the involvement of the corresponding residue in anchoring to B*2705 or in TCR interactions. Thus, of the residues for which β-amino acid substitutions had the lowest effect on CTL recognition, Arg1 is not critical for alloreactivity (29Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Albar J.P. López de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5680-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but makes a significant contribution to affinity and stability of the B*2705-peptide complex (Table I), Pro5is exposed and critical for CTL recognition, and Val8 is an anchor residue (20Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar, 29Garcia-Peydro M. Paradela A. Albar J.P. López de Castro J.A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5680-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The highest effect on CTL recognition was obtained upon substitution of two exposed residues (Phe4, Tyr7) or a hidden one (Tyr6). The lack of correlation between the effect of β-amino acid substitutions on CTL recognition and the nature of the peptide positions, or their contribution to affinity or stability of the B*2705-peptide complex, suggests that the conformational changes induced in the peptide following introduction of β-amino acids have independent effects on peptide binding and T-cell recognition. The rapid clearance from blood serum, e.g. by enzymatic cleavage, is one of the major limitations for the pharmaceutical application of peptides. As peptides composed solely of β3-amino acids are completely stable against proteases (15D. Seebach Matthews J. L. (1997)Chem. Commun. 2015; Google Scholar), we investigated whether single β3-amino acids have an influence on the degradation upon incubation of the peptides with human blood serum. For the majority of the peptides a decrease similar to that of the parent peptide was observed. Typically, less than 20% of the initial amount was detected after 18 min of incubation. However, the βR2 peptide was significantly more resistant to degradation than the parent epitope. The strongest effect was induced for mutation of the N-terminal residue, which resulted in complete stability during the time of observation. This is particularly significant, because the βR1 substitution had the lowest effect on CTL allorecognition among those tested in this study. These data confirm the relevance of aminopeptidases for the cleavage of short peptides in blood serum (23Ayyoub M. Monsarrat B. Mazarguil H. Gairin J.E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 12: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, our results show that single substitution by β3-amino acids analogues can already induce a significant protective effect against enzymatic degradation. Our data reveal a strong influence of single β3-amino acids on parameters of high relevance for the immunogenic properties of the ligand. Furthermore, we could show that the introduction of β3-amino acids may be used as a general method to increase the resistance of short peptides against enzymatic degradation. Thus, the results of this study strongly suggest the utilization of β3-amino acids for the design of altered MHC ligands for therapeutic application.

We have investigated further the role of hydrophobic interactions in complex stabilization and ET between these proteins by replacing three hydrophobic residues, Leu-76, Leu-78, and Val-136, situated on the FNR surface in the vicinity of its FAD cofactor. Whereas neither the ability of FNR to accept electrons from NADPH nor its structure appears to be affected by the introduced mutations, different behaviors with Fd are observed. Thus, the ET interaction with Fd is almost completely lost upon introduction of negatively charged side chains. In contrast, only subtle changes are observed upon conservative replacement. Introduction of Ser residues produces relatively sizable alterations of the FAD redox potential, which can explain the modified behavior of these mutants. The introduction of bulky aromatic side chains appears to produce rearrangements of the side chains at the FNR/Fd interaction surface. Thus, subtle changes in the hydrophobic patch influence the rates of ET to and from Fd by altering the binding constants and the FAD redox potentials, indicating that these residues are especially important in the binding and orientation of Fd for efficient ET.

Important illustrations of this are the reactions that occur between proteins in the ET1 chains participating in photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and cytochrome P450 hydroxylations. In all of these cases, specific recognition and binding occur between the donor and the acceptor proteins. Although the structural parameters that determine such recognition are not fully understood, it is widely accepted that a transient complex between the two proteins must be formed and that the mutual orientation of the two proteins within the complex determines the rate of the ET reaction.

Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, only two charged residues on the FNR surface appear to have a crucial role in these processes. One is the Lys residue at position 75 of theAnabaena protein, which has been clearly established to require a positively charged side chain for complex formation with its physiological protein partners to produce ET (15Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Medina M. Hurley J.K. Hafezi R. Brodie T.B. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13604-13613Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The other crucial charged residue on FNR, Glu-301, is neither positively charged nor is it involved in complex formation but has been clearly shown to be a critical residue for ET to the FNR protein partners (14Medina M.

Similar results have been reported for charge-reversal mutations on the Fd surface. Thus, it has been shown that charge-reversal mutations of acidic residues such as Asp-62, Asp-67, Asp-68, Asp-69, or Glu-95 have either a moderate or no effect on complex stability and ET with the reductase (4Hurley J.K. Salamon Z. Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, a charge-reversal mutation of Glu-94 has large effects on the ET reactivity (4Hurley J.K. Salamon Z. Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G.

The crucial role of Glu-94 has been discussed in terms of the Fd x-ray structure. It has been shown that this residue forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Ser-47, which has also been shown to be a critical residue, suggesting an important role of these two residues in the stabilization of the molecular surface of the Fd. It is noteworthy that the critical function played by Glu-94 cannot be carried out by an adjacent residue in the sequence, which is also a Glu residue, Glu-95, indicating the importance of the geometry and the specific nature of the interaction between FNR and Fd. These mutagenesis results are supported by the previously mentioned crystallographic structure of theAnabaena FNR·Fd complex, where it has been shown that Fd Glu-94 is involved in a well defined hydrogen bond with Lys-75 of FNR and that no other charged residues in either of the proteins are directly involved in the interaction surface (26Morales R. Charon M.-H. Kachalova G. Serre L. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Frey M. EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that other types of interactions,e.g. hydrophobic interactions, might be stronger than electrostatic forces at protein-protein interfaces (30Ejdebäck M.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1426-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and might play a more active role in complex formation, as has been described for systems such as hormone-receptor or antigen-antibody complexes (34Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar,35DeLano W.L. Ultsch M.H. de Vos A.M. Wells J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In the FNR/Fd system, previous studies have indicated that an aromatic amino acid residue on the surface of Fd, Phe-65, was essential for the efficient ET reaction between Fd and FNR (5Hurley J.K. Cheng H. Xia B. Markley J.L. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11698-11701Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, thermodynamic and kinetic analyses of this system have suggested that hydrophobic interactions, which seem to originate from the dehydration of the protein-protein interface (3Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13321-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Hurley J.K. Fillat M.F. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5526-5531Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), play an important role. In the present study we further investigate the role of hydrophobic interactions in complex stabilization and ET between Fd and FNR, by analyzing the function of several hydrophobic residues that the three-dimensional structure of the protein shows are situated on the protein surface in the vicinity of the FAD isoalloxazine ring (Fig.1 A). These amino acids, Leu-76, Leu-78, and Val-136 of Anabaena FNR, are fully conserved in all photosynthetic FNRs from different species (Fig.1 B). In this study we have replaced these residues by a series of amino acids in order to establish their involvement and to assess the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the processes of complex formation and ET in the FNR/Fd system. Our results clearly indicate that these residues are important for efficient ET and provide additional evidence that the crystallographic structure reported for the Anabaena FNR·Fd complex (26Morales R. Charon M.-H. Kachalova G. Serre L. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Frey M. EMBO Reports. 2000; 1: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) represents a viable model for a productive ET complex.DISCUSSIONThe three-dimensional structure of FNR shows that the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD redox center binds at the bottom of a concave cavity to which, as indicated by all available biochemical and structural data, Fd binds during catalysis (17Martı́nez-Júlvez M.

Since Fd is a one-electron carrier protein and two electrons are required by the reductase to reduce NADP+, it is necessary that association and subsequent dissociation of the two proteins occur at rates that are compatible with the catalytic turnover. It is in these processes of association and dissociation that electrostatic interactions have been proposed to play an important role (6Hurley J.K. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Hurley J.K. Hazzard J.T. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Medina M. Gomez-Moreno C. Tollin G.

Chem. 1999; 4: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in the FNR/Fd system hydrophobic interactions might also being involved in such processes, as well as in the ET mechanism itself, as suggested by the important role reported for Phe-65 in Anabaena Fd (7Hurley J.K. Fillat M.F. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5526-5531Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar,9Hurley J.K. Weber-Main A.N. Stankovich M.T. Benning M.M. Thoden J.B. Vanhooke J.L.

In the present study three hydrophobic amino acid residues, Leu-76, Leu-78, and Val-136 (Fig. 1 A), situated within the proposed Fd interaction site of theAnabaena FNR surface and in close proximity to the flavin ring have been replaced by a series of other residues. These three residues are fully conserved in all cyanobacterial and leaf FNR species and are replaced by Val and Ser, respectively, in those proteins from roots (Fig. 1 B). Noticeably, although the region containing these residues possesses considerable structural and sequence homology to other enzymes of the FNR family, residues equivalent to Leu-76, Leu-78, and Val-136 of Anabaena FNR are not conserved within this family, nor are their substitutions of a conservative nature (Fig.1 B).No significant differences were observed in the spectroscopic properties for any of the FNR mutants prepared in this study, indicating that no gross protein structural rearrangements were introduced by any of the mutations. This has been confirmed for the L78D, L76D/L78D, and V136L mutants by x-ray crystallography. The analysis of the steady-state kinetic parameters measured by the diaphorase activity indicates that, among the mutations studied here, only the introduction of a negatively charged residue at positions 76 and/or 78 or an Ala at position 136 produces enzymes that are considerably less efficient than the WT in this reaction (Table II). In contrast, measurements of the direct reduction of these mutants by NADPH using stopped-flow methodologies indicate that none of them is impaired in the processes of charge transfer complex formation or hydride transfer (Table V). Therefore, the behavior observed in the diaphorase assay for these mutants might be due to an effect on the interaction of the DCPIP with the FAD due to the introduction of a bulky residue in the vicinity of the cofactor. We conclude from these data that Leu-76, Leu-78, and Val-136 of Anabaena FNR are not critical residues for complex formation and ET between NADPH and FNR. This was expected since the region where NADP(H) binds to FNR is different from the area where the mutations were introduced (24Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C.

Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In contrast to this, our results clearly indicate that the introduction of a negatively charged residue at positions 76 and/or 78 ofAnabaena FNR impairs the ET transfer processes that take place to and from Fd (Figs. 3 and 7). Binding constants between the oxidized forms of these mutants and Fdox could not be measured, presumably because complex formation was too weak (TableIII). Furthermore, in the steady-state kinetic assay,K m values with Fd were immeasurably large for L76D and L78D, and no reaction could be detected for L76D/L78D (Table II). Moreover, although the dissociation constant obtained for the L78DFNRox·Fdrd intermediate complex by flash photolysis differs only by a factor of 2 from that of the WT enzyme (Table IV), values could not be determined for intermediate complexes involving L76D and L76D/L78D (Table IV). Differences observed in the extension of the changes observed in K m andK d, for example for the L78D FNR mutant, can be easily explained by taking into account the fact thatK m includes not only the dissociation of the FNRox·Fdrd complex but also the dissociation constants for other species included in the cytochrome cassay, such as the FNRsq·Fdox complex (where sq is semiquinone) and the corresponding ternary complexes with NADP+/H. The ionic strength behavior observed for the ET from Fd to these FNR mutants suggests that the electrostatic interactions have been weakened, which results in ET-favorable interprotein orientations occurring only at lower ionic strengths (Fig. 3 B). This is also indicated by the amplitudes of the fast kinetic reactions measured by stopped-flow (Fig. 7), since the reactions between the protein partners seem to occur to the same extent as with the WT enzyme, indicating that it is not the ET transfer process per se that is affected by the mutation, but the stabilization of the complex (Tables Table II, Table III, Table IV, Table V). Again, differences in magnitudes of the changes when comparing steady state, laser flash photolysis, and stopped-flow kinetic data were also sometimes difficult to compare due to the different species produced by the special characteristics of each technique (including different protein ratios and even other compounds in the reaction mixture that are also involved in ET processes); however, an identical general tendency produced in FNR by each introduced mutation was observed. It has been shown that Arg-16, Lys-72, and Lys-75 provide a positively charged region on the FNR surface that is particularly important in the binding and orientation of Fd during ET (10Hurley J.K. Hazzard J.T. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Medina M. Gomez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1614-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Placement of a negative charge at positions 76 or 78, and especially at both positions simultaneously, produces a change of polarity in the FAD environment that must have a marked destabilizing effect on the complex (Fig.8 A). Finally, the double mutant L76D/L78D, whose activity is almost completely inhibited, has a midpoint redox potential that is quite similar to that of the WT protein (Table VI), and among these mutants only L78D has a redox potential that is significantly more positive than that of WT FNR (−302 mV versus −325 mV for WT). These latter results demonstrate that the effect of the mutation on the observed rates for electron exchange between the proteins is not due to an effect on the free energy of the reaction, since this parameter is determined by the difference between the midpoint redox potentials of the two proteins involved in the reaction. Thus, the drastic effect observed on the rates of reaction for these mutants is likely a consequence of a decrease in the ability of the reductase to recognize its ET protein partner due to the introduction of negative charges at these positions and, consequently, a decreased ability to form a complex that is catalytically efficient. Similar results have also been reported for other ET protein systems, such as azurin/cytochrome c 551 and azurin/nitrite reductase, where the introduction of positively charged residues in the hydrophobic patch of azurin, which is believed to be involved in the protein-protein interaction, has been shown to impair the ET reaction (32van der Kamp M.

Canters G.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The L76A, L76V, L78A, L78V, V136A, and V136L FNR forms represent the most conservative substitutions of the corresponding WT side chains. Thus, the hydrophobic and non-polar character of the Leu-76, Leu-78, and Val-136 side chains are maintained, with the main difference between them being the side chain volume that extends from the protein surface. Our data indicate that all of these mutant enzymes were able to form complexes and to transfer electrons efficiently to and from Fd, as shown by the catalytic and dissociation constants obtained either by steady-state (Tables II and III) or fast kinetic (Tables IV and V) methods. However, the data also demonstrate that the reactions are slightly modified by the introduced mutations as indicated by their interaction and kinetic parameters with Fd, which for most of these mutants are within a factor of 2 or 3 of the values determined for the WT enzyme. The most extreme case is that of the L76V FNR mutant which has rate constants, obtained either by laser flash photolysis or stopped-flow methods (Tables IV and V), that are consistently smaller than those for the WT FNR. Moreover, this mutant reaches its maximalk obs value for reduction by Fd at an ionic strength value that is significantly lower than the WT enzyme (Fig.6 B). These data support the idea that FNR establishes specific hydrophobic interactions with Fd and suggests a precise hydrophobic surface complementarity at the protein-protein interface of the ET complex.Replacement of Leu-76, Leu-78, or Val-136 by Ser, a side chain capable of forming hydrogen bond interactions, also produces some interesting effects on the ET properties of FNR. Thus, although the introduced residues apparently do not significantly affect FNR·Fd complex formation as judged by"

However, the underlying mechanism has remained largely unknown. Here we show that the TNF-sensitizing effect of lithium chloride (LiCl) is independent of the type of cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis. In the case of apoptosis, TNF/lithium synergism is associated with an enhanced activation of caspases and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Sensitization to apoptosis is specific for TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas Fas-mediated or etoposide-induced apoptosis remains unaffected. LiCl also potentiates cell death induced by artificial oligomerization of a fusion protein between FKBP and the TNF receptor-associated death domain protein. TNF-induced activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression is not modulated by LiCl treatment. These results indicate that LiCl enhances TNF-induced cell death in an NF-κB-independent way, and suggest that the TNF receptor-associated death domain protein plays a crucial role in the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl.

Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The first interest in TNF arose from its potential antitumor properties because of a specific cytotoxic effect of TNF on several transformed cell lines (2Carswell E.A. Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3751) Google Scholar). Also in vivo, TNF showed considerable antitumor activity in a number of murine tumor models (3Chcialowski A. Targowski T. Bajera I. Jahnz-Rozyk K. Pol. Merkuriusz Lek. 1997; 2: 392-395PubMed Google Scholar). The antitumor effect of TNF is mediated by direct cytotoxic effects on the tumor cells as well as by several effects on the host cells. Because TNF receptors (TNF-R) are ubiquitously expressed, it is not surprising that almost all cell types respond to TNF. Many cell types respond to TNF by the expression of specific proteins, including other cytokines, adhesion proteins, and enzymes induced in the production of proinflammatory mediators (1Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These proinflammatory effects of TNF lead to several toxic side effectsin vivo after injection of high TNF doses (4Kettelhut I.C. Fiers W. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The latter, as well as the rather low sensitivity of several tumor cells to the direct cytotoxic effect of TNF, have limited the use of TNF as an antitumor agent. However, combination treatments that allow the use of lower nontoxic TNF doses might still offer opportunities for TNF in the treatment of cancer. Combination treatments have already proven their success in the clinic, as demonstrated by isolated limb perfusion of melanoma and carcinoma patients (5Balkwill F.R. Lee A. Aldam G. Moodie E. Thomas J.A. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 3990-3993PubMed Google Scholar, 6Liénard D. Ewalenko P. Delmotte J.J. Renard N. Lejeune F.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 1992; 10: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, a systemic treatment is still hampered by toxic side effects. Unexpectedly, lithium chloride was found previously to considerably increase the direct cytotoxic activity of TNF on tumor cells in vitro and in animal studies, without significant side effects (7Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Suffys P. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9494-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The potential use of lithium as a sensitizing agent for the antitumoral activities of TNF is interesting in view of the well known use of lithium in the treatment of manic depression (8Tondo L. Baldessarini R.J. J. Clin. Psychiatry. 2000; 61: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar). So far, the underlying mechanism for TNF/lithium synergism is still unclear. TNF-treated cancer cells die from either necrosis or apoptosis (9Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Necrosis is often referred to as accidental cell death and is induced when the plasma membrane is damaged in such a way that cells swell and finally burst, releasing their cellular content. In contrast to necrosis, apoptosis is the commonest physiological form of cell death that also occurs during embryonic development, tissue remodeling, and immune regulation. Cells undergoing apoptosis show a sequence of cardinal morphological features including membrane blebbing, cellular shrinkage, and condensation of chromatin. It is also a clean way of dying, in which cells fall apart in so-called apoptotic bodies, which are removed by phagocytosis. So far, the reason why some cells die by necrosis whereas others die by apoptosis is still unknown. Recently, a new family of cysteine proteases (caspases) has been shown to play a crucial role in apoptosis. All caspases, currently 14 in number, share the unusual property of being cysteine proteases with specificity for cleaving substrates on the carboxyl side of aspartic acid residues (10Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6151) Google Scholar, 11Van de Craen M. Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Van Loo G. Molemans F. Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as proenzymes with a tripartite structure consisting of an N-terminal prodomain that is variable in length, a large subunit with an approximate size of 20 kDa (p20), and a second smaller subunit of about 10 kDa (p10); the mature caspase is a (p20p10)2 heterotetramer. Processing of caspases to a mature product occurs following different apoptotic stimuli (12Erhardt P. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17601-17604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and requires cleavage at specific aspartic acid residues located between the different subdomains. The question of how an apoptotic stimulus is linked to the activation of caspases has been partially answered by the isolation of caspase-8 (13Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

This protein associates through its prodomain with the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), which is a component of the p55 TNF-R (TNF-RI) and the Fas receptor complex.

Binding of the trimeric TNF ligand to the extracellular domain of TNF-RI induces oligomerization of the receptor death domains (DD). This leads to recruitment of the adapter protein TNF-R-associated DD (TRADD), which acts as a scaffold for the assembly of a signaling complex containing different proteins that mediate several TNF activities. The DD of TRADD associates with that of FADD, which mediates apoptosis by activating caspase-8 and a downstream caspase cascade (14Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A.

Apoptosis initiated by Fas triggering follows a similar pathway, but in this case FADD is directly recruited to the Fas receptor without involvement of TRADD. Caspases also initiate a mitochondrial pathway leading to release of several mediators that further amplify the caspase cascade by acting as direct activators of specific caspases (16Srinivasula S.M.

In addition to the proapoptotic TRADD/FADD/caspase-8 pathway initiated by TNF, TNF-R triggering also initiates an antiapoptotic pathway believed to be mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB. The expression of several proinflammatory and antiapoptotic proteins is known to be NF-κB-dependent (19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar, 20Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression has recently been shown to sensitize cancer cells to TNF-induced apoptosis (21Muenchen H.J. Lin D.L. Walsh M.A. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1969-1977PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyze the level at which lithium ions interfere with the TNF-signaling pathway leading to cell death. We demonstrate that lithium sensitizes cancer cells to TNF-induced cell death in an NF-κB-independent way. Furthermore, we present evidence for a role of TRADD as a potential target for LiCl. The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Kym37E4 was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The murine fibrosarcoma cell line L929sA; its subclone L929luc, generated by stable transfection with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene (22Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E.

Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The protease inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA); they were dissolved as stock solutions of 100 mm in Me2SO and stored at −70 °C until use. Acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone was obtained from Calbiochem. The caspase-3 substrate acetyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-aminomethylcoumarin was obtained from the Peptide Institute. Recombinant human and murine TNF were expressed in Escherichia coli in our laboratory and were purified to at least 99% homogeneity; the specific activity (8.8 × 106 IU/mg for human TNF and 1.4 × 108IU/mg for murine TNF) was determined with the International Standard Code 88/532 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, United Kingdom). Anti-human Fas antibodies (agonistic antibodies; clone CH-11) were purchased from Immunotech (Alston, MA). Staurosporine, valproic acid, insulin, and etoposide were supplied by Sigma. Indirubin-3′-monoxime and Ro31–8220 were obtained from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland). Anti-caspase-3 and anti-caspase-8 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-cytochrome c antibody (clone 7H8.2C12) was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-β-catenin was purchased from Sigma. Secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. L929rTA cells (24Vanhoenacker P. Gommeren W. Luyten W.H.M.L. Leysen J.E. Haegeman G. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 3: 301-310Google Scholar, 25Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar) were stably cotransfected with the plasmid pPHT coding for hygromycin resistance and pUHD10–3/FKBP2-TRADD, encoding an N-terminal fusion protein of murine TRADD with two copies of FKBP. Stably transfected cells were selected for 3 weeks in medium containing 250 units/ml hygromycin. Individual colonies were analyzed for FKBP2-TRADD expression by Western blotting. All hygromycin-resistant cell clones showed considerable expression of FKBP2-TRADD, even in the absence of doxycyclin. Stimulation with the latter agent did not lead to higher expression levels. For this reason, FKBP2-TRADD-expressing cells were used for cytotoxicity assays without prior doxycyclin treatment. To construct pUHD10–3/FKBP2-TRADD, we first cloned murine TRADD as a blunted NdeI/SalI fragment into anSpeI/SalI-opened and blunted pCMF2E vector (26Spencer D.M. Belshaw P.J. Chen L. Ho S.N. Randazzo F. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), provided by ARIAD (Cambridge, MA); this generated an N-terminal fusion protein of TRADD with two FKBPs. The intermediate construct was used to clone the FKBP2-TRADD fragment as anEcoRI/SalI fragment into anEcoRI/SalI-opened pUHD10–3 vector and was stably transfected in L929rTA cells. To detect cytosolic cytochrome c, caspase-3, and caspase-8, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), containing 0.001% digitonin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 100 µg of cytosolic protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To measure β-catenin accumulation, 106 cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 12 h and subsequently treated with GSK-3 inhibitors for 6 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS, and whole-cell extracts were prepared by adding 1× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Lysates were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to Hybond nitrocellullose membranes, blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20; they were probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-human caspase-3 or -8, or anti-β-catenin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were developed with a chemiluminescence method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorometric Assay for Caspase-3-like Activity—Cellular extracts were prepared as described under “Isolation of Cell Extracts and Western Blotting.” 25 µg of protein was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 50 µm of acetyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-aminomethylcoumarin in a total volume of 150 µl of reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The release of aminomethylcoumarin was determined by spectrofluorometry (CytoFluor; PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). Data are expressed as increase in fluorescence as a function of time (ΔF/min). L929luc cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter gene under control of the minimal chicken conalbumin promoter, preceded by three NF-κB-binding sites (22Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Boone E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), were seeded on day −1 in a 96-well plate at 2 × 104/microwell. The next day, cells were either untreated or pretreated with 10 mm LiCl for 1 h and subsequently stimulated with TNF. After 3 h of incubation, cells were lysed in 200 µl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmcyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). The luciferase activity was determined as described previously (27De Valck D. Heyninck K. Van Criekinge W. Vandenabeele P. Fiers W. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity Assays—Cells were seeded on day −1 at 2 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. The next day, cells were stimulated with a serial dilution of TNF, anti-Fas, or etoposide in the absence or presence of LiCl or GSK-3 inhibitors. Transcription- or translation-independent cell death was analyzed in the presence of 1 µg/ml actinomycin D or 10 µg/ml cycloheximide, respectively. Typically, cells were incubated for 18 h, and cell viability was assessed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide as previously described (28Beyaert R. Schulze-Osthoff K. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Tada H. Shiho O. Kuroshima K. Koyama M. Tsukamoto K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Cell death of L929 cells stably expressing FKBP2-TRADD was induced by stimulating the cells with 62.5 nm of the dimerizing agent AP1510 (ARIAD) for 24 h. The percentage of cell survival was calculated using the equation 100% × (1 − (A 595/655-treated cells −A 595/655medium)/(A 595/655-untreated cells −A 595/655 medium)). To investigate whether the TNF/LiCl synergism depends on the type of cell death, we analyzed the effect of LiCl on TNF-induced killing of L929 and KYM37E4 cells. L929 cells were previously shown to die by necrosis (23Vercammen D. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas KYM37E4 die in an apoptotic way in response to TNF. Moreover, necrosis of L929 cells is caspase-independent, whereas apoptosis of KYM37E4 cells strictly depends on caspase activity (30Denecker, G., Vercammen, D., Steemans, M., Vanden Berghe, T., Brouckaert, G., Van Loo, G., Zhivotovsky, B., Fiers, W., Grooten, J., Declercq, W., and Vandenabeele, P. (2001) Cell Death Differ., 8, in press.Google Scholar). Co-treatment with LiCl was found to drastically increase the cytotoxic effect of TNF in both cell lines, irrespective of the type of cell death (Fig.1). The addition of similar concentrations of NaCl had no effect on TNF sensitivity (data not shown). LiCl has a sensitizing effect on TNF-induced necrosis, known to be caspase-independent. We investigated whether LiCl affects TNF-induced apoptosis of KYM37E4 cells by increasing the TNF-induced caspase pathway or by a novel caspase-independent pathway that would also contribute to TNF-induced apoptosis. Therefore, we pretreated Kym37E4 cells with several synthetic peptide caspase inhibitors and analyzed their effect on TNF-induced apoptosis in the absence or presence of 10 mmLiCl. Both TNF-induced cell death and the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl were completely inhibited by the broad range caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone and the caspase-3 family inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone, whereas the caspase-1 family inhibitor acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone was only partially protective (Fig. 2). This suggests that lithium interferes with the TNF-induced activation of a caspase-dependent signaling pathway in KYM37E4 cells, leading to increased apoptosis. This was further demonstrated by the observation that LiCl also increased the TNF-induced activation of caspase-3-like activity in KYM37E4 cell extracts (Fig.3). This was associated with an increased proteolytic processing of caspase-3, as demonstrated by the faster disappearance of procaspase-3 in TNF/LiCl-treated cellsversus cells treated with TNF alone (Fig.4).Figure 3LiCl increases TNF-induced caspase-3-like activity. KYM37E4 cells were either untreated or treated for 1 h with 10 mm LiCl before stimulation with 100 IU/ml TNF for increasing time points. At the indicated time points, caspase-3-like activity in cell extracts (25 µg cellular protein) was measured with acetyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-aminomethylcoumarin.

At the indicated time points, cytosolic extracts were prepared; expression was determined by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mitochondria are believed to contribute to TNF-induced caspase activation and apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c, which is directly involved in the activation of caspase-9, a direct activator of caspase-3 (31Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6218) Google Scholar). To analyze whether LiCl-induced sensitization of caspase-3 activation in response to TNF was associated with an enhanced release of cytochrome c in TNF + LiCl-treated cells, we analyzed cytosolic cytochrome c levels by Western blotting. This showed that LiCl also enhanced the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in response to TNF (Fig. 4), indicating that LiCl acts early in the proapoptotic signaling pathway. It is generally accepted that caspase-8 is at the apex of the TNF-induced signaling pathway leading to cytochrome c release (32Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16589-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Again, LiCl considerably accelerated the processing of procaspase-8 in response to TNF, further suggesting an effect of LiCl on the TNF-R-signaling complex (Fig. 4). In order to analyze whether the sensitizing effect of LiCl is specific for TNF, we compared the effect of LiCl on apoptosis induced by TNF and Fas agonistic antibodies. To avoid a potential contribution of cell type-specific effects, we analyzed the effect of TNF and Fas in L929.hFas cells. Treatment with TNF leads to typical necrosis, whereas treatment of the same cells with agonistic Fas antibodies results in typical apoptosis (23Vercammen D. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas LiCl was able to induce a 100-fold sensitization to TNF cytotoxicity in L929 cells, Fas-mediated killing of the same cell line was not modulated by LiCl (Fig. 5, Aand B). Similarly, when Kym37E4 cells were stimulated with TNF, etoposide, or staurosporine (data not shown), only TNF-induced apoptosis was enhanced by LiCl treatment (Fig. 5, C–E). These results demonstrate that the sensitizing effect of LiCl is specific for TNF. Fas-mediated signaling to cell death is largely overlapping TNF signaling. Fas directly binds to FADD, whereas TNF-RI initiates FADD clustering via the adapter protein TRADD. The specific effect of LiCl on TNF-induced cell death suggests that LiCl interferes with a step upstream of FADD. To distinguish between TRADD or TNF-RI as targets for LiCl, we generated an L929 cell line that stably expresses TRADD fused to two tandem repeated FKBP dimerization domains. This fusion protein can be oligomerized by the cell-permeable artificial ligand AP1510 (34Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), resulting in TNF-RI-independent cell death. These data suggest that self-association of TRADD is necessary and sufficient to induce cell death. Moreover, LiCl was still able to enhance cell death induced by the oligomerizer (Fig. 6). These data strongly suggest that the potentiating effect of LiCl on TNF cytotoxicity is situated downstream of TNF-RI, most likely at the level of TRADD. NF-κB becomes activated in several cell lines after stimulation with TNF and is responsible for the transcription of many proinflammatory genes. More recently, an antiapoptotic function for NF-κB has been reported (35Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathway leading to NF-κB activation in response to TNF has been largely elucidated (36Magnusson C. Vaux D.L. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TRADD seems to act as a point of bifurcation, from which both proapoptotic and NF-κB activation pathways start. Interaction of TRADD with FADD initiates a signaling pathway leading to apoptosis (37Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 38Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), whereas the interaction of TRADD with receptor-interacting protein and TNF-R-associated factor-2 is crucial for NF-κB activation (37Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 39Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). To analyze whether LiCl potentiates TNF-induced cell death by preventing TNF-induced NF-κB activation and expression of antiapoptotic genes, we studied the effect of LiCl on the TNF-induced expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in L929 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, there was no effect of LiCl on NF-κB-dependent gene expression, indicating that LiCl sensitizes cells to TNF-induced cell death in an NF-κB-independent way. Moreover, the sensitizing effect of LiCl could still be observed in the presence of inhibitors of transcription or translation, such as actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively (Fig. 8). As previously demonstrated (40Ruff M.R. Gifford G.E. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 380-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transcriptional or translational inhibition by these inhibitors is associated with a strong TNF-sensitizing effect. These results show that the effect of LiCl on TNF cytotoxicity is independent of de novo transcription or protein synthesis, making the involvement of an LiCl-induced change in expression of proapoptotic or antiapoptotic proteins unlikely. Recently, an increased cytotoxic effect of TNF was shown in GSK-3β-deficient cells (41Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), suggesting a protective function for GSK-3β against TNF-induced cell death. In addition, GSK-3 was demonstrated to be essential for NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to TNF. Because LiCl is known to directly inhibit GSK-3 activity (42Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one could imagine a potential role for GSK-3 in the LiCl-induced sensitization against TNF. However, our observation that LiCl has no effect on TNF-induced NF-κB activation suggests that GSK-3 is not involved in the lithium-induced TNF sensitization of the cells studied. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that GSK-3 could still play a role in the LiCl-induced TNF sensitization through an effect independent of NF-κB. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of the GSK-3 inhibitors Ro31–8220 (43Hers I. Tavare J.M. Denton R.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), valproic acid (44Chen G. Huang L.D. Jiang Y.M. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and indirubin-3′-monoxine (45Leclerc S. Garnier M. Hoessel R. Marko D. Bibb J.A. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Mandelkow E.M. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) on TNF-induced cell death. However, none of these inhibitors was able to mimic the effect of LiCl on TNF cytotoxicity (partially shown in Fig.9 A). GSK-3 inhibition was confirmed by analyzing the effect of the drugs on the accumulation of β-catenin (partially shown in Fig. 9 B), which has previously been shown to be negatively regulated by GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation (46Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The above findings make it rather unlikely that inhibition of GSK-3 is involved in the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl in the cells studied.Figure 8LiCl enhances TNF cytotoxicity in the presence of transcriptional or translational inhibitors.

Vanhaesebroeck B. Suffys P. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9494-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism has remained largely unknown. In this report, we present evidence that LiCl potentiates TNF cytotoxicity by acting at an early step in the TNF-signaling pathway. First, we demonstrate that the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl is independent of the type of cell death, more particularly necrosis in the case of L929 fibrosarcoma cells and apoptosis in the case of KYM rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Although it is still unclear which signals determine whether a cell will die by necrosis or apoptosis in response to TNF, recent experiments in our laboratory showed that TNF-induced necrosis is not associated with caspase activation, whereas apoptosis is strictly dependent on caspases (30Denecker, G., Vercammen, D., Steemans, M., Vanden Berghe, T., Brouckaert, G., Van Loo, G., Zhivotovsky, B., Fiers, W., Grooten, J., Declercq, W., and Vandenabeele, P. (2001) Cell Death Differ., 8, in press.Google Scholar). The fact that LiCl potentiates both types of cell death indicates that LiCl acts upstream of the point of bifurcation of signaling pathways leading to necrosis or apoptosis. Second, potentiation of TNF-induced apoptosis by LiCl was associated with an increased processing of procaspase-8 and an early release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Caspase-8 is known as an initiator caspase, being part of the TNF-R complex (47Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V. Chiannilkulchai N. Beckmann J.S. Mett I.L. Rebrikov D. Brodianski V.M. Kemper O.C. Kollet O. Lapidot T. Soffer D. Sobe T. Avraham K.B. Goncharov T. Holtmann H. Lonai P. Wallach D. Immunity. 1998; 9: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Third, although TNF-induced and Fas-induced signaling pathways leading to caspase activation and apoptosis converge at the level of FADD, only differing in the requirement of TRADD as an adapter protein between TNF-RI and FADD, LiCl specifically increases TNF-induced cell death. Although we cannot exclude the existence of a TNF-specific pathway (still unknown), the results mentioned above suggest that LiCl acts upstream of FADD, more specifically at the level of the TNF-R itself or of TRADD. However, cell death induced by enforced oligomerization of a stably expressed FKBP2-TRADD fusion protein with a synthetic oligomerizer (26Spencer D.M. Belshaw P.J. Chen L. Ho S.N. Randazzo F. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 839-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was still potentiated by LiCl cotreatment, excluding an effect of LiCl at the level of the TNF-R. Moreover, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of LiCl on the binding of TNF to its receptor (data not shown). By binding to receptor-interacting protein and TNF-R-associated factor-2, TRADD is also involved in the initiation of NF-κB activation in response to TNF (37Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). However, LiCl did not modulate TNF-induced NF-κB activation. These results also exclude the possibility that LiCl enhances TNF-induced apoptosis by preventing the antiapoptotic function of NF-κB. Moreover, the sensitizing effect of LiCl could still be observed in the presence of transcriptional or translational inhibitors, excluding a role for de novo protein synthesis in LiCl-induced TNF sensitization. The inability of LiCl to modulate NF-κB activation in response to TNF is in contrast with a recently published observation that LiCl inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB activation via inhibition of GSK-3 (41Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Because GSK-3β-deficient cells are hypersensitive to TNF, it has also been concluded that inhibition of GSK-3 and NF-κB-dependent gene expression by LiCl is directly responsible for the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl. The reason for this discrepancy with our results is still unclear. However, it should be noted that the inhibitory effect of LiCl on TNF-induced NF-κB activation was previously shown in the presence of 30 mm LiCl (41Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), which is considerably higher than the concentration needed for the potentiating effect on TNF-induced cell death, namely 2.5–10 mm. Moreover, if LiCl would inhibit NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to TNF, we would expect that LiCl also inhibits the TNF-induced expression of NF-κB-responsive genes such as interleukin-6, which is not the case (28Beyaert R. Schulze-Osthoff K. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF-induced levels of interleukin-6 were even enhanced in the presence of LiCl. Furthermore, we also obtained evidence against an NF-κB-independent function of GSK-3 in lithium-induced TNF sensitization. First, the GSK-3 inhibitors indirubin-3′-monoxime, valproic acid, and Ro31–8220 had no effect on the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Second, treatment of the cells with insulin, which is known to inhibit GSK-3 activity (48Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar), was unable to mimic the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl. 2P. Schotte, unpublished observation. Although we cannot exclude a cell type-specific involvement of GSK-3 in the modulation of TNF sensitivity, the above observations suggest at least the existence of an additional mechanism responsible for the sensitizing effect of LiCl on TNF-induced cell death. The therapeutic application of TNF in cancer treatment is limited by the fact that many tumor cells are only weakly sensitive to its direct cytotoxic action. To overcome this problem of TNF resistance as well as to be able to use lower doses of TNF with less side effects, agents that specifically increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to TNF might be very promising. Since lithium has been used for many years in the clinic to treat manic depression, the TNF-sensitizing effect of LiCl is intriguing and merits further experiments aimed to understand the underlying mechanism. We have demonstrated in this study that LiCl sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis in an NF-κB- and GSK-3-independent way. Moreover, we obtained evidence for a crucial role of TRADD in the TNF/LiCl synergism. It would be interesting to investigate how LiCl affects the signaling potential of TRADD."

We investigated conditions required for ATP to induce a permeability transition in mammalian mitochondria. Mitochondrial swelling associated with mitochondria permeability transition (MPT) was initiated by adding succinate to a rat liver mitochondrial suspension containing alloxan, a diabetogenic agent. If alloxan was added immediately with or 5 min after adding succinate, MPT was strikingly decreased. MPT induced by alloxan was inhibited by EGTA and several agents causing thiol oxidation, suggesting that alloxan leads to permeability transition through a mechanism dependent on Ca2+ uptake and sulfhydryl oxidation. Antimycin A and cyanide, inhibitors of electron transfer, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and oligomycin all inhibited MPT. During incubation with succinate, alloxan depleted ATP in mitochondria after an initial transient increase. However, in a mitochondrial suspension containing EGTA, ATP significantly increased in the presence of alloxan to a level greater than that of the control. These results suggest the involvement of energized transport of Ca2+ in the MPT initiation. Addition of exogenous ATP, however, did not trigger MPT in the presence of alloxan and had no effect on MPT induced by alloxan. We conclude that alloxan-induced MPT requires mitochondrial energization, oxidation of protein thiols, and matrix ATP to promote energized uptake of Ca2+.

Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) 1The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; CCCP, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone; Δψ, mitochondrial inner membrane potential; PTP, permeability transition pore. is associated with an increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to solutes with a molecular mass of 1.5 kDa or lower and can disturb mitochondrial functions in several ways (1Gunter T.E.

It is generally accepted that MPT is due to the opening of a so-called permeability transition pore (PTP), which accompanies a loss of transmembrane potential (Δψ), a release of Ca2+ and other cations, and mitochondrial swelling, causing ATP synthesis to stop in mitochondria (2Zaratti M. Srabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 3Bernardi P. Physiol.

Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The PTP is thought to have a role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, in import of mitochondrial protein, in thermal regulation in mammalian mitochondria, and as a common mediator of cell death (7Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 8Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). We focused on the role of adenine nucleotides in the modulation of MPT. The sensitivity of MPT to [Ca2+] is greatly increased by ATP depletion (9Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matrix ADP is an important modulator of PTP opening and acts by decreasing the sensitivity of the calcium trigger site to Ca2+ (10Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18931-18936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The opening of PTP may be caused by well known membrane constituents, including the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), porin molecules, and the complex forming the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (11Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hirsch T. Decaudin D. Susin S.A. Marchetti P. Larochette N. Resche-Rigon M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Two ADP binding sites may exist, one with a high affinity with the ANT that is blocked by the inhibitor atractyloside and the other site with a lower affinity (5Cromptom M. Bronner F.

Mitochondrial damage seems to occur in the early phase of cell death (14Sakurai K. Cederbaum A.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and evidence supports the idea that MPT is involved in apoptosis (6Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev.

Intracellular levels of ATP and mitochondrial dysfunction determine the way a cell dies with a difference between apoptosis and necrosis; ATP is required for apoptosis (19Sanchez-Alcazar J.A.

These findings suggest that ATP is involved in the apoptotic process that includes the induction of MPT. So far no clear evidence exists that ATP is involved in the initiation of MPT in mammalian mitochondria. This led us to explore the conditions that are necessary for ATP to induce the MPT. In this study, the permeability transition of rat liver mitochondria progressed markedly by adding respiratory substrates such as succinate in the presence of alloxan. Alloxan, a diabetogenic agent, causes changes in respiration, a decrease in the concentration of adenine nucleotides, Ca2+ release, and loss of Δψ in mammalian mitochondria (22Boquist L. Diabetologia. 1984; 27: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Mallaisse W.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 3524-3527Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and it has thiol oxidant activity similar to some MPT inducers (1Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zaratti M. Srabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 3Bernardi P. Physiol.

The focus of this study was to characterize the involvement of an increase in the ATP level, Ca2+uptake, and membrane thiol oxidation in alloxan-induced MPT initiated by adding succinate to rat liver mitochondria. Liver mitochondria were prepared daily from male Wistar rats weighing about 200 g that were fasted overnight as described previously (24Sakurai K. Stoyanovsky D.A. Fujimoto Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 237-280Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The permeability transition of mitochondria resulting from permeation of sucrose into the mitochondrial matrix was measured by recording the decrease in absorbance at 540 nm. The standard experimental conditions were as follows. Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were equilibrated in a total volume of 3 ml of Chelex 100-treated medium consisting of 0.1 µm rotenone, 0.25m sucrose, and 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 37 °C for 5 min. The suspension was then preincubated with 1 mm alloxan for 5 min. MPT was initiated by adding 5 mm succinate to this suspension. Various inhibitors, except for EGTA as indicated in the legend of Fig. 2, were included at the beginning of the preincubation period before adding alloxan. The effect of the various compounds on MPT was represented by changes in the maximal rate or extent of swelling as calculated from the change in absorbance at 10 min after adding succinate. The amount of ATP in the mitochondria was measured using the luciferin-firefly luciferase method (25Farber J.L. Lab. Invest. 1982; 47: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were preincubated in the presence or absence of alloxan, EGTA, or both at 37 °C and then incubated with 5 mmsuccinate for the indicated time. Twenty µl of the mitochondrial suspension was immediately mixed with 280 µl of HEPES buffer containing 0.02% sodium azide and 200 µl of the releasing solution. The amount of ATP was measured using an ATP assay kit. All operations for the assay ended after 90 s. To decrease the concentration of adenine nucleotides, mitochondria were incubated with Pi as described previously (26Austin J. Aprille J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 154-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Asimakis G.K. Sordahl L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: H672-H678PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of thiol in the mitochondrial membrane was measured using 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm as described previously (28Kowaltwski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Caarilho R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The experimental conditions were the same as those described for the MPT determination except that the incubation time was 10 min, and 50 µg of protein/ml of mitochondria was used. Alloxan was obtained from Wako Co. (Osaka, Japan) and was dissolved in Chelex 100-treated medium that had been purged with N2 gas for 10 min. Oligomycin, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), rotenone, and antimycin A were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and were dissolved in ethanol. The ATP assay kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals used in this study were of the highest grade available from commercial suppliers. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. and were statistically analyzed using the Student's t test for paired data.p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. After isolated rat liver mitochondria in the presence of rotenone were preincubated with succinate for 5 min, MPT was induced by adding Ca2+ ortert-butyl hydroperoxide plus Ca2+ (Fig.1 A). When alloxan was added 5 min after adding succinate, only a small MPT was observed. The features of MPT induced by these inducers agreed with other studies (3Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 4Kushnareva Y.E. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Boquist L. Diabetologia. 1984; 27: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,29Petronilli V. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In mitochondria that had previously been incubated with 1 mm alloxan for 5–15 min, an enhanced MPT was clearly observed after adding succinate (Fig. 1 B). However, adding alloxan together with succinate to the mitochondrial suspension resulted in little MPT. Increases in alloxan concentrations up to 2 mm increased the rate and extent of MPT initiated by adding succinate (Fig. 1 C). The MPT was significantly inhibited by 1 µm cyclosporin A (data not shown), suggesting that the absorbance changes indicated the “opening” of the PTP. Increases in succinate up to 5 mm in the presence of a constant concentration of alloxan induced the MPT in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). Because MPT in the presence of alloxan proceeded rapidly and markedly after adding succinate, subsequent experiments were made by first preincubating mitochondria with alloxan for 5 min in the presence of rotenone before adding succinate. Ca2+ is the most important factor for MPT, but the effects are modulated by a wide variety of physiological and chemical factors. Also, it has been shown that alloxan influences intramitochondrial [Ca2+] (30Frei B. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7394-7401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows that the MPT induced by alloxan was inhibited strongly by EGTA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). EGTA added after the initiation of MPT prevented further swelling but did not reverse the progression of swelling (Fig. 2 B). Mitochondria were preincubated with 0.05 mm EGTA to eliminate free Ca2+ present in the mitochondrial preparation and then were preincubated with or without alloxan and various concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 C). Added Ca2+ concentrations of more than 10 µm in the presence of alloxan or more than 100 µm in the absence of alloxan were sufficient to lead to MPT. These results suggest that Ca2+ is necessary for the induction of the MPT by alloxan. Alloxan reacts rapidly with protein thiol groups (23Mallaisse W.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 3524-3527Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Sakurai K. Miura M. Ogiso T. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1990; 38: 993-997Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and some thiol oxidants and thiol cross-linking reagents can induce MPT (1Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 32Marzo I.

We therefore investigated whether membrane-protein thiol groups were involved in the MPT induced by alloxan.N-Ethylmaleimide and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid strongly and diamide partially prevented MPT induced by alloxan (TableI). The thiol oxidants used in this study did not induce MPT in the absence of exogenous Ca2+. When the mitochondria were preincubated with alloxan, the amount of membrane thiol decreased in mitochondria incubated with or without malate/glutamate or succinate, indicating that alloxan directly consumes thiols of the mitochondrial membrane (TableII). These results suggest that the oxidation of membrane thiol protein is involved in the induction of MPT by alloxan. In the absence of alloxan, the amount of membrane thiol only slightly decreased after incubation with succinate but significantly increased after incubation with malate/glutamate. Adding malate/glutamate in place of succinate to a mitochondrial suspension clearly initiated MPT in the presence of alloxan, but the extent of MPT initiated by malate/glutamate was significantly decreased compared with the extent of MPT initiated by succinate.Table IEffects of thiol oxidants on MPT induced by alloxanThiol oxidantsPresence of alloxanAbsence of alloxanMPTInhibitionMPTΔA540/min%ΔA540/minNone (control)0.192 ± 0.0010.002 ± 0.000NEM0.012 ± 0.0011-ap < 0.05 compared with control.930.001 ± 0.000Diamide0.151 ± 0.0051-ap < 0.05 compared with control.21.90.005 ± 0.001DIDS0.048 ± 0.0001-ap < 0.05 compared with control.750.004 ± 0.000N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM, 20 µm), diamide (0.1 mm) and 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS, 0.3 mm) were included from the beginning of the experiments.

To evaluate the role of succinate in the induction of MPT, we examined the effects of inhibitors of the electron transfer chain and of ATP synthesis on the MPT. Antimycin A, an inhibitor of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (complex III), and KCN, an inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase reductase (complex IV), strongly inhibited the induction of MPT (TableIII), implying that succinate functions as an electron donor in MPT induction. Also, CCCP, an uncoupler, and oligomycin, an inhibitor of F0F1-ATPase, significantly inhibited MPT. The MPT initiated by malate/glutamate was inhibited by rotenone, an inhibitor of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) as well as by inhibitors of complexes III and IV (data not shown). In the absence of alloxan, none of the test compounds had an effect on the permeability of mitochondria. These results suggest that ATP produced by the metabolism of respiratory substances in mitochondria is involved in the induction of MPT.Table IIIEffects of electron transfer and ATP synthesis inhibitors on MPT induced by alloxanInhibitorsMPTPresence of alloxanInhibitionAbsence of alloxanΔA540/min%ΔA540/minControl (no addition)0.204 ± 0.0120.004 ± 0.002Antimycin A0.015 ± 0.0023-ap < 0.05 compared with control in the presence of alloxan.930.003 ± 0.002KCN0.025 ± 0.0033-ap < 0.05 compared with control in the presence of alloxan.880.006 ± 0.000CCCP0.011 ± 0.0023-ap < 0.05 compared with control in the presence of alloxan.950.009 ± 0.002Oligomycin0.036 ± 0.0073-ap < 0.05 compared with control in the presence of alloxan.820.006 ± 0.002Antimycin A (0.1 µm), KCN (0.3 mm), CCCP (0.2 mm), and oligomycin (0.002%) were included from the beginning of the experiments.

Fig. 3 shows changes in the amount of ATP in mitochondria preincubated with alloxan to show the involvement of ATP. When the mitochondria were incubated with succinate in the presence or absence of EGTA, the level of ATP increased from 1 to 5 min after the start of incubation. In mitochondria preincubated with alloxan, the level of ATP transiently increased in the 1st min after adding succinate, reaching a value that was similar to that of control mitochondria, but the ATP level decreased until all the ATP was lost at 5 min after adding succinate. In the presence of EGTA, the ATP level in mitochondria preincubated with alloxan significantly increased compared with control mitochondria without EGTA and alloxan at 1 and 5 min after adding succinate, suggesting a link between the behavior of Ca2+ and the consumption of ATP. Alloxan and EGTA had no effects on the production of ATP in the absence of succinate or on the light intensity of the luminescent reaction in the presence or absence of a sample. Under these conditions, CCCP and oligomycin inhibited the production of ATP after adding succinate in the presence or absence of alloxan (data not shown). We next examined the effect of Pi on the MPT. Pretreatment with Pi decreased the rate of MPT induced by alloxan in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). When alloxan or succinate was omitted from the mixture, the range of Pi concentrations used in this study did not induce MPT without added exogenous Ca2+. Table IV (A) shows that neither exogenous ATP nor ADP was able to trigger MPT in mitochondria in the presence of alloxan. Adding exogenous ATP or atractyloside, an inhibitor of the ANT, had no effect on alloxan-induced MPT initiated by adding succinate, whereas exogenous ADP significantly inhibited the MPT (TableIV (B)). Unexpectedly, atractyloside significantly reduced the inhibition of MPT by exogenous ADP. These results suggest that ATP produced in mitochondria is involved in the induction of MPT by alloxan, and external ADP, but not ATP, inhibits the MPT.Table IVEffects of ATP, ADP, and atractyloside on MPTAdditionsMPTΔA540/minANone (control)0.001 ± 0.001+ATP0.006 ± 0.002+ADP0.002 ± 0.001BNone (control)0.188 ± 0.011+ATP0.222 ± 0.006+ADP0.066 ± 0.0044-ap < 0.05 compared with control in B.+Atractyloside0.213 ± 0.015+Atractyloside and ADP0.102 ± 0.0094-ap < 0.05 compared with control in B.In A, after mitochondria were preincubated with 1 mM of alloxan for 5 min, the MPT was initiated by adding exogenous ATP (1 mm) or ADP (1 mm).

Open table in a new tab In A, after mitochondria were preincubated with 1 mM of alloxan for 5 min, the MPT was initiated by adding exogenous ATP (1 mm) or ADP (1 mm). In B, MPT was initiated by adding succinate. ATP, ADP, and atractyloside (50 µm) were included from the beginning of the experiments. Other conditions were the same as those described in the legend of Table I. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of triplicate experiments. In this study we showed that in mitochondria preincubated with alloxan, a diabetogenic agent, the membrane permeability transition is initiated by adding succinate by a reaction that can be inhibited by inhibitors of complex II, III, and IV in the electron transport chain. An uncoupler, CCCP, also inhibited the MPT. These results indicate that the induction of the MPT by alloxan is related to a transmembrane proton gradient generated by electron flow through the mitochondrial electron transfer system to molecular oxygen. Also, the induction of the MPT was clearly inhibited by oligomycin. However, adding exogenous ATP had no effect on the mitochondria without adding succinate in the presence of alloxan or on the MPT induced by alloxan. These results suggest that the ATP produced would be involved in inducing MPT in the matrix or at a matrix site of the inner membrane. Adenine nucleotides are often used as negative regulators of MPT in mammalian mitochondria initiated by some inducers (2Zaratti M. Srabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar, 10Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18931-18936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Simbula G. Glascott J.R. Akita S. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C479-C488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, the external ADP significantly inhibited the MPT, which was reduced by atractyloside, an agent that can stabilize the conformation of ANT. Atractyloside itself had no effect on the MPT by alloxan. ANT catalyzes the exchange between ATP and ADP because adenine nucleotides cannot diffuse across the inner membrane. ADP enters the matrix only if ATP exists in the matrix. Therefore, we assume that external ADP is exchanged for endogenous ATP through the action of ANT, and this may result in a decrease in the ATP level in the mitochondrial matrix and inhibition of MPT induced by alloxan. Lowering the matrix concentration of ADP may result in a decrease of the ADP-mediated inhibition of the MPT (10Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18931-18936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Austin J. Aprille J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 154-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the decrease in the amount of ADP induces the MPT by alloxan, pretreatment with Pi may increase MPT induced by alloxan by decreasing the matrix concentration of adenine nucleotides. Pretreatment with 5 mm Pi for 10 min decreased the amount of ATP and ADP in mitochondria to about 20 and 40%, respectively, of the control (data not shown). Other studies showed similar results (26Austin J. Aprille J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 154-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Rodriguez-Zavala J.S. Moreno-Sanchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7850-7855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the rate of MPT induced by alloxan in mitochondria pretreated with Pi was lower than the MPT rate in control mitochondria. These results suggest that the induction of MPT by alloxan depends on an increase in the concentration of matrix ATP rather than a decrease in the concentration of ADP. Alloxan added before the respiratory substrates caused a slight reduction in state 3 respiration and a collapse of Δψ. However, alloxan added after the substrates had no effect on the respiration. 2K. Sakurai, M. Katoh, and Y. Fujimoto, unpublished data. How alloxan causes an increase in the ATP level is not clear. Adding EGTA before or after alloxan inhibited the MPT. Alloxan decreased the concentration of Ca2+ needed to induce MPT. In the presence of EGTA, the increase in the ATP level was pronounced in mitochondria preincubated with alloxan compared with control mitochondria at 1 and 5 min after adding succinate. In contrast, a depletion of the ATP level occurred in mitochondria preincubated with alloxan in the absence of EGTA at 5 min. These results suggest that there is a link between the behavior of Ca2+ and the consumption of ATP in the process of MPT. Transfer of Ca2+across the inner membrane is mediated by an energy-requiring process (36Gunter T.E. Butinas L. Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 37Nicholls D. Akerman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 57-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable that the ATP produced during electron transfer increases matrix [Ca2+], which then initiates MPT. Alloxan, which is a mild thiol oxidant, directly consumes mitochondrial membrane thiols. The extent of MPT initiated by malate/glutamate was lower than the MPT initiated by succinate; malate/glutamate increased the membrane thiol content as found in other studies (38Rigobello M.P. Turcato F. Bindoli A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Skrede S. Biochem. J. 1968; 108: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is thought that the thiols generated by metabolism of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reacts with alloxan, resulting in partial prevention against oxidation of the critical thiols involved in MPT. Several studies have shown that oxidation of membrane thiol groups is involved in MPT triggered by inducers such as diamide, arsenite,tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and 1-hydroxyethyl radicals (2Zaratti M. Srabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar,24Sakurai K. Stoyanovsky D.A. Fujimoto Y. Cederbaum A.I. Free Radic. Biol.

We showed that thiol oxidants had an effect on MPT induced by alloxan because thiol compounds such as dithiothreitol and N-acetylcysteine directly reacted with alloxan and reduced alloxan concentrations in the medium. Thiol oxidants inhibited MPT, but the degree of inhibition varied widely among the oxidants. The reactions of alloxan with specific thiols may be needed to induce MPT; this is in agreement with the conclusion of another study (28Kowaltwski A.J. Vercesi A.E. Caarilho R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Further investigation is needed to clarify this point. The results of this study provide compelling evidence that a sequential addition of respiratory substances is needed to induce MPT by alloxan and indicate the existence of MPT in mammalian mitochondria resulting from the energized transport of Ca2+ and oxidation of protein thiols. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first to show that matrix ATP favors the pore opening in mammalian mitochondria. This finding supports the idea that MPT is important in the overall mechanism of apoptosis especially because apoptosis requires intracellular ATP (6Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu.

https://openalex.org/W2069173034,"A subfamily of zinc metalloproteases, represented by Neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) and endothelin-converting enzyme, is involved in the metabolism of a variety of biologically active peptides. Recently, we cloned and characterized a novel member of this metalloprotease family termed soluble secreted endopeptidase (SEP), which hydrolyzes many vasoactive peptides. Here we report that alternative splicing of the mouse<i>SEP</i> gene generates two polypeptides, SEP<sup>Δ</sup> and SEP. After synthesis, both isoforms are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as type II membrane proteins. SEP<sup>Δ</sup> then becomes an ER resident, whereas SEP, which differs by only the presence of 23 residues at the beginning of its luminal domain, is proteolytically cleaved by membrane secretase(s) in the ER and transported into the extracellular compartment. An analysis of the chimeric proteins between SEP<sup>Δ</sup> and bovine endothelin-converting enzyme-1b (bECE-1b) demonstrated that the retention of SEP<sup>Δ</sup> in the ER is mediated by the luminal domain. In addition, the dissection of the chimeric bECE-1b/SEP insertion showed that its insertion domain is obviously responsible for its secretion. A series of mutagenesis in this region revealed that the minimal requirement for cleavage was found to be a WDERTVV motif. Our results suggest that the unique subcellular localization and secretion of SEP proteins provide a novel model of protein trafficking within the secretory pathway."

Thus, cyanobacteria, especially transformable ones such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 andSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942, have proven to be valuable model organisms to elucidate chloroplast functions such as photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria, like other organisms, synthesize a diverse range of heat shock proteins (Hsps)1 upon exposure to high temperatures (1Borébry G. Surányi G. Korcz A. Pálfi Z. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lehel C. Wada H. Kovács E. Török Z. Gombos Z. Horváth I. Murata N. Vigh L. Plant Mol.

The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 751-767Crossref Google Scholar). To prove a specific contribution of a Hsp in thermo-tolerance in cyanobacteria, disruption mutants of the clpB, hsp16.6, and htpG genes have been constructed (5Eriksson M.J. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4839-4846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lee S. Prochaska D.J. Fang F. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 1998; 37: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Tanaka N.

Interestingly, all these disruptants showed much more striking thermo-sensitive phenotypes than those ofEscherichia coli or other prokaryotes, suggesting that those Hsps have a particularly important role for photosynthetic prokaryotes. In fact, photosynthetic oxygen evolution activity in theclpB and hsp16.6 mutants was more susceptible to high temperature inactivation than that in the wild type (5Eriksson M.J. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4839-4846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lee S. Prochaska D.J. Fang F. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 1998; 37: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The regulation of the expression of cyanobacterial heat shock genes remains poorly understood. Webb et al. (3Webb R. Reddy K.J. Sherman L.A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5079-5088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identify sequences upstream of the transcription start site of thegroESL gene from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells that were similar to the consensus heat shock promoters of E. coli recognized by sigma factor 32. However, there is no evidence for the presence of sigma factor 32 in cyanobacteria. As far as we know, there is no report that an alternative sigma factor may control the heat shock regulon in cyanobacteria. The nine-nucleotide inverted repeat sequence called CIRCE (8Zuber U. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is a regulatory element of heat shock induction that is conserved in cyanobacteria as well as other prokaryotes. The CIRCE element has been reported to be present around the transcription start site in groESL and/ordnaK operons of more than 30 different bacterial species, and it is thought to be an operator with which the HrcA repressor protein interacts (9Yuan G. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6462-6468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mogk A. Homuth G. Scholz C. Kim L. Schmid F.X. Schumann W.

CIRCE has been identified upstream ofgroEL genes in cyanobacteria (12Lehel C. Los D. Wada H. Györgyei J. Horváth I. Kovács E. Murata N. Vigh L. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; 239: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that heat shock strongly enhanced accumulation of transcripts of the two groEL genes, groEL and cpn60, in Synechocystis PCC 6803 in the light, but induction was lower in the dark (14Glatz A. Horváth I. Varvasovszki V. Kovács E. Török Z. Vigh L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Light appears to exert its effect through the photosynthetic electron transport since DCMU, an inhibitor of electron transport, suppressed the accumulation of transcripts of the twogroEL genes in the light. Those results suggest that cyanobacteria may have evolved a unique regulatory mechanism to induce the groEL genes. Evidence for additional regulatory mechanisms came from an inspection of promoter sequences. The potential transcription initiation site of the hspA gene, encoding a small Hsp homologue in the thermophilic cyanobacteriumSynechococcus vulcanus, was preceded by typical vegetative promoter sequences, although its transcript was clearly heat-inducible (15Roy S.K. Nakamoto H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3997-4001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no CIRCE element around the potential transcription initiation site of the hspA gene, indicating that an unknown regulatory mechanism suppresses the expression of hspA in cyanobacteria under non-heat shock conditions. Furthermore, the gene appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally because its mRNA was more stable at a heat shock temperature 63 °C than at 50 °C (15Roy S.K. Nakamoto H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3997-4001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel heat shock gene, orf7.5, fromSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942. To reveal the function of theorf7.5 gene, we generated a mutant strain in whichorf7.5 was insertionally disrupted by gene targeting. Analysis of the mutant showed the involvement of theorf7.5 gene in the growth and survival ofSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 under high temperatures and, additionally, in the expression of the groESLoperon. Unless otherwise indicated, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells were grown at 30 °C under a light intensity of 30 μE/m2/s in liquid BG-11 medium (16Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) or on BG-11 plates containing 1.5% (w/v) agar and 0.3% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate. The BG-11 was modified to contain 5 mm TES-NaOH, pH 8.0, and 50 mg/ml Na2CO3. The liquid culture was bubbled with air. Sequencing single-stranded DNA was carried out by using an AutoRead sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a DNA sequencer (DSQ-1, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The nucleotide sequences were aligned and analyzed using GENETYX software (Software Development Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Theorf7.5 gene from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 was found during the amplification of a small Hsp gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One of the PCR primers, 5′-GG(A/G)CCITT(C/T)(C/A)GIGA(A/G)GA-3′, was based on the amino-terminal sequence of HspA of S. vulcanus (15Roy S.K. Nakamoto H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3997-4001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EPFREED, and the other primer, 5′-ATIC(GT)IA(GA)IGTIA(GA)IACICC-3′, was based on the internal amino acid sequence of the HSP18 ofStreptomyces albus (17Servant P. Mazodier P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2998-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GVLTLRI. A 300-bp fragment was amplified from the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 genome after 90 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C and extension for 2 min at 72 °C, although nothing was produced after 30 PCR cycles. The product was designated as PCR-1. The PCR-1 was cloned into pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). PCR-1 was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the multiprime-labeling method as directed by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe was used to screen aSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 genomic library constructed in bacteriophage λ-DASH vector. Bacteriophage DNA from positive plaques was prepared by the liquid culture method, and further screening was performed by Southern blot analysis (18Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) after digestion of the DNA byEcoRI. A 6.5-kbp fragment that hybridized with the above probe was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A 5.0-kbp XhoI-EcoRI fragment was generated by digestion of the 6.5-kbp EcoRI fragment withXhoI and was subcloned into pBluescript II KS (+). Overlapping deletions of the 5.0-kbp XhoI-EcoRI fragment were obtained by the Erase-a-Base System (Promega, Madison, WI). With M13KO7 as a helper phage, single-stranded templates from both strands were generated for sequencing. Southern blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Nakamoto H. Hasegawa M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) except for the following procedure. A 276-bpNcoI fragment (Fig. 1A) containing theorf7.5 gene was labeled as described above and used as a probe for the hybridization. After hybridization, the membrane was washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and then 1× SSC containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 30 min each. Total RNA from Synechococcussp. PCC 7942 was prepared as described previously (19Nakamoto H. Hasegawa M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) from cells incubated for different time intervals after shifting cultures from 30 to 40 or 45 °C. During the incubation, the culture was illuminated and air-bubbled as described above. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a denaturing 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel containing 6.6% (w/v) formaldehyde. Northern blotting and hybridization with the 32P-labeled 276-bp NcoI fragment (Fig. 1A) as a probe were performed as described previously (19Nakamoto H. Hasegawa M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membrane was washed in 6× SSC at 65 °C for 60 min. The size of the mRNA was determined using an RNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The hybridization signals were detected with a BAS1000 Mac bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). In Fig. 9, the orf7.5, groEL, andhtpG mRNAs were detected by hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A suitable fragment for the preparation of anorf7.5-specific probe was generated by cloning a 0.8-kbp DNA fragment (Fig. 1A) containing theorf7.5 gene into the multicloning sites,EcoRI and PstI, of pBluescript II KS (+). The fragment (nucleotides 9–820, Fig. 1B) was amplified by PCR with primers (5′-AGGTTGA ATT CGTGGGCACAGCAA-3′ and 5′-TTCAACCTGCAGCCAGGTTT-3′, where A andT are mutations to create an EcoRI restriction site), and the cloned 5.0-kbpXhoI-EcoRI fragment was described above as a template. The resulting plasmid, pBS-EP, was used for the in vitro production of a digoxigenin-labeled,orf7.5-specific RNA probe with T7 RNA polymerase after linearization with EcoRI. For the preparation of agroEL-specific probe, a 1.1-kbpEcoRI-HincII fragment containing the 3′ half ofgroES and the 5′ half of groEL of S. vulcanus (13Tanaka N. Hiyama T. Nakamoto H. Biochim.

The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and the linearized DNA was used for the in vitro production of a digoxigenin-labeledgroES and groEL-specific RNA probe with T3 RNA polymerase. For the preparation of a htpG-specific probe, a 3.6-kbp EcoRI fragment containing the htpG gene of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (7Tanaka N. Nakamoto H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was cloned into pBluescript II KS (+), linearlized with BglII, and used for the in vitro production of a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe with T3 RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase transcribed the 0.45-kbpBglII-EcoRI region of the htpG gene (7Tanaka N. Nakamoto H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis was performed according to Sambrook et al. (18Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-TCGTAGAGGTTACCGAACGC-3′, which is complementary to the region downstream of the initiation codon oforf7.5 (nucleotides 500–519, see Fig. 1B) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), purified through a NAP-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then used as a primer. Labeled primer (2 pmol) and 20 μg of total RNA in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4m NaCl, and 80% (v/v) formamide) was heated at 85 °C for 10 min and annealed at 30 °C for 12 h. After ethanol precipitation, the primer and total RNA were dissolved in a final volume of 20 μl of reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm dNTPs). Primer extension was carried out by adding 200 units of SuperscriptTM II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubating at 42 °C for 50 min. Subsequently, 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1 μl of RNase A (10 μg/ml) were added and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The sample was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 7.4, and 6 μl of formamide loading buffer (80% (v/v) formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, and 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue). After heat denaturation, a 5-μl sample was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel for electrophoresis. Products of dideoxynucleotide sequencing reactions performed with the same primer and the cloned 5.0-kbpXhoI-EcoRI fragment as a template were run in parallel to allow determination of the end points of the extension products. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using GeneAmp thermostable rTth reverse transcriptase RNA PCR kit as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA was prepared as described above, and contaminating DNA was removed by S.N.A.P. total RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The antisense oligonucleotide primer (5′-TATCTTACGGCTTTGGCCGA-3′) complementary to nucleotides 693–712 (Fig. 1B) was used for cDNA synthesis that was performed at 60 °C for 30 min. PCR amplification was performed with a sense primer (5′-TAGGG AATT CCACCCTAGTTGC-3′, where G and T are a mutation and an insertion, respectively, to create an EcoRI restriction site) corresponding to nucleotides 288–309 (Fig.1B) under the cycling conditions of 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C and the final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. A 2.0-kbpHindIII/EcoRI chromosomal fragment (Fig.1A) cloned in pBluescript II KS (+) was digested at the unique BstEII site in orf7.5. A kanamycin-resistant gene cassette, which was isolated by digesting pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by BamHI, was inserted into the restriction site in the forward direction (the same gene orientation as that of orf7.5). The resulting plasmid was named pNT31 (Fig. 5). The construct was used to transform cells of naturally competent Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 through homologous recombination. These cells were segregated for a few generations by single colony selection on BG-11 agar plates to isolate mutant strains (20Golden S.S. Brusslan J. Haselkorn R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). 20 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate was used for selection of transformants. One of the clones was designated as NT31. The Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells were grown to mid log phase at 30 °C under a light intensity of 35 μE/m2/s as described above and then diluted to an absorbance of 0.50 at 730 nm. For basal thermo-tolerance assays, 20 ml of the diluted culture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. Aliquots of the culture taken before and after the high temperature treatment were serially diluted (5 times each) in fresh, sterile BG-11 medium. A 10-μl aliquot from each dilution was then spotted onto a BG-11 plate, and the culture was grown at 30 °C under a light intensity of 35 μE/m2/s for a week. Cell survival was determined by counting the number of colonies in the most and second-most diluted cultures and multiplying their average by the appropriate dilution factor. At least three independent replicate experiments were carried out for all temperature experiments. Acquired thermo-tolerance assays were performed as above, except 20 ml of the diluted culture was given a pretreatment at 42 °C for 60 min before the high temperature treatment at 50 °C for 20 min. In both assays, the cultures were continuously bubbled with air, and the photon irradience was maintained at 35 μE/m2/s throughout the heat treatments at 42 or 50 °C. pBS-EP, which was used for the preparation of anorf7.5-specific RNA probe, was digested withXbaI and XhoI at the cloning sites of the vector and subcloned into pAM1573 to generate plasmid pNI52. pAM1573, which was provided by Professor Susan S. Golden (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX), has the cloning sites and a chloramphenicol resistance gene inserted into a segment of DNA (termed as a neutral site) from the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 chromosome. The neutral site mediates homologous recombination with the chromosome without causing any apparent phenotype. pNI52 was introduced intoSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 as described above, and transformants were selected on BG-11 agar plates containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 7.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. One of the transformants was designated as NI52. A frameshift or a point mutation within theorf7.5-coding region was generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Two primers (5′-GCGTTCGGTAACCTCTG ACGAAATCTTTGGGCG-3′, 5′-CGCCCAAAGATTTCGTC AGAGGTTACCGAACGC-3′) containing an insertion of a single base at the ninth codon oforf7.5 (underlined bases in the above sequences, see also Fig. 8A), each complementary to opposite strands of the vector pBS-EP, were extended by PCR. Then the product was treated withDpnI to digest the parental template pBS-EP and to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA. The DNA incorporating a frameshift in orf7.5 was designated as pNI71. In the same way, pNI81 in which a point mutation was incorporated at the third codon of orf7.5 (underlined bases in the following sequences, see also Fig. 8A) was generated using two primers, 5′-GAGGATCCCATGGAGT AAGCGTTCGGTAACC-3′, 5′-GGTTACCGAACGCTTA CTCCATGGGATCCTC-3′. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing orf7.5 in pNI71 and pNI81. Either pNI71 or pNI81 was introduced intoSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 as described above, and transformants were selected on BG-11 agar plates containing 10 μg/ml kanamycin and 7.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. One of the clones from each transformation was isolated and designated as NI71 and NI81, respectively. The sequence data reported here (see Fig. 1) will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBankTM nucleotide sequence data bases with the accession number AB002694. Initially, we intended to amplify a small Hsp gene from the unicellular cyanobacteriumSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 by PCR with degenerate primers to small Hsps from other prokaryotes. Although there was no product after 30 cycles of polymerase reactions, further-extended PCR resulted in a 0.3-kbp DNA fragment. The sequence of the DNA fragment does not reveal close relatedness to any gene in the data base. We further examined the product to see if it is a portion of a heat-inducible gene since we have embarked on a project to identify cyanobacterial Hsps and their genes (7Tanaka N. Nakamoto H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka N. Hiyama T. Nakamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Roy S.K. Nakamoto H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3997-4001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Furuki M. Tanaka N. Hiyama T. Nakamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed transient increases during heat shock of 400- and 330-base RNAs with which the 0.3-kbp PCR product hybridized (data not shown). These results indicated that the PCR product constitutes a novel heat shock gene. Thus, we went on to clone a DNA fragment containing the whole gene by screening a Synechococcus genomic library with this PCR product. There were three open reading frames (orfs) in the sequenced region of 2.4 kbp (Fig.1A). We could not find any nucleotide or amino acid sequences in Cyanobase (data base on the genome of cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) that exhibits significant homology to the smaller orfs. One of them, designated as orf14.1 (the number is based on the estimated molecular weight for the orf) is located from bases 333 to 713 of the sequence shown in Fig. 1B. Withinorf14.1, there was another orf that we designated as orf7.5. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR product corresponded to a region from bases 478 to 607 of the sequence shown in Fig. 1B. The latter half of the PCR product did not correspond to the sequence. Thus, the 400- and 330-base RNAs described above are likely to be transcripts of orf14.1 and/ororf7.5. The amino acid sequence deduced from the larger orf, which is located 54-bp downstream oforf14.1, showed significant homology to adenylosuccinate lyase (PurB) of Bacillus subtilis (22Ebbole D.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8274-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of orf14.1 and orf7.5copies in the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 genome was determined by Southern blot analysis. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 genomic DNA digested with EcoRI, HincII,HindIII, PstI, SalI, orXhoI was hybridized using the radiolabeled 276-bpNcoI DNA fragment (shown as a dotted line in Fig.1A) as a probe. The probe hybridized to only one DNA fragment for each restriction endonuclease, demonstrating that there is no other gene in the genome that is extensively homologous toorf14.1 and orf7.5 (data not shown). To confirm that orf14.1 and/or orf7.5 is induced by heat shock, we performed Northern blot analysis with total RNA isolated from cells after a shift from 30 to 40 °C. TheNcoI DNA fragment containing a 3′-portion oforf14.1, whole orf7.5, and upstream untranslated region of the purB gene hybridized with 400- and 330-base RNAs (Fig. 2A). The 400- and 330-base RNAs, barely detectable at 30 °C, increased 4- and 3-fold, respectively, after a 15-min exposure to 40 °C and then diminished during 45 min of prolonged incubation (Fig. 2A). The Northern blot was stripped and reprobed with the32P-labeled psaD gene ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which encodes one of the peripheral subunits of photosystem I (23Reilly P. Hulmes J.D. Pan Y.C.E. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17658-17662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The psaD gene was shown previously not to be heat-induced in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (24Chitnis P.R. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 58-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus serving as a control for a heat-induced gene. The level of the psaD mRNA remained unchanged during the heat shock (Fig. 2C), confirming that the two RNAs are heat-induced. Similar experiments were carried out with total RNA isolated from cultures heat-shocked at 45 °C. The accumulation of the 400- and 330-base RNAs was 9- and 4-fold, respectively, after a 15-min exposure to 45 °C (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the 400-base RNA increased further at 45 °C. Northern blot analysis with an RNA probe whose sequence is complementary to orf14.1 andorf7.5 resulted in similar results (Fig. 9). These results suggested that orf14.1 and/ororf7.5 were induced upon heat shock treatment. The DNA and RNA fragments sused as probes contain sequences beyondorf14.1 and orf7.5. Therefore, the probes could be hybridizing to an RNA downstream of the orfs. We performed Northern blot analysis with the radiolabeledSacI-EcoRV DNA probe (see Fig. 1A) to examine expression of purB. No RNA hybridizing with thepurB probe in total RNA that was prepared from cells grown at 30 °C or heat-shocked at 45 °C was detected (data not shown). Thus, it appears that the putative purB gene is not expressed significantly under both normal and stress conditions. The results also confirm that the 400- and 330-base mRNAs were the transcripts of orf14.1 and/or orf7.5. The two RNA species of 400 and 330 bases may be transcripts of orf14.1 and orf7.5, respectively. Alternatively, both mRNAs originate from the sameorf. To clarify the origin of the RNAs, we determined the 5′-ends of the 400- and 330-base mRNAs by primer extension analysis using total RNA and a synthetic oligonucleotide primer complementary to the 5′-end of orf7.5. Total RNA was isolated fromSynechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells grown at 30 °C or cells heat-shocked at 45 °C for 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. The analysis revealed two extended products (Fig. 3). No more extended products were detected within 200 bases upstream of P1 (data not shown). The result indicated that the two mRNAs have different 5′-ends that correspond to the P1 and P2 positions of the genomic DNA shown in Fig. 1B. The number of both transcripts increased with the temperature shift from 30 to 45 °C, although the transcripts initiated at P1 increased much more than those initiated at P2. P1 and P2 were located 141 and 71 bases upstream of the ATG start codon of orf7.5, respectively (Fig. 1B and Fig. 3). Since P1 and P2 are located within orf14.1 (Fig.1A), the two mRNAs are likely to be the transcripts oforf7.5. We could find neither the E. coli-type heat shock promoter sequences recognized by sigma factor 32 (25) nor the CIRCE (8Zuber U. Schumann W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) sequence upstream of P1 and P2. Instead, P1 was preceded by sequences that resemble the consensus sequences of promoters recognized by the vegetative sigma factors of B. subtilis as well as that of E. coli (Fig.1B, underlined) (25Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). We could not find any promoter seque"
https://openalex.org/W2015033845,"INAD is a scaffolding protein containing five PSD95/dlg/zonular occludens-1 (PDZ) domains that tether NORPA (phospholipase Cβ4), the TRP calcium channel, and eye-PKC in Drosophila photoreceptors. We previously showed that eye-PKC interacted with the second PDZ domain (PDZ2) of INAD. Sequence comparison with a prototypical type I PDZ domain predicts that PDZ2 is the best candidate among the five PDZ domains to recognize eye-PKC that contains a type I PDZ ligand, Ile-Thr-Ile-Ile, at its carboxyl terminus. Replacement of Ile−3 in eye-PKC with charged residues resulted in a drastic reduction of the PDZ2 interaction. Substitution of a conserved His with Arg at the second α-helix of PDZ2 led to a reduced binding; however, a Leu replacement resulted in an enhanced eye-PKC association. We isolated and sequenced the InaD gene. The coding sequence of InaDcontains nine exons spanning 3 kilobases. Translation of coding sequences from three wild-type alleles revealed three SNPs affecting residues, 282, 319, and 333 of INAD. These polymorphisms are localized in PDZ2. Interestingly, we found two of three PDZ2 variants displayed a greater affinity for eye-PKC. In summary, we evaluated the molecular basis of the eye-PKC and PDZ2 association by mutational analysis and concluded that PDZ2 of INAD is a type I domain important for the eye-PKC interaction.

Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Because the carboxyl-terminal of eye-PKC (11Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) contains a type I PDZ ligand, we sought to identify a type I domain in INAD. Sequence alignment with the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) of PSD95, a type I domain, indicates that PDZ2 is the only type I domain in INAD. PDZ3 of PSD95 interacts with a tetrapeptide, Gln-Thr-Ser-Val (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), and the side chains of Gln−3 form hydrogen bonds with those of Ser and Asn in PDZ3 of PSD95. In contrast, the corresponding residue of Gln−3 in eye-PKC is Ile−3, a residue with a hydrophobic side chain. We explored how a different residue at the −3 position of the target may interact with the different type I PDZ domains. We also performed site-directed mutagenesis by modifying Ile−3 of eye-PKC and investigated the contribution of this residue in the PDZ2 recognition. To explore the basis of the type I interaction, we mutated a conserved His in the second α-helix of PDZ2. This His has been implicated in the interaction with Ser/Thr at the −2 position (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that substitution of His310 with a Leu resulted in enhanced eye-PKC interaction, whereas replacement with Arg led to a reduction of association. To gain insight into the regulation of InaD expression, we analyzed the genomic structure of InaD and mapped the transcription start site by RACE. The InaD gene contains nine exons. Interestingly, we found SNPs in the coding exons leading to substitutions in three residues of PDZ2. We analyzed these variant PDZ2 and show that two modified PDZ domains display an increase in eye-PKC binding. Ficoll, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and nitroblue tetrazolium were obtained from Research Organic, Inc. (Cleveland, OH). Phenol and deoxynucleotide triphosphates were purchased from U. S. Biochemicals. Chloroform and other chemicals were from Fisher. Nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher & Schuell. DNA size markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes such as T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), orPromega (Madison, WI). RNasin and pGEMEX1 were obtained from Promega. [32P]dCTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A Drosophila genomic library prepared from Canton S strain in Charon 4 vector (22Maniatis T. Hardison R.C. Lacy E. Lauer J. O'Connell C. Quon D. Sim G.K. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1978; 15: 687-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar) was plated. Filter replicas of the library were probed with radioactively labeled InaD in a hybridization solution (5× SSCP, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution) at 65 °C for 16 h. Subsequently filters were rinsed with a buffer containing 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 2 h (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 8.46-8.49Google Scholar). Positive plaques were identified by autoradiography and purified. The EcoRI inserts containing the InaD gene were identified and subcloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene) for sequence analysis. The nucleotide sequence was determined either by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or by automatic DNA sequencing using ABI PRISM BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For DNA obtained by PCR at least four to six independent subclones were sequenced. Total genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (1Shieh B.-H. Niemeyer B. Neuron. 1995; 14: 201-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 flies were gently homogenized in 300 μl of buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris, pH 7.6, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS). The homogenates were incubated at 65 °C for 30 min, and 8 m potassium acetate (one sixth volume) was added. The mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min, and the supernatant was recovered following centrifugation. RNase A (50 μg) was added to the supernatant to hydrolyze RNA. The mixture was subject to phenol/chloroform extraction to remove proteins. Ethanol was added to the supernatant to precipitate genomic DNA. Fly heads from various strains were isolated, and total RNA were extracted according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA was precipitated by ethanol and quantified by spectrophotometry. To generate first strand cDNA, 20 μg of total RNA were added to a 25-μl reverse transcription reaction using the reverse transcription system (Promega). Following incubation at 42 °C for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by addition of 75 μl of 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). An aliquot of cDNA (1–2 μg of RNA equivalent) was used as templates for PCR analysis. PCR was used to amplify genomic DNA as well as cDNA using InaD-specific primers. A negative control containing no added templates was also performed to assure the specificity of amplifications. The amplified fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1 using the TOPO TA Cloning system (Invitrogen), and recombinant plasmids were purified and used for sequencing. The experimental conditions for PCR (30 cycles) were denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and annealing at 50 °C for 30 s followed by extension at 72 °C for 2–3 min. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50–100 ng of each primer, 1 μg of total genomic DNA (or first strand cDNA from 1–2 μg total RNA) as templates, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Primers for InaD genomic and cDNA amplification were primers b and d (see Fig.4 A). Primer sequences for the amplification of the eye-PKC carboxyl tail were TTC GAA TTC ATG GCA GGT (5′) and TAT GGA TCC TTA AAT GAT GGT TAT AAA CTC (3′). RACE was performed using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, total RNA fromDrosophila head was primed with a modified oligo(dT)30 primer to generate first strand cDNA by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The first strand cDNA was then used as templates for the second strand cDNA synthesis mediated by RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, and E. coli DNA ligase. After ligating with an adaptor primer, the double-strand cDNA was used as templates for PCR using a gene-specific primer, b (see Fig. 4 A) and AP1 primer that anneals to the adaptor primer. A second PCR reaction using the initial PCR mixture as templates and a different set of primers, primer a (see Fig. 4 A) and AP1, was followed. Two antisense primers, a and b (see Fig. 4 A), were used for the 5′ RACE, and two sense primers, d and e (see Fig. 4 A), were used for 3′ RACE. All four InaD-specific primers have melting temperatures of 72 °C. The DNA fragments obtained from the nested PCR amplification were subcloned and sequenced. Primer sequences forInaD are CTT GTC CAG GGT CAC CAT GTG AAT (primer a), CAG CAG CAT GTC GCC CAC TTT CA (primer b), TCA AGC AGC GAG GAT GGT TCA GTT (primer d), and GGC ATG TGC GTC AAG CCC ATC AA (primer e). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the overlap extension method as described (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal tails of wild-type eye-PKC (641) and PDZ2 (206) of INAD were expressed as fusion proteins of glutathione S-transferase (GST). Briefly, recombinant pGEX4T1 plasmids were transformed intoE. coli HMS174. Overnight cultures (1 ml) were prepared from a single colony and used to inoculate a 50-ml LB broth containing ampicillin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C for 2–3 h until the density of bacterial cultures (OD600) reached 0.6–0.7. The expression of fusion proteins was initiated by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.1–1 mm) (27Smith D.B. Rubira M.R. Simpson R.J. Davern K.M. Tiu T.W. Board P.G. Mitchell G.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 27: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cultures were harvested 3 h following induction, and bacterial pellets were collected by centrifugation. Bacterial lysates containing the fusion protein were prepared by resuspending the pellets in binding buffer (50 mm K3PO4, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 plus a mixture of protease inhibitors) followed by repeated sonication. Recombinant plasmids containing target cDNA in pGEMEX1 (Promega) were constructed and used as templates for T7 RNA polymerase-dependent transcription. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into T7 gene 10 fusions containing PDZ2 (206), the carboxyl-terminal tail of eye-PKC (562), and PDZ4 (485) was accomplished by in vitrotranscription and translation using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) (6Shieh B.-H. Zhu M.-Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of reticulocyte lysates were added for a 50-μl reaction that contained [35S]methionine (40 μCi), circular plasmid templates (0.2–1 μg), RNasin (40 units), and T7 RNA polymerase (1 μl).In vitro translated radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE or used directly for pull-down assays. Bacterial lysates containing similar amounts (5 μg) of GST fusion proteins or GST were incubated with radiolabeled target proteins (10–20-fold excess) in binding buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture (55 μl) was transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prewashed with binding buffer. Incubation proceeded for 1 h at 4 °C with constant agitation for binding of GST fusion proteins to the beads. The supernatant of the mixture was removed, and an aliquot (5%) was analyzed by SDS/PAGE. The beads were rinsed with binding buffer (100 μl) three times to remove nonspecific binding. The GST fusion protein with bound radioactive proteins was eluted with SDS/PAGE loading buffer and analyzed on SDS/PAGE. Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography or with a PhosphorImager (445SI, Molecular Dynamics). Affinity of interaction was determined by the amount of bound radioactive probes. Nonspecific binding to GST was used as a negative control. Western blotting was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The presence of antigens was visualized upon staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Polyclonal anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Previously our laboratory reported that PDZ2 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal sequence of eye-PKC (11Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, Tsunoda et al. (9Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) showed that retinal eye-PKC associated with PDZ4 by pull-down assays. Xuet al. (16Xu X.-Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) suggested the involvement of PDZ3 and PDZ4 in the eye-PKC association by heterologous expression and co-immunoprecipitation. Questions remain as to which PDZ domains are important for the eye-PKC association. Importantly, both Xu et al. (16Xu X.-Z.S. Choudhury A. Li X. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and Adamski et al. (11Adamski F.M. Zhu M.-Y. Bahiraei F. Shieh B.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17713-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) pointed out the involvement of the carboxyl tail of eye-PKC; a point mutation that converted the last residue of eye-PKC, Ile, to an Asp, led to a drastic reduction of the INAD interaction. To investigate which PDZ domain of INAD associates with eye-PKC, we examined the carboxyl-terminal tail of eye-PKC. Eye-PKC terminates with Ile-Thr-Ile-Ile, consistent with an interaction with a type I PDZ domain. The molecular basis of the interaction between a type I PDZ domain and a carboxyl-terminal sequence has been revealed in the x-ray crystallographic studies of PDZ3 of PSD95 and a target peptide (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). We aligned PDZ3 of PSD95 with five PDZ domains of INAD and found that only PDZ2 resembles a type I domain (Fig.1 A) because several critical residues involved in target binding are conserved. In particular, the His residue located at the beginning of the second α-helix (αB) is conserved in PDZ2 of INAD, His310. The N-3 nitrogen of His310 is likely to be involved in hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl side chain of Ser/Thr at the −2 position of the target (Fig. 1 B). The presence of (Ser/Thr)−2 is a hallmark of the type I ligand. Consistently, eye-PKC contains Thr at the −2 position for an interaction with PDZ2; none of the other PDZ domains of INAD contain a His at the corresponding position. Another conserved residue in PDZ2 includes Arg254 implicated in binding to the terminal carboxyl group of the target (Fig. 1). By analogy, the hydrophobic pocket for binding to the terminal hydrophobic residue of eye-PKC, Ile0, is contributed by Leu260, Leu262, Leu264, and Phe317 from PDZ2 (Fig. 1 B). Overall, PDZ2 of INAD and PDZ3 of PSD95 share 28% sequence identity. It is noteworthy that PDZ3 of PSD95 associates with a target sequence, Gln-Thr-Ser-Val. The polar side chain of Gln at the −3 position, specifically the free carbonyl group, forms hydrogen bonds with the polar side chains of Asn326 and Ser339 of PDZ3 (17Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In contrast, PDZ2 of INAD recognizes eye-PKC containing a hydrophobic residue, Ile, at the −3 position. The side chain of Ile does not participate in hydrogen bonding. Consistently, the corresponding residues in PDZ2 for bonding with Ile−3 are Ala263 and Ala278 (Fig. 1), whose side chains also do not form hydrogen bonds. The divergence of these two residues predicted to interact with Ile−3 of eye-PKC further lends support for the role of PDZ2 in interacting with the carboxyl terminus of eye-PKC. To investigate whether Ile−3 of eye-PKC is involved in the PDZ2 interaction, we generated and characterized two point mutants. The codon of Ile−3 was replaced with that of Glu (Ile−3 → Glu) or Lys (Ile−3 → Lys) by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type and modified eye-PKC cDNAs were used to generate radiolabeled fusion protein for PDZ2 binding. As shown in Fig. 2, we detected a drastic reduction of the PDZ2 interaction in these two mutants. In particular, the Glu substitution (Ile−3 → Glu) displayed a total loss of the association (Fig. 2 A, lane 4, and Fig. 2 B). These findings indicate that Ile−3 of eye-PKC is critically involved in the PDZ2 interaction; substitutions with charged residues almost abolished the association. As mentioned above, type I PDZ domains usually contain a basic residue, either His or Arg, at the beginning of αB (Fig. 1 A) for binding to (Ser/Thr)−2 of type I targets. In contrast, type II targets contain either a bulky hydrophobic or Tyr at the −2 position that interacts with a hydrophobic residue (e.g. Val) in the corresponding αB position of type II PDZ domains. We examined the involvement of His310 in αB of PDZ2 by amino acid replacement followed by pull-down assays. When His was substituted by Arg (H310R), the interaction with wild-type eye-PKC was reduced to about 50% (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the Leu substitution (H310L) led to a 1-fold increase in the eye-PKC interaction. We also tested the eye-PKC binding to PDZ4 of INAD and showed a much weaker binding compared with that of PDZ2 (Fig. 3). Both His and Arg have side chains capable of hydrogen bonding with (Ser/Thr)−2; however, Arg has an aliphatic side chain instead of an imidazole ring like His. It is likely that differences in the side chains at the corresponding αB position lead to a change in the eye-PKC interaction. When His310 was substituted by Leu whose side chain does not support hydrogen bonding, an increased affinity toward eye-PKC was observed. We proposed that polar side chains from a neighboring residue of His310, such as Arg308, can engage in hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group of Thr−2 of eye-PKC to stabilize the interaction in the H310L mutant. To investigate whether Arg308 is important for the observed eye-PKC association, we substituted Arg308 with Gly in the H310L background (R308G,H310L). We show that double mutants displayed a great reduction of the eye-PKC association (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that Arg308 is essential for the eye-PKC interaction in the H310L mutant. We identified theInaD gene and investigated its genomic organization. Genomic clones were obtained either by screening a Drosophilagenomic library or by gene amplification via PCR (Fig.4 A). The InaD gene was subjected to restriction enzyme mapping (Fig. 4 A) and nucleotide sequencing. Comparison of the genomic DNA (accession numberAF245280) with cDNA sequences provided the basis for the exon/intron organization as shown in Fig. 4 A (middle panel). The coding sequence of InaD is contained within a 3-kilobase genomic fragment that has nine exons interrupted by eight intervening sequences. All introns are rather small in size ranging from 54 to 368 nucleotides and are flanked by conserved 5′ and 3′ consensus sequences (28Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at each end. The InaD gene product is composed of five distinct PDZ domains (2Saras J. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 3Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr.

To reveal whether each PDZ domain is encoded within an exon, we projected the location of introns in the translation product of InaD (Fig.4 A, bottom panel). We found both PDZ1 and PDZ2 are encoded by only one exon, whereas the remaining three PDZ domains are encoded by two adjacent exons (Fig. 4 A). To determine the transcription start site of the InaD gene, we employed 5′ RACE (Fig. 4 B) followed by DNA sequencing. Similarly, the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) was also determined (Fig.4 B).
