https://openalex.org/W2075796682,"Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolae membranes. We have suggested that caveolin functions as a scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate certain caveolin-interacting proteins within caveolae membranes. In this regard, caveolin co-purifies with a variety of lipid-modified signaling molecules, including G-proteins, Src-like kinases, Ha-Ras, and eNOS. Using several independent approaches, it has been shown that a 20-amino acid membrane proximal region of the cytosolic amino-terminal domain of caveolin is sufficient to mediate these interactions. For example, this domain interacts with G-protein α subunits and Src-like kinases and can functionally suppress their activity. This caveolinderived protein domain has been termed the caveolin-scaffolding domain. However, it remains unknown how the caveolin-scaffolding domain recognizes these molecules.Here, we have used the caveolin-scaffolding domain as a receptor to select random peptide ligands from phage display libraries. These caveolin-selected peptide ligands are rich in aromatic amino acids and have a characteristic spacing in many cases. A known caveolin-interacting protein, Gi2α, was used as a ligand to further investigate the nature of this interaction. Gi2α and other G-protein α subunits contain a single region that generally resembles the sequences derived from phage display. We show that this short peptide sequence derived from Gi2α interacts directly with the caveolin-scaffolding domain and competitively inhibits the interaction of the caveolin-scaffolding domain with the appropriate region of Gi2α. This interaction is strictly dependent on the presence of aromatic residues within the peptide ligand, as replacement of these residues with alanine or glycine prevents their interaction with the caveolin-scaffolding domain. In addition, we have used this interaction to define which residues within the caveolin-scaffolding domain are critical for recognizing these peptide and protein ligands. Also, we find that the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 both recognize the same peptide ligands, whereas the corresponding domain within caveolin-2 fails to recognize these ligands under the same conditions. These results serve to further demonstrate the specificity of this interaction. The implications of our current findings are discussed regarding other caveolin- and caveolae-associated proteins.

Caveolae are plasma membrane-attached vesicular organelles that have a characteristic diameter in the range of 50-100 nm (1Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W.

Caveolae are present in most cell types but are especially abundant in adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (3Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes and smooth muscle cells, they represent up to 20% of the total plasma membrane surface area. Endothelial cells contain ∼5,000-10,000 caveolae/cell. Although they were originally implicated in cellular transport processes (4Simionescu N. Simionescu M. Palade G.E. J.

Caveolin, a 21-24-kDa protein, is a principal integral membrane component of caveolae membranes in vivo (12Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W.

Using either Triton X-100-based methods or detergent-free methods, caveolin co-purifies with certain lipid-modified signaling molecules (such as G-proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, and Ha-Ras) (5Sargiacomo M.

In addition, caveolin was first identified as a major v-Src substrate that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells (17Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Based on these and other observations, we have proposed the “caveolae signaling hypothesis,” which states that caveolar localization of certain signaling molecules could provide a compartmental basis for their actions and explain cross-talk between signaling pathways (18Lisanti M.P.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Several independent lines of evidence suggest that caveolin may function as a scaffolding protein within caveolae membranes: (i) both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of caveolin remain entirely cytoplasmic and are therefore accessible for cytoplasmic protein-protein interactions (21Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar); (ii) caveolin forms high molecular mass homo-oligomers of ∼350 kDa (22Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E.

Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 25Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J.

Thus, it appears that the caveolin protein has the capability of interacting with itself, specific lipids, and other proteins and can serve to orchestrate caveolae formation. Using a variety of domain-mapping approaches (deletion mutagenesis, GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTBSTris-buffered salineTBSTTBS/Tween 20FLfull-length. fusion proteins, and synthetic peptides), a region within caveolin has been defined that mediates the interaction of caveolin with itself and other proteins (16Song K.S.

This cytoplasmic 41-amino acid membrane proximal region of caveolin is sufficient to mediate the formation of caveolin homo-oligomers (22Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl-terminal half of this region (20 amino acids, residues 82-101) mediates the interaction of caveolin with G-protein α subunits and Src family tyrosine kinases (26Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This interaction is sufficient to suppress the GTPase activity of G-proteins and inhibits the autoactivation of Src family tyrosine kinases (29Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). As this caveolin domain (residues 82-101) is critical for caveolin homo-oligomerization and the interaction of caveolin with certain caveolin-associated proteins (G-proteins, Ha-Ras, and Src family kinases), we have previously termed this protein domain the caveolin-scaffolding domain (29Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Tris-buffered saline TBS/Tween 20 full-length. Here, we have used the caveolin-scaffolding domain and one of its protein ligands (a G-protein α subunit, Gi2α) to explore the possible protein sequence requirements that underlie this molecular recognition event. As a first step, a fusion protein carrying the caveolin-scaffolding domain was used to select random peptide ligands from phage display libraries. Many of these peptide ligands share two properties with a particular region of the G-protein: (i) a preponderance of aromatic amino acids in a short stretch; and (ii) a characteristic spacing between these aromatic residues. We show that this region of Gi2α interacts directly with the caveolin-scaffolding domain, and a peptide encoding this G-protein domain competitively inhibits the binding of the appropriate region of Gi2α to the caveolin-scaffolding domain. The 15-mer library and bacterial strains were from Dr. George Smith (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO), whereas the decapeptide (10-mer) library was constructed as described elsewhere (32Schumacher T.N.M. Mayr L.M. Minor Jr., D.L. Milhollen M.A. Burgess M.W. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1854-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The GST-caveolin-1-(61-101) fusion protein was purified and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) as described previously (26Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The incubation was performed using 6 × 1010 transforming units of phage in presence of 50 μl of beads in TNET buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20) at 4°C under agitation for 16 h. Beads were then washed with 20 ml of TNET before acidic elution with 100 μl of 50 mM glycine, pH 2.2. The eluate was neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 M Tris, pH 10.0, and used to infect Escherichia coli K91-kan cells for amplification. Purified phage were prepared as described elsewhere (33Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Four rounds of selection were performed. Colonies from the last titering plate were picked to inoculate 2 ml of Luria broth/tetracycline medium. The culture was grown overnight, and phage DNA was prepared by polyethylene glycol precipitation of the culture supernatant, phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation (33Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The region corresponding to the selected peptide was sequenced using a Sequenase II kit from U.S. Biochemical Corp. An oligonucleotide specific for the fuse5 vector downstream of the cloning site was used for sequencing (5′-GCCTGTAGCATTCCACAGACAA-3′). We used 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) to perform all ELISAs. Phage from selected clones were prepared as described elsewhere (33Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Purified phage in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) were used for coating the plate, and the incubation proceeded at 4°C overnight. Plates were saturated for 1 h at room temperature with TBS/0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Purified His-tagged Myc full-length caveolin-1 (1 μg/well) (25Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) or GST-caveolin-1-(61-101) fusion protein (1 μg/well) (26Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) was then added in TBST to the well for 2 h and washed several times with TBST. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the Myc epitope (Harvard Monoclonal Antibody Facility, Cambridge, MA) (1:400) or GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000) in TBST were then added for 2 h at room temperature followed, after washes, by horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Corp.) (1:2000). The reaction was revealed using 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.-L. HermanoskiVosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar)] (Boehringer Mannheim), and absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 410 nm. The opposite assay was also performed, in which purified full-length caveolin-1-Myc-H7 (1 μg/well) or GST-caveolin-1-(61-101) fusion proteins (1 μg/well) were coated onto the wells in 100 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, and then incubated with phage. A biotinylated anti-fd polyclonal antibody (Sigma) (1:1000) was used in addition to horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (Zymed) (1:2000) and 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.-L. HermanoskiVosatka A. Tu Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar)]. For the ELISA using peptides, 500 pmol/well was used for coating the wells in bicarbonate coating buffer. Peptide synthesis was performed by the Biopolymers Facility at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA) and Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Using the bovine Gi2α cDNA (provided by Dr. Nukada) as a template, the polymerase chain reaction was performed to construct GST-Gi2α-full length (1-355), GST-Gi2α-B (120-238), and GST-Gi2α-C (239-355). The products were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pGEX-1λT vector; resulting constructions were subjected to restriction analysis and sequencing via the Sanger method. Purification of GST-Gi2α fusion proteins was essentially as described elsewhere (26Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 34Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). To assess the quality of the purification, the fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-GST IgG (1:1000) to visualize GST fusion proteins. For ELISAs, GST-Gi2α fusion proteins (∼200 ng/well) were added to peptide-coated wells, and binding was revealed using a monoclonal antibody directed against the GST moiety. To the caveolin-1-(82-101) peptide-coated well, a mixture of ∼120 ng of purified GST-Gi2α B fusion protein (∼3 pmol) and increasing amounts of competing peptide was added. The mixture was assembled just prior to addition to the well. The procedure following was as described above. We also used biotinylated peptides in several experiments, and binding was revealed using horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin (1:2000). We used a GST-caveolin fusion protein that contains the caveolin-scaffolding domain as a receptor to randomly select peptide ligands from two different phage display libraries (Fig. 1). This GST-caveolin fusion protein contains caveolin residues 61-101 and has been previously shown to be functionally sufficient to interact with G-protein α subunits (including Gi2α), c-Src, and Ha-Ras (26Li S.

After four rounds of selection, caveolin-binding phage clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis to reveal their peptide sequences, as shown in Table I. Caveolin binding clones from the 10-mer library were rich in tryptophan, and most exhibited a characteristic spacing conforming to the sequence WXWXXXXW. Random sequencing of the 10-mer library indicated that tryptophan was enriched ∼3-fold in caveolin-selected clones (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, caveolin binding clones from the 15-mer library did not exhibit any characteristic spacing but were also enriched in aromatic amino acids. More specifically, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine were enriched 3.8-, 1.5-, and 1.8-fold relative to the unselected library population (Fig. 2, B and C). Also, a single 15-mer clone (RNVPPIFNDVYWIAF) accounted for ∼60% of all clones.Table ISequence, occurrence, and aromatic residue content of peptide ligands selected using a GST fusion protein containing the caveolin-1-scaffolding domainSequence10-merSequence15-merOccurrenceW, F, or Y contentOccurrenceW, F, or Y 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 Open table in a new tab An ELISA was developed to evaluate the interaction of these peptide ligands with various regions of caveolin. Nine caveolin-derived peptides that correspond to regions of the cytoplasmic amino-terminal domain of caveolin were used to as receptors to capture these ligands (Fig. 3A). All phage clones tested only interacted with the peptide that corresponds to the caveolin-scaffolding domain (residues 82-101; Fig. 3A) and with recombinant full-length caveolin-1 purified from E. coli (not shown). The clones tested include the three most abundant clones from the 10- and 15-mer libraries (see Table I) and the clone containing the sequence VWEWAVSRFN. Identical results were obtained when a biotinylated peptide corresponding to the sequence of the most abundant 15-mer phage clone was tested. When the caveolin-scaffolding domain is divided into two halves (residues 84-92 and 93-101), we have previously shown that this inhibits its functional activity (26Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M.

Similarly, each of these halves was unable to interact with the caveolin-selected phage clones and their corresponding biotinylated peptides (Fig. 3B). Recent studies have shown that caveolin is the first member of a multigene family of related molecules (13Glenney J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar); caveolin has been retermed caveolin-1. Thus, we next tested the interaction of these caveolin-selected phage clones with the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1-3. Fig. 3B shows that these peptide ligands only interact with the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 but fail to interact with the homologous domain in caveolin-2. This suggests that the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2 has different protein sequence requirements for its interaction with other molecules and further demonstrates the selectivity of these interactions, as these peptide ligands were selected using the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1. By comparing the peptide ligands obtained for the caveolin-scaffolding domain with the protein sequences of a known class of caveolin-interacting proteins (G-protein α subunits), we deduced two possible caveolin-binding motifs: ΦXΦXXXXΦ and ΦXXXXΦXXΦ, where Φ is an aromatic residue (Trp, Phe, or Tyr). These two motifs correspond to the sequences of most 10-mer phage clones and the most abundant 15-mer clone, respectively. Fig. 4A shows that these two motifs are present in most G-protein α subunits in a composite manner (ΦXΦXXXXΦ+ΦXXXXΦXXΦ→ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ). To evaluate whether this region of G-protein α subunits can serve as a ligand for the caveolin-scaffolding domain, we constructed: (i) a synthetic peptide containing this G-protein region (THFTFKLDLHFKMFDV), termed GP; and (ii) a variety of GST-Gi2α fusion proteins, including full-length (FL) Gi2α and two deletion mutants, termed B and C (Fig. 4B). Note that the GP region is contained within two of these GST-Gi2α fusion proteins (FL and B). Fig. 5A shows that both the FL and B Gi2α fusion proteins interacted preferentially with the caveolin-scaffolding domain, but little or no interaction was observed with an adjacent region of caveolin (residues 53-81). Also, the B region of Gi2α was only recognized by the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 but not by the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2 (Fig. 5B). This binding profile is exactly what we observed previously for peptide ligands selected using the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (See Fig. 3B), suggesting a similar mode of interaction. Fig. 6A shows that the GP peptide interacts with the scaffolding domain of caveolins 1 and 3 and that this interaction is strictly dependent on the presence of aromatic residues within the GP peptide. When the phenylalanine residues of the GP peptide (THFTFKLDLHFKMFDV) were changed to either alanine or glycine (THATAKLDLHAKMADV and THGTGKLDLHGKMGDV), binding of these peptides to the caveolin-scaffolding domain was almost completely abolished. This is consistent with the idea that aromatic residues play a key role in recognition by the caveolin-scaffolding domain. Also, it is important to note that the GP peptide was only recognized by the scaffolding domain of caveolins 1 and 3 but not by the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2 (Fig. 6A). The GP peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of the B region of Gi2α to the caveolin-scaffolding domain, and this occurs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). In this regard, it is important to note that the B region contains the sequence that corresponds to the GP peptide. Virtually identical results were obtained using the peptide ligand selected from the 15-mer phage display library (RNVPPIFNDVYWIAF), indicating that this caveolin-selected peptide, the GP peptide, and Gi2α are all recognized by the caveolin-scaffolding domain in a similar fashion. Importantly, mutated GP peptides lacking phenylalanine failed to show any competition for binding. Fig. 7 shows that the GP peptide also recognizes the full-length intact caveolin-1 molecule (caveolin-1-Myc-H7). However, as predicted, the GP peptide was not recognized by full-length caveolin-2 (caveolin-2-Myc-H7) under identical conditions. These results provide an extraordinary demonstration of the specificity of this interaction given the close protein sequence homology between caveolins 1 and 2. Caveolin-2 is 58% similar and 38% identical to caveolin-1 (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). As the protein sequence encoded by the GP peptide appears to serve as a ligand for the caveolin-scaffolding domain, we identified the location of this sequence within the known three-dimensional structure of G-protein α subunits. The GP region lies directly between switch I and switch II regions and precisely defines the space between where switch I ends and switch II begins (Fig. 8). Interestingly, we have previously shown that a Gln → Leu mutation (located 5 amino acid residues downstream from the end of the GP region) prevents the interaction of Gsα with caveolin-1 (26Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This mutation also locks the G-protein α subunit in the GTP-liganded and -activated conformation. Two different approaches were used to define critical residues within the caveolin-1-scaffolding domain that are required for binding peptide ligands. First, deletion mutagenesis of the 82-101 region indicated that a minimal length of 16 amino acids is required (residues 86-101) (Fig. 9A). Second, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was then performed using this minimal caveolin-1-scaffolding domain. Our results indicate that a central core of four amino acids (92FTVT95) is strictly required for interaction of the caveolin-1-scaffolding domain with both the GP peptide and the corresponding region of Gi2α (Fig. 9B). This region is FTVS in caveolin-3 and FEIS in caveolin-2. Thus, this small difference may explain why these peptide ligands (library peptides and GP peptide) and protein ligands (GST-Gi2α fusion proteins) are recognized by the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3, but not by the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2 (as shown in Figs. 3B, 5B, and 6A). Here, we have identified peptide and protein ligands for the scaffolding domain of caveolin and characterized the sequence requirements of this reciprocal interaction. Several independent lines of evidence indicate that this interaction is extremely specific: (i) the identified peptide and protein ligands interacted only with the caveolin-scaffolding domain, but not with other regions of the caveolin protein; (ii) the interaction also occurred with the purified full-length caveolin molecule expressed as a polyhistidine-tagged protein; (iii) the interaction was sequence-specific; mutation of critical phenylalanine residues within the ligand prevented the binding of these ligands to the caveolin-scaffolding domain; also, mutation of certain critical residues within the caveolin-scaffolding domain abrogated the binding of peptide and protein ligands; and (iv) these peptide and protein ligands bound selectively to the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 but not to the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2. This is despite the fact that these domains within caveolins 1-3 are extremely homologous. Also, it is important to note that these ligands were identified using the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1, suggesting that other potential ligands may exist that selectively recognize the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2. These results are consistent with the previous observations that the scaffolding domains of caveolins 1 and 3 can both act as GDP dissociation inhibitors for heterotrimeric G-proteins, and both inhibit the autoactivation of Src family kinases (16Song K.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In contrast, the scaffolding domain of caveolin-2 exhibits GTPase-activating activity toward heterotrimeric G-proteins and fails to affect the activity of Src family kinases (27Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 29Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). What are the possible implications of these interactions? Other modular protein domains (such as Src homology 2 and 3, WW, and PID) have been previously defined and their corresponding peptide and protein ligands identified using techniques that are similar or identical to the ones used here for the caveolin-scaffolding domain. Src homology 2 domains and PID domains both recognize phosphotyrosine and 3 or 4 surrounding residues; Src homology 3 domains recognize proline-rich sequences, especially with the consensus PXXP; and the WW domain recognizes proline-rich sequences such as PPPY (see Prosite data base for specific references). Protein kinases also recognize short peptide sequences to direct phosphorylation of specific peptide and protein substrates: protein kinase A (R-R-X-[ST]); protein kinase C ([ST]-X-[RK]); casein kinase II ([ST]-X-(2)-[DE]); and tyrosine kinases ([RK]-X-(2,3)-[DE]-X-(2,3)-Y). This is also the case for other posttranslational modifications, including: N-glycosylation (N-X-[ST]); N-myristoylation (MG); dual acylation (MGC); and prenylation (C-aliphatic-aliphatic-X). Similarly, antibody binding depends on the recognition of specific epitopes that can be as small as 5-10 amino acids in length. Thus, many diverse cellular processes rely heavily on the recognition of short consensus peptide motifs. However, not all of these motifs are recognized, as this depends on whether a given motif is cytoplasmic or extracellular or is exposed on the surface of the protein; exposure on the surface of the protein may even be conformation-specific. Also, recognition may depend on the subcellular localization of the protein and the potential interacting partner, e.g. nuclear, cytoplasmic, plasma membrane, or Golgi-associated. These added criteria for interaction thus strictly modulate whether the interaction may or may not take place and greatly increase the specificity of these interactions. Of course, these same constraints would apply to the recognition of peptide and protein ligands by the caveolin-scaffolding domain. An increasing number of reports suggest that many different classes of molecules are concentrated within caveolin-rich membrane domains. Thus, we searched the protein sequences of known caveolin- or caveolae-associated proteins for aromatic-rich sequences that contain a specific spacing (ΦXΦXXXXΦ, ΦXXXXΦXXΦ, or ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ, where Φ = Trp, Phe, or Tyr), as defined here using the caveolin-scaffolding domain. Most molecules reported to be associated with caveolin or caveolae contain cytoplasmically accessible sequences that resemble those that we have defined here as peptide and protein ligands for the caveolin-scaffolding domain (summarized in Table II). Although it is not yet known whether all these molecules interact directly with caveolin, our studies provide a rational and systematic basis for investigating whether these protein sequences are indeed recognized as cytoplasmic ligands by the caveolin-scaffolding domain. This type of interaction could provide a simple mechanism for sequestration of a diverse group of molecules within caveolin-rich regions of the plasma membrane.Table II.A selection of known caveolin and/or caveolae-associated proteins containing a caveolin binding motifProteinaPKC, protein kinase C; HC, heavy chain; AR, adrenergic receptor; ETA, endothelin A; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor receptor; insulin-R, insulin receptor; PDGF-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; IP3, inositol triphosphate.1st residuebFirst residue of the motif in the protein sequence.Caveolin binding motif ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ sequenceRef.Cytoplasmic signaling moleculesGα subunitscThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.190FTFKDLHFKMF(5, 6, 7, 38)PKC-αc,The caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.dMore than one possible caveolin binding motif in the protein.656FSYVNPQF(6, 15)Src-like kinasesc,The caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.dMore than one possible caveolin binding motif in the protein.425WSFGILLY(5, 6, 10, 39)Endothelial NOScThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.347FPAAPFSGW(40, 41)MAP kinasecThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.124YIVGFYGAF(6)Actin-cytoskeleton relatedMyosin HCc,The caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.dMore than one possible caveolin binding motif in the protein.827WPWMKLYF(6)DystrophindMore than one possible caveolin binding motif in the protein.2108FHYDIKIFNQW(42)G-protein-coupled receptorsβ-ARcThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.359FVFFNWLGY(21)Endothelin R (ETA)146WPFDHNDFGVF(8)mAcRcThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.422WTIGYWLCY(18)Growth-factor receptorsEGF-R898WSYGVTVW(15)Insulin-R1220WSFGVVFW(43)PDGF-RcThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.887WSFGILLWEIF(44)ChannelsAquaporin-1cThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.210WIFWVGPF(45)IP3-sensitive Ca2+ channel2452YLFSIVGYLFF(46)OthersCaveolincThe caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.92FTVTKYWFY(12, 13)NSF138FSFNEKLF(38)Cholera toxin A138YGWYRVHF(18)subunita PKC, protein kinase C; HC, heavy chain; AR, adrenergic receptor; ETA, endothelin A; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor receptor; insulin-R, insulin receptor; PDGF-R, platelet-derived growth factor receptor; IP3, inositol triphosphate.b First residue of the motif in the protein sequence.c The caveolin binding motif is present in other members of the protein family.d More than one possible caveolin binding motif in the protein.

In fact, the best peptides tested for binding to BiP contain one Phe and three Trp, which suggests that they could also bind to caveolin. However, for BiP, no single peptide sequence was enriched over others. This is in contrast to the present situation, in which strong enrichments were observed for particular caveolin-selected peptide sequences. The apparent similarity between BiP and caveolin in this matter may suggest a potential role for caveolin as a chaperone. Although to our knowledge no chaperone described thus far is an integral membrane protein, caveolin could fulfill the role of a “membrane-bound chaperone” by interacting with signaling molecules and maintaining them in an inactive conformation.

Although the IGF-I mitogenic signaling pathway has been extensively studied in other cell types, little is known about the signaling pathway leading to differentiation in skeletal muscle. By using specific inhibitors of the IGF signal transduction pathway, we have begun to define the signaling intermediates mediating the two responses to IGFs. We found that PD098059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase activation, inhibited IGF-stimulated proliferation of L6A1 myoblasts and the events associated with it, such as phosphorylation of the MAP kinases and elevation of c-fos mRNA and cyclin D protein. Surprisingly, PD098059 caused a dramatic enhancement of differentiation, evident both at a morphological (fusion of myoblasts into myotubes) and biochemical level (elevation of myogenin and p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor expression, as well as creatine kinase activity). In sharp contrast, LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of the activation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k), completely abolished IGF stimulation of L6A1 differentiation. We found that p70S6k activity increased substantially during differentiation, and this increase was further enhanced by PD098059. Our results demonstrate that the MAP kinase pathway plays a primary role in the mitogenic response and is inhibitory to the myogenic response in L6A1 myoblasts, while activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/p70S6k pathway is essential for IGF-stimulated differentiation. Thus, it appears that signaling from the IGF-I receptor utilizes two distinct pathways leading either to proliferation or differentiation.

Recently, it has been shown that IGF actions occur through two phases (reviewed in Ref. 1Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 16: 481-517Google Scholar). This involves an initial mitogenic response in which intracellular mediators of proliferation such as cyclin D mRNA and c-fos mRNA are up-regulated and mediators of the myogenic response such as elevation of myogenin mRNA are suppressed (2Rosenthal S.M.

Although IGF binding has been shown for both IGF receptors, the type I IGF-I receptor and the type II IGF-II receptor, most biological actions of IGF-I and IGF-II on L6A1 muscle cells appear to be mediated by the type I IGF-I receptor (3Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. Florini J.R. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is not obvious how stimulation of two mutually exclusive processes such as proliferation and differentiation can be mediated by the same receptor. A likely possibility is that there is a step at which signal transduction pathways leading to proliferation or differentiation diverge. Although many of the signaling intermediates for the mitogenic actions of IGFs have been described for other cell types, little is known about signal transduction pathways leading to muscle differentiation. The results of studies on signaling by the insulin and IGF-I receptors in other cell types have revealed two primary pathways by which these signals might be transmitted. Binding of IGF-I to the type I receptor induces a conformational change resulting in receptor autophosphorylation, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular substrates. Two primary substrates of the activated IGF receptor are IRS-1 and Shc (4Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F.

A second pathway involving PI 3-kinases is also observed in insulin/IGF-I receptor signal transduction (4Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Cheatham B. Jachna B.R. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. White M.F.

Association of IRS-1 with p85/p110 PI 3-kinase results in its activation, leading to downstream phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine kinase p70S6k (14Dardevet D. Sornet C. Vary T. Grizard J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4087-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein and PHAS-I, resulting in an increased translation of mRNAs containing polypyrimidine tracts (15Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In addition, Weng et al. (16Weng Z.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have shown that constitutively active PI 3-kinase indirectly activates p70S6k, possibly through the kinase Akt (17Franke T.F.

However, p70S6k may also be activated through a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway, since mutation of the PDGF receptor has been shown to abolish PI 3-kinase activation in transfected 293 cells, while p70S6k activation remains unaffected (18Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, Lenormand et al. (19Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have recently shown that expression of an estradiol-regulated form of Raf-1 (ΔRaf-1:ER) results in p70S6k activation via a MAPK-independent pathway. Therefore, it appears that multiple signaling pathways lead to p70S6k activation. In order to evaluate the relative importance of the MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways in skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation, we have determined the effect of several inhibitors of these mediators on L6A1 myoblasts. PD098059 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of MEK that functions by blocking the activation of MEK by Raf-1 (20Dudley D. Pang L. Decker S. Bridges A. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). Its inhibitory effect on the MAP kinase pathway has been shown in several cell types including mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and PC-12 cells (21Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar) and has been shown to block insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (22Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). LY294002 is a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (23Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that has recently been reported to block differentiation in L6E9 myoblasts (24Kaliman P. Vinals F. Textar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19146-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant drug known to block progression of the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Rapamycin blocks activation of the serine/threonine kinase p70S6k (25Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), resulting in the dephosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein or PHAS-I, leading to a decrease in translation of specific, rapamycin-sensitive transcripts (15Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Through the use of these inhibitors we have separated the pathways involved in skeletal muscle proliferation and differentiation and have shown that they diverge at a very early point. Our studies demonstrate that the early stimulation of cell proliferation involves the Ras/Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway, and the later stimulation of differentiation utilizes the PI 3-kinase/p70S6k pathway.

The c-fos cDNA probe was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), and the myogenin cDNA probe (E26) was a gift from Eric N. Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The anti-cyclin D antibody, p70S6k assay kit, and recombinant protein A-agarose were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-MAPK antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Hybridoma cells secreting the anti-myogenin antibody were a gift from W. R.

Tissue culture medium components were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were from Sigma. L6A1 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% horse serum, 1% chick embryo extract, and 1% antibiotic, antimycotic solution (penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B). Cultures were plated at 1.2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish for cell number and creatine kinase (CK) determination and at 1.2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish for RNA extraction or immunoprecipitation of proteins. After incubation overnight, the cultures were washed with DMEM before the addition of IGFs or inhibitors in DMEM containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Stock solutions of inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO at the following concentrations and stored at −20°C: PD098059, 30 mM; LY294002, 10 mM; rapamycin, 1 mg/ml. To quantitate cell proliferation, cells were trypsinized and counted in a model ZBI Coulter Counter 1 day after the addition of growth factors and inhibitors. Differentiation was quantitated 3 days after the addition of growth factors and inhibitors by measuring the elevation in CK activity using the NAD-coupled microtiter assay (27Florini J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); CK levels were normalized to DNA content as described previously (28Ewton D.Z. Roof S.L. Magri K.A. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cultures using the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten-μg samples were analyzed on Northern blots. Consistency of RNA loading was monitored by visualization of ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal RNA bands. 32P-Labeled probe for c-fos mRNA was prepared by random priming of the 1-kilobase pair PstI restriction fragment, for myogenin the 1.1-kilobase pair BamHI/EcoRI restriction fragment, and for p21 the 420-base pair EcoRI restriction fragment. Blots were hybridized at 42°C and washed as described previously (29Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Roof S.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The autoradiographs and photographs were scanned with a Microtek Scanmaker II at 600 dots per inch using Adobe Photoshop software. Total cell lysates were prepared by washing the cell monolayers (100-mm dish) twice with ice-cold PBS followed by lysis in 0.5 ml of boiling 1 × Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mM dithiothreitol. Proteins (10 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following the procedures of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) and transferred onto Immobilon-nitrocellulose (Millipore Corp.) in transfer buffer containing 48 mM Tris base, 39 mM glycine, 0.037% SDS, and 20% methanol at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1 h using a SemiPhor Transfer Unit (Hoefer). The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies against cyclin D1 (1 μg/ml) or phospho-MAPK (1:1000) in 5% milk, PBST, or myogenin (1:50) in 1% milk, 10% goat serum, PBST. After washing six times in PBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:3000 in 5% milk, PBST (except myogenin, which was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:2000 dilution). The blots were washed six times in PBST at room temperature, and immunolabeling was detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's directions. The cell monolayers in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were lysed by incubating the cultures for 20 min in 1 ml of cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge to remove any insoluble material. The protein content of the supernatants was determined by the BCA method. p70S6k activities were assayed by following a modification of the manufacturer's protocols. After cell lysis in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, 200 μg of protein were incubated with 1 μg of anti-p70S6k antibody for 1 h at 4°C. The immunocomplex was captured with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (50% slurry) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed two times with an equal volume of cold PBS followed by one wash with assay dilution buffer. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of assay dilution buffer, 10 μl of substrate, 10 μl of inhibitor mixture, and 10 μl of [γ32P]ATP mixture (75 mM MgCl2, 500 μM ATP, 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 30°C and then centrifuged for 1 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the supernatants were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper squares and washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid, followed by one wash in acetone. The squares were transferred to scintillation vials and counted in a Beckman LS 7500 scintillation counter. The actions of IGF-I are modified by six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), three of which are secreted by L6A1 muscle cells and have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on proliferation and differentiation (Refs. 31Ewton D.Z. Florini J.R. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Brown A.L. Rechler M.M.

Z. Ewton, S. A. Coolican, S. Mohan, S. D. Chernausek, and J. R. Florini, manuscript in preparation. In order to minimize the actions of these IGFBPs in this study, we used an analog of IGF-I with a low affinity for IGFBPs, R3 IGF-I. We have previously reported that several similar IGF-I analogs with reduced affinity for IGFBPs were not only more potent than IGF-I in stimulating L6A1 myoblast proliferation and differentiation, but caused much more extensive myotube formation (31Ewton D.Z. Florini J.R. J. Endocrinol. 1995; 144: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The effects of adding increasing concentrations of R3 IGF-I on L6A1 cell proliferation and differentiation are shown in Fig. 1. Stimulation of proliferation after 1 day reached a maximum at approximately 30-100 ng/ml R3 IGF-I. Maximum stimulation of differentiation measured after 3 days was attained with 1-3 ng/ml of R3 IGF-I, while exposure to higher concentrations resulted in progressively lower CK levels accompanied by decreased fusion of myoblasts into myotubes as well as increased cell division; this biphasic response was also seen at higher concentrations of unmodified IGF-I (34Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Falen S.L. Van Wyk J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C771-C778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in subsequent studies, R3 IGF-I was used at low concentrations of 1-3 ng/ml in experiments monitoring inhibitor effects on differentiation and at higher concentrations of 10-30 ng/ml when we studied effects on proliferation. In order to determine which signaling pathways play a role in mediating R3 IGF-I-stimulated proliferation and differentiation, we used three compounds that have been reported to inhibit specific signaling molecules in other cells. PD098059 specifically inhibits the activation of MEK by Raf-1, thus suppressing MAP kinase activation (20Dudley D. Pang L. Decker S. Bridges A. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar). LY294002 is a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (23Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rapamycin treatment inhibits p70S6k (25Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). When these inhibitors were added in the presence of R3 IGF-I, we observed striking differences in the response of L6A1 myoblast cultures. Fig. 2 summarizes the concentration dependences of the effects of each of the three inhibitors on cell proliferation and differentiation when added in the presence of 3 ng/ml R3 IGF-I. As shown in Fig. 2, increasing concentrations of PD098059 gave progressive decreases in the mitogenic response to R3-IGF-I, inhibiting proliferation approximately 90% at concentrations of 30 μM, while the same levels of inhibitor showed a dramatic 3-fold enhancement of R3 IGF-I-stimulated differentiation quantitated as CK in units/mg of DNA. In sharp contrast, incubation with increasing concentrations of either LY294002 or rapamycin progressively inhibited the myogenic response to R3 IGF-I but had much less effect on the mitogenic response. At concentrations of 10 μM and 1 ng/ml, LY294002 and rapamycin, respectively, completely abolished R3 IGF-I-stimulated differentiation but inhibited cell proliferation only 30-40%. There were equally striking changes in cell morphology following treatment with these inhibitors. Upon the removal of growth medium, cells maintained in serum-free DMEM remained relatively quiescent, with little, if any cell division or fusion into myotubes (Fig. 3A). After the addition of R3 IGF-I to L6A1 cultures, the myoblasts first underwent a round of cell division before fusing into myotubes; after 2 days the cultures consisted of both unfused myoblasts and differentiated myotubes (Fig. 3B). However, when PD098059 was added in the presence of R3 IGF-I, there was less cell division, and the myoblasts began to differentiate sooner, forming an extensive network of myotubes; after 2 days in culture, few if any unfused myoblasts could be detected (Fig. 3C). In sharp contrast, differentiation was completely inhibited in cultures treated with either LY294002 or rapamycin in the presence of R3 IGF-I (Fig. 3, D and E). Myoblasts treated with these two inhibitors continued to proliferate, as demonstrated by the increased cell density when compared with those in DMEM, but they did not fuse into myotubes. These results (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) suggest that signaling by the MAP kinase pathway is required for R3 IGF-I-stimulated L6A1 proliferation, but not for differentiation, and that inhibition of this pathway by PD098059 permits, and even enhances, R3 IGF-I-stimulated L6A1 myoblast differentiation. In contrast, a functional PI 3-kinase/p70S6k pathway is an absolute requirement for IGF-stimulated differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, the inhibitors used here have dramatically opposite effects on responses of myoblasts to R3 IGF-I. This raises the question of which effect predominates when cells are incubated with combinations of these inhibitors. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, the results are unequivocal; the inhibitory effects of LY294002 and rapamycin overcome both the stimulation of myogenesis by R3 IGF-I and its enhancement by PD098059. Differentiation of myoblasts in response to R3 IGF-I is completely blocked by these inhibitors, both in the absence and presence of PD098059; morphological differentiation (i.e. fusion) of the cultures closely parallels the quantitation by CK levels presented in Fig. 4B Thus, it appears that the PI 3-kinase/p70S6k pathway is essential for myogenesis even when the mitogenic response through MAP kinase is blocked. The results presented in Fig. 4A indicate a major effect of the MAP kinase pathway and a smaller contribution of the PI 3-kinase/p70S6k pathway to the mitogenic response; there was much greater inhibition of proliferation by PD098059 than by either of the other inhibitors, but when added in combination with PD098059, there was an even lower level of cell proliferation; indeed, there was some loss of cells below the level found in DMEM controls. We usually measure proliferative responses of L6A1 myoblasts to mitogenic stimuli by counting the actual number of cells in the cultures 1 day after the specific treatment. In addition, we also determined the effects of these inhibitors on several intracellular mediators closely associated with early aspects of the proliferative response in other cell systems. Of these, c-fos mRNA is an established early marker for cell proliferation and has been shown to be induced during IGF-I-stimulated mitogenesis in L6 myoblasts (35Ong J. Yamashita S. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Giorgino F. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of PD098059, LY294002, and rapamycin on c-fos mRNA levels after 30 min as shown in Fig. 5A In the presence of R3 IGF-I, c-fos mRNA levels were enhanced about 3-fold above control levels. As expected, this increase in c-fos mRNA was significantly reduced in the presence of the MEK inhibitor, PD098059. In contrast, LY294002 and rapamycin, at concentrations that abolished myogenic differentiation, had little or no effect on c-fos mRNA levels compared with R3 IGF-I treatment alone. Both combinations of inhibitors resulted in decreased c-fos mRNA levels similar to those seen for PD098059 plus R3 IGF-I alone. The primary substrates of MEK are the p42/p44MAPK isoforms, ERK 2 and ERK 1, respectively (37Seger R. Krebs E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). PD098059 prevents the activation of MEK, thereby inhibiting phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinases. It has been postulated that the MAP kinases are required for activation of the G1 cyclin-dependent complexes (38Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Therefore, levels of phosphorylated MAP kinase were measured in cells incubated with PD098059, LY294002, and rapamycin, both individually and in combin"

In response to tissue injury, the HGF activator zymogen is converted to the active form by limited proteolysis. The activated HGF activator converts an inactive single chain precursor of HGF to a biologically active heterodimer in injured tissue. The activated HGF may be involved in the regeneration of the injured tissue. In this study, we purified an inhibitor of HGF activator from the conditioned medium of a human MKN45 stomach carcinoma cell line and molecularly cloned its cDNA. The sequence of the cDNA revealed that the inhibitor has two well defined Kunitz domains, suggesting that the inhibitor is a member of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors. The sequence also showed that the primary translation product of the inhibitor has a hydrophobic sequence at the COOH-terminal region. Inhibitory activity toward HGF activator was detected in the membrane fraction as well as in the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells. These results suggest that the inhibitor may be produced as a membrane-associated form and secreted by the producing cells as a proteolytically truncated form.

Cytotechnology. 1992; 8: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and from human serum (7Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the HGF activator cDNA revealed that HGF activator purified from serum is derived from the COOH-terminal half-region of a precursor protein and that the precursor has a similar overall domain organization to blood coagulation factor XII (7Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor protein circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen. The zymogen is activated by limited proteolysis by thrombin, and the NH2-terminal half region of the zymogen is removed by plasma kallikrein in vitro (11Shimomura T. Kondo J. Ochiai M. Naka D. Miyazawa K. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22927-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue injury often leads to local blood coagulation. When coagulation is initiated, thrombin and kallikrein are generated from pro-proteins. Activated thrombin and kallikrein may participate in the activation of the HGF activator zymogen and in the removal of the NH2-terminal half of the zymogen, respectively. The activation potential of HGF activator may be neutralized by the activity of an inhibitor(s). The activity of HGF activator is not inhibited by serum protease inhibitors such as antithrombin III, C1-inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin, and α1-proteinase inhibitor. Furthermore, HGF activator is active in serum (9Shimomura T. Miyazawa K. Komiyama Y. Hiraoka H. Naka D. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, serum protease inhibitors are not responsible for inhibiting the activity of HGF activator. It is likely that cells of tissues produce the inhibitor of HGF activator. We therefore searched human cell lines for the inhibitor and found that conditioned media from various cell lines contained the inhibitory activity for HGF activator. To characterize the molecule for the inhibitory activity, we purified the protein and cloned its cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA revealed that the inhibitor is a Kunitz-type of serine protease inhibitor. We designated this newly identified serine protease inhibitor as HGF activator inhibitor (HAI). The following cell lines were obtained from the indicated sources: human melanoma cell lines C32 and A375, human lung carcinoma cell line A549, human lung fibroblast cell line HLF, human hepatoma cell lines Hep G2 and PLC/PRF/5, and human colon carcinoma cell line CCL229 from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); human stomach carcinoma cell lines HSC-3 and MKN45 and human lung carcinoma cell lines PC-9 and PC-3 from IBL (Gunma, Japan); human lung carcinoma cell line HLC-1 and human stomach carcinoma cell line IG-1 from Department of Physiology, Keio University (Tokyo, Japan); immortalized cell line of human fetal liver NuE from Dr. N. Ishida (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). All cells were grown in eRDF medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. At confluence, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and further cultured in fresh serum-free medium for 4 days. The conditioned medium was harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration using a YM30 membrane (Amicon). The concentrates were assayed for inhibitory activity toward HGF activator. To prepare membrane extract, the cells (1 × 107 cells) were washed three times with Dulbecco's sodium phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by a cell scraper. The collected cells were suspended in 10 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), disrupted by sonication at 4°C, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4°C for 1 h. The pellet was suspended in 1.5 ml of PBS containing 1% Brij 58, sonicated, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4°C for 1 h. The resultant supernatant (membrane extract) was assayed for inhibitory activity toward HGF activator. Protein concentration in the conditioned medium and membrane extract was measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The single chain precursor of HGF and HGF activator was prepared as described (6Shimomura T. Ochiai M. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Cytotechnology. 1992; 8: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 μl of 900 ng/ml HGF activator and 40 μl of concentrated conditioned medium or membrane extract were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, 10 μl of 1.5 mg/ml single chain HGF was added as a substrate, and the mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The mixture was then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands were scanned using a Flying-Spot Scanner CS-9000 (Shimadzu). To purify HAI, MKN45 cells were cultured in roller bottles (850, Falcon). At confluence, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and further cultured in serum-free medium. After 3-6 days, the conditioned medium was harvested. Ten liters of medium was concentrated to about 300 ml by 30 K OMEGA membrane (FILTRON) and applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column (2.5 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with PBS. The pass-through fractions were collected and then applied to a ConA-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column (1 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with PBS. Proteins were eluted with PBS containing 200 mMα-methyl-D-mannoside. The eluates were concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged for 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 1 M ammonium sulfate, using a YM30 membrane. The concentrates were applied to a phenyl-5PW (TOSOH) column (0.75 × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 1 to 0 M. The HAI protein was eluted at 500-250 mM ammonium sulfate. The fraction was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% CHAPS and then applied to an anion exchange PL-SAX (Polymer Laboratories Ltd.) column (0.46 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl. The HAI protein was eluted with 50-200 mM NaCl and then dialyzed against 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 0.05% CHAPS. The dialysate was applied to a hydroxyapatite HCA A-4007 (Mitsui-touatu Chemical) column (0.4 × 7.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The pass-through fraction was collected and then gel-filtrated on an Ashahipak GS520 (Asahi Chemical Industries, Ltd.) column (0.76 × 50 cm) pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS. The HAI protein was collected at 50-30 kDa and finally purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a YMC pack C4 (YMC) column (0.46 × 15 cm). Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 10-50% acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (3:7) containing 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min for 30 min. The HAI fractions were neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), dried under a vacuum, and then dissolved in PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS. The preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver. The concentration of HAI in the sample was determined by the phenylthiocarbamyl method (12Stone K.L. Williams K.R. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 359: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The final preparation of the protein was hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid, and the resulting free amino acids were converted to phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives (phenylthiocarbamyl-amino acid) by phenyl isothiocyanate. Phenylthiocarbamylamino acids were separated by a YMC pack ODS-A column (0.46 × 15 cm), and the quantity of HAI in the sample was calculated. To determine the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified HAI, the protein that was eluted from the C4 column and dried was reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.6) containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 2 mM EDTA at 40°C for 2 h. The reduced protein was then carboxymethylated with monoiodoacetic acid at room temperature for 1 h, separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a C4 column, and sequenced using an Applied Biosystems 470A Protein Sequencer. To determine the internal amino acid sequence of HAI, the protein was digested with Achromobacter protease-I. The digested peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a YMC pack C8 column (0.46 × 15 cm) and sequenced. HGF activator (18 ng) or factor XIIa (38 ng) was mixed with various concentrations of HAI in 40 μl of PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Five microliters of 1.5 mg/ml single chain HGF in PBS containing 0.05% CHAPS and 5 μl of 100 μg/ml dextran sulfate (Mr cut-off, 500,000, Sigma) were added to the mixture and further incubated (2 h for HGF activator and 24 h for factor XIIa). The mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The amounts of single chain HGF and the heterodimeric form were measured by Flying-Spot Scanner. The inhibitory activity of HAI against each protease was estimated by calculating the ratio of the remaining single chain form to total HGF. Total RNA was prepared from MKN45 cells by acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), and poly(A) RNA was purified by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography. The primers, 5′-GGNGCNGAYTGYTTRAA-3′ and 5′-GGNGCNGAYTGYCTNAA-3′ (primer 1), 5′-GTRTCYAANACRAANCC-3′ and 5′-GTRTCNAGNACRAANCC-3′ (primer 2), 5′-CCNCCRTANACRAANGA-3′ and 5′-CCNCCRTANACRAARCT-3′ (primer 3), and 5′-CCCCAYAAYTCNACYTG-3′ and 5′-CCCCANAGYTCNACYTG-3′ (primer 4) (N = A, G, C, or T, Y = C or T, and R = A or G) were chemically synthesized. Using primers 1 and 2, and poly(A) RNA as a template, DNA fragments were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and a 56-bp fragment was generated. The DNA fragment was subcloned and sequenced. The primer, 5′-AACAGCTTTACCG-3′ (primer 5), which is part of the new sequence, was chemically synthesized. Using primers 3 and 5 and poly(A) RNA as a template, DNA fragments were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The products were further amplified using primers 4 and 5, and a 480-bp fragment was generated. Using the fragment as a probe, a human placenta cDNA library (Clontech) was screened to obtain full-length cDNA. Total RNA (10 μg) from MKN45 cells was denatured, electrophoresed (14Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar), and transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne). Human adult and fetal multiple tissue Northern blot membranes were purchased from Clontech. The membranes were hybridized at 42°C for 16 h with the 32P-labeled probe as described (15Miyazawa K. Kitamura A. Naka D. Kitamura N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed with 1 × SSC containing 1% SDS at 50°C. The hybridization probe was the 480-bp PCR fragment. We screened serum-free conditioned media from a variety of human cell lines for HGF activator-inhibitory activity. Six out of 14 conditioned medium samples contained significant inhibitory activity (Table I). Among them, five cell lines (three lung and two stomach carcinoma cell lines) produced high levels of the inhibitory activity. Thus, one (MKN45) of these cell lines was used for purification of a molecule with the inhibitory activity. An inhibitor (HAI) was purified from the serum-free conditioned medium of MKN45 by a seven-step procedure described under “Experimental Procedures”. Analysis of the purified protein by SDS-PAGE revealed two bands of 39 and 40 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1). When the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein was analyzed, only one sequence was obtained (Table II). Thus, the apparent heterogeneity of the purified protein on the gel may be caused by a difference in the COOH-terminal sequence or in glycosylation.Table I.Inhibition of HGF activator by conditioned medium from human cell linesCell lineOriginInhibitory activitya±, less than 10%; +, 10-50%, ++, more than 50%.C32Human melanoma−A375Human melanoma−PC-9Human lung carcinoma++PC-3Human lung carcinoma+A549Human lung carcinoma++HLC-1Human lung carcinoma++HLFHuman lung fibroblast±HSC-3Human stomach carcinoma++MKN45Human stomach carcinoma++IG-1Human stomach carcinoma±PLC/PRF5Human hepatoma±HepG2Human hepatoma±NuEImmortalized cells from human fetal liver±CCL229Human colon carcinoma±a ±, less than 10%; +, 10-50%, ++, more than 50%.

Six partial sequences were determined (Table II). None of the peptide sequences nor the NH2-terminal sequence matched those in the Swiss Prot or NBRF protein sequence data bases, indicating that HAI is a novel protein. Fig. 2 shows the dose-response curve of the inhibitory activity of HAI. In these reactions, HGF activator (450 ng/ml) was mixed with various concentrations of purified HAI and incubated for 30 min to form an enzyme-inhibitor complex. Then remaining HGF-converting activity in the mixture was measured. The concentration of HAI for 50% inhibition was about 250 ng/ml. Considering the molecular masses of HAI and HGF activator, HAI forms about an equimolar complex with HGF activator within 30 min. HGF activator is homologous to blood coagulation factor XIIa. Factor XIIa can activate single chain HGF in vitro, although the specific activity of factor XIIa is lower than that of HGF activator (9Shimomura T. Miyazawa K. Komiyama Y. Hiraoka H. Naka D. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether or not HAI inhibits the HGF-converting activity of factor XIIa and found that it did not, even when a 5-fold molar excess of HAI was incubated with factor XIIa (Fig. 2). Thus, HAI is specific for HGF activator in HGF-converting activity. Two hexapeptide sequences, Gly-Ala-Asp-Cys-Leu-Asn and Gly-Phe-Val-Leu-Asp-Thr in the NH2-terminal sequence (Table II), were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of the sequence for the NH2-terminal region. PCR amplification of MKN45 RNA resulted in a cDNA fragment with the expected size of about 56 bp. The cDNA fragment was subcloned and sequenced. The cDNA clone encoded 19 amino acids, including 7 amino acids in the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence between the two hexapeptide sequences used for the primer design. Thirteen nucleotides from the obtained sequence were used as a 5′ primer for further PCR amplification together with a sequence corresponding to the hexapeptide Ser-Phe-Val-Tyr-Gly-Gly in peptide 2 (Table II) as a 3′ primer. The PCR amplification products were further amplified using the 5′ primer and the sequence corresponding to the hexapeptide Gln-Val-Glu-Leu-Trp-Gly in peptide 5 (Table II) as a 3′ primer. The PCR amplification resulted in a cDNA fragment of about 480 bp. The cDNA fragment was subcloned and sequenced. The cDNA clone encoded 160 amino acids, including the sequences of peptides 1, 3, and 4 in Table II. Northern blotting using the PCR clone as a probe revealed that the human placenta produced significant amounts of mRNA of HAI. Thus, a cDNA library from the human placenta (Clontech) was screened using the PCR clone as a probe. Eighty-four hybridization-positive clones were obtained from about 4 × 105 phage. The largest clone was sequenced to determine the primary structure of human HAI. The determined nucleotide sequence of the cDNA is shown in Fig. 3. The amino acid sequence of HAI deduced from the cDNA sequence is also shown in Fig. 3. The translation initiation site was assigned to the first methionine codon because the sequence GCGG matches a favorable Kozak consensus sequence (16Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). This methionine is followed by a hydrophobic region (Fig. 4), and the NH2-terminal amino acid of the purified protein is located at 36th residue downstream of the methionine. Thus, the hydrophobic region may represent a signal peptide sequence. Because the reading frame is open upstream of the first methionine codon, it is possible that translation is initiated further upstream beyond the boundary of the cDNA sequence. The open reading frame that starts from the putative ATG codon consists of 513 amino acids, and the protein product has a calculated molecular mass of 56,893. Excluding the putative signal peptide, the mature form of the protein consists of 478 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 53,319. The apparent molecular mass of HAI purified from the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells was about 40 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Thus, the protein purified from the conditioned medium appears to be a processing product cleaved at the COOH-terminal region. A hydrophobic region of 23 amino acids is present in the COOH-terminal region (Fig. 4), suggesting that the primary translation product is a membrane-associated protein. There are three potential N-glycosylation sites with the canonical Asn-X- (Ser/Thr). A comparison of the predicted protein sequence of HAI with sequences in the Swiss Prot and NBRF protein data base revealed three regions with characteristic structural features. The two regions (residues 250-300 and 375-425) showed extensive similarity to the Kunitz-type sequence of serine protease inhibitors (Fig. 5A). Thus, HAI appears to be a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor. The other region (residues 319-353) located between the two Kunitz domains showed similarity to the ligand binding domain of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and related proteins (Fig. 5B). Other regions did not show clear-cut similarity to any protein sequences within the data base entries.Fig. 5Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Kunitz domains (A) and the LDL receptor-like domain (B) of HAI with human homologous protein sequences.

We therefore examined whether inhibitory activity toward HGF activator was detected in membrane fraction. Membrane extract and conditioned medium of MKN45 cells were prepared and assayed for the inhibitory activity. Protein concentration in the membrane extract and conditioned medium was 290 and 620 μg/ml, respectively. Significant activity was detected in the membrane extract (Fig. 6). Considering the protein concentration in each fraction, the activity in the membrane fraction was about 80% that in the conditioned medium. These results suggest that HAI may be produced as a membrane-associated form and is secreted as a proteolytically truncated form. We determined the size and tissue distribution of HAI mRNA by Northern blotting with poly(A) RNAs from various human tissues (Fig. 7). A major transcript of 2.5 kb was detected in MKN45 cells where we purified the HAI protein. In addition, a minor transcript of 5.6 kb was also detected in MKN45 cells. A transcript of 2.5 kb was detected in a variety of human adult and fetal tissues. Among them, the expression level of HAI mRNA was relatively high in the adult placenta, kidney, pancreas, prostate, and small intestine. It was also high in the fetal kidney. However, although the level was low in the adult lung, it was relatively high in the fetal lung. In this study, we found an inhibitory activity toward HGF activator in serum-free conditioned media of various human cell lines. We purified the inhibitor protein, HAI, from the conditioned medium of MKN45 stomach carcinoma cells. The purified HAI has a molecular mass of about 40 kDa. The primary structure of the protein was predicted from the sequence of the cDNA for human HAI. The structure of human HAI is schematically summarized in Fig. 8. The primary translation product consists of 513 amino acid residues. The NH2-terminal 35 residues may serve as a signal peptide. The mature protein appears to be membrane-bound, because a hydrophobic region of about 20 amino acids is present at the COOH-terminal region. HAI has two well defined Kunitz domains. The Kunitz domain is typically about 60 amino acids in length and contains three disulfide bonds. It was first recognized as the functional domain of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (17Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the domain was found in several mammalian serine protease inhibitors. Thus, one or both of the Kunitz domains found in HAI appear to be responsible for the inhibitory activity of the protein. The first and second Kunitz domains of human HAI show the highest homology (47% identity) to those of human β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and human APP homolog protein, respectively. APP is the precursor protein of amyloid β-protein which is present in neutritic plaque and cerebrovascular deposits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome (18Kang J. Lemaire H.-G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.-H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Müller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar). The Kunitz domain is located in the middle of APP (19Ponte P. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. Schilling J. Miller J. Hsu D. Greenberg B. Davis K. Wallace W. Lieberburg I. Fuller F. Cordell B. Nature. 1988; 331: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar–21Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Tokushima Y. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Nature. 1988; 331: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), and it efficiently functions as an inhibitor of several serine proteases (22Sinha S. Dovey H.F. Seubert P. Ward P.J. Blacher R.W. Blaber M. Bradshaw R.A. Arici M. Mobley W.C. Lieberburg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8983-8985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary translation product of APP has a hydrophobic sequence at the COOH-terminal region, and thus it appears to be a membrane-bound protein. Oltersdorf et al (23Oltersdorf T. Fritz L.C. Schenk D.B. Lieberburg I. Johnson-Wood K.L. Beattie E.C. Ward P.J. Blacher R.W. Dovey H.F. Shinha S. Nature. 1989; 341: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and Van Nostrand et al (24Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Suzuki M. Choi B.H. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1989; 341: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) reported that protease nexin II (PNII) is a secreted form of APP. PNII is a protease inhibitor that forms SDS-resistant inhibitory complexes with epidermal growth factor-binding protein, the γ-subunit of nerve growth factor, and trypsin. Smith et al (25Smith R.P. Higuchi D.A. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) reported that an inhibitor of coagulation factor XIa purified from the serum-free conditioned medium of HepG2 liver cells is also a secreted form of APP. Truncated forms of APP are derived from their cognate membrane-associated forms by proteolysis and have apparently lost the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane domains (26Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Thus, PNII and factor XIa inhibitor are proteolytically truncated forms of the transmembrane form of APP. HAI purified from the serum-free conditioned medium of MKN45 cells has a molecular mass of about 40 kDa, which is smaller than the predicted molecular mass (53,319) of the primary translation product, and thus it may lack the putative membrane-associated and cytoplasmic domains. Because the HGF activator-inhibitory activity was detected in the membrane fraction of MKN45 cells, it is likely that the primary translation product of HAI is a membrane-associated form. Thus, like PNII and factor XIa inhibitor, the secreted form of HAI appears to be a proteolytically truncated form of the membrane-associated form of HAI. HAI has two Kunitz domains interrupted by another domain. Two serine protease inhibitors with two or three Kunitz domains have been identified. Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (IαTI) found in mammalian plasma is a high molecular weight glycoprotein with two tandemly repeated Kunitz domains in the light chain, which is one of three polypeptide chains linked by a glycosaminoglycan (27Sailer J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which was also found in mammalian plasma, has three tandemly repeated Kunitz domains (28Wun T.-C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Bronze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFPI inhibits activated factor X(Xa) directly and, in a Xa-dependent manner, inhibits VII(a)/tissue factor activity by forming a quaternary Xa·TFPI·VII(a)·tissue factor complex. The Kunitz domains in these inhibitors are not interrupted by another domain. Trypsin and chymotrypsin form equimolar complexes with IαTI. Furthermore, a protease inhibitor, which consists of only the second Kunitz domain of the light chain of IαTI (29Itoh H. Ide H. Ishikawa N. Nawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3818-3822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been identified from mast cells (30Kido H. Yokogoshi Y. Katunuma N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18104-18107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor, named trypstatin, markedly inhibits factor Xa and tryptase and also inhibits trypsin and chymase. Thus, the second Kunitz domain in the light chain of IαTI is required for the inhibition of serine proteases, whereas the first domain does not seem to be required for this function. Site-directed mutagenesis of TFPI has revealed that the second Kunitz domain is required for the efficient binding and inhibition of Xa, that both Kunitz domains 1 and 2 are required for the inhibition of VIIa/tissue factor activity, but that the third Kunitz domain does not seem to be required for these functions (31Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The dose-response curve of the HAI activity showed that HAI purified from the conditioned medium seems to form an equimolar complex with HGF activator. Furthermore, the proteolytic cleavage to produce the extracellular truncated form of HAI appears to occur within the second Kunitz domain, because the size (about 40 kDa) of the protein implies that it consists of about 360 amino acids. Thus, the first Kunitz domain in HAI may be sufficient for it to exert activity. The other characteristic structural domain in HAI is located between the two Kunitz domains. It consists of about 40 amino acid residues and bears a close resemblance to the “cysteine domain” repeat of the LDL receptor and related proteins. The LDL receptor has seven repeats of the domain (32Südhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Science. 1985; 228: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Each repeat has six cysteine residues, all of which are involved in disulfide bonds, and in addition it has several negatively charged amino acid residues at the COOH-terminal region. The clustering of cysteine residues in the domain of HAI is similar to that in the repeat of the LDL receptor. Furthermore, the domain of HAI has 8 negatively charged but only 2 positively charged amino acid residues. The negatively charged domain in the LDL receptor is believed to be the binding site for its positively charged apoprotein ligand (32Südhof T.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Russell D.W. Science. 1985; 228: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Although the significance of the negatively charged domain in HAI remains to be established, it may be involved in formation of the inhibitor-enzyme complex, because HGF activator shows high affinity to negatively charged substances. HGF activator is produced mainly in the liver, and it normally circulates in the blood as an inactive zymogen. In response to tissue injury, the zymogen is activated by proteolytic processing exclusively in the injured tissue (10Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The activated HGF activator acquires strong affinity for heparin, which may ensure the localization of the enzyme in injured tissue (10Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This localized HGF activator activates single chain HGF that is also associated with a heparin-like molecule on the cell surface. Thus, the activity of HGF activator may be regulated by tissue-derived inhibitors. Because human HAI mRNA is expressed in various tissues, the HAI protein produced by cells of these tissues may be responsible for inhibiting HGF activator. However, HAI mRNA expression is low in some tissues, including the liver and lung. HGF is thought to play a crucial role in repair of liver and lung following injury (1Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Naka D. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8966-8970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yanagita K. Matsumoto K. Sekiguchi K. Ishibashi H. Niho Y. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21212-21217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these tissues, production of HAI could be induced during tissue repair. Alternatively, another inhibitor(s) may function in these tissues. Characterizations of these inhibitors in injured tissues are needed to understand mechanisms for regulating the activation of HGF."

Adenovirus vectors and nonviral vectors each have specific advantages, but they also have limitations. Adenovirus vectors efficiently escape from the endosome and enter the nucleus, but the virus shows limited binding to airway epithelia. Nonviral cationic vectors bind efficiently to the negatively charged cell surface, but they do not catalyze subsequent steps in gene transfer. To take advantage of the unique features of the two different vector systems, we noncovalently complexed cationic molecules with recombinant adenovirus encoding a transgene. Complexes of cationic polymers and cationic lipids with adenovirus increased adenovirus uptake and transgene expression in cells that were inefficiently infected by adenovirus alone. Infection by both complexes was independent of adenovirus fiber and its receptor and occurred via a different cellular pathway than adenovirus alone. Complexes of cationic molecules and adenovirus also enhanced gene transfer to differentiated human airway epithelia in vitro and to the nasal epithelium of cystic fibrosis mice in vivo These data show that complexes of adenovirus and cationic molecules increase the efficiency of gene transfer, which may enhance the development of gene therapy.

Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L45-L51PubMed Google Scholar). The two systems have different limitations and advantages. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to airway epithelia is suboptimal because binding to the apical surface of the epithelium is limited, perhaps because the apical surface does not express the fiber receptor that mediates viral attachment (7Grubb B.R.

Welsh, unpublished data. Limited infection in vitro and in vivo could be partially overcome when the contact time between the virus and the apical surface was increased, even with a relatively low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) (8Zabner J. Zeiher B.G. Friedman E. Welsh M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6994-7003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that if adenovirus binding or entry into the cell could be increased, then adenovirus-dependent processes subsequent to binding and entry would remain intact and would facilitate gene transfer. These functions, which include entry of virus into the cell, release of DNA from the vector, entry into the nucleus, and transcription, are influenced by specific adenovirus proteins (11Horwitz M.S. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Chanock R.M. Hirsch M.S. Melnick J.L. Monath J.P. Roizman S.D. Virology. Raven Press, New York1990: 1679-1721Google Scholar).

Cationic molecules, including cationic lipids complexed with DNA, bind to the cell surface, and they are often taken up into the cell. However, release of DNA from the endosome, entry into the nucleus, release of DNA from the cationic molecules, and transcription of the DNA are not specifically enhanced by the vectors and thus remain as partial barriers that limit the efficiency of transgene expression (9Zabner J.

In most cases, adenovirus has been incorporated into gene delivery systems to take advantage of its endosomolytic properties. These studies have involved either covalent attachment of the adenovirus to a gene delivery complex or co-internalization of unbound adenovirus with cationic lipid-DNA complexes. In these formulations, the transferred gene is contained in plasmid DNA that is exogenous to the adenovirus. However, such formulations do not take advantage of adenovirus-dependent functions other than endosome disruption, and as a result, large amounts of adenovirus are required, and the increase in gene transfer has often been modest. We reasoned that the efficiency of gene transfer would be improved if we could combine a nonviral vector system, which could mediate cell attachment, with an adenovirus vector system, which could mediate processes in gene transfer subsequent to binding. We thought that such a hybrid system might take advantage of the unique features associated with the two individual vector systems. We initially attempted to covalently link recombinant adenovirus to various ligands in order to increase vector binding and gene transfer. However, such attempts often reduced gene expression from the adenovirus vector, probably because chemical modification of viral proteins interfered with their functions in effecting gene transfer and expression (19Ogier G. Michal Y. Thomas V. Quash G. Rodwell J.D. Arch. Virol. 1994; 135: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).2 In the work described here, we tested the hypothesis that efficiency could be improved by using a noncovalent complex consisting of a cationic component and a recombinant adenovirus that contained the cDNA to be expressed. We postulated that a cationic component would charge-associate with adenovirus particles, which carry a net negative surface charge, and would facilitate attachment to the negatively charged cell membrane. We also postulated that if we could increase binding to the cell membrane, more adenovirus would be internalized, enhancing gene transfer and expression. To test this hypothesis and to examine the process, we used several cell systems in which the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer varies. We then tested the gene transfer method on normal and CF airway epithelia in vitro and in vivo COS-1, NIH-3T3, and 9L gliosarcoma (20Weizsaecker M. Deen D.F. Rosenblum M.L. Hoshino T. Gutin P.H.

For some studies, adenovirus was labeled by production in 293 cells in methionine-free medium containing 1 mCi/100 μl [35S]methionine (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Fiber protein was a gift of Dr. Paul Freimuth (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY). Various size poly-L-lysine (PLL) hydrobromide polymers were purchased from Sigma. Poly-L-lysine with an average molecular mass of 55.8 kDa (corresponding to ∼250 lysine residues) was used in all experiments unless otherwise noted. Polyethyleneimine (average Mr = 25,000) was purchased from Aldrich. Histone (fraction V-S) and spermine were purchased from Sigma. Lipofectin, Lipofectace, and Lipofectamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. DEAE-dextran, Tfx-50, and dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The lipids GL-67, GL-53, and [N-(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol) were gifts from Drs. Seng Cheng and David Harris (Genzyme Corp.). In some cases, these were formulated in a 1:2 molar ratio of GL-67 to dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), a 1:1 molar ratio of GL-53 to DOPE, or a 1:2 molar ratio of DC-Chol to DOPE. DOPE was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). DMRIE/DOPE at a 1:1 molar ratio and βAE-DMRIE were gifts from Dr. Phil Felgner (Vical Inc., San Diego, CA). Fluorescently labeled PLL was produced by stirring 2 mg of PLL with 400 μl of Fluorolink Cy3 (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, for 30-60 min with protection from light. Cy3-labeled PLL was purified on a PD-10 Sephadex G-25M desalting column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala) eluted with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Recombinant adenovirus was prepared by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core at titers of ∼1 × 1010 IU/ml. Complexes between cationic components and adenovirus particles were formed by prediluting the cationic component and the adenovirus components in Eagle's MEM in 12 × 75-mm polystyrene tubes (Fisher). Ratios of cationic molecules to adenovirus particles and volumes of the dilutions are described in the figure legends. The cationic component dilution was added to the viral particle dilution, mixed by inversion or gentle pipette tip aspiration, and allowed to incubate for 15-30 min at room temperature before application to cells or tissue. We describe cationic molecule-adenovirus complexes based on the calculated average number of cationic molecules/adenovirus particle. The ratio of adenovirus particles to infectious units varied from 50 to 150. Cultured cells were infected 18-24 h after seeding when the cells were ∼70% confluent unless otherwise noted. Airway epithelial cells were allowed to mature in culture for at least 10-14 days before use so that they developed a ciliated apical surface that resembles the in vivo airway surface (8Zabner J.

The medium was replaced with 500 μl of Eagle's MEM containing 1.1 × 109 particles of adenovirus complexed with cationic component at the indicated ratios of cationic molecules to particles. The cells were incubated for 15 min to 6 h (times indicated in the figure legends) in a 5% CO2 humidified environment at 37°C, the infection solution was removed, and fresh serum-containing medium was added. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h unless otherwise specified. In experiments where uptake of 35S-labeled adenovirus was assessed, cells were harvested for the measurement of cell-associated radiolabeled virus at the end of the infection period, while paired groups of cells were incubated for an additional 20-24 h (unless otherwise noted) and harvested for assessment of gene expression. Human airway epithelial cells were infected as described in the figure legends. Ad2/CFTR-8 was applied to the nasal epithelium of unanesthetized ΔF/ΔF mice (25Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J.

The transepithelial electric potential difference (Vt) across the nasal epithelium was measured using techniques similar to those we previously described (25Zeiher B.G. Eichwald E. Zabner J.

During measurement of Vt, the nasal mucosa was perfused at a rate of 50 μl/min with a Ringer's solution containing 135 mM NaCl, 2.4 mM KH2PO2, 0.6 mM K2HPO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Three solutions were used: (a) Ringer's solution alone; (b) Ringer's solution containing 100 μM amiloride (Merck); or (c) Ringer's solution containing 135 mM sodium gluconate (substituted for NaCl), 10 μM terbutaline, and 100 μM amiloride. Measurements were made after perfusion for 5 min. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed using a Galacto-Lite kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) and a luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Cells were removed from dishes or millicell filters by incubation with 120 μl of lysis buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) for 15 min, followed by scraping. A 4-μl aliquot from each 24-well plate or millicell was used for each Galacto-Lite assay. Protein was measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Data for β-galactosidase activity represent total values from all cells in one well or from one millicell. All conditions were performed in triplicate on at least two different occasions. For X-gal staining, cells were washed 24 h after infection, fixed with 1.8% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde, and then incubated for 16 h in X-gal solution as described previously. Blue staining of nuclei was evaluated by light microscopy. For anti-hexon staining, airway epithelia cultured on permeable filter supports were studied 30 h after infection. They were fixed with acetone/methanol and stained with a polyclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-hexon antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Hexon-positive cells were counted using low magnification fluorescence photomicrographs of the monolayers. This method allows for detection of infected cells by staining for the most abundant adenovirus protein, hexon, conferring better sensitivity than with reporter genes such as β-galactosidase. To evaluate cell-associated 35S-labeled adenovirus, cells were harvested at the end of the infection period. The dishes or millicells were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; then lysis buffer was applied, the dishes were scraped, and the cell lysate was counted in a RACK BETA Model 1209 liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). To evaluate transepithelial electrolyte transport by human airway epithelia, epithelia were mounted in modified Ussing chambers as described previously (26Zabner J. Wadsworth S.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 458-465PubMed Google Scholar). Short-circuit current was measured under base-line conditions and after addition of amiloride (10 μM) and cAMP agonists (10 μM forskolin and 100 μM isobutylmethylxanthine). Cells were seeded on 8-well slides 18-24 h before the experiment. The medium was removed and replaced with 200 μl of Eagle's MEM supplemented with 5 ng/μl Cy3-labeled PLL. After a 10-min incubation at 37°C, the solution was removed, and the cells were washed twice with Eagle's MEM and examined by a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope for cell-associated fluorescence. Complexes of PLL and adenovirus were formed as follows. Adenovirus particles (9 × 109) were prediluted in 50 μl of Eagle's MEM and combined with 0, 4, 250, or 10,000 PLL molecules/particle (0, 3.3, 208, or 8320 ng, respectively) also in 50 μl of Eagle's MEM. The PLL dilution was added to the virus dilution and mixed by gentle pipette tip aspiration. Complexes of cationic lipids with adenovirus particles were formed in a similar fashion. PLL-adenovirus and cationic lipid-adenovirus complexes were processed for transmission electron microscopy using a negative stain technique. Fifteen-μl drops of freshly prepared samples were placed on glow-discharged collodion/carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids for 3 min. The solution was wicked off with filter paper and replaced with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s. After removal of this solution, grids were allowed to dry and imaged in a Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope. To evaluate the interaction of adenovirus complexes with cells, complexes of PLL or Lipofectamine with adenovirus were formed as follows. Adenovirus particles (1.5 × 1011) were prediluted in 150 μl of Eagle's MEM and combined with 250 PLL molecules/particle (3460 ng of PLL) or 68,150 DOSPA molecules/particle (equivalent to 33 μg of Lipofectamine), also prediluted in 150 μl of Eagle's MEM. The cationic component was added to the virus dilution and mixed by gentle pipette tip aspiration. To follow the cellular entry of cationic molecule-adenovirus complexes, 9L gliosarcoma cells were infected for 15 min at 37°C, and then the cells were washed and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and processed using standard electron microscopic procedures. Briefly, the samples were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide followed by 2.5% aqueous uranyl acetate and then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol washes. Thin sections (70 nm) of the Eponate 12-embedded specimen were placed on 135-mesh hexagonal copper grids and post-stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate. As a starting point, we studied cells that varied in the efficiency of infection by adenovirus. Fig. 1A shows that application of Ad5RSVLacZ to COS-1 and HeLa cells generated high levels of β-galactosidase expression. In contrast, an identical experiment in NIH-3T3 and 9L gliosarcoma cells yielded much lower expression levels (Fig. 1A). Decreased expression was not likely due to cell type-specific effects on the Rous sarcoma virus promoter because we found similar effects when we used Ad2/βGal-2, which contains the cytomegalovirus promoter driving β-galactosidase expression (data not shown). We tested the hypothesis that decreased expression in some cells was due to decreased binding of adenovirus. We applied 35S-labeled virus to cells; after 90 min, we removed the labeled vector, rinsed the surface four times with phosphate-buffered saline, and measured cell-associated radioactivity. Fig. 1 shows that there was a correlation between the amount of adenovirus bound to the different cell types (Fig. 1B) and the level of expression (Fig. 1A); there was substantial binding to COS-1 and HeLa cells, which showed high levels of transgene expression, whereas there was little binding to NIH-3T3 and 9L gliosarcoma cells, which showed much less transgene expression. These data suggest that low levels of expression in some cells may be due to limited vector binding. Because both the cell and the adenovirus have a net negative surface charge, we postulated that a cationic molecule might facilitate association of the vector with the cell. To learn whether a cationic molecule would bind to the cell surface, we applied Cy3-labeled PLL to different cell types. Fig. 2 shows Cy3-labeled PLL bound to the surface of the COS-1, HeLa, NIH-3T3, and 9L gliosarcoma cell lines. The surface of nearly every cell was fluorescently labeled in all cell types. Therefore, we prepared PLL·Ad complexes and measured vector binding and transgene expression in the different cell lines. When we applied the PLL·Ad complex to NIH-3T3 and 9L gliosarcoma cells, both adenovirus binding (Fig. 1B) and transgene expression (Fig. 1A) increased to the same range as we had observed with adenovirus alone in COS-1 and HeLa cells. In contrast, complexing PLL with adenovirus had only small effects on binding and expression in COS-1 and HeLa cells. Fig. 3 shows photomicrographs of cells stained with X-gal after application of Ad2/βGal-2. PLL·Ad not only increased total β-galactosidase activity in NIH-3T3 and 9L gliosarcoma cells, but also increased the number of cells expressing the transgene. Complexes of PLL·Ad also increased expression in primary cell cultures. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which are poorly infected by adenovirus alone, PLL·Ad increased expression 63 ± 3-fold (n = 3). In contrast, in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, which are readily infected by adenovirus, PLL·Ad produced little enhancement (PLL·Ad was 1.1 ± 0.1 the level of expression with adenovirus alone (n = 3)). Encouraged by the results with PLL, we asked whether other cationic polymers would enhance gene transfer. We tested polyethyleneimine, DEAE-dextran, and histone (fraction V-S) and found that all facilitated gene transfer to poorly infected cell types (Fig. 4). As expected, with each polymer, the optimal cationic molecule/adenovirus particle ratio varied, producing data similar to those shown below in Fig. 5. However, not all cationic molecules were effective; spermine (a low molecular mass polyamine with a potential +4 net charge) failed to enhance expression in 9L gl"
https://openalex.org/W2022246579,"We have identified a gene product (NKT) encoding an apparently novel transcript that appears to be related to the organic ion transporter family and is expressed almost exclusively in the kidney. Analysis of the deduced 546-amino acid protein sequence indicates that NKT is a unique gene product which shares a similar transmembrane domain hydropathy profile as well as transporter-specific amino acid motifs with a variety of bacterial and mammalian nutrient transporters. Nevertheless, the overall homology of NKT to two recently cloned organic ion transport proteins (NLT and OCT-1) is significantly greater; together these three gene products may represent a new subgroup of transporters. The NKT was characterized further with respect to its tissue distribution and its expression during kidney development. A 2.5-kilobase transcript was found in kidney and at much lower levels in brain, but not in a number of other tissues. Studies on the embryonic kidney indicate that the NKT transcript is developmentally regulated with significant expression beginning at mouse gestational day 18 and rising just before birth, consistent with a role in differentiated kidney function. Moreover, in situ hybridization detected specific signals in mouse renal proximal tubules. NKT was mapped by linkage disequilibrium to mouse chromosome 19, the same site to which several mouse mutations localize, including that for osteochondrodystrophy (ocd). Although initial experiments in a Xenopus oocyte expression system failed to demonstrate transport of known substrates for OCT-1, the homology to OCT-1 and other transporters, along with the proximal tubule localization, raise the possibility that this gene may play a role in organic solute transport or drug elimination by the kidney.

INTRODUCTIONThe proximal tubule of the kidney is a major site of transport of small organic molecules, including glucose, amino acids, and uric acid. The proximal tubule also plays a key role in drug elimination by the kidney. Xenobiotics and their metabolites are transported mainly by the organic anion and organic cation transport systems. These two transport systems share common substrates, and many functional features (2Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that these transport systems may also resemble each other at the molecular level.A complementary DNA from rat kidney (OCT-1), which has the functional characteristics of organic cation uptake in the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubules has been recently isolated (8Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). At the present time, only one nucleotide sequence (NLT) with significant homology to OCT-1 has been reported (9Simonson G.D. Vincent A.C. Roberg K.J. Huang Y. Iwanij V. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1065-1072PubMed Google Scholar). NLT is a transporter protein of unknown substrate(s) present in the sinusoidal (basolateral) domain of hepatocytes. Increased expression of NLT at the time of birth correlates with the maturation of enterohepatic circulation. NLT is also present in the kidney although at a lower level than in liver. Organic anions, such as bilirubin and bromosulfophthalein, have been postulated as potential substrates for NLT, although this remains to be determined.We report here the cloning and the molecular characterization of a transcript encoding a novel protein (NKT) apparently related to the recently identified OCT-1 and NLT. The gene product is almost exclusively expressed in kidney.DISCUSSIONRenal tubular cells are responsible for the reabsorption and secretion of numerous substrates. These cells are highly polarized with unique species of transporters localized to either the basolateral or the apical domains of their plasma membranes. Using a new approach to selectively represent mammalian protein-coding regions (1López-Nieto C.E. Nigam S.K. Nature Biotech. 1996; 14: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we have identified a novel transport protein which, by Northern analysis, is almost exclusively expressed in the kidney.The sequence analyses of NKT suggest that it belongs to a recently identified subgroup of transport proteins. One member of this subgroup (OCT-1) has been shown to translocate hydrophobic and hydrophilic organic cations of different structures over the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubules and hepatocytes (8Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). OCT-1 is currently considered a new prototype of polyspecific transporters likely to be important in drug elimination, although presently little is known of its specific role in various tissues. Xenobiotics and their metabolites are transported mainly by the organic anion (PAH) and organic cation transport systems, and there exist substrates that interact with both the transporter for organic anions and that for organic cations (2Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 280-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. David C. Fritzsch G. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 425: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Neither transporter appears to detect the degree of ionization in bulk solution, and they also accept nonionizable substrates (4Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 421: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since these two transport systems (cationic and anionic) share so many common functional features, it is possible that they may also resemble each other at the molecular level. Functional expression of renal organic anion transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with rat kidney poly(A)+ RNA has shown that the active species with respect to PAH transport was in the range of 1.8 to 3.5 kb (24Wolff N.A. Philpot R.M. Miller A.S. Pritchard J.B. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 114: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The size of NKT (2.5 kb) is within this range. Deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that four cysteine residues are conserved among NKT, NLT, and OCT-1. Previous studies of the effect of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an irreversible sulfhydryl modifying reagent, on the transport of organic cations in the renal basolateral membrane imply that inactivation involves the binding of at least four molecules of N-ethylmaleimide per active transport unit. This is most consistent with the presence of four sulfhydryl groups at this site. The capability of organic cations to alter the susceptibility to sulfhydryl modification suggests that these groups may have a dynamic role in the transport process (25Zimmerman W.B. Byun E. McKinney T.D. Sokol P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5459-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these and other reasons already discussed, NKT was considered to be a strong candidate for the important task of drug elimination by the kidney, a major function of the organ.PAH and TEA are the prototype substrates of organic cation and organic anion transporters. Therefore, we tested these possibilities by measuring the uptake of the radiolabeled PAH, TEA as well as cimetidine into Xenopus oocytes. However, under the conditions we employed (including measurements in the presence of α-ketoglutarate (30Danzler W.H. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 663-672PubMed Google Scholar)), we were unable to show any transport activity. At present it is unclear whether this negative result was due to suboptimal conditions for NKT transport (despite robust transport in the positive control), poor expression or insertion of an inactive (incompletely processed) transporter protein, or because NKT might transport other substrates than those we have examined so far. Expression of NKT protein in other mammalian cells such as COS-7 cells may be required to answer these questions.Assuming NKT is a transporter, the forementioned data raises the possibility that it may have significantly different substrates from OCT-1. The low overall homology of the NKT sequence to the hexose transporters argues against its participation in sugar transport. When considering possible substrates for NKT, it is of importance to keep in mind that the expression of NKT appears to be kidney-specific, or at least relatively so. Both NLT and OCT-1 are located within the basolateral membrane. Other less closely related members of the family of nutrient transport proteins (e.g. SV2) are expressed in intracellular organelles or the membrane of synaptosomes rather than the plasma membrane (26Bajjalieh S.M. Peterson K. Shinghal R. Sheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1271-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The subcellular location of NKT awaits the development of antibodies to carry out indirect immunofluorescent detection of the protein in kidney sections. In situ hybridization in mouse kidney showed that NKT is expressed in proximal tubules, but not in distal tubules, collecting ducts, or glomeruli (a pattern similar to that observed for OCT1). Confirmatory evidence for proximal tubular distribution was also obtained by Northern blot analysis with positive signals obtained in cortex and outer stripe, but not inner stripe and inner medulla. But unlike OCT-1 and NLT, transcripts were also detected in brain (mouse but not human), while no signal was found in liver (NLT and OCT-1) or small intestine (OCT-1). Of special interest is that NKT is expressed preferentially in the kidney and that its expression is developmentally regulated. The NKT transcripts appear shortly before birth. Studies of gene expression during kidney development have shown that genes appearing late in kidney development or at birth represent markers for highly differentiated kidney tubular cells, and these markers are often lost during neoplastic transformation. Therefore, NKT cDNA in addition to being related to organic ion transporters represents a new molecular marker for the terminally differentiated nephron.SSCP analysis was used to localize NKT to mouse chromosome 19, tightly linked to D19Mit32. The human homologs of genes in this region such as Gstp1 and Adrbk1 map to 11q13 (27Rochelle J.M. Watson M.L. Oakey R.J. Seldin M.F. Genomics. 1992; 14: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since subchromosomal linkage relationships are conserved in many cases between mouse and man, this result suggests that the human homolog of NKT will be found in this region. A number of interesting mouse mutations have been mapped to the proximal portion of chromosome 19, including several that affect neurological function or development (neuromuscular degeneration (nmd), muscle deficient (mdf), Dancer (Dc), deafness (dn)) or bone development (osteochondrodystrophy (ocd), osteosclerosis (oc)). Whether NKT plays a role in these murine mutations awaits further analyses.

Several proteins that regulate cellular homeostasis and function, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, the 70-kDa subunit of the U1 small ribonucleoprotein, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, and the Huntington's disease gene product (huntingtin), are thought to be target substrates for activated CPP32 (8Nicholson D.W.

Thus, activation of CED3/ICE proteases, including CPP32, within pre-apoptotic cells is thought to lead to the proteolytic inactivation of proteins that are necessary for cell viability. In support of this hypothesis, CED3/ICE protease inhibitors have been shown to block cell death in several model systems (3Gagliardini V. Fernandez P.-A. Lee R.K.K. Drexier H.C.A. Rotello R.J.

The CED3/ICE family can be divided into two subfamilies on structural grounds, the ICE subfamily and the CED3 subfamily, with the prototypical human representatives being ICE and CPP32, respectively. ICE and CPP32 differ in both substrate recognition and inhibitor binding. Regarding substrate cleavage, ICE displays a preference for hydrophobic residues in the P4 position, while known substrates of CPP32 contain aspartic acid at P4. Thus, ICE efficiently cleaves pro-interleukin-1β at a (P4)Tyr-Val-His-Asp(P1) sequence to generate mature interleukin-1β, while CPP32 does not (7Thornberry N.A. Bull H.D. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). CPP32 catalyzes the cleavage of several protein substrates, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, at (P4)Asp-X-X-Asp(P1) motifs much more efficiently than does ICE (8Nicholson D.W. Ali A.

Differences in the active sites of these two proteases are also reflected in their abilities to bind inhibitors. For example, the cowpox virus serpin CrmA inhibits ICE 5 orders of magnitude more potently than it does CPP32 (8Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y.

Similarly, the tetrapeptide aldehyde acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-aldehyde), corresponding to the ICE cleavage site in pro-interleukin-1β, inhibits ICE 5 orders of magnitude better than it does CPP32 (8Nicholson D.W.

To understand the structural basis for the similarities and differences in inhibitor recognition by CPP32 and ICE, we have solved the x-ray structure at 2.3 Å of recombinant CPP32 complexed to an irreversible tetrapeptide inhibitor, acetyl-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (Ac-DVAD-fmk), and compared it with two previously published ICE structures (24Walker N.P.C.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing this plasmid were grown to a density of A600 nm = 1.9 at 37°C in 3 liters of induction medium (20 g/liter Tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, 0.5 × M9 salts, 0.4% glucose, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, pH 7.4). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (1 mM) was added, and the culture was shaken at 25°C for 3 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 ml of binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 40 min, the cells were flash-frozen and stored at −80°C. After centrifugation, lysate supernatant was loaded onto a 12-ml Ni2+-charged HisBind metal affinity column (Novagen) equilibrated with binding buffer. The purified CPP32 protein was eluted from the column using a linear 60-1000 mM imidazole gradient (total volume of 100 ml). Fractions containing CPP32 activity were mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 M HEPES and 0.1 M dithiothreitol, pH 8.9, and then 2 mol eq of Ac-DVAD-fmk were added to prevent autoproteolysis. The inhibited enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration and buffer-exchanged into 25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. All procedures were done at 4°C. Ac-DVAD-fmk was prepared via a Swern oxidation of Ac-Asp-(OBut)-Val-Ala-NHCH(CH2CO2But)CH(OH)CH2F with oxalyl chloride/triethylamine in dimethyl sulfoxide/CH2Cl2, followed by deprotection with 50% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2. The requisite alcohol was prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-NHCH(CH2CO2But)CH(OH)CH2F over 10% palladium on carbon in methanol, followed by coupling to Ac-Asp-(OBut)-OH with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/1-hydroxybenztriazol in CH2Cl2/dimethylformamide. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-NHCH(CH2CO2But)CH(OH)CH2F, in turn, was prepared by coupling benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-OH to H2NCH(CH2CO2But)CH(OH)CH2F (26Revesz L. Briswalter C. Heng R. Leutwiler A. Mueller R. Waethrich H.-J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 9693-9696Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/1-hydroxybenztriazol. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as standard. Automated Edman degradation for N-terminal sequence analysis was performed using a gas-phase sequencer (Model 477A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were analyzed by gradient liquid chromatography on a phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (Model 120A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry was performed using sinapinic acid as matrix (27Börnsen O.K. Schär M. Widmer H.M. Chimia. 1990; 44: 412-416Google Scholar). Reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography was performed using a C18 column (0.46 × 11 cm, 5 μm) equilibrated at room temperature with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The column was eluted at 1 ml/min with a 15-min linear gradient (16-48% acetonitrile in 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid), and the eluate was monitored at 214 nm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on cast gels (10-20% acrylamide gradient gel) in a Tris/Tricine system (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 (29Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Eibl H. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 427-448Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis of the CPP32-inhibitor complex was performed at 4°C using a 1.6 × 70-cm Sephadex G-75 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. The protein was chromatographed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 mg/ml. The elution volume was compared against a standard curve of the column calibrated with molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad). The enzymatic activity of CPP32 was determined from the initial rate of Ac-DEVD-amc substrate hydrolysis in 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.5. Aminomethylcoumarin product formation was detected by the increase in sample fluorescence (λex = 360 nm, λem = 460 nm) for 1 h at room temperature using a Cytofluor II fluorescent plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). For kinetic and inhibitory measurements, the final substrate concentration range was 1-200 μM, while the enzyme concentration was 32 pM. For inhibition constant (Ki) determinations, the enzyme and inhibitor were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the substrate. Light scattering was performed with a Dynapro-801 molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Inc., Charlottesville, VA). Data analyses were performed with Protein Solutions Auto Pro Data analysis software. The purified protein was injected through a 0.02-μm syringe filter at room temperature into the Dynapro-801 detector. The sample was measured at a protein concentration of 2.6 mg/ml. The hanging and sitting drop methods of vapor diffusion at 4°C were used (30McPherson A. McPherson A. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. Krieger Publishing Co., Malabar, FL1989: 94-97Google Scholar). CPP32 protein (2-4 μl) inhibited with Ac-DVAD-fmk (at a protein concentration of 5.3 mg/ml) was mixed with 2-4 μl of buffer consisting of 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mM magnesium acetate, 90 mM sodium cacodylate, and 80 mM sodium sulfate, pH 6.3-6.5. Within ∼1 week at 4°C, crystals grew to a size of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm3. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 4°C from a single crystal using a 30-cm MAR Research imaging plate detector system. Graphite-monochromated CuKα radiation was provided by an Enraf Nonius FR591 rotating anode x-ray generator operated at 45 kV and 90 mA. A preliminary native data set from a small crystal was collected at room temperature using monochromated synchrotron radiation at the Swiss-Norwegian Beam Line, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data collection and processing were performed using MAR Research imaging plate software (31Collaborative Computational Project No. 4. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). As a template, a p17/p12 heterodimer of a previously constructed homology model, created on the basis of the ICE structure (25Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), was used. Two peaks were found in the cross-rotation function for the rotation angles α = 76.11°, β = 149.64°, γ = 56.28° (peak height = 5.8σ, 8.0 to 3.0-Å resolution, and 25-Å Patterson radius) and α = 323.10°, β = 52.62°, γ = 186.75° (peak height = 5.5σ). The two-dimensional translation function, calculated with the search model rotated according to the first set of angles in the resolution range 8.0 to 3.0 Å, yielded a solution for the translation a = 0.4306, b = 0.0000, and c = 0.3672 (correlation coefficient (r) = 29.8%, R-factor = 53.5%). 2R-factor (Rf) and Rsym are defined as follows: Rsym = σhklσiˈIhkl,i−〈Ihkl〉ˈ/σhklσiˈIhkl,iˈ; Rf = σhklˈFobs(hkl)ˈ− kˈFcalc(hkl)ˈ/σhklˈFobs(hkl)ˈ. For the calculation of the second translation function, the first molecule was fixed in its previously determined orientation. This function gave a correlation maximum at a = 0.1734, b = 0.2189, and c = 0.1169 (r = 35.8%, R-factor = 52.1%). The two orientations were improved by rigid-body refinement (R-factor = 51.1%, 8.0- and 3.0-Å resolution). The structure was further refined using the rotating anode data set by alternating rounds of molecular dynamics refinement from 3000 to 300 K (program X-PLOR) (35Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) and manual interventions on a graphic terminal (program O) (36Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The R-factor converged at 18.8% for all data between 8.0- and 2.3-Å resolution (free R-factor = 28.4%). During the refinement, 346 water molecules were included in the structure. The root mean square deviations for bond lengths and angles were 0.013 Å and 1.71°, respectively. The structure contains two copies each of the p17 and p12 subunits and the inhibitor. The first dimer, (p17/p12/one inhibitor)-molecule, is numbered 35-173, 185-277, and 989-993, respectively. The second dimer, (p17/p12/one inhibitor)-molecule, is numbered 1035-1173, 1185-1277, and 1989-1993, respectively. Not all residues could be assigned due to a too weak electron density. In the p17 subunit, 6 residues could not be located at the N terminus and 2 residues at the C terminus. In the p12 subunit, 9 N-terminal residues and 8 C-terminal residues (Leu-Glu-His6) could not be fitted. The root mean square deviation of 0.35 Å for the C-α distance, when comparing the two p17/p12 heterodimers, is in the range of the coordinate error. Therefore, they can be considered to be identical. Due to significantly higher temperature factors, the electron density for the second p17/p12 dimer (residues 1035-1993) is worse than for the first dimer (residues 35-993). The average temperature factors for the two p17/p12 heterodimers and inhibitor molecules are 25.5 Å2 (residues 35-277), 36.7 Å2 (residues 1035-1277), 24.0 Å2 (residues 989-993), and 33.9 Å2 (residues 1989-1993), respectively. The average temperature factor for discrete water molecules is 49.6 Å2. Soluble active recombinant CPP32 was produced in E. coli using a T7 expression system. The enzymatic activity present in the induced cell lysate indicated that 46 mg of active CPP32 were produced from a 3-liter culture. The enzyme was readily purified from the lysate using metal chelate affinity chromatography. Although CPP32 was expressed as the 32-kDa proenzyme, purified CPP32 is composed of two subunits in a 1:1 molar ratio with molecular masses of 17 and 12 kDa, which indicates that the proenzyme has been processed to mature enzyme in E. coli (Table II). Like the native enzyme (8Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju A.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T.

Two possible explanations for the CPP32 proenzyme processing are that CPP32 processes itself, or a bacterial protease processes CPP32. We favor the first possibility for two reasons. First, there is some evidence that in vitro translated CPP32 can cleave its own pro-domain after the p17/p12 cleavage is made; and second, pro-CPP32 in the bacterial lysate is converted to p17/p12 during the Ni2+ affinity chromatography step, possibly on the column itself (data not shown).

Although many studies have focused on the biosynthetic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein and on the production and polymerization of Aβ, understanding the degradation and clearance of Aβ has received very little attention. By incubating the conditioned medium of metabolically labeled Aβ-secreting cells with media of various cultured cell lines, we observed a time-dependent decrease in the amount of Aβ in the mixed media. The factor principally responsible for this decrease was a secreted metalloprotease released by both neural and non-neural cells. Among the cells examined, the microglial cell line, BV-2, produced the most Aβ-degrading activity. The protease was completely blocked by the metalloprotease inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, and partially inhibited by EDTA, whereas inhibitors of other protease classes produced little or no inhibition. Substrate analysis suggests that the enzyme was a non-matrix metalloprotease. The protease cleaved both Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 peptides secreted by β-amyloid precursor protein-transfected cells but failed to degrade low molecular weight oligomers of Aβ that form in the culture medium. Lipopolysaccharide, a stimulator of macrophages/microglia, activated BV-2 cells to increase their Aβ-degrading metalloprotease activity.

We show that nuclease activity inherent to cyclophilins is distinct from cis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase activity and is similar to that described for apoptotic nucleases. Cyclophilin nucleolytic activity is stimulated by Ca2+ and/or Mg2+, with a combination of the two being optimal for cyclophilins A and B.

Additionally, cyclophilins produce 3′-OH termini in linear double-stranded substrates, suggesting the cuts produced are similar to those of apoptotic cells. Cyclophilins also display endonucleolytic activity, demonstrated by their ability to degrade supercoiled DNA. In the absence of ions, cyclophilins bind linearized DNA.

One important question is the relationship between the HuR, which is ubiquitously expressed, and the neural specific members HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1. It is reasonable to postulate that HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1 interact with brain-specific mRNAs involved in pathways critical to neuronal differentiation. In our previous studies we have investigated the interaction between the Elav-like proteins and mRNAs that are expressed in all cells (16Liu J. Dalmau J. Szabo A. Rosenfeld M. Huber J. Furneaux H.

Recent studies have indicated that post-transcriptional mechanisms significantly contribute to the regulation of GAP-43 gene expression (22Federoff H.J. Grabczyk E. Fishman M.C. J. Biol.

Precise control of GAP-43 expression is thus of critical importance during nervous system development. Two independent cis-acting elements that regulate expression have been mapped to the 3′-UTR of GAP-43 mRNA. One maps to the region proximal to the termination codon (35Nishizawa K. Okamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Insertion of this element into a reporter mRNA results in destabilization of the reporter message (36Nishizawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This pathway is regulated by nerve growth factor (36Nishizawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The other element is U-rich in sequence and found within a highly conserved region of the 3′-UTR (37Kohn D.T. Tsai K.C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Insertion of this element also confers instability to reporter constructs, which is reversed by treatment with TPA (38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J.

Cross-linking studies have identified three brain proteins of 40, 65, and 95 kDa that specifically interact with the 3′UTR of GAP-43 mRNA (37Kohn D.T. Tsai K.C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L.

It was noted that the 40-kDa protein was similar in size to the neuronal specific Elav-like proteins. Thus, in the current study, we have investigated whether this 40-kDa protein corresponds to a neuronal specific member of the Elav-like protein family and have investigated its interaction with GAP-43 mRNA in a purified system. Plasmid DNAs were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase for GAP-43B, and GAP-43C or T7 RNA polymerase for GAP-43A in the presence of [32P]uridine triphosphate (Amersham Corp.) as described previously (39Furneaux H.M.

Following digestion with RNase T1 (1 unit/μl, Calbiochem), RNA-protein complexes were exposed to UV irradiation for 30 min at 4°C using a germicidal lamp (Sylvania G30T8), and samples were then subjected to an additional digestion with RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37°C. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed using 16A11 mAb (10Marusich H.M. Furneaux H.M. Henion P. Weston J.A. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) or an anti-tubulin mAb as a negative control. We used the protocol developed by De Graan et al. (42De Graan P.N. Dekker L.V. Oestreicher A.B. Van der Voorn L. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. UV-cross-linked complexes were incubated in 200 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA) containing the indicated mAb (at 1:100 dilution) for 1 h at 25°C. Next, 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) in Nonidet P-40 buffer was added. Samples were further incubated for 4 h at 4°C; beads containing the immunoprecipitates were then separated by centrifugation and proteins analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and the radioactivity associated with each band analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). An overnight culture of Escherichia coli BL 21, transformed with each HuD construct (17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), was diluted in 1:50 LB media. At an A600 of 0.4, the culture was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mM). After 4 h of further growth, cells were spun down and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The cells were lysed by adding lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and Triton (1%). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose affinity column (13 mg of protein/ml of resin). After washing the column with buffer B (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton), GST-HuD was eluted with (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM glutathione). Active protein was determined by RNA-complex formation, pooled, and stored at −70°C. Reaction mixtures (0.02 ml) contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 fmol of labeled RNA and protein as indicated. Mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Following incubation, 4 μl of a dye mixture (50% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) was added, and 20% of the reaction mixture was immediately loaded on a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA). The gel was then electrophoresed at 40 V for 2.5 h. The gel was dried on DE81 (Whatman) with a backing of gel drying paper (Hudson City Paper, West Caldwell, NJ) and exposed to XAR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 4-5 h at −70°C. Reaction mixtures (0.02 ml) contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 20 fmol of radiolabeled mRNA, purified HuD as indicated. After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, 0.5 unit of RNase T1 was added to each reaction and incubated at 37°C for 10 min further. The mixtures were diluted 1:6 with buffer F (20 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 mg/ml tRNA) and filtered through nitrocellulose (BA 85, Schleicher & Schüll). After washing the nitrocellulose twice with buffer F, bound HuD-RNA complex was extracted with phenol/chloroform and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The resultant RNA was dissolved in formamide buffer and denatured at 65°C for 2 min. Samples were analyzed by 12% polyacrylamide/urea gel electrophoresis. The gel was fixed with 1:1:8 acetic acid:methanol:water, dried, and exposed to the XAR5 film at −70°C overnight. Reaction mixtures (0.02 ml) contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 10 fmol of radiolabeled mRNA, and purified HuD as indicated. After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, the mixtures were diluted 1:6 with buffer F and filtered using nitrocellulose. After washing the filter twice with buffer F, bound radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the GAP-43 mRNA and the transcripts (encoded by plasmids GAP-43H, GAP-43A, GAP-43C, and GAP-43B) used in these studies. Kohn et al. (37Kohn D.T. Tsai K.C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have previously described 40, 65, and 90-kDa brain proteins that cross-link to the transcript encoded by plasmid GAP-43H. To investigate whether the 40-kDa protein was related to the Elav-like proteins, the labeled cross-linked material was precipitated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the neuronal members of the Elav-like protein family (10Marusich H.M. Furneaux H.M. Henion P. Weston J.A. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The anti-Elav-like monoclonal (16A11) specifically precipitated the 40-kDa species (Fig. 2, lanes 1-3). The 40-kDa protein was not detected without added mAb nor precipitated on addition of an irrelevant monoclonal antibody. Thus we concluded that the previously characterized 40-kDa RNA binding factor is indeed a member of the neuronal Elav-like protein family. The 65- and 95-kDa proteins were not co-precipitated. This result indicates that there is little protein-protein interaction between the 40-kDa protein and the 65- and 95-kDa proteins. It is possible, however, that they interact when bound to RNA. In this experiment the complex was digested with RNase before immunoprecipitation.Fig. 2The 40-kDa species is a member of the Elav-like RNA-binding protein family. 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled GAP-43 RNA (derived from plasmid GAP-43H) was incubated with S100 extract (50 μg of protein) and cross-linked by UV irradiation. The cross-linked material was then precipitated with mAb 16A11 or an anti-tubulin mAb and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis (lanes 1-3). The nonprecipitated material is shown in lane 4View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are three neuronal members of the Elav-like protein family, namely HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1.

Since, however, the RNA binding properties of all three are virtually identical (12Gao F.B. Carson C. Levine T. Keene J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11207-11211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and GAP-43 is expressed in virtually all neurons, it is likely that all three family members associate with GAP-43 mRNA. Although it is clear that the Elav-like proteins are bound to GAP-43 mRNA, it is possible that other factors in the extract are required to stabilize binding. Thus we have investigated whether purified Elav-like proteins can bind to GAP-43 mRNA. For these studies, we have chosen HuD, since its RNA binding properties have been documented previously (17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant HuD was incubated with labeled transcripts and complex formation was assayed by gel retardation analysis. HuD binds with high affinity to the transcripts encoded by GAP-43B and GAP-43H (Gap-43H data are not shown), but not to transcripts encoded by GAP-43A or GAP-43C (Fig. 3). GAP-43A contains the entire coding region and the cis-acting element defined by Nishizawa et al. (35Nishizawa K. Okamoto H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) GAP-43B contains the cis-acting element defined by Tsai et al. (38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). Thus, purified HuD is sufficient to reconstitute binding and the specificity of that binding correlates well with the known properties of the 40-kDa factor (38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). The interaction between HuD and GAP-43B RNA was further investigated using a quantitative RNA binding assay. We employed the same method as originally used for the R17 coat protein (43Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A low concentration of labeled RNA (100 pM) was incubated with increasing concentrations of HuD protein as indicated. The reactions were filtered through nitrocellulose and the bound radioactivity determined. Fig. 4A shows that the formation of the GAP-43B RNA-HuD complex is detectable at 7.2 nM, has a midpoint at about 130 nM, and reaches a plateau above 720 nM with about 60% of the input RNA bound. Complex formation with GAP-43A or GAP-43C RNA was not detectable under these conditions. A plot of the log of complex/free RNA versus the log of HuD concentration reveals a straight line with an intersect on the x axis at 129 nM (Fig. 4B). Thus the binding of HuD to GAP-43 mRNA is a simple molecular reaction with an apparent Kd of 129 nM. We have further mapped the binding site using an RNase T1 digestion technique. In this technique the HuD-RNA complex is digested with RNase T1, and the protein bound RNA fragments are isolated by absorption to nitrocellulose (17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the HuD-dependent retention of a single fragment on incubation with GAP-43B RNA. No fragments were selected from GAP-43A or GAP-43C RNAs. This fragment is identical in size to a unique 26-nucleotide T1 fragment present in the total digest of GAP-43B RNA. This suggested that this fragment is the HuD binding site. It was also conceivable, however, that it arose from the protection of a G residue between two smaller T1 oligonucleotides, yielding a fragment of similar size. The 26-nucleotide fragment was isolated and redigested with RNase T1 (Fig. 5B). No digestion products were observed, therefore this fragment indeed corresponds to the unique 26-nucleotide sequence that is shown in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that this binding site is highly conserved between GAP-43 mRNAs from different species (37Kohn D.T. Tsai K.C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have compared the sequence of the GAP-43 mRNA binding site with those we have found found in c-Fos, c-Myc, Tau, interleukin-3, and AdIVA2 mRNAs (Fig. 6). The GAP-43 binding site is similar to the others in that it contains U-rich tracts. We have shown that these U-rich tracts are essential for the binding of HuD to the element in the 3′-UTR of c-Fos mRNA (17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether the HuD-GAP-43 complex would be displaced by the 27-nucleotide c-Fos binding site. Complex formation was indeed readily displaced by the 27-nucleotide c-Fos oligonucleotide but not by a mutant oligonucleotide (27Jacobson R.D. Virag I. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1843-1855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28McGuire C.B. Snipes G.J. Norden J.J. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 41: 277-291Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) which contains substitutions of the U-rich tracts (Fig. 7). Thus the GAP-43 binding site is functionally similar to those we have described in other mRNAs.Fig. 7Competition analysis. 10 fmol (50,000 cpm/pmol UTP) of 32P-labeled GAP-43B RNA was incubated with 240 nM HuD protein. The indicated molar excess of “27” (containing c-Fos ARE sequences) or “27-8” (irrelevant competitor) was added into the reaction. After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, 20% of reaction mixtures was resolved on a 1% agarose gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HuD contains three RNA binding domains (5Szabo A.

The first and second are in tandem and are separated from the third by a basic segment, which we call the basic domain. Previous studies have shown that the first and second RNA binding domains are both essential for binding to the AU-rich elements, whereas the third RNA binding domain binds to the poly(A) tail (17Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).2 To determine the domains of HuD required for binding to GAP-43 mRNA, we utilized the deletion constructs shown in Fig. 8. Gel retardation analysis showed that the first and second RRMs were essential for binding to the GAP-43 site (Fig. 8). The third RRM did not display any detectable binding (Fig. 8, lanes 8 and 9). As noted previously in our studies on the c-Fos element, the first and second RRMs are required in tandem for complete binding activity (Fig. 8, lanes 4-6). The basic domain alone did not exhibit any binding activity. The Elav-like RNA-binding proteins regulate gene expression via an interaction with U-rich elements in the 3′-UTR of specific mRNAs. The mechanism underlying the specificity of this regulation is poorly understood. There are four members of this family (HuD, HuC, Hel-N1, and HuR) in human cells. HuR is ubiquitously expressed, whereas HuD, HuC and Hel-N1 are selectively expressed in neurons (5Szabo A. Dalmau J. Manley G. Rosenfeld M.R. Wong E. Henson J. Posner J.B. Furneaux H.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 325-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 6King P.H. Levine T.D. Fremeau R.T. Keene J.D. J.

The neuronal members are the homologues of Elav, a Drosophila gene required for neuronal differentiation. (2Robinow S. Campos A.R. Yao K.M. White K. Science. 1988; 242: 1570-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) The existence of three family members in human neurons suggests that they specifically modulate mRNAs that regulate neuronal differentiation. The RNA binding specificity, however, of all four members is very similar (7Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Wright A. Campbell C. Furneaux H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 12Gao F.B. Carson C. Levine T. Keene J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1 exert their function, not only through binding to U-rich elements, but also through interactions with other proteins that selectively bind to the 3′-UTR of neuronal mRNAs. The first step in investigating this is to identify and study neuronal specific mRNAs that may be regulated by the Elav-like proteins. Previous studies have shown that neuronal factors of 40, 65, and 95 kDa bind specifically to the 3′-UTR of GAP-43 mRNA. (37Kohn D.T. Tsai K.C. Cansino V.V. Neve R.L. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar) GAP-43 is an important neuronal specific protein that regulates synaptic remodeling (18Yankner B.A. Benowitz L.I. Villa-Komaroff L. Neve R.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 7: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Zuber M.X. Goodman D.W. Karns L.R. Fishman M.C.

Cell. 1995; 80: 445-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that the 40-kDa factor is a neuronal specific member of the Elav-like protein family. We have shown that purified HuD binds to GAP-43 mRNA with appropriate specificity and affinity. Thus it is likely that the Elav-like proteins play a significant role in the post-transcriptional control of GAP-43 expression. If this was so, then one would expect that alteration of Elav-like gene expression would affect GAP-43 expression. In addition one might suspect that deletion of the Elav-like binding site from GAP-43 mRNA would significantly affect its expression. These are important future experiments to confirm the role of the Elav-like proteins in the regulation of GAP-43 expression. The regulation of GAP-43 expression in PC12 cells illuminates the specificity problem that we discussed above. Addition of TPA to PC12 cells results in the marked stabilization of GAP-43 mRNA (38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). This stabilization is effected through interactions with the segment of GAP-43 mRNA encoded by plasmid GAP-43B. However, TPA treatment also results in the increased degradation of many other mRNAs (e.g. c-Fos) that contain U-rich elements and are selectively bound by the Elav-like proteins. The simplest hypothesis is that the regulation of a particular mRNA may be governed by the association of the Elav-like proteins with other RNA-binding proteins that recognize disparate specificity elements in the mRNA. In this paper we have defined the 26-nucleotide Elav-like binding site. This site is well conserved between GAP-43 mRNAs from different species. There are, however, additional elements within the sequence encoded by GAP-43B (Fig. 1) that are also well conserved. It is reasonable to assume that these elements and their associated binding factors also play a role in the expression of GAP-43 mRNA. The 95-kDa protein described by Tsai et al. (38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar) is a good candidate for such a trans-acting factor. Thus, the TPA-induced stabilization of GAP-43 mRNA may depend on the binding of the 95-kDa protein, the binding of the Elav-like proteins to the 26-nucleotide element, and appropriate interactions between these two proteins. Further investigation of this possibility will require the purification of the 95-kDa factor. It is also important to point out that GAP-43 mRNA contains another element at the 3′ end of the open reading frame. This element is bound by the 65-kDa factor (38Tsai K.-C. Casino V.V. Kohn D.T. Neve R. Perrone-Bizzozero N.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether there is any interaction between the 65-kDa factor and the Elav-like proteins. In conclusion, the GAP-43-Elav-like protein complex described here will provide an important reagent to answer these questions and may facilitate the development of an in vitro system that faithfully recapitulates regulation of GAP-43 mRNA turnover.

A catalytically fully active form of human UDG has been expressed in Escherichia coli (5Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavlie B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E.

These studies identified this form of human UDG as a one domain structure with a positively charged DNA-binding groove. UDGs are relatively small monomeric enzymes that, at least in vitro, do not require cofactors. However, UDG is preferentially associated with replicating SV40 minichromosomes, indicating a possible interaction with components of the replication machinery (7Krokan H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 133: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the major human UDG, UNG, is transcribed predominantly late in the G1-phase, resulting in a 2-3-fold increase in UDG activity early in the S-phase (8Slupphaug G. Olsen L.C. Helland D. Aasland R. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5131-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cell cycle regulation is consistent with the presence of several putative regulatory elements detected in the UNG gene (9Haug T. Skorpen F. Lund H. Krokan H.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), including a putative element for binding of replication protein A (RPA) (10Haug T. Skorpen F. Kvaløy K. Eftedal I. Lund H.

RPA from non-mammalian species substitutes poorly for human RPA during initiation of SV40 DNA replication (17Brill S.J. Stillman B.

Roberts J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2177-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) or following DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light (21Carty M.P. Zernik-Kobak M. McGrath S. Dixon K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2114-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) or ionizing radiation (22Liu V. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7222-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but the role of phosphorylated RPA2 remains unclear. A human homolog of RPA2, called RPA4, has been identified (23Keshav K.F. Chen C. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3119-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but its function is not known. The tumor suppressor p53 physically interacts with and inhibits the function of RPA, and this interaction may be important for regulating the onset of the S-phase (24Dutta A. Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester E. Nature. 1993; 365: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). uracil-DNA glycosylase replication protein A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the present work, we demonstrate an interaction between human UDG from the UNG gene (UNG) and RPA using the two-hybrid system in yeast, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a UDG activity assay. The results show that RPA2, but neither the homolog RPA4 nor RPA1, binds to UNG. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal presequence in UNG. The presequence, which is not necessary for the catalytic activity of UNG, contains a region of 23 amino acids with strong homology to the conserved RPA2-binding region of XPA. These results indicate a possible function for RPA in base excision repair. Yeast reporter strain HF7c, used in the two-hybrid system, contains two Gal4-inducible reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ (MATCHMAKER Two-hybrid system, Clontech Laboratories Inc.). Plasmid vectors, pGBT9 and pGADGH, encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, Gal4-BD, (Gal4 residues 1-147) and Gal4-activating domain, Gal4-AD (Gal4 residues 768-881), respectively, were used to express hybrid proteins. pGBT9 and pGADGH also contain the yeast Trp1 and the Leu2 genes, respectively, as selectable markers. To screen for protein interactions in the two-hybrid system, we used pGBTUNGΔ28, constructed by insertion of UNGΔ28-cDNA, which lacks the 28 N-terminal amino acids of the open reading frame, into EcoRI/SalI-digested pGBT9, and a Jurkat cell cDNA library, constructed in fusion with Gal4-AD in pGAD1318. The yeast reporter strain HF7c was sequentially cotransformed with the UNGΔ28 hybrid expression plasmid and the Jurkat cell cDNA library (100 μg) according to Bartel and Fields (25Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interactions with the UNGΔ28 hybrid protein were assayed as described by Clontech Laboratories Inc. Positive clones were further tested for specificity by retransformation into HF7c either with pGBTUNGΔ28 or with extraneous targets as yeast pGBTSNF1 or pGBT9. The SNF1-Gal4-BD/SNF4-Gal4-AD interaction in the two-hybrid system was used as positive control (26Chien C. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), and plasmid vectors without insert were used as negative control. The cDNA inserts from positive clones were sequenced using primer walking and TaqPRISM™ Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy™ terminator cycle sequencing kit on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems). The human RPA2 hybrid with the Gal4-AD in pGADGH (isolated from a HeLa cDNA library, Clontech Laboratories Inc.) was kindly supplied by K. Tanaka (27Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T.

In order to identify amino acids involved in the interaction between UNG and human RPA2 (p34), pGBTUNGΔ75 and pGBTUNGΔ84 were constructed the same way as pGBTUNGΔ28. Sequencing of the vectors were performed in order to ensure in frame reading. Yeast cells were cotransformed with pGAD-RPA2 and pGBT-UNGΔ28 or pGBT-UNGΔ75, and necessary controls were performed. The filter assay was performed according to Clontech Laboratories Inc. pACTRPA1 was constructed by cloning the RPA1 NcoI-SalI fragment from pRPA70 into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pACT2 (28Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). pACTRPA2 was constructed by cloning the RPA2 XhoI-EcoRI fragment from pJGRPA2 into the XhoI-EcoRI sites of pACT2. pACTRPA4 was constructed by cloning a PCR-generated fragment encoding the open reading frame of RPA4 into the BamHI site of pACT11. UNGΔ28 was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pAS vector and called pASIUNGΔ28. The β-galactosidase assay was performed as described by Harper et al. (28Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). A 1-kilobase pair genomic fragment from the uracil-DNA glycosylase gene was amplified by PCR in the presence of [3H]dUTP (15 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Corp., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) instead of dTTP. PCR products were purified by gel filtration followed by adsorption to glass milk and subsequent elution according to the Geneclean II protocol (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA) in order to remove excess primers and free nucleotides. [3H]Uracil-containing DNA (60,000 dpm/μl and ∼ 1 ng of DNA/μl) was stored in 1 × TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) at −80°C. Heterologous expression and purification of UNGΔ84 (lacking 84 amino acids of the N-terminal part) have been described previously (5Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavlie B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). UNGΔ28 (lacking the N-terminal 28 amino acids in the presequence) was expressed using a Baculovirus system 2S. Bharati, M. Otterlei, G. Slupphaug, and H. E. Krokan, unpublished results. and purified to homogeneity as described for UNGΔ84 (5Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavlie B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The UDG activity of UNGΔ28 is severalfold lower than that of UNGΔ84 on the substrate used in the present experiments.2 Purified proteins were stored in 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.125 M NaCl, and 50% glycerol at −20°C. To test the effect of trimeric RPA on UDG activity, UNGΔ28 or UNGΔ84 (10 ng) and recombinant trimeric RPA (200 ng), kindly provided by Dr. M. S. Wold (29Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were incubated for 30 min on ice in 200 μl of 2 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 1.6 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mM dithiothreitol. Then aliquots of the preincubation mixture were diluted in the same buffer to equal enzyme activities, mixed with double-stranded [3H]uracil-containing DNA prepared by PCR, and UDG activity measured as described (30Krokan H. Wittwer C.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RPA bound to single-stranded DNA could recruit UNG to DNA, 100 ng of RPA diluted in assay buffer was preincubated on ice for 30 min with rate-limiting amounts of heat-denatured [3H]uracil-containing single-stranded DNA prepared by nick translation of calf thymus DNA (30Krokan H. Wittwer C.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This was done by diluting the assay volume to 200 μl such that the final concentration of [3H]uracil (in DNA) was approximately 0.27 μM, which is severalfold below Km for both forms of UNG. Then 40 pg of UNGΔ84 or 3.5 ng of UNGΔ28 were added, and the assay was mixture incubated at 37°C for time periods specified in the results. UDG activity was determined as described in Ref. 30Krokan H. Wittwer C.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2599-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar. To investigate whether RPA in solution could recruit UNG to DNA, UNG proteins and RPA were preincubated and then substrate was added under otherwise similar conditions. Wells of immunoplates (Nunc Maxisorb, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 1 μg of RPA in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at 4°C overnight. All subsequent incubations were done at room temperature. The wells were blocked by incubation with 1 mg of bovine serum albumin in 200 μl of PBS for 1 h and washed with PBS (three times with 200 μl/well). Then varying concentrations of UNGΔ28 or UNGΔ84 in 100 μl of PBS with 2% fetal calf serum were added to the wells, and the plates incubated for 1 h. After washing as above, protein A-purified rabbit antibodies raised against UNGΔ84 (5Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavlie B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) were added (15 ng/well). The anti-UNG antibodies (PU101) detect UNGΔ28 and UNGΔ84 equally well in an ELISA system when they are coated directly onto immunoplates.2 After further incubation for 1 h and subsequent washing with PBS, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dacopatts A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) was added and binding quantitated using a colorimetric method (o-phenylenediamine, Dacopatts A/S) according to the manufacturer's instructions. UNG proteins were treated with proteinase K, separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), blotted, and visualized as follows: 3.2 pmol of UNGΔ28 (calculated molecular mass 30.9 kDa, SDS-PAGE molecular mass 33 kDA) or UNGΔ84 (calculated molecular mass 25.5 kDa, SDS-PAGE molecular mass 27 kDa) diluted in UDG buffer (10 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) were incubated with 400 ng of proteinase K (Sigma) in a total volume of 100 μl for 0 and 160 min at room temperature. At 160 min 100 μl of UDG buffer or UDG buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) were added to the tubes which were immediately placed on ice. To test whether RPA protected UNGΔ28 against protease digestion, 3.2 pmol of UNGΔ28 diluted in UDG buffer were preincubated on ice with 8.6 pmol (1 μg) RPA in a total volume of 100 μl for 30 min. Then the sample was split in two equal parts, incubated with 400 ng of proteinase K or buffer for 160 min at room temperature, and digested UNG proteins analyzed by Western blotting using PU101 antibodies for detection (5Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavlie B. Bharati S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Using the hybrid protein Gal4-BD-UNGΔ28, a human Jurkat cDNA library fused to Gal4-AD in pGAD1318 (gift from J. Camonis, U248, INSERM, Paris) was screened in the yeast two-hybrid system with a transformation efficiency of 2.5 × 106 transformants/100 μg of library DNA used. From a 5.6-fold amplification, 62 positive clones were identified. All these clones indicated an interaction between UNGΔ28 and a protein closely related to RPA2 as determined by nucleotide sequencing. Initially we assumed that this was a new homolog of RPA2. However, this potential RPA2 homolog hybridized strongly to genomic DNA from rat and not to human DNA. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of this cDNA clone was identical to a partial cDNA clone for rat RPA2 given the accession number H32647 in GenBank™. Therefore this new RPA2 cDNA clone most probably results from contamination of the human cDNA library with cDNA from rat and has consequently been reported to GenBank™ (accession number X98490) as a putative rat homolog of human RPA2 showing 89% identity with the human protein. Using this information, interaction between the human hybrid proteins Gal4-BD-UNGΔ28 and Gal4-AD-RPA2 (authentic human RPA2) was demonstrated with both His3 and LacZ reporter genes (Fig. 1, panel A). No interaction was detected between the Gal4-AD-RPA2 and Gal4-BD-UNGΔ75 (Fig. 1, panel B) or Gal4-BD-UNGΔ84 hybrid proteins (data not shown), indicating that the binding of RPA2 to UNG is dependent on the presequence of UNG. This interaction between RPA2 and UNG is specific, since the RPA2 hybrid did not interact with other irrelevant Gal4-BD hybrid proteins such as Gal4-BD-SNF1 or the unfused Gal4BD (Fig. 1A). In addition to the controls specified in Fig. 1, panels A and B, we tested for interaction between Gal4-BD-UNGΔ28 and Gal4-AD or Gal4-AD-SNF4, but no such unspecific binding was observed (data not shown). Although no other interactions were observed after screening with the cDNA library, we investigated the possible interaction of UNGΔ28 with RPA1 (known to interact with XPA) and RPA4 using a modified version of the two-hybrid system (28Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar). Human RPA1, RPA4, and RPA2 (as a positive control) were each fused to the Gal4-AD in the pACT vector, and UNGΔ28 was fused to the Gal4-BD in the pAS vector. As shown in Fig. 1C, UNGΔ28 interacted only with RPA2 and not with RPA1 or RPA4. We did not directly test for possible interaction with RPA3, but such an interaction may not be likely since it could not be demonstrated when human UNG was screened against the Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. The longest and shortest RPA2-cDNA clones obtained from the screening, started at positions corresponding to amino acids 4 and 136 in human RPA2, indicating that the C-terminal region of RPA2 from amino acid residue 136-271 is sufficient for binding to UNG. UNG probably interacts with an amino acid region of RPA2 that is divergent in RPA4. Although RPA4 has a 47% overall identity with RPA2, a region located between positions 184 and 210 in RPA2 is distinctly different in the corresponding region in RPA4. Alignment of human RPA2 with RPA2 from other species shows that this region appears to be conserved in mammals, but not in lower eukaryotes or the human RPA2 homolog RPA4 (Fig. 2). To examine whether physiologically active trimeric form of RPA interacted with UNG in vitro, ELISA assays using UNG-Ab and purified recombinant trimeric RPA together with purified UNGΔ28 or UNGΔ84 were performed. Data shown in Table I support the UNGΔ28-RPA interaction, while the severalfold lower absorbance detected with UNGΔ84 may represent unspecific interaction close to the detection limit or very weak specific interactions. This experiment demonstrated that the RPA2-UNG interaction is direct and does not require a yeast intermediate protein. Furthermore, UNG binds to RPA2 in its heterotrimeric physiological context.Table IBinding of UNG to trimeric RPA detected by ELISAUNG addedBinding of UNGΔ28 (A492)Binding of UNGΔ84 (A492)pmol80.290 ± 0.0210.039 ± 0.0120.80.042 ± 0.0020.010 ± 0.002000 Open table in a new tab We also tested the effect of trimeric RPA on UDG activity of UNG proteins on double-stranded DNA substrate. Since RPA binds strongly to single-stranded DNA, a UDG substrate without detectable gaps or single-stranded regions (generated by PCR) was used for this purpose. Using this substrate in the presence of excess trimeric RPA, UDG activity of UNGΔ28 was inhibited by approximately 25%, while the UDG activity of UNGΔ84 remained unaffected (Table II). These in vitro assays support the view that the interaction between the two proteins is specific and not an artifact observed with the hybrid protein in the two-hybrid system. Furthermore, the lack of effect of RPA on UNGΔ84, which does not contain the presequence, is consistent with the results of the two-hybrid experiments.Table IIEffect of RPA on UDG activity on double-stranded [3H]uracil-containing DNAUDG activityRatio RPA/UNGUNGΔ28UNGΔ84%01001002075 ± 7100 ± 1020075 ± 4100 ± 8 Open table in a new tab In order to investigate whether the strong DNA binding capacity of RPA could mediate recruitment of UNG to single-stranded DNA, UDG assays were performed under conditions where the concentration of single-stranded DNA substrate was limiting. Neither preincubation of trimeric RPA with substrate nor preincubation of trimeric RPA with UNGΔ28 or UNGΔ84 resulted in consistently increased UDG activity. Rather, a weak inhibition of UDG activity was mostly observed under the varying conditions used; thus we could not demonstrate significant recruitment of UNG by RPA in these in vitro experiments (Table III).Table IIIEffect of RPA on UDG activity of UNG proteins on single-stranded [3H]uracil-containing DNA present in limiting amounts (“recruitment experiment”)TimeRPAUNGΔ84UNGΔ28RPA/UNGRPA/DNARPA/UNGRPA/DNAminactivity in %activity in %10−100 ± 8100 ± 9100 ± 7100 ± 410+87 ± 5114 ± 589 ± 685 ± 620−100 ± 3100 ± 1100 ± 7100 ± 1020+83 ± 1127 ± 1293 ± 480 ± 8 Open table in a new tab The region of XPA required for interaction with RPA2 is located within the N-terminal 58 amino acid residues (16Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, within the 49 amino acids of the presequence of UNG, which interacts with RPA2, a 23-amino acid region with strong homology to the RPA2-binding region of XPA is found. The hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity profiles are also very similar. When allowing for two gaps of 2 amino acids, 11 out of 23 amino acids are identical (47.8% identity), and in addition 3 are conserved (60.9% similarity), (Fig. 3, panel A). XPA from several other species also show homology to this region of human UNG with chicken showing the highest homology (60.9% identity and 78.3% similarity). SV40 T-antigen, which also binds to the C-terminal region of RPA2 (19Lee S.-H. Kim D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12801-12807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), has a 26-amino acid region with limited homology to human UNG. In addition, a protein in the cyclin family (UNG2) apparently having UDG activity also has a region of homology to UNG and XPA (Fig. 3B). The presequence of mouse UDG 3H. Nilsen, unpublished results. is also strongly homologous to human UDG and contains the putative RPA2-binding motif. The corresponding region is also conserved in UDG from the fish Xiphophorus, although more distantly related, 4R. B. Walter, personal communication. but is absent in UDG from yeast or animal viruses (various herpes simplex viruses and pox viruses) (data not shown). Although limited to a small region, this is, to our knowledge, the first homology demonstrated between damage recognizing proteins in the nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair pathways. In conclusion, these results support the biochemical data and suggest that residues 57-79 in human UNG and 20-46 in XPA interact with RPA2. The crystal structure of UNGΔ84, a catalytically fully active enzyme, has revealed a globular one-domain protein with the N-terminal region localized on the surface. Using proteinase K digestion, the presequence is easily removed from UNGΔ28, resulting in a processed form slightly longer than UNGΔ84 (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). No further digestion of UNGΔ28 is observed. Purified UNGΔ84 is proteinase K-resistant, probably due to its compact structure (lanes 2 and 4). In an attempt to examine whether binding of RPA to UNGΔ28 affected the proteinase K digestion, UNGΔ28 was preincubated with RPA and then incubated with proteinase K. Lanes 2 and 6 show that RPA did not protect UNGΔ28 from protease digestion. Proteinase K treatment of UNGΔ28 removed the presequence without any loss of activity, in fact the activity is increased (data not shown), whereas the catalytic activity of UNGΔ84 was not affected by the proteinase K treatment. The shorter form of UNG resulting from proteinase K treatment could not have resulted from digestion at the C-terminal end, because deletion of only the last 4 amino acids at the C-terminal end by site-directed mutagenesis where Trp-301 was converted to a stop codon resulted in complete loss of activity (data not shown). These results, together with the results obtained in the two-hybrid studies, indicate that the presequence constitutes a separate structural domain required for RPA binding, but not for catalytic activity. In this report we demonstrate an interaction between human UNG and human RPA in vivo, using the yeast two-hybrid system, and in vitro by an ELISA assay using purified trimeric RPA and purified forms of human UDG (UNGΔ28 or UNGΔ84). Only the 34-kDa subunit of RPA2 interacts directly with UNG, and the interaction results in a weak inhibitory effect on UDG activity rather than stimulation. The weak inhibitory effect may be an in vitro effect, and we do not suggest that RPA inhibits UDG activity in the much more complex in vivo situation; this result merely strengthens the other results showing that the presequence is involved in an interaction between UNG and RPA, since a possible functional consequence on UDG activity should be confirmed inside cells. Previously, RPA has been shown to be involved in the damage recognition step of nucleotide excision repair (14He Z. Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. Ingles C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), in recombination repair (15Heyer W.D. Rao M.R. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and in replication (13Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), but a possible involvement in base excision repair has not been reported, except for a possible role of RPA as a transcription factor in the regulation of expression of DNA repair genes (11Singh K.K. Samson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4907-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A putative element for binding of RPA is located in an inhibitory region of the UNG promoter (9Haug T. Skorpen F. Lund H. Krokan H.E.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In nucleotide excision repair, XPA interacts with both RPA2 and RPA1, but whereas RPA1 is essential for cell survival after UV light exposure, RPA2 has a more modest although significant effect (16Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A region between amino acids 28 and 78 in UNG is necessary for interaction with RPA2, but we have not formally shown that this region is sufficient for interaction. Interestingly, amino acids 57-79 in UNG show strong homology to amino acids 20-46 in human XPA. Since XPA residues 1-59 are necessary and 1-74 sufficient for binding to RPA2 (16Li L. Lu X. Peterson C.A. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), it seems likely that the region of homology between amino acids 57-79 in human UNG and amino acids 20-46 in XPA are the actual RPA2-binding regions. At the C-terminal end of the region of homology, the amino acid sequence RLAAR is present in both UNG and XPA. However, this sequence does not appear to be sufficient for RPA2 binding, since Gal4-BD-UNGΔ75 that starts with this sequence did not interact in the two-hybrid system. Our results indicate that the interacting region in human RPA2 is located downstream of the first 136 amino acid residues. A conserved region in RPA2 from mammals, lacking in RPA4 and RPA2 from lower eukaryotes, is present between residues 184 and 210. This may be a candidate region for binding of UNG, and if so, the pattern of conservation would indicate that only RPA from higher eukaryotes will recognize UNG, analogous to the ability of RPA from mammals, and inability of RPA from lower eukaryotes like Saccharomyces cerevisiae to bind to T-antigen and to stimulate SV40 replication (17Brill S.J. Stillman B. Nature. 1989; 342: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Melendy T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3389-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible function of RPA2 could be to recruit UNG to a DNA repair complex possibly associated with the replication complex for scanning for uracil prior to replication. A related function has been proposed for SV40 T-antigen which, like dnaC, λ P protein, and the T4 phage gp59 protein, facilitate primase recognition of RPA-coated DNA (Ref. 18Melendy T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3389-3395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Alternatively, RPA2 might assist transport of UNG either to the nucleus or within the nucleus. Among the three subunits, only RPA2 is associated with the nuclear matrix and this association persists throughout the cell cycle (31Murti K.G. He D.C. Brinkley B.R. Scott R. Lee S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, RPA2 and RPA1 undergo a transition from uniform nuclear distribution to the punctuate nuclear pattern typical for replication foci during the S-phase (32Brenot-Bosc F. Gupta S. Margolis R.L. Fotedar R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1995; 103: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nuclear staining of UNG also displays a nonhomogeneous distribution reminiscent of replication foci (33Nagelhus T.A. Slupphaug G. Lindmo T. Krokan H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although it has not been shown that UNG and replication foci colocalize. One of the functions of RPA2 could be to contribute to the localization of UNG in replication foci. UDG activity is not essential for DNA replication in E. coli or S. cerevisiae (34Duncan B.K. Miller J.H. Nature. 1980; 287: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 35Impellizzeri K.J. Anderson B. Burgers P.M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6807-6810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, it is essential for poxvirus replication (36Millns A.K. Carpenter M.S. DeLange A.M. Virology. 1994; 198: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and for the replication of a herpes virus (HSV1) in mammalian cells that do not express cellular UDG (37Focher F. Verri A. Verzeletti S. Mazzarello P. Spandari S. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In human cells, UNG is most actively transcribed very late in the G1-phase and UDG activity subsequently increases 2-3-fold early in the S-phase (8Slupphaug G. Olsen L.C. Helland D. Aasland R. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5131-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, an association of UDG activity with replicating SV40 minichromosomes (7Krokan H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 133: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) may indicate a possible function for UNG in replication or in an associated repair complex. The protease digestion in the present study indicates that the first approximately 80 amino acids, comprising the presequence of UNG, constitute a second structural domain separated from the previously reported structure of the catalytic domain by at least one protease-accessible site (6Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the nuclear and mitochondrial form of human UDG have a size corresponding to the “mature” form lacking the presequence of 77 amino acids, while a larger form that reacted with an antibody specific for the presequence was present in the cytosol fraction. In addition, transfection experiments indicated that the presequence was essential for mitochondrial import, but not for nuclear import (38Slupphaug G. Markussen F.-H. Olsen L.C. Aasland R. Aarsæther N. Bakke O. Krokan H.E. Helland D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2579-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, there are some inconsistencies in the literature regarding the size of nuclear UDG, since some reports indicate a size consistent with processing of the N-teminal end (39Talpaert-Borle M. Campagnari F. Creissen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1208-1214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Myrnes B. Wittwer C.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whereas others report a size essentially corresponding to the larger “preform” (41Seal G. Arenaz P. Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Domena J.D. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7320-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we do not yet know whether processing at the N-terminal end is a physiological process or merely an in vitro artifact during purification. Proteolytic cleavage of UDG during purification has been reported in yeast (43Percival K.J. Klein M.B. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2593-2598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a similar digestion of human nuclear UNG may take place. However, the interaction of the “presequence” of UNG with RPA, a truly pleiotropic nuclear protein, necessitates further studies on the biochemistry of nuclear uracil-DNA glycosylase and possible accessory proteins assisting in base excision repair.

In order to characterize the signaling pathway through which FGFR3 regulates cell growth, L6 cells lacking any endogenous FGFR were stably transfected with the two different human isoforms, FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc, that result from alternative splicing of exon III of the FGFR3 gene encoding the ligand binding domain. Expression of FGFR3 IIIc in stably transfected L6 cells conferred growth responses to several members of the FGF family including FGF-1, −2, −4, and −6, while FGFR3 IIIb-expressing cells responded only to FGF-1. Activation of FGFR3 upon ligand binding resulted in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. FGFR3 utilizes two different pools of adapter protein GRB2 to link to Ras. Activated FGFR3 predominantly interacts with GRB2·Sos in complex with a previously identified 90-kDa protein and designated protein 80K-H. In addition, 80K-H·GRB2·Sos complex was found to contain a novel 66-kDa protein. Tyrosine phophorylation of the 66-kDa protein was dependent on ligand activation of FGFR3, suggesting that the 66-kDa protein may play an important role in FGFR3-specific signaling. In addition to this unique pathway, FGFR3 also links to GRB2·Sos complex via the adapter protein Shc. Furthermore, activated FGFR3 was not able to induce dissociation of GRB2·Sos complex following Sos phosphorylation. In summary, FGFR3 signaling pathway utilizes two GRB2-containing complexes; Shc·GRB2·Sos and 80K-H·pp66·GRB2·Sos; these two complexes may alternatively link FGFG3 to mitogen-activated protein kinase. Finally, activated FGFR3 was also found to result in phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ but reduced phosphorylation of c-Src.

The FGFs exert their pleiotropic effects by binding with various specificities to a family of tyrosine kinase-linked cell surface receptors encoded by four separate genes (4Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). The variety of FGFR family receptors is increased by alternate exon splicing mechanisms, which provide further diversity and ligand specificity through swapping of exons encoding the ligand binding domain (5Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Werner S.

Among these FGFRs, FGFR3, which corresponds to the IIIc variant of FGFRs, was originally isolated from a human K562 cDNA library (10Keegan K. Johnson L. Williams L.T. Hayman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In previous studies, the FGFR3 IIIb was present in epithelial cell populations, while non-epithelial cell populations express the alternate form FGFR3 IIIc (9Murgue B. Tsunekawa S. Rosenberg I. deBeaumont M. Podolsky D.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5206-5211PubMed Google Scholar). More recently FGFR3 IIIb was found to promote cell proliferation in colonic epithelial cells (11Kanai M. Rosenberg I. Podolsky D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; Google Scholar). FGFR3 mRNA has also been reported to be expressed at high levels in cartilage, suggesting a role for FGFR3 in bone development (12Peters K.G. Werner S. Chen G. Williams L.T. Development. 1992; 114: 233-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of the murine FGFR3 gene resulted in severe and progressive bone dysplasia with enhanced and prolonged endochondorial bone growth (13Deng C. Wynshaw B.A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Thus, FGFR3 appears to mediate negative regulation of bone growth. Recent studies in FGFR3 have focused on mutations in FGFR3, which are associated with several bone abnormalities in humans (14Rousseau F. Bonaventure J. Legeai M.L. Pelet A. Rozet J.M. Maroteaux P.

Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4081-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the signaling pathway of FGFR3 has not yet been clarified. Binding of cognate ligand to FGFRs has been known to lead to receptor dimerization, followed by the activation of intrinsic kinase activity (18Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M.

Tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shc binds the adapter protein GRB2-nucleotide exchange factor Sos complex linking FGFR1 to the Ras signaling pathway. Several investigators have also demonstrated the involvement of a 90-kDa protein in FGFR1 and keratinocyte growth factor receptor but not in FGFR4 signaling pathway (29Friesel R. Burgess W.H.

Among these, Tyr766 in the carboxyl tail of FGFR1 provides a binding site for one of the SH2 domains of PLC-γ (20Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M.

Although all known FGFR have a consensus sequence corresponding to Tyr766 in FGFR1, PLC-γ phosphorylation caused by activated FGFR4 is considerably weaker than that by FGFR1 (21Wang J.K. Gao G.

Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that FGFR4 was phosphorylated mainly on serine and threonine residues and to a lesser degree on tyrosine residues upon ligand stimulation. Activated FGFR4 but not FGFR1 was associated with 85-kDa serine kinase (35Vainikka S. Joukov V. Wennstrom S. Bergman M. Pelicci P.G. Alitalo K. J. Biol.

Thus the subtle differences in cytoplasmic domain of FGFRs may confer different signaling and biological potentials in each FGFRs. Observations that both acidic FGF (aFGF) and basic FGF had a mitogenic effect on rat bladder carcinoma cells and that only aFGF caused cell dissociation and dispersion suggesting that these two biological activities could be mediated through distinct signaling pathways of different receptors (38Vallés A.M.

Radiochemicals ([γ-32P]ATP, [35S]methionine, and [3H]thymidine) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Human recombinant FGF-1 (aFGF), FGF-2 (basic FGF), FGF-4, FGF-5, FGF-6, and FGF-7 were obtained from R&D Systems.

GRB2 full-length glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein conjugated to agarose was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A full-length human cDNA encoding the FGFR3 IIIb protein was isolated from an oligo(dT)-primed HT-29 cDNA plasmid library in CDM8 vector, and cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (9Murgue B.

To construct FGFR3 IIIb expression vector, a BssHII/KpnI fragment was released from pBluescript containing full-length FGFR3 IIIb cDNA and subsequently ligated into a HindIII/KpnI-digested pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A cDNA fragment containing the region that encodes the ligand binding domain of FGFR3 IIIc was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Poly(A)+-enriched RNA (100 ng) from K-562 cells was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing random hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions (Perkin Elmer). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using 10 μl of the reverse transcription cDNA products with the primer pair of 5′-ACCGCATTGGAGGCATCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-AGTCGTGTGTTGGAGCTCAT-3′ for 35 cycles of 93°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pCR-Script (Stratagene). A PmlI/MulI fragment was digested and subsequently ligated into a PmlI/MulI-digested pcDNA3 plasmid containing FGFR3 IIIb cDNA. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method. The L6 rat myoblast cell line devoid of endogenous FGFR was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid containing full-length human cDNA encoding either FGFR3 IIIb or IIIc. Stable transfectants were established by selection in medium supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 weeks. The expression of FGFR3 protein was assessed by Western blotting using anti-FGFR3 antibody, which recognizes the common carboxyl terminus of FGFR3. One cloned cell line from each construct was chosen for further study. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml. In some experiments, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 2 h before and throughout a 3-h [35S]methionine-labeling period. The labeled cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FGFR3 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline for three times, cells were incubated for 12 h in serum-free medium. After stimulation with FGFs in the presence of heparin (1.25 μg/ml), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) containing phosphatase inhibitors (500 μM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate). After 30 min on ice, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The protein concentration in each sample was quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Antibodies to the respective proteins were added to the clarified cell lysates, then incubated for 2 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer. SDS-sample buffer was added, and the immune complexes were boiled for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed through a 7.5% or a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After saturation in blocking buffer (1 × Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin), the blots were incubated for 4 h room temperature or overnight 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After washing in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, incubation with appropriate secondary antibody diluted in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk was performed for 45 min at room temperature, and binding was detected using Renaissance chemiluminescent reagents (DuPont), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some immunoblots were stripped of antibodies with 62.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS containing 100 mMβ-mercaptoethanol at 50°C for 30 min. GRB2-GST fusion protein conjugated to agarose was added to clarified cell lysate at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (5-μl bead volume with 5 μg of protein), then incubated for 2 h. After washing in lysis buffer as described above, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. Anti-Raf-1, anti-ERK1, or anti-ERK2 antibody was individually added to the clarified cell lysates, then incubated for 2 h and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed two times with lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer. The immune complexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 7.5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma). Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 25°C and terminated by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 104 L6 cells expressing FGFR3 were seeded into 96-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Twelve hours before adding FGFs, cells were washed three times and then cultured for 20 h in serum-free medium containing FGFs in concentrations ranging from 5 to 5000 pM in the presence of heparin (1.25 μg/ml). 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. Cells were harvested after 4 h by filtration through glass fiber filters. Incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. The L6 rat myoblast cell line has been used extensively to study the signaling and biological functions of FGFR because this cell line does not express any endogenous FGFRs. In order to characterize pathways mediating FGFR3 response without the confounding presence of other FGFRs, L6 cells were stably transfected with plasmid pcDNA3 containing full-length cDNA encoding the two isoforms FGFR3 IIIb and FGFR3 IIIc. After prolonged culture in selection medium, the transfectants were assessed for expression of the FGFR3 by Western blot analysis. Western blotting of protein lysates from cloned cells transfected with FGFR3 IIIb using an antibody that recognizes the carboxyl terminus of FGFR3 demonstrated that FGFR3 IIIb protein was indeed present in this clone as a 125-kDa glycoprotein, while IIIc-transfected cells expressed a 135-kDa protein (Fig. 1A). To determine the basis of the molecular weight difference observed between the two forms of FGFR3, FGFR3 IIIb and IIIc were immunoprecipitated after metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine of cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. FGFR3 IIIb transfectants yielded a 97-kDa protein, while IIIc yielded a 105-kDa protein (Fig. 1B). In aggregate, Western blotting confirmed successful expression of intact FGFR3s in the stable transfectants. Ligand specificities of murine FGFR3 have been previously reported (8Chellaiah A.T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16305-16311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the region of the third Ig-like domain closest to the transmembrane domain which determines ligand specificity of FGFR3 is highly conserved between mouse and human, there is still some sequence divergence between the FGFs in these two species. After establishing stable transfectants of FGFR3s, subsequent studies were carried out to determine the ligand binding specificity of human FGFR3. L6 cells expressing FGFR3 IIIb or IIIc were stimulated with each of six human recombinant FGFs for 15 min in the presence of 1.25 μg/ml of heparin. After stimulation, cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FGFR antibody. The immune complexes precipitated by anti-FGFR antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE, and autophosphorylation of FGFR3 was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, only FGF-1 induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR3 IIIb (Fig. 2A), while FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, and FGF-6 all induced equivalent phosphorylation of FGFR3 IIIc (Fig. 2B). In parallel studies, the mitogenic response of transfectants to FGFs was assessed. The stable transfectants exhibited a comparable pattern of mitogenic response to FGFs similar to that found in phosphorylation. Thus cells stably expressing FGFR3 IIIb responded only to FGF-1 (Fig. 3A), while cells expressing FGFR3 IIIc responded well to FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, and FGF-6 (Fig. 3B). The non-transfected L6 parent was unresponsive to all FGFs. In order to analyze the time course of receptor autophosphorylation, FGFR3-expressing L6 cells were stimulated for 1, 5, and 15 min with 1 nM aFGF in the presence of 1.25 μg/ml heparin. Tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins in total cell lysate or the immune complex precipitated by anti-FGFR were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Stimulation of L6 cells expressing FGFR3 resulted in tyrosine phophorylation of several proteins including the transfected receptor itself, as well as 175-, 90-, 66-, 44-, and 42-kDa proteins (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, autophosphorylation of FGFR3 can be detected within 1 min of stimulation and is maximal at 15 min. Of note, a tyrosyl-phosphorylated 90-kDa protein was co-precipitated with FGFR3 between 5 and 15 min after stimulation. To determine the potential role of Shc, a SH2 domain-containing protein that anchors GRB2 to receptor tyrosine kinase (40Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Shc and its binding to FGFR3 were analyzed. After 5 min of stimulation of FGFR3-expressing L6 cells with aFGF, the 52-kDa form of Shc was prominently phosphorylated. The 46-kDa form of Shc was phosphorylated to a lesser degree, but no phosphorylation of the 66-kDa form of Shc was detected. (Fig. 5A). As a control, the same blot was stripped and rehybridized with anti-Shc antibody to verify the equivalent immunoprecipitation of 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa isoforms of Shc (Fig. 5B). Subsequently, experiments were carried out to assess the potential binding of Shc to activated FGFR3. Immunoprecipitation using FGFR3 antiserum followed by immunoblotting using Shc antiserum could not demonstrate direct binding of 46- and 52-kDa forms of Shc to activated FGFR3. In contrast the 66-kDa form of Shc, which was not phosphorylated after stimulation by aFGF, appeared to bind to FGFR3 constitutively (Fig. 5C). To analyze the components interacting with GRB2 in response to FGFR3 activation, lysates from aFGF-stimulated L6 cells expressing FGFR3 were subjected to immunoprecipitation using GRB2 antiserum or GST-GRB2, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 6A). GRB2 immunoprecipitates were also subjected to GRB2 immunoblotting, which confirmed that equal amounts of GRB2 were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6B). The prominent tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein interacting with GRB2 is a 90-kDa protein that appears to be identical to the 90-kDa protein found to bind to activated FGFR3 directly (Fig. 4B). To identify this protein, cell lysate from aFGF-stimulated L6 cells expressing FGFR3 was incubated with GST-GRB2. Material bound to GST-GRB2 was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or anti-80K-H antibody, an antibody that recognizes a previously identified 90-kDa phosphoprotein involved in FGFR1 signaling pathway (32Goh K.C.

Immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies resulted in localization of the same tyrosine phosphorylation as found after immunoblotting of anti-GRB2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Immunoblotting with anti-80K-H antibody confirmed the identity of the 90-kDa protein (Fig. 6C). In addition to the 90-kDa (80K-H) protein, 66- and 52-kDa tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were found to interact with GRB2. It is likely that the 52-kDa protein is the 52-kDa component of Shc on the basis of its molecular weight and binding to GRB2. To demonstrate in vivo binding of Shc to GRB2, GRB2 immunoprecipitates were subjected to Shc immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6D, the binding of 52-kDa component of Shc to GRB2 was detecta"
https://openalex.org/W2010778834,"The nature and extent of carbohydrate modification in intraerythrocytic stage Plasmodium falciparum proteins have been controversial. This study describes the characterization of the carbohydrates in intraerythrocytic P. falciparum proteins and provides an overall picture of the nature of carbohydrate modification in the parasite proteins. P. falciparum strains were metabolically labeled with radioactive sugar precursors and ethanolamine at different developmental stages. The individual parasite proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and whole parasite cell lysates were analyzed for the carbohydrate moieties. The results established the following: 1) glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors represent the major carbohydrate modification in the intraerythrocytic stage P. falciparum proteins; 2) in contrast to previous reports, O-linked carbohydrates are either absent or present only at very low levels in the parasite; and 3) P. falciparum contains low levels of N-glycosylation capability. The amount of N-linked carbohydrates in whole parasite proteins is ∼6% compared with the GPI anchors attached to proteins based on radioactive GlcN incorporated into the proteins. The glycan cores of multiple parasite protein GPI anchors are all similar, consisting of protein-ethanolamine-phosphate-(Manα1-2)6Manα1-2Manα1-6Manα1- 4GlcN. The fourth Man residues distal to GlcN of the GPI anchor glycan cores contain unidentified substituents that are susceptible to conditions of nitrous acid deamination. This unusual structural feature may contribute to the reported pathogenic properties of the P. falciparum GPI anchors."

https://openalex.org/W2093243180,"Metaxin, a novel gene located between the glucocerebrosidase and thrombospondin 3 genes in the mouse, is essential for survival of the postimplantation mouse embryo. In this study, the subcellular location, domain structure, and biochemical function of metaxin were investigated. Anti-recombinant metaxin antibodies recognized 35- and 70-kDa proteins in mitochondria from various tissues; the 35-kDa protein is consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin cDNA. When metaxin cDNA was transfected into COS cells, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the protein is located in mitochondria. Metaxin contains a putative mitochondrial outer membrane signal anchor domain at its C terminus, and a truncated form of metaxin lacking this signal anchor domain had a reduced association with mitochondria. In addition, metaxin was highly susceptible to proteases in intact mitochondria. We therefore conclude that metaxin is a mitochondrial protein that extends into the cytosol while anchored into the outer membrane at its C terminus. In its N-terminal region, metaxin shows significant sequence identity to Tom37, a component of the outer membrane portion of the mitochondrial preprotein translocation apparatus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but important structural differences, including apparently different mechanisms of targeting to membranes, also exist between the two proteins. Given the similar subcellular locations of metaxin and Tom37, the possible role of metaxin in mitochondrial preprotein import was investigated. Antibodies against metaxin, when preincubated with mitochondria, partially inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled preadrenodoxin into mitochondria. Metaxin is therefore the second mammalian component of the protein translocation apparatus of the mitochondrial outer membrane to be characterized at the molecular level and the first for which an inherited mutation has been described. The early embryonic lethal phenotype of mice lacking metaxin demonstrates that efficient import of proteins into mitochondria is crucial for cellular survival. The characterization of metaxin provides an opportunity to elucidate similarities and possible differences in the mechanisms of protein import between fungi and mammals and in the phenotypes of fungi and mammals lacking mitochondrial import receptors.

During studies of thrombospondin 3 (Thbs3), which encodes an extracellular matrix protein (2Vos H.L. Devarayalu S. De Vries Y. Bornstein P. J. Biol.

Genet. 1995; 32: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a novel gene, termed metaxin (Mtx), was found to span the interval between Thbs3 and Gba on chromosome 3E3-F1 in the mouse (6Bornstein P. McKinney C.E. LaMarca M.E. Winfield S. Shingu T. Devarayalu S. Vos H.L. Ginns E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mtx and Thbs3 are situated in a head-to-head orientation, with the translation start sites 1.4 kilobase pairs apart. Gba and Mtx lie in a tail-to-tail orientation, with the polyadenylation sites spaced 431 base pairs apart. The Mtx promoter resembles the promoters for housekeeping genes in that it is TATA-less, GC-rich, and regulated by tandem Sp1 elements within 300 base pairs of the transcription start site (7Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the close apposition and head-to-head orientation of Mtx and Thbs3 raise the possibility that the two genes share a bidirectional promoter, several lines of evidence suggest that these genes are regulated independently. First, Mtx mRNA is ubiquitously distributed in the mouse, whereas Thbs3 mRNA is restricted to lung, cartilage, the gastrointestinal tract, and hippocampus (2Vos H.L. Devarayalu S. De Vries Y. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12192-12196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Iruela-Arispe M.L. Liska D.J. Sage E.H. Bornstein P. Dev.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1262-1269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, the basal elements of the Mtx and Thbs3 promoters can largely be dissociated, which indicates that the Mtx and Thbs3 genes are not regulated by a true bidirectional promoter (7Collins M. Bornstein P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the process of producing a subtle mutation in Gba, a neomycin cassette was inadvertently placed in exon 8 of Mtx (6Bornstein P. McKinney C.E. LaMarca M.E. Winfield S. Shingu T. Devarayalu S. Vos H.L. Ginns E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for this disruption have an embryonic lethal phenotype, indicating that metaxin is necessary for the early development of the mouse embryo. This severe phenotype is in contrast to the phenotype of mice lacking glucocerebrosidase, which die shortly after birth with Gaucher disease-like symptoms. Because Mtx mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the adult mouse, it is likely that metaxin has a fundamental role in an as-yet-undefined cellular process. To gain insight into its function and to examine the possible metabolic relationship between metaxin and glucocerebrosidase and/or thrombospondin 3, we have investigated the subcellular location of metaxin and have found that it is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein. Metaxin has significant sequence identity to a component of the yeast mitochondrial protein import machinery, Tom37 (10Gratzer S. Lithgow T. Bauer R.E. Lamping E. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Haucke V. Junne T. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that metaxin also functions in the import of mitochondrial preproteins into mammalian mitochondria, although its mode of function may differ in important respects from that of Tom37.

Inclusion bodies containing GST-metaxin were cleaved with thrombin, and the metaxin portion was purified by electrophoresis and electroelution.

Metaxin was placed under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and transfected into COS cells by electroporation. Electroporations were performed in a BRL Cell-Porator set at 150 V, 800 microfarads, with a 0.4-cm cuvette containing 1.5 × 106 cells in 500 μl of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM dextrose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were plated at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml into either glass chamber slides (for immunofluorescence) or tissue culture dishes (for cell lysis). After 48 h, cells were lysed with 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and examined by Western blotting. Cells in chamber slides were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 1% sucrose, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in ethanol. Indirect immunofluorescence staining for metaxin was performed with 1:200 diluted affinity-purified anti-metaxin antibody and 1:200 anti-guinea pig IgG-fluorescein conjugate. In some experiments, prior to fixation, the cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 nM MitoTracker™ (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscropy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal laser scanning microscope (W. M. Keck Center for Advanced Studies in Neural Signaling, University of Washington), with excitation settings of 488 and 568 nm that emitted in the green and red, respectively. The metaxin deletion construct, pcDNA3metΔC, spans amino acids 1- 303 and was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-ApaI fragment of the metaxin cDNA to pcDNA3. The deletion construct, pcDNA3metΔTM/C, spans amino acids 1-269 and was constructed by ligating the EcoRI-BglI fragment of metaxin to pcDNA3. These constructs were transfected into COS cells and examined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting as above, except that a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL, Amersham Corp.) were used to visualize metaxin. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was performed with a Bio-Rad GS-670 Imaging Densitometer. Stable cell populations expressing intact and truncated forms of metaxin were prepared by incubating transfected COS cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and 800 μg/ml G418. The enhanced green fluorescent protein vector pEGFP C1 (Clontech) was utilized to examine the targeting domain of metaxin. The EGFP/metaxin C-terminal fragment fusion vector, pEGFPmetC, encodes EGFP followed by amino acids 260-317 of metaxin. COS cells transfected with EGFP expression vectors were incubated with MitoTracker, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by confocal microscopy, as above. Immunoblotting for EGFP was performed with a rabbit anti-EGFP antiserum (Clontech) at a 1:2000 dilution. Mitochondria were prepared as described (17Schnaitmann C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), and mitoplasts were prepared by incubating 10 mg/ml mitochondria with 2 mg/ml digitonin in Schnaitmann and Greenawalt buffer A (220 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 2 mM HEPES, pH 7.3) for 15 min on ice. The reaction was diluted 5-fold in buffer A, and mitoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation. For protease sensitivity assays, mitochondria or mitoplasts were incubated at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in buffer A with varying concentrations of trypsin for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mM and soybean trypsin inhibitor to 2.5 mg/ml. The mitochondria or mitoplasts were pelleted at 7000 × g and washed four times in buffer A containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The final pellet was resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 7% SDS. Samples were examined by Western blotting with anti-metaxin antibodies (see above) or anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (Molecular Probes). Mitochondrial import of preadrenodoxin was assayed as described previously (18Komiya T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, 125I-labeled preadrenodoxin was incubated with 150-200 μg of rabbit reticulocyte lysate in 50 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM potassium acetate and 2 mM magnesium acetate at 30°C for 30 min. The substrate mixture was incubated with mouse liver mitochondria (100 μg) in 100 μl of the “import buffer” (10 mM HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.4 containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.22 M mannitol, and 0.07 M sucrose) containing 5 mM NADH, 20 mM sodium succinate, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.1 mM GTP, 1.5 mM creatine phosphate, and 15 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase at 30°C for 50 min. Mitochondria were then separated by centrifugation and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were analyzed with a Fuji Bioimage Analyzer BAS2000. Antibodies against recombinant metaxin recognize a 35- and a 70-kDa protein in lysates of all mouse tissues that were examined (data not shown). The predicted translation product of metaxin cDNA is 317 amino acids in length, which corresponds closely to the 35-kDa band that we observe. The ubiquity of metaxin protein is in keeping with the wide distribution of metaxin mRNA (6Bornstein P. McKinney C.E. LaMarca M.E. Winfield S. Shingu T. Devarayalu S. Vos H.L. Ginns E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mouse liver was fractionated into its constituent subcellular organelles, and these fractions were assayed for the presence of metaxin by Western blotting (Fig. 1A) and for marker enzymes (not shown). Antibodies against metaxin recognized 35- and 34-kDa bands in mitochondria and in the cytosol, respectively. The 70-kDa band was found solely in mitochondria. To determine whether this subcellular distribution was characteristic of metaxin in other tissues, mouse heart, kidney, liver, and lung were separated into a mitochondrial fraction and a post-mitochondrial supernatant, which contains microsomes and cytosol. In subcellular fractions of mouse heart, kidney, and lung, no cytosolic band was detected, whereas the mitochondrial 35- and 70-kDa bands were present (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial metaxin has a tissue distribution like that of metaxin mRNA and therefore likely represents the authentic metaxin protein. It is unclear whether the 34-kDa liver cytosolic band is related to metaxin or is a cross-reactive protein. The relationship of the 70-kDa protein to metaxin is also unclear, but the fact that the two proteins are found together in mitochondria and in the same tissues suggests that the 70-kDa form could represent a denaturation-resistant homo- or heterodimer containing the 35-kDa protein. The subcellular distribution of metaxin was also determined in cultured cells by immunofluorescence. Several mouse cell lines were stained for metaxin, but the endogenous concentrations of metaxin were too low to permit detection by immunofluorescence. Therefore, COS cells were transiently transfected with a full-length metaxin cDNA, and after 48 h, indirect immunofluorescence was performed with anti-metaxin antibody. The overexpressed metaxin protein had a punctate distribution within the cytoplasm with heavier staining in the perinuclear region that was consistent with a mitochondrial location (Fig. 2a). In addition, weaker diffuse staining throughout the cytosol was observed. Mitochondria were detected by incubation of the cells with MitoTracker™ dye prior to fixation and staining for metaxin (Fig. 2b). A merged image of the staining for metaxin and mitochondria (Fig. 2c) revealed a partial colocalization (indicated by yellow color). In this experiment, metaxin does have a wider distribution than mitochondria, which can be due to the possibility that overexpressed metaxin has saturated chaperones and/or receptors responsible for its mitochondrial localization. A similar staining pattern was observed in cell lines stably expressing metaxin cDNA (data not shown). In sum, examination of its distribution by immunofluorescence and by subcellular fractionation indicates that metaxin has a mitochondrial location within the cell. The majority of proteins that are to be directed to the interior of mitochondria contain a cleavable, N-terminal, amphiphilic, positively charged sequence of 12-70 amino acids that acts as a signal peptide (19Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metaxin contains no positively charged residues within its first 20 amino acids, and a helical wheel projection of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of metaxin did not reveal a predilection toward amphiphilicity (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that metaxin resides in the interior of mitochondria. Near its C terminus, metaxin contains a 23-amino acid stretch of hydrophobic and hydroxy amino acids that is predicted to form a transmembrane sequence by the PHDhtm transmembrane topology prediction computer program (20Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). This transmembrane sequence is flanked at its N terminus by three consecutive arginine residues and is followed by a sequence of 7 amino acids that contains 2 arginines and no negatively charged amino acids. This sequence motif resembles the C-terminal mitochondrial outer membrane targeting domains of Bcl-2 (21Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monoamine oxidase A (22Mitoma J. Ito A. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Yeast Tom70 contains a motif of similar character but at its N terminus (23Hase T. Müller U. Riezman H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that metaxin is an outer membrane protein with a C-terminal signal anchor sequence and a majority of the protein in the cytosol was first tested by determining its protease susceptibility in intact mitochondria. Mitochondria were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin, and the presence of metaxin was examined by Western blotting. Metaxin was found to be susceptible to very low concentrations of trypsin (Fig. 3B). At lower concentrations of trypsin, a 30-kDa proteolytic fragment of metaxin was evident, whereas at higher concentrations, complete disappearance of metaxin was observed. In mitochondria incubated with 1% trypsin (w/w mitochondria), a 30-kDa band also appears in the supernatant (not shown); presumably, the supernatant form is a metaxin fragment lacking a membrane anchor. Under these same conditions, cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV, an inner membrane protein that protrudes into the inner membrane space and is partially cleaved by trypsin in mitoplasts (24Jarausch J. Kadenbach B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 146: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was not digested by trypsin, demonstrating that general degradation of proteins within the interior of the mitochondria did not occur (Fig. 3B, COX IV). However, when the outer membrane of mitochondria was removed from the inner membrane/matrix fraction (mitoplasts), metaxin remained in association with the mitoplast fraction (data not shown). Certain outer membrane proteins, such as Bcl-2, exhibit this behavior, presumably as a result of their association with contact sites between the outer and the inner membrane (21Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 70-kDa cross-reactive species was resistant to trypsin in intact mitochondria but was susceptible in mitoplasts (data not shown). The requirement for the putative transmembrane sequence in the mitochondrial localization of metaxin was tested by making truncations of the metaxin C-terminal region. The first deletion construct, pcDNA3metΔC, encodes a metaxin that lacks the C-terminal 15 amino acids, which are not predicted to contain targeting information (Fig. 3A). As judged by indirect immunofluorescence of COS cells transfected with pcDNA3metΔC, metaxin lacking its C-terminal 15 amino acids retained its mitochondrial location (Fig. 4A, a-c), and furthermore the COS cells appeared to have a lower background of cytosolic staining than did cells transfected with the intact metaxin cDNA. The second deletion construct, pcDNA3metΔTM/C, encodes a metaxin that lacks the 48 C-terminal amino acids, a region that includes the transmembrane domain (Fig. 3A). The metaxin lacking this transmembrane domain was distributed diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 4A, d-f), indicating that the transmembrane domain is required for proper mitochondrial distribution of metaxin. Stable cell populations expressing full-length metaxin and the two C-terminal deletion constructs were prepared by selection with G418. Mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation and analyzed for metaxin by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). The percentage of total cellular overexpressed metaxin that was associated with mitochondria was calculated by densitometric analysis of Western blots from three separate experiments (Fig. 4C). Small amounts of metaxin were detectable in the mitochondrial fraction of COS cells transfected with vector alone. COS/metaxin cells accumulated metaxin to a high concentration in the mitochondrial fraction and contained a lower concentration of metaxin in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction (Fig. 4B). The percentage of total cellular metaxin associated with mitochondria (28.1 ± 1.2% (mean ± S.D.)) was lower than that in the cytosol (Fig. 4C), because the protein content of the cytosolic fraction is much larger than that of mitochondria. COS/metΔC cells contained similar concentrations of metaxin in their mitochondria as did COS/metaxin cells (Fig. 4B) but contained less metaxin in the post-mitochondrial supernatant; 67.1 ± 3.9% (mean ± S.D.) of the total cellular metaxinΔC was associated with mitochondria (Fig. 4C). This difference suggests that the C-terminal 15 amino acids inhibit association of metaxin with mitochondria. COS/metΔTM/C cells, on the other hand, had reduced concentrations of plasmid-encoded mitochondrial metaxin, compared with COS/metaxin and COS/metΔC cells (Fig. 4B); only 1.6 ± 1.5% of the total cellular metaxinΔTM/C (mean ± S.D.) was found in mitochondria (Fig. 4C). Thus, in general, the independent approaches of immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation give similar estimates of relative cytosolic and mitochondrial concentrations of metaxin. The C-terminal sequences of Bcl-2 and monoamine oxidase are sufficient to target a heterologous, nonmitochondrial protein to the mitochondrial outer membrane. To test whether the C-terminal region of metaxin is sufficient to act as a mitochondrial outer membrane targeting sequence, the C-terminal amino acids of metaxin (260-317) were fused in frame to EGFP in the pEGFP vector to yield the pEGFPmetC fusion vector. COS cells were transfected with either pEGFP or pEGFPmetC and analyzed by either Western blot or fluorescence. As predicted, anti-EGFP recognized 30- and 35-kDa bands in lysates of cells transfected with pEGFP and pEGFPmetC, respectively (Fig. 5A, anti-EGFP). Anti-metaxin antibody recognized only the 35-kDa band in cell lysates of pEGFPmetC transfected cells, demonstrating that the metaxin portion of the fusion protein was synthesized (Fig. 5A, anti-metaxin). When these cells were analyzed by fluorescence, EGFP was distributed throughout the cell, with a preponderance of the protein in the nucleus (Fig. 5B, a-c). EGFPmetC, on the other hand, was absent from the nucleus and had a restricted distribution in the cytoplasm that only partially overlapped that of mitochondria (Fig. 5B, d-f). The broad distribution of EGFPmetC may be due in part to saturation of the targeting machinery, as may be the case with full-length metaxin. However, EGFPmetC overlaps mitochondria to a lesser extent than does full-length metaxin (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the C-terminal region of metaxin appears to be necessary but not entirely sufficient to direct proteins to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Several proteins with distant sequence identity to metaxin were detected by searching the protein data bases with the BLAST function. Metaxin has 25% sequence identity over 143 amino acids to Tom37, a yeast protein that is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane and participates in the import of mitochondrial preproteins into the mitochondria (10Gratzer S. Lithgow T. Bauer R.E. Lamping E. Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Haucke V. Junne T. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The highest degree of identity occurs between the N-terminal regions of the proteins, from amino acids 35 to 165 of metaxin and amino acids 43 and 185 of Tom37; no significant sequence identity occurs within the C-terminal halves of the proteins (data not shown). Another apparent difference exists in the mitochondrial outer membrane targeting domains of the two proteins, because Tom37 has an N-terminal targeting sequence, and metaxin has a C-terminal targeting sequence. Given the similarity in the subcellular locations and sequence of metaxin and Tom37, we tested the hypothesis that metaxin functions in mitochondrial import in a manner similar to that of Tom37. Preadrenodoxin, labeled with 125I, was incubated with purified mitochondria that had been preincubated in the absence of antibodies or in the presence of either anti-metaxin antibodies or antibodies against porin, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that is not involved in mitochondrial protein import. The anti-metaxin antibodies inhibited uptake of the preadrenodoxin in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6). Mitochondria treated with the highest concentrations of anti-metaxin imported 10% of the preadrenodoxin relative to untreated mitochondria. Preincubation in the presence of anti-porin antibodies had no effect on preadrenodoxin import. Thus, metaxin acts in the mitochondrial outer membrane to promote import of mitochondrial preproteins. We have attempted to answer the question of whether metaxin is a functional mammalian homologue of Tom37 by assessment of the ability of metaxin cDNA to restore a wild type phenotype to [email protected], a tom37 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (kindly provided by Sabin"

Dioctanoyl-phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which does not have a 5-phosphate, and 4,5-O-bisphosphoryl-D-myo-inosityl 1-O-(1,2-O-diundecyl)-sn-3-glycerylphosphate, which does not have a 3-phosphate, were, respectively, 2-fold and 4-fold less potent than DiC8-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as inhibitors of clathrin assembly. Deacylation of DiC8-PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 reduced its affinity for AP-3 almost 20-fold, and also dramatically lowered its ability to inhibit clathrin assembly. The deacylated products of the soluble derivatives of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were both not significant inhibitors of clathrin assembly. It therefore appears that the interactions of inositides with AP-3 should not be considered simply in terms of electrostatic effects of the highly charged phosphate groups.

https://openalex.org/W2095419805,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is required for normal embryonic development and postnatal growth. Like most hormones and growth factors, IGF-I is synthesized as a proprotein that is converted to the mature form by endoproteolysis. Processing of pro-IGF-I to mature IGF-I occurs by cleavage within the unique pentabasic processing motif Lys-X-X-Lys-X-X-Arg71-X-X-Arg-X-X-Arg77. We have previously shown that human embryonic kidney 293 cells process pro-IGF-IA at Arg71 to generate IGF-I-(1-70) and at Arg77 to produce IGF-I-(1-76). Cleavage at each of these sites requires upstream basic residues, indicating that subtilisin-related proprotein convertases (SPCs) may be involved. In order to investigate the identity of the endogenous enzymes involved in maturation of pro-IGF-IA, we have expressed wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA in 293 cells and in the furin-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line, RPE.40. We have also co-expressed these constructs with SPCs that are thought to play a role in processing precursor proteins in the constitutive pathway: furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC. The results show that furin is most active at cleaving wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA and can cleave these precursors at multiple sites within the pentabasic motif. PC6A and LPC are less active than furin but cleave only at Arg71. PACE4 and PC6B have very little activity on pro-IGF-IA precursors. Wild-type pro-IGF-IA was correctly processed to mature IGF-I in 10 of 10 cell lines that were tested. Since furin, PC6A, and LPC are known to have a broad pattern of tissue distribution and we have demonstrated expression of LPC in RPE.40 cells, our results suggest that these SPCs may be responsible for the endogenous pro-IGF-IA processing activity observed in a wide variety of cell lines.

Most hormones and growth factors are initially synthesized as inactive propeptide precursors that are post-translationally processed to the biologically active mature peptide. The subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs) are a family of enzymes that have been shown to play an important role in the maturation of prohormones and growth factors as well as a number of other protein precursors. PC2 and PC3 (also known as PC1) are restricted in expression to endocrine and neuroendocrine cells and process substrates such as proinsulin and proopiomelanocortin. PC4 is expressed in the testis, and substrates for this processing enzyme have not yet been identified. In contrast, furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC (also known as PC7, SPC7, and PC8) are expressed in many tissues and may have an important function in proteolytic processing of precursors in the constitutive secretory pathway (6Steiner D.F.

The mature, 70-amino acid IGF-I molecule can be generated from two different prohormone precursors, pro-IGF-IA or pro-IGF-IB. Pro-IGF-IA and pro-IGF-IB are derived from a single gene by alternative splicing of 3′-exons. The prohormone sequences are identical through the B, C, A, and D domains of mature IGF-I as well as the first 16 amino acids of the E domain or pro-region. Pro-IGF-IA and pro-IGF-IB, therefore, contain the same prohormone processing site at the junction of the D and E domains but diverge in sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the pro-region (1Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr. Rev. 1989; 10: 68-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). In our previous study on pro-IGF-I processing, we found that expression of pro-IGF-IA in human embryonic kidney 293 cells resulted in secretion of N-glycosylated pro-IGF-IA, pro-IGF-IA, IGF-I-(1-76), and IGF-I-(1-70). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that IGF-I-(1-76) is produced by cleavage at Arg77 and that IGF-I-(1-70) is generated by cleavage at Arg71. Cleavage at both of these positions required a P4 basic residue (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, cleavage at Arg71 occurred in the furin-deficient LoVo and RPE.40 cell lines, indicating that another processing enzyme must be involved in maturation of pro-IGF-IA (13Duguay S.J.

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc) with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). RPE.40 cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RPE.40 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc). For co-transfection experiments, 5 μg of prohormone cDNA was co-precipitated with 5 μg of SPC cDNA. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed two times in PBS and incubated for 2 h in cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The medium was then replaced with cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (Amersham Corp.; 1000 Ci/mmol), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After labeling for 24 h, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Conditioned medium was concentrated on a Sep-Pak (Waters), eluted and lyophilized, as described previously (13Duguay S.J. Lai-Zhang J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17566-17574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lyophilized proteins were reconstituted in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 3 μg of M1 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI) and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were washed two times in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and then once in buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2. Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in SDS-sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and denatured by heating at 95°C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 16% Tricine-buffered polyacrylamide gels with a 4% stack at 4°C (18Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10498) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 25% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min and then soaked in a fluorographic solution (Amplify, Amersham) for 15 min. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) with an intensifying screen for 4 h to 2 days unless stated otherwise. Quantitation of individual bands was done using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA was prepared from RPE.40 cells and transcribed to cDNA with Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hamster LPC was amplified using degenerate PCR primers LPC-3 and LPC-4 that were designed to anneal to unique sequences coding for the P domain. The LPC-3 primer (5′-TT(T/C)TG(T/C)CCNAG(T/C)GGNATGATG) corresponds to the amino acid sequence 547FCPSGMM553, and LPC-4 (5′-AT(G/C)GT(A/G)TANCC(A/G)TC(T/C)TC(T/C)TC) encodes 654EEDGYTI660. The 342-bp PCR product was end-filled, blunt end-ligated to pBluescript (Stratagene), and sequenced. For Northern blot analysis, 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from RPE.40 cells was electrophoresed through 1% agarose, blotted to a HyBond membrane (Amersham), and probed with a 32P-labeled 342-base pair PCR product encoding the P domain of hamster LPC. Standard molecular biology protocols were followed (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). Our previous study on pro-IGF-IA processing utilized the pCMVigf1-FLAG expression vector. This vector directs expression of human prepro-IGF-IA containing the eight-amino acid FLAG epitope between Ala−1 of the signal peptide and Gly+1 of the B domain. We have shown that the FLAG peptide does not affect co-translational or post-translational processing of prepro-IGF-IA. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with pCMVigf1-FLAG secrete N-glycosylated pro-IGF-IA, pro-IGF-IA, IGF-I-(1-76), and IGF-I-(1-70) (13Duguay S.J. Lai-Zhang J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17566-17574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present work, we sought to determine 1) if any of the known SPCs could process pro-IGF-IA and 2) if Arg for Lys substitutions at the P4 and/or the P7 positions would affect processing by endogenous or exogenous enzymes. The primary sequences of the cleavage sites of wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA-FLAG constructs used in this study are indicated in Fig. 1. The results of expression of these constructs in 293 cells and their processing by endogenous enzymes or SPCs are shown in Fig. 2 and Table I.Table I.Processing of wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA in 293 cellsConstructsLys/Arg68aAssignment of this cleavage site is tentative.Arg71Arg77Pro%WT0454510WT + furin189010WT + PACE4055432WT + PC6A059347WT + PC6B054388WT + LPC073189K65R0454510K65R + furin316009K65R + PACE4061364K65R + PC6A071236K65R + PC6B059329K65R + LPC0672310K68R087013K68R + furin3454012K65R/K68R266509K65R/K68R + furin890011a Assignment of this cleavage site is tentative. Open table in a new tab When wild-type pro-IGF-IA and pCMV6c (as a negative control) are co-transfected in 293 cells, two major bands corresponding to IGF-I-(1-70) and IGF-I-(1-76) are detected in conditioned medium (Fig. 2A). The diffuse band that migrates at approximately 20 kDa corresponds to N-glycosylated pro-IGF-IA (see marker on Fig. 2E). Cells are continuously labeled for approximately 24 h after transfection, and under these conditions approximately 45% of the IGF recovered from conditioned medium is IGF-I-(1-70) and 45% is IGF-I-(1-76). When wild-type pro-IGF-IA is co-transfected with pCMV-furin, 89% of the precursor is processed to IGF-I-(1-70). An additional band is visible that migrates slightly faster than IGF-I-(1-70) and has a molecular mass of approximately 7 kDa. The 7-kDa band is not present in the absence of pCMV-furin. Furin has been reported to cleave at lysine residues (19Horimoto T. Nakayama K. Smeekens S.P. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6074-6078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this band may result from processing at Lys65-X-X-Lys68 to generate IGF-I-(1-67). The pattern observed for processing of the K65R mutant by enzymes endogenous to 293 cells is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to processing of wild-type pro-IGF-IA. In the presence of furin the main processing product is again IGF-I-(1-70). A 7-kDa band is also present and is more intense than the the minor cleavage product produced by co-expression of wild-type pro-IGF-IA with furin. This band may result from cleavage at Arg65 or Lys68. The K68R mutant shifts the Lys68-X-X-Arg71 processing motif of pro-IGF-IA upstream by three amino acids to Lys65-X-X-Arg68 and creates a new minimal furin site at Arg68-X-X-Arg71 (see Fig. 1). When the K68R mutant is co-transfected with pCMV6c in 293 cells, IGF-I-(1-70) is the major product, and IGF-I-(1-76) is not detected (Fig. 2A). A faint band is visible below IGF-I-(1-70) in Fig. 2A However, this product is not produced consistently from K68R by the endogenous processing enzymes (see Fig. 2, B, C, D, and E). In the presence of furin, 54% of the K68R precursor is processed to IGF-I-(1-70), and 34% is processed to a 7-kDa product that likely represents cleavage at the Lys65-X-X-Arg68 site. The K65R/K68R mutant contains arginine residues at positions 65, 68, 71, 74, and 77. Processing enzymes endogenous to 293 cells generate two products from this precursor (Fig. 2A). The upper band represents 65% of the precursor and corresponds to IGF-I-(1-70). The 7-kDa band represents 26% of the precursor and may result from cleavage at Arg65 or Arg68. Furin processes 89% of the K65R/K68R precursor to the 7-kDa form, and IGF-I-(1-70) is not detected. When PACE4 is co-expressed with wild-type pro-IGF-IA or the K65R mutant, IGF-I-(1-70) and IGF-I-(1-76) are the only cleavage products, lower molecular weight forms are not produced (Fig. 2B). PhosphorImager analysis indicates a slight increase in the production of IGF-I-(1-70) from the wild type and the K65R precursor in the presence of pCMV-PACE4. The K68R mutant is processed only to IGF-I-(1-70), and the amount of product produced is not affected by PACE4. As seen previously, the K65R/K68R mutant is processed primarily to IGF-I-(1-70) by endogenous enzymes, with a smaller peptide composing 27% of the final product. Processing of this mutant is unaffected by PACE4. Co-expression of PC6A with either the wild-type pro-IGF-IA or the K65R mutant enhances production of IGF-I-(1-70), and lower molecular weight forms are not generated (Fig. 2C). PC6A processes 59% of the wild-type precursor and 71% of the K65R mutant to IGF-I-(1-70). PC6A does not qualitatively or quantitatively alter the processing of the K68R or K65R/K68R mutants. Fifty-four percent of the wild-type precursor and 59% of the K65R mutant are processed to IGF-I-(1-70) in the presence of PC6B, compared with 45 and 48% IGF-I-(1-70) product by endogenous enzymes (Fig. 2D). PC6B does not qualitatively or quantitatively alter the processing of the K68R or K65R/K68R mutants. In the presence of LPC, 73% of wild-type pro-IGF-IA was converted to IGF-I-(1-70), as compared with 45% conversion by endogenous enzymes (Fig. 2E). LPC was less active on the K65R, K68R, and K65R/K68R mutants. LPC did not generate peptides smaller than IGF-I-(1-70) from any of the precursors. The co-expression experiments in 293 cells indicated that furin will efficiently process wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA to IGF-I-(1-70) and will also cleave the mutant precursors at other sites. Processing enzymes endogenous to 293 cells process all precursors to IGF-I-(1-70) and cleave only the K65R/K68R mutant at an alternate site. By co-expressing pro-IGF-IA constructs with SPCs in the furin-deficient RPE.40 cell line (20Spence M.J. Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we sought to determine 1) if furin was responsible for alternative cleavage of K65R/K68R and 2) the activity of PACE4, PC6A, PC6B and LPC for pro-IGF-IA in the absence of furin. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3 and Table II.Table II.Processing of wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA in RPE.40 cellsConstructsLys/Arg68aAssignment of this cleavage site is tentative.Arg71Arg77Pro%WT081019WT + furin138502WT + PACE4082018WT + PC6A083017WT + PC6B075025WT + LPC085015K65R081019K65R + furin267202K65R + LPC085015K68R082018K68R + furin237502K68R + LPC09109K65R/K68R085015K65R/K68R + furin98002K65R/K68R + LPC09307a Assignment of this cleavage site is tentative. Open table in a new tab As we have shown previously (13Duguay S.J. Lai-Zhang J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17566-17574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), when pro-IGF-IA is expressed in RPE.40 cells, IGF-I-(1-70), but not IGF-I-(1-76), is generated. In RPE.40 cells, approximately 80% of the precursor is processed to IGF-I-(1-70), while 20% is secreted as N-glycosylated pro-IGF-IA (Fig. 3A). When co-expressed with furin, nearly 100% of the pro-IGF-IA is converted to IGF-I-(1-70). Approximately 80% of the K65R and K68R precursors appeared as IGF-I-(1-70). In the presence of furin IGF-I-(1-70) is still the major product, but a smaller peptide is also generated from both mutants. The processing enzymes endogenous to RPE.40 cells generate only IGF-I-(1-70) from the K65R/K68R mutant. However, when co-expressed with furin, nearly 100% of the precursor is processed at an alternative site to generate the smaller 7-kDa form. When wild-type or mutant pro-IGF-IA is co-expressed with PACE4 (Fig. 3B), PC6A (Fig. 3C), or PC6B (Fig. 3D) in RPE.40 cells, IGF-I-(1-70) is the only cleavage product. Approximately 80% of each precursor is converted to mature IGF-I, and this figure is not affected by the presence of exogenous enzymes. In the background of RPE.40 cells, LPC is nearly as efficient as furin at processing pro-IGF-IA. Eighty-five to 93% of each precursor is processed to IGF-I(1-70) when co-expressed with LPC, and smaller peptides are not produced (Fig. 3E). In order to determine if SPCs discriminate between the Lys68-X-X-Arg71 and Arg74-X-X-Arg77 sites of pro-IGF-IA we co-expressed these enzymes with the R74A/R77A and R71A mutants. Each of these mutants contains only one of the two potential processing sites (Fig. 1). When the R74A/R77A mutant is expressed in 293 cells, 48% of the precursor is processed at Arg71 (Fig. 4A). In the presence of furin, nearly 100% of the precursor is cleaved at Arg71. PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC cleave at Arg71 to generate 59, 66, 60, and 58% IGF-I-(1-70), respectively. Seventy-seven percent of the R71A precursor is cleaved by endogenous enzymes in 293 cells (Fig. 4B). Processing at Arg77 increased to 96, 81, 91, 88, and 70% of the precursor in the presence of furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC, respectively. When expressed in RPE.40 cells, 47% of the R74A/R77A precursor is processed at Arg71. Furin processed this precursor very efficiently, but PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B had no apparent affect. In contrast, LPC had a moderate affect, processing 57% of the precursor (Fig. 4C). Sixty-eight percent of the R71A mutant is cleaved at Arg77 in RPE.40 cells. In the presence of furin, cleavage at this site increases to 93% of precursor. PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC do not affect processing of this mutant in the RPE.40 cells (Fig. 4D). We often observe some additional processing or degradation of the R71A precursor in RPE.40 cells, resulting in faint bands below the IGF-I-(1-76) product. The previous experiments show that PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B can cleave wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA when co-expressed in 293 cells, but these enzymes do not appear to process pro-IGF precursors in RPE.40 cells. One possible explanation is that furin first cleaves pro-IGF-IA at Arg77 to generate IGF-I-(1-76), which then becomes a substrate for these other SPCs. To test this hypothesis we co-expressed the R77X truncation mutant with the SPCs. In 293 cells, 61% of the IGF-I-(1-76) is processed to IGF-I-(1-70). Furin and PC6A convert 90% of this precursor to IGF-I-(1-70). PACE4, PC6B, and LPC have no effect on processing efficiency (Fig. 5A). In RPE.40 cells, 56% of the IGF-I-(1-76) is processed to IGF-I-(1-70). Furin very efficiently processes the precursor to IGF-I-(1-70), but PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC have no effect (Fig. 5B). In the previous experiments we have not observed processing of IGF-IA precursors by PACE4, PC6A, or PC6B in RPE.40 cells. In order to determine if these enzymes are active in RPE.40 cells, we co-expressed them with the K68R/A70K mutant. This mutant contains an Arg-X-Lys-Arg71 cleavage site (Fig. 1), which is also found in other precursors that are processed by PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B (21Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D.

J. 1996; 414: 521-532Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The K68R/A70K mutant was processed very efficiently by the endogenous RPE.40 processing enzymes, and it was therefore necessary to overexpose the gel to detect pro-IGF-IA. Overexposure of the gel revealed that processing is enhanced by furin, PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B (Fig. 6). This effect was observed in three independent experiments. The data on co-expression of pro-IGF-IA with SPCs in RPE.40 cells indicates that furin and LPC are most active in this cell line. The fact that both alleles of furin are known to be inactive in RPE.40 cells due to mutation (20Spence M.J. Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggests that LPC may be responsible for the observed pro-IGF-IA processing. In order to determine if RPE.40 cells express LPC, we obtained a partial clone by PCR of RPE.40 cDNA. The 342-base pair cDNA encodes a 113-amino acid segment of the P domain that shares 92% sequence identity to human LPC and 95% sequence identity to rat PC7 (data not shown). When this cDNA was used to probe a Northern blot of RPE.40 poly(A)+ RNA, a single transcript of 4.4 kilobase pairs was detected (Fig. 7), indicating that LPC is expressed in RPE.40 cells. Since IGF-I is synthesized by all tissues of the body, we were interested in determining if pro-IGF-IA-processing enzymes are also ubiquitous. We expressed pro-IGF-IA-FLAG in cell lines derived from several mammalian sources as well as one invertebrate cell line. Secreted IGF-I peptides were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results have been summarized in Table III. All cell lines examined processed pro-IGF-IA to IGF-I-(1-70). IGF-I-(1-76) was also generated by all cells except the furin-deficient LoVo and RPE.40 cells and the Drosophila cell line. Pro-IGF-IA was also processed very efficiently. Endogenous enzymes were able to convert at least 50% of overexpressed precursor to final product in all cell lines (data not shown).Table IIIProcessing of human pro-IGF-IA in various cell linesCell lineOriginIGF-I-(1-70)IGF-I-(1-76)293Human, embryonic kidney++GM03652CHuman, fibroblast++LoVoHuman, colon carcinoma+−SaOs-2Human, osteosarcoma++Rat-1Rat, fibroblast++CHO-K1Chinese hamster, ovary++RPE.40CHO-K1 derivative+−CV-1Monkey, kidney++COS-7CV-1 derivative++S2Drosophila+− Open table in a new tab We have expressed wild-type and mutant pro-IGF-IA with furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC in order to determine which of these enzymes might play a role in pro-IGF processing. In 293 cells, endogenous enzymes process wild-type pro-IGF-IA and the K65R mutant at Lys68-X-X-Arg71 to yield IGF-I-(1-70) and at Arg74-X-X-Arg77 to produce IGF-I-(1-76) (Fig. 2). The K68R mutant is processed at Arg68-X-X-Arg71 to generate IGF-I-(1-70), and IGF-I-(1-76) is apparently not produced from this precursor by 293 enzymes. The lack of IGF-I-(1-76) could be due to a preference for Arg68-X-X-Arg71 over Arg74-X-X-Arg77. It is also possible that pro-IGF-IA is processed sequentially from IGF-I-(1-76) to IGF-I-(1-70) and that the Arg for Lys68 substitution creates a more efficient cleavage site or a site favorable to additional processing enzymes, resulting in complete processing to the final product. Pulse-chase analysis will be necessary to determine if the K68R precursor is sequentially cleaved. Endogenous processing enzymes in 293 cells produce two products from the K65R/K68R precursor (Fig. 2). The main product corresponds to IGF-I-(1-70) generated by cleavage at Arg68-X-X-Arg71. The smaller peptide likely corresponds to IGF-I-(1-67) resulting from cleavage at the newly created furin site, Arg65-X-X-Arg68. This suggestion is supported by the fact that the smaller peptide is not generated from K65R/K68R in the furin-deficient RPE.40 cell line (Fig. 3). When furin is co-expressed with wild-type pro-IGF-IA in 293 cells, IGF-I-(1-70), but not IGF-I-(1-76), is produced (Fig. 2A). A faint band migrating slightly faster than IGF-I-(1-70) is also produced and could represent cleavage at an upstream lysine. The fact that furin generates IGF-I-(1-70), but not IGF-I-(1-76), from pro-IGF-IA could be due to a preference for Lys68-X-X-Arg71 over Arg74-X-X-Arg77 or the result of sequential processing, with IGF-I-(1-70) being the major final product. Since each site is cleaved with high efficiency when the R74A/R77A and R71A mutants are co-expressed with furin in 293 or RPE.40 cells (Fig. 4, A and B), we suggest that the latter hypothesis is more likely. Furin processes the K65R and K68R mutants to IGF-I-(1-70) and a smaller band that may result from cleavage at one of the two upstream basic residues (Fig. 2A). Only one product, which migrates slightly ahead of IGF-I-(1-70), is produced from the K65R/K68R mutant. This 7-kDa band likely represents IGF-I-(1-67) produced by cleavage at the Arg65-X-X-Arg68 site. Again, cleavage may be sequential or reflect processing site specificity. In contrast to furin, co-expression of PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, or LPC with pro-IGF precursors in 293 cells does not qualitatively change the pattern of processing products generated by the endogenous enzymes (Fig. 2, B, C, D, and E). However, some quantitative changes are apparent. PC6A and LPC are most efficient at generating IGF-I-(1-70) from pro-IGF-IA, followed by PC6B and then PACE4 (Table I). These enzymes appear to have a more strict substrate specificity than furin, since they produce only IGF-I-(1-70) from pro-IGF precursors. However, PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B are capable of cleaving at Lys68-X-X-Arg71 or Arg74-X-X-Arg77 (Fig. 4, A and B). Other studies comparing specificity and activity of SPCs have also found that furin has the widest substrate specificity and is more active than PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B. Furin will efficiently cleave both Arg-X-(Lys/Arg)-Arg and Arg-X-X-Arg motifs (25Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.-S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

However, PC6A is more active than PACE4 at cleaving the Arg-X-(Lys/Arg)-Arg site of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ (23Campan M. Yoshizumi M. Seidah N.G. Lee M.-E. Bianchi C. Haber E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3797-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that structural features are also important for processing activity. Although we have not extensively examined the substrate specificity of LPC, our data suggest that this convertase may prefer the Lys-X-X-Arg71 site to the Arg-X-X-Arg77 site (Fig. 4). Processing of pro-IGF by endogenous and transfected enzymes in 293 cells is summarized in Fig. 8A From our experiments in 293 cells it is clear that the endogenous processing enzymes cleave pro-IGF-IA very efficiently and that furin is more active on pro-IGF precursors than PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, or LPC. We therefore thought it would be informative to examine processing of pro-IGF-IA in a furin-deficient cell line. We have used RPE.40 cells for this purpose. These cells were derived from CHO-K1 cells by exposure to the mutagen ethyl methane sulfonate and selection for resistance to Pseudomonas exotoxin A (29Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RPE.40 cells fail to process several proprotein precursors due to mutations in both furin alleles (20Spence M.J. Sucic J.F. Foley B.T. Moehring T.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When expressed in RPE.40 cells, wild-type pro-IGF-IA is processed exclusively to IGF-I-(1-70) by endogenous enzymes (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained previously in LoVo cells (13Duguay S.J. Lai-Zhang J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17566-17574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that furin is required to generate IGF-I-(1-76), although co-expression of wild-type pro-IGF-IA and furin in 293 or RPE.40 cells results in processing to IGF-I-(1-70), not IGF-I-(1-76) (Figs. 2A and 3A). This may be due to sequential processing of pro-IGF-IA by furin, as discussed above. An unexpected result from the experiments with RPE.40 cells was that PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B do not process pro-IGF-IA precursors in this cell line (Fig. 3 and Table II). This could be due to a requirement for furin to activate PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B. However, others have shown that these enzymes cleave prosomatostatin and neurotropin precursors in LoVo cells (21Seidah N.G. Benjannet S. Pareek S. Savaria D. Hamelin J. Goulet B. Laliberte J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B will cleave the K68R/A70K mutant in RPE.40 cells. This mutant contains a basic residue in the P2 position and may therefore be a better substrate for these enzymes (Fig. 6). It is also possible that PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B act primarily on IGF-I-(1-76) that would be generated by furin but is not produced in RPE.40 cells. This possibility was eliminated by showing that PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B process IGF-I-(1-76) to IGF-I-(1-70) in 293 cells but not in RPE.40 cells (Fig. 5). A third possibility is that expression levels of exogenous enzymes may vary in 293 and RPE.40 cells. Using ribonuclease protection assays, we determined that mRNA levels for PACE4, PC6A, and PC6B were 1.5-2.3-fold higher in 293 cells than RPE.40 cells (data not shown), suggesting that lower expression may account for their lack of activity in RPE.40 cells. Expression levels did not strictly correlate with processing activity, however. For example, PACE4 had the highest mRNA levels but the lowest activity in both cell lines. Processing of pro-IGF by endogenous and transfected enzymes in RPE.40 cells is summarized in Fig. 8B Our previous work clearly identified the processing site for final maturation of pro-IGF-IA as Lys68-X-X-Arg71 (13Duguay S.J. Lai-Zhang J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17566-17574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This dibasic motif has been shown to be cleaved by enzymes of the SPC family (8Rouille Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G. Oliva Jr., A.A. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Front.

The data presented here indicate that furin, PC6A, and LPC are capable of efficiently processing pro-IGF-IA to mature IGF-I. We have also found that processing activity can be influenced by enzyme expression levels and that all cells examined contain endogenous enzymes that efficiently and correctly process pro-IGF-IA. Furin, PC6A, and LPC are expressed in many tissues (–6Steiner D.F. Cuatrecasas P. Jacobs S. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology.

We propose that a tertiary interaction of these two loop regions forms a pocket for binding the αt C terminus of the transducin during light transduction in vivo In most G-proteins, the C termini of α subunits are important for interaction with receptors, and, in several serpentine receptors, regions similar to those in rhodopsin are essential for G-protein activation, indicating that the interaction described here may be a generally applicable mode of G-protein binding in signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W2017847081,"Recent data indicate that sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) functions in the rapid movement of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane (Puglielli, L., Rigotti, A., Greco, A. V., Santos, M. J., and Nervi, F. (1995) <i>J. Biol. Chem</i> 270, 18723-18726). In order to further characterize the cellular function of SCP-2, we transfected McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells with a pre-SCP-2 cDNA expression construct. In stable transfectants, pre-SCP-2 processing resulted in an 8-fold increase in peroxisomal levels of SCP-2. SCP-2 overexpression increased the rates of newly synthesized cholesterol transfer to the plasma membrane and plasma membrane cholesterol internalization by 4-fold. There was no effect of SCP-2 overexpression on the microsomal levels of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and neutral cholesterol ester (CE) hydrolase; however, in the intact cell, CE synthesis and mass were reduced by 50%. SCP-2 overexpression also reduced high density lipoprotein-cholesterol secretion and apoA-I gene expression by 70% and doubled the rate of plasma membrane desmosterol conversion to cholesterol. We conclude that SCP-2 overexpression enhances the rate of cholesterol cycling, which reduces the availability of cholesterol for CE synthesis and alters the activity of a cellular cholesterol pool involved in regulating apoA-I-mediated high density lipoprotein cholesterol secretion. The net result of these changes in cholesterol metabolism is a 46% increase in plasma membrane cholesterol content, the implications of which are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2161472286,"Soluble Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF) forms a non-covalently associated dimer. We have determined a dimer association constant (Ka) of 2-4 × 108M−1, using sedimentation equilibrium and size exclusion chromatography. SCF has been shown previously to be present at concentrations of approximately 3.3 ng/ml in human serum. Based on the dimerization Ka, greater than 90% of the circulating SCF would be in the monomeric form. When 125I-rhSCF was added to human serum and the serum analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, 72-49% of rhSCF was monomer when the total SCF concentration was in the range of 10-100 ng/ml, consistent with the Ka determination. Three SCF variants, SCF(F63C), SCF (V49L,F63L), and SCF(A165C), were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The dimer Ka values, biophysical properties, and biological activities of these variants were studied. Dimerization-defective variants SCF(F63C)S-CH2CONH2 and SCF(V49L,F63L) showed substantially reduced mitogenic activity, while the activity of the Cys165-Cys165 disulfide-linked SCF(A165C) dimer was 10-fold higher than that of wild type rhSCF.

It is found in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter being derived from a membrane-bound form by proteolytic cleavage.

J. 1995; 305: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that SCF dimer is dissociable under non-denaturing conditions and the dissociation rate constant (kd) of E. coli-derived rhSCF dimer is approximately 1.35 × 10−4 s−1 at pH 4.8, 25°C. In the present work, we arrive at a value of 2-4 × 108M−1 for the dimer association constant (Ka) of E coli-derived rhSCF, based on several approaches including ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography at low SCF concentrations. Since the SCF concentration in human serum has been found previously to be a few nanograms/ml (5Langley K.E. Bennett L.G. Wypych J. Yancik S.A. Liu X.D. Westcott K.R. Chang D.G. Smith K.A. Zsebo K.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 656-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Ka value suggests that the majority of SCF in serum may be monomeric. We use 125I-SCF as a tracer added to serum to show that this does in fact appear to be the case.The binding of ligands to cell receptors, followed by receptor dimerization, is essential for signal transduction by the family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (6Ullich A.

The ligands for each of these receptors can exist as dimers, non-covalently associated in the cases of SCF (3Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.W. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L.

Commun. 1982; 104: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that ligand dimerization helps to mediate receptor dimerization for each of these ligand/receptor pairs, but a requirement for ligand dimerization has not been definitively shown in any of these cases. For Kit in particular, dimerization was suggested to be independent of the bivalency of the dimeric SCF ligand (14Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sedimentation equilibrium and size exclusion chromatography indicated that SCF and Kit form 2:2 complexes in vitro (15Philo J.S. Wen J. Wypych J. Schwartz M.G. Mendiaz E.A. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6895-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The SCF concentrations used in the latter study were higher than those found in vivoAs an additional approach to testing whether dimerization of SCF helps to mediate dimerization of Kit, three E. coli-derived SCF variants were designed. Based on the genetic and structural homology between SCF and M-CSF (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), Phe63 of SCF appeared comparable to the corresponding Phe67 of M-CSF, which is located in a loop between the B-helix and C-helix. (M-CSF is a four-helix bundle cytokine (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and SCF almost certainly is as well (17Bazan J.F. Cell. 1991; 65: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).) The x-ray crystallographic structure of the M-CSF disulfide-linked dimer (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) has shown that Phe67 resides in the M-CSF dimer interface. Phe63 involvement in the dimer interface of SCF was assumed, and two variants with Phe63 substitutions were therefore prepared. The variant SCF(A165C) was also prepared. Characterization of dimer association constant Ka, biophysical properties, and biological activities of these variants give results consistent with the hypothesis that SCF dimerization is important for Kit dimerization. Models for SCF-induced Kit dimerization are discussed in light of the results.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have demonstrated that the dimer association constant (Ka) of E. coli-derived wild type rhSCF is 2-4 × 108M−1, as determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Consistent with this Ka value, we have also demonstrated, by using size exclusion chromatography after addition of 125I-SCF as a tracer, that the SCF monomer is probably the major species in human serum preparations.Based on Bazan's prediction of the genetic and structural homology between SCF and M-CSF (17Bazan J.F. Cell. 1991; 65: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the x-ray crystallographic structure of M-CSF (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the Phe63 in SCF probably resides at the dimer interface. Variants with Phe63 substituted were therefore studied. Variant SCF(F63C) and its derivative SCF(F63C)S-CH2CONH2 exist primarily as monomers, as indicated by size exclusion chromatography (Ka 1.8 × 103M−1 for the derivative). Thus substitution of Phe63 with Cys significantly reduces formation of the SCF dimer. Substitution with Leu63 in the variant SCF(V49L,F63L) resulted in a Ka of 1.47 × 105M−1. Replacing the bulky Phe by Leu could result in unfavorable packing in the hydrophobic dimer interface. We believe that Leu, replacing Val at position 49, would reside in the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic B helix and would not be in the interface of the dimer, again based on the structural analogy to M-CSF. Leu49 therefore would be less likely to affect SCF dimerization. The conformation of these two variants, determined by circular dichroism and fluorescence, is indistinguishable from that of wild type rhSCF. However, these methods are unlikely to detect small structural alterations.The disulfide-linked SCF(A165C) dimer would be 100% dimer at all concentrations. Since SCF1-141 is fully active (29Langley K.E. Mendiaz E.A. Liu N. Narhi L.O. Zeni L. Parseghian C.M. Clogston C.L. Leslie I. Pope J.A. Lu H.S. Zsebo K.M. Boone T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and is a non-covalently associated dimer as judged by size exclusion chromatography, the Ala165 almost certainly does not reside in the dimer interface. The C-terminal portion, which would include the disulfide bond Cys165-Cys165 of the SCF(A165C) disulfide-linked dimer, is probably flexible. The phenomenon of dynamic association/dissociation at the dimer interface might still occur in the SCF(A165C) disulfide-linked dimer. However, the association at the interface would be much enhanced because of the interchain disulfide bond (Cys165-Cys165).The mitogenic activities of SCF(F63C)S-CH2CONH2 and SCF(V49L,F63L) are 1,300-fold and 30-fold lower, respectively, than that of wild type rhSCF (Fig. 7), while that of SCF(A165C) is about 10-fold higher. Based on calculation from the Ka values listed in Table III, the dimer concentration at 50% maximum in the UT-7 mitogenic bioassay is 0.8 ng/ml for the SCF(A165C) disulfide-linked dimer, 0.8 ng/ml for wild type rhSCF, 0.7 ng/ml for SCF(V49L,F63L), and 18 ng/ml for SCF(F63C)S-CH2CONH2. Thus the proliferation bioactivity and Ka are correlated to some extent, consistent with a hypothesis that dimerization of SCF mediates the mitogenic response. (Models of SCF association with Kit for Kit dimerization and signal transduction are discussed further below.) However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the correlation is coincidental, and that SCF(V49L,F63L) and SCF(F63C)S-CH2CONH2 have lower activity because of other structural alterations that might affect their ability to interact with the receptor.Since the dissociation rate constant, kd, for wild type SCF has been determined previously (4Lu H.S. Chang W.-C. Mendiaz E.A. Mann M.B. Langley K.E. Hsu Y.-R. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we can estimate the association rate constant ka from the Ka determined in the present work: ka = Ka× kd = 4 × 104M−1 s−1. Given a soluble SCF concentration of 3.3 ng/ml in human serum (5Langley K.E. Bennett L.G. Wypych J. Yancik S.A. Liu X.D. Westcott K.R. Chang D.G. Smith K.A. Zsebo K.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 656-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Ka for SCF dimerization also allows the calculation that about 90% of the SCF would be monomeric, and the size exclusion chromatographic experiments with 125I-SCF added to human serum support this calculation. However, we have shown in vitro that at concentrations where rhSCF is dimeric, a complex is formed with sKit that includes two rhSCF monomers and two sKit molecules (15Philo J.S. Wen J. Wypych J. Schwartz M.G. Mendiaz E.A. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6895-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and we consider it most likely that SCF dimer mediates Kit dimerization. Models by which SCF could induce receptor dimerization and consequently activate signal transduction are shown in Fig. 9.In these models, some correlation between Ka for rhSCF dimerization and biological activity, such as that noted above, would be anticipated. The models differ from each other primarily in that each SCF monomer interacts with only one receptor molecule in model I, whereas each SCF monomer interacts with both receptor molecules in model II. In this sense, model II is analogous to the 1:2 growth hormone-growth hormone receptor complex (30de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar), in which a single growth hormone molecule mediates receptor dimerization by interacting with both receptor molecules. It is important to note (e.g. with regard to monomeric SCF which may be present in human serum) that each model allows that an SCF molecule be initially monomeric and still wind up as part of a 2:2 SCF·sKit complex.It is also noteworthy that reported Ka values for SCF binding to Kit (ranging from 0.6 × 108 to 2 × 109M−1, depending on the system; see Refs. 14Lev S.

This could be considered consistent with a model in which SCF·sKit interactions were relatively strong and sKit·sKit interactions relatively weak or non-existent, such that SCF·SCF interactions determine the apparent Ka for formation of the 2:2 SCF·Kit complex (15Philo J.S.

We do not attempt to address the issues of conformational changes and cooperative interactions in SCF·Kit complex formation (14Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONStem cell factor is a cytokine that is active toward early hematopoietic cells and also plays roles in gametogenesis, melanogenesis, and mast cell function. Its biological and other properties have been extensively reviewed (1Galli S.J. Zsebo K.M. Geissler E.N. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Lev S. Blechman J.M.

It is found in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, with the latter being derived from a membrane-bound form by proteolytic cleavage. The soluble SCF has 165 amino acids.Both soluble Escherichia coli-derived and CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovarySCFstem cell factorrhSCFstem cell factor recombinantly expressed in E. coli with an N-terminal methionine, followed by the native sequence of SCF from amino acids 1-165HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRP-HPLCreversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salinePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorM-CSFmacrophage-colony stimulating factorsKitsoluble Kit (extracellular domain)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cell-derived recombinant human SCF have been reported to be non-covalently associated dimers, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium and size exclusion chromatography at protein concentrations above 0.4 mg/ml (3Arakawa T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 18942-18948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous paper (4Lu H.S. Chang W.-C. Mendiaz E.A. Mann M.B. Langley K.E. Hsu Y.-R. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that SCF dimer is dissociable under non-denaturing conditions and the dissociation rate constant (kd) of E. coli-derived rhSCF dimer is approximately 1.35 × 10−4 s−1 at pH 4.8, 25°C. In the present work, we arrive at a value of 2-4 × 108M−1 for the dimer association constant (Ka) of E coli-derived rhSCF, based on several approaches including ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography at low SCF concentrations. Since the SCF concentration in human serum has been found previously to be a few nanograms/ml (5Langley K.E. Bennett L.G. Wypych J. Yancik S.A. Liu X.D. Westcott K.R. Chang D.G. Smith K.A. Zsebo K.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 656-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Ka value suggests that the majority of SCF in serum may be monomeric. We use 125I-SCF as a tracer added to serum to show that this does in fact appear to be the case.The binding of ligands to cell receptors, followed by receptor dimerization, is essential for signal transduction by the family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (6Ullich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4583) Google Scholar, 7Wilks A.F. Adv.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4124-4128Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The receptor for SCF on target cells is Kit (see Refs. 1Galli S.J. Zsebo K.M. Geissler E.N. Adv.

Oncogenesis. 1994; 5: 141-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar for reviews). Kit is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily, which also includes the M-CSF receptor (Fms), the PDGF receptor, and Flk2 (6Ullich A. Schlessinger J.

The ligands for each of these receptors can exist as dimers, non-covalently associated in the cases of SCF (3Arakawa T. Yphantis D.A. Lary J.W. Narhi L.O. Lu H.S. Prestrelski S.J. Clogston C.L.

Commun. 1982; 104: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that ligand dimerization helps to mediate receptor dimerization for each of these ligand/receptor pairs, but a requirement for ligand dimerization has not been definitively shown in any of these cases. For Kit in particular, dimerization was suggested to be independent of the bivalency of the dimeric SCF ligand (14Lev S. Yarden Y. Givol D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15970-15977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, sedimentation equilibrium and size exclusion chromatography indicated that SCF and Kit form 2:2 complexes in vitro (15Philo J.S. Wen J. Wypych J. Schwartz M.G. Mendiaz E.A. Langley K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6895-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The SCF concentrations used in the latter study were higher than those found in vivoAs an additional approach to testing whether dimerization of SCF helps to mediate dimerization of Kit, three E. coli-derived SCF variants were designed. Based on the genetic and structural homology between SCF and M-CSF (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), Phe63 of SCF appeared comparable to the corresponding Phe67 of M-CSF, which is located in a loop between the B-helix and C-helix. (M-CSF is a four-helix bundle cytokine (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and SCF almost certainly is as well (17Bazan J.F. Cell. 1991; 65: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).) The x-ray crystallographic structure of the M-CSF disulfide-linked dimer (16Pandit J. Bohm A. Jancarik J. Halenbeck R. Koths K. Kim S.-H. Science. 1992; 258: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) has shown that Phe67 resides in the M-CSF dimer interface. Phe63 involvement in the dimer interface of SCF was assumed, and two variants with Phe63 substitutions were therefore prepared. The variant SCF(A165C) was also prepared. Characterization of dimer association constant Ka, biophysical properties, and biological activities of these variants give results consistent with the hypothesis that SCF dimerization is important for Kit dimerization. Models for SCF-induced Kit dimerization are discussed in light of the results."

K., Kishore, N., and Brewer, C. F. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 1149-1156). Similar studies of the binding of a series of monodeoxy derivatives of the α(1-3) residue of the trimannoside showed that this arm was required for high affinity binding (Mandal, D.

In the present paper, a series of monodeoxy derivatives of the α(1-6) arm and “core” Man residue of the trimannoside as well as dideoxy and trideoxy analogs were synthesized. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry experiments establish that the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of the α(1-6)Man residue of the trimannoside binds to the lectin, along with the 2- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the core Man residue and the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups of the α(1-3)Man residue. Dideoxy analogs and trideoxy analogs showed losses of affinities and enthalpy values consistent with losses in binding of specific hydroxyl groups of the trimannoside. The free energy and enthalpy contributions to binding of individual hydroxyl groups of the trimannoside determined from the corresponding monodeoxy analogs are observed to be nonlinear, indicating differential contributions of the solvent and protein to the thermodynamics of binding of the analogs. The thermodynamic solution data agree well with the recent x-ray crystal structure of ConA complexed with the trimannoside (Naismith, J. H., and Field, R. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 972-976).

Schnebli H.P. Concanavalin A as a Tool. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976Google Scholar, 2Lis H. Sharon N. Biochem. Plants. 1981; 6: 371-447Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to establish the nature of the molecular interactions between N-linked carbohydrates and ConA in order to understand the specificity of the lectin for cellular carbohydrates.ConA is a tetramer above pH 7 and a dimer below pH 6, with each monomer (Mr = 25, 600) possessing one saccharide-binding site as well as a transition metal ion site (S1) (typically Mn2+) and a Ca2+ site (S2) (3Kalb A.J.

The three-dimensional structure of the lectin at 1.75-Å resolution has been determined by x-ray diffraction analysis (6Hardman K.D. Agarwal R.C. Freiser M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a complex with Me-α-Man to 2.9-Å resolution (7Derewenda Z. Yariv J. Helliwell J.R. Kalb A.J. Dodson E.J. Papiz M.Z. Wan T. Campbell J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of ConA bound with methyl-3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-α-D-mannopyranoside to 2.3 Å has been reported (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Early studies by Goldstein and co-workers (9Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar) established that ConA has specificity for α-pyranose forms of Glc and Man, which contain similar hydroxyl group configurations at the 3-, 4-, and 6-positions. Monodeoxy derivatives of the monosaccharides at these positions showed essentially complete loss of binding to the lectin, thus establishing the specificity of the so-called “monosaccharide-binding site” in ConA. Later studies demonstrated that certain N-linked oligomannose and complex-type oligosaccharides possessed much higher affinities (∼50-fold or greater) than the monosaccharide methyl-α-D-mannopyranoside (Me-α-Man) (10Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), thus suggesting extended site binding interactions with the lectin. The trisaccharide moiety 3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-D-mannose, which is part of all N-linked oligosaccharides, was shown to bind with nearly 100-fold higher affinity than Me-α-Man, and to induce conformational changes in ConA similar to those of the larger N-linked carbohydrates (10Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Brewer C.F. Bhattacharyya L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7306-7310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that the trimannosyl moiety in N-linked carbohydrates was primarily responsible for their high affinity binding to ConA.Detailed insights into the specificity of carbohydrate-protein interactions requires not only relative binding affinity data, but also thermodynamic data to establish whether extended binding site interactions occur. We recently described titration microcalorimetry studies of the binding of methyl-3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-α-D-mannopyranoside (1) (Fig. 1) to ConA (12Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The results showed that 1 possesses nearly 6 kcal mol−1 greater change in binding enthalpy (−ΔH) than Me-α-Man, thus providing direct evidence for extended recognition site by the lectin of the trimannoside epitope. Similar studies with deoxy analogs of the α(1-3)Man residue of the trimannoside established that the 3-OH on this arm is required for high affinity binding (13Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H.

In light of the recently reported x-ray crystal structure of ConA and the trimannoside (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the present results provide information on the energetics of binding of the trimannoside to ConA, and, in turn, on the structure of the complex in solution.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOur previous titration calorimetry studies showed that ConA binds to trimannoside 1 which is present in all N-linked carbohydrates with nearly −6 kcal mol−1 greater enthalpy change (−ΔH) and 60-fold higher affinity than Me-α-Man (Table I) (12Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the high affinity of the the trimannoside moiety is due to extended site interactions. In order to examine the nature of these extended site interactions, a complete set of monodeoxy analogs of 1 as well as two dideoxy and a trideoxy analog were synthesized and their thermodynamics of binding determined by titration microcalorimetry. The results have provided structural information on the complex in solution which has been compared with the recently reported x-ray crystal structure of the complex (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J.

Open table in a new tab Binding of Monodeoxy Analogs of Trimannoside 1Our previous studies examined the thermodynamics of binding of a series of monodeoxy analogs of 1 possessing substitutions on the α(1-3) arm (13Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown III, R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The results, which are shown in Table I for comparison, indicate that the 2- (2) and 6-deoxy (5) analogs (Fig. 1) possess similar affinities, −ΔH and entropy (TΔS) values as that of the parent trimannoside. However, the 3-deoxy analog (3) showed a nearly 10-fold decrease in affinity and a 3.4 kcal mol−1 decrease in −ΔH with respect to 1, indicating its involvement in binding. Although we previously reported no change in the thermodynamics of binding of the 4-deoxy analog (4) relative to 1, a reinvestigation shows that 4 binds to ConA with a 5-fold decrease in affinity and a 2.1 kcal mol−1 decrease in −ΔH with respect to 1 (Table I). Thus, the 3- and 4-hydroxyl groups on the α(1-3) arm of 1 bind to ConA.Our previous studies also revealed that analogs of 1 with a Glc or Gal residue substituted on the α(1-6) arm possessed decreased affinities and −ΔH values relative to 1 (13Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown III, R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results provided evidence that the α(1-6)Man residue binds to the so-called “monosaccharide”-binding site of ConA, by analogy to the requirements of monosaccharide binding to ConA (9Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar). However, in order to directly determine the interactions of the α(1-6) arm of 1 with ConA, the 2- (6), 3- (7), 4- (8), and 6-deoxy (9) derivatives of the α(1-6)Man arm of 1 were synthesized. The thermodynamic binding data for these derivatives are shown in Table I. The binding parameters of 6 are nearly the same as that of 1, indicating no binding of the the 2-OH group of the α(1-6) arm. On the other hand, the Ka and ΔH values for 7, 8, and 9 are significantly lower than that of 1, indicating the involvement of 3-, 4-, and 6-OH of the α(1-6)Man residue of the trimannoside in binding (19Wells T.N.C. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the reductions in Ka and ΔH for 7-9 are similar to those observed for 3 and 4 above (Table I). Since the 3-, 4-, and 6-OH groups of the monosaccharides Man and Glc are required for binding to ConA (9Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar), the data are consistent with binding of the α(1-6)Man of 1 to the “monosaccharide site” of the lectin.Titration microcalorimetry data for the 2-deoxy (10) and 4-deoxy (11) derivatives of the central Man residue of 1 are shown in Table I. The results show reductions in Ka and −ΔH for both analogs, indicating the involvement of the 2- and 4-OH of the central Man residue of 1 in binding to ConA.Binding of Dideoxy and Trideoxy Analogs of 1The 2,3- (12) and 4,3- (13) dideoxy analogs of 1, and trideoxy analog 14 (Fig. 1) were also synthesized. Table I shows that the 12 binds about 14-fold more weakly than 1 and possesses a ΔH of −10.6 kcal mol−1 which is a loss of −3.8 kcal mol−1 compared to 1. This reflects the combined loss in ΔH by the 2-deoxy analog 10 and 3-deoxy derivative 3 relative to 1. Table I shows that 13 binds about 25-fold more weakly than 1, and possesses a ΔH of −9.7 kcal mol−1 which is −4.7 kcal mol−1 less favorable than that of 1. This reflects the combined loss in ΔH of the 3-deoxy derivative 3 and 4-deoxy derivative 11 relative to 1.Trideoxy analog 14, which possesses deoxy substitutions at the 3-OH group on the α(1-3) arm and at the 2- and 4-OH groups of the central Man residue of 1, exhibits a Ka value about 50-fold lower than that of 1 (Table I). The ΔH of 14 is −8.7 kcal mol−1 which is 5.7 kcal mol−1 less than that of 1. This reflects losses in ΔH of the corresponding monodeoxy analogs 3, 10, and 11, relative to 1.Comparison with the X-ray Crystal Structure of 1 Complexed to ConAThe x-ray structure of the complex formed by the free sugar of 1 with ConA has recently been reported (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A view of the H-bonding interactions between 1 and the binding site of the lectin is shown in Fig. 3, with the individual hydrogen bonds and their distances listed in Table II. The crystal structure indicates that the α(1-6)Man residue of 1 binds via its 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups in the same manner as Me-α-Man in its crystalline complex with the lectin (7Derewenda Z. Yariv J. Helliwell J.R. Kalb A.J. Dodson E.J. Papiz M.Z. Wan T. Campbell J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These results agree with the thermodynamic data for the 7, 8, and 9 in Table I. The x-ray data also shows binding of the 3-OH of the α(1-3) Man residue to the N-H and side chain O of Thr-15, and the 4-OH of the α(1-3)Man residue to the side chain -OH of Thr-15 (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3; Table II). These results agree with the thermodynamic data for 3 and 4 in Table I. The x-ray data also shows binding of the 2-OH of the central Man residue of 1 to a water molecule which, in turn, is bound to the protein, as shown in Fig. 3, and the 4-OH of the central Man residue to the aromatic 4-OH of Tyr-12 (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These results agree with the thermodynamic data for 10 and 11 in Table I. Thus, the titration calorimetry data in Table I which provides structural information on the solution complex of 1 with ConA agrees with the x-ray structure of the complex (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A.

Open table in a new tab Nonlinearity of the ΔΔH and ΔΔG Values of the Individual Hydroxyl Groups of 1The present thermodynamic data indicate that the ΔΔH values for the monodeoxy analogs in Table I are nonlinear. For example, the sum of the ΔΔH values for monodeoxy analogs 7, 8, and 9 is ∼−10.5 kcal mol−1 (Table I). To a first approximation, this represents the combined ΔH contribution of the 3-, 4-, and 6-OH of the α(1-6)Man residue of 1 at the monosaccharide site of the lectin. This value can be compared to the ΔH for Me-α-Man binding of −8.2 kcal mol−1 to the same site. Furthermore, the value of −10.5 kcal mol−1 does not take into account the ΔH contribution of the ring oxygen of the α(1-6)Man residue of 1 (Fig. 3) which would make this value even greater and hence the difference with the ΔH of Me-α-Man larger. Similarly, the combined ΔΔH values for the 3-OH and 4-OH of the α(1-3)Man residue of 1 obtained from 3 and 4, respectively, and the 2-OH and 4-OH of the central Man residue obtained from 10 and 11, respectively, is ∼−8.8 kcal mol−1. This can be compared to the difference in ΔH between 1 and Me-α-Man of −6.2 kcal mol−1 which reflects binding of the α(1-3)Man and the central Man residues of 1. Furthermore, the sum of the ΔΔH values for the 3-, 4- and 6-OH of the α(1-6)Man residue (7, 8, and 9), the 3- and 4-OH of the α(1-3)Man residue (3 and 4), and the 2- and 4-OH of the central Man residue (10 and 11) is −19.3 kcal mol−1 which is greater than the ΔH for 1 of −14.4 kcal mol−1. Thus, the sum of the ΔΔH values for the hydroxyl groups of 1 obtained from the monodeoxy analogs in Table I does not correspond to the measured ΔH of 1. In all of the above cases, the sum of the ΔΔH values for specific hydroxyl groups on certain Man residues of 1 obtained from the corresponding monodeoxy analogs is greater than the measured ΔH for that residue(s).This nonlinear relationship in ΔΔH is also present in the di- and trideoxy analogs of 1. ΔΔH for dideoxy analog 12 is −3.8 kcal mol−1 as compared to the sum of the ΔΔH values for corresponding monodeoxy analogs 3 and 10 of −4.4 kcal mol−1. Likewise, ΔΔH for dideoxy analog 13 is −4.7 kcal mol−1 as compared to the sum of the ΔΔH values for corresponding monodeoxy analogs 3 and 11 of −5.7 kcal mol−1. In the case of trideoxy analog 14, its ΔΔH value is −5.7 kcal mol−1 as compared to −6.7 kcal mol−1 for 3, 10, and 11. Thus, the ΔΔH values for the monodeoxy analogs are nonlinear in terms of their contributions to the ΔΔH values for the two dideoxy analogs and the trideoxy analog.The same nonlinearity is also present in the ΔΔG values of the monodeoxy analogs. For example, the sum of the ΔΔG values for 3, 4, 10, and 11 is −4.7 kcal mol−1, however, the difference in ΔΔG between 1 and Me-α-Man is −2.5 kcal mol−1 (Table I). In addition, the sum of the ΔΔG values for 3 and 10 is −2.3 kcal mol−1 while the ΔΔG for 12, the corresponding dideoxy analog, is −1.6 kcal mol−1. The sum of the ΔΔG values for 3 and 11 is −2.8 kcal mol−1 while the ΔΔG for 13, the corresponding dideoxy analog, is −1.9 kcal mol−1. The sum of the ΔΔG values for 3, 10, and 11 is −3.7 kcal mol−1 while the ΔΔG value for 14, the corresponding trideoxy analog, is −2.3 kcal mol−1. Thus, the ΔΔG values for the monodeoxy analogs are nonlinear in terms of their contributions to the ΔΔG values for the two dideoxy analogs and the trideoxy analog.The ΔΔH and ΔΔG values for each monodeoxy analog of 1 also do not scale with the number of H-bonds at each position as determined from x-ray crystallography (Fig. 3; Table II). For example, ΔΔH for 7 is −3.2 kcal mol−1, as compared to −2.7 and −2.8 kcal mol−1 for 8 and 9, respectively. However, the x-ray crystal structure shows only one H-bond from the protein to the 3-OH of the α(1-6)Man residue and at least two strong H-bonds each to the 4-OH and 6-OH of the α(1-6)Man residue. Thus, the ΔΔH of −3.2 kcal mol−1 for 7 reflects the loss of a single H-bond with the protein, however, the ΔΔH values for 8 (−2.7 kcal mol−1) and 9 (−2.8 kcal mol−1) do not scale with the loss of two H-bonds. The type of H-bonds involved (Table II) does not provide an explanation for this apparent discrepancy. Likewise, the ΔΔH for 3 (−3.4 kcal mol−1) is nearly the same as that for 7 (−3.2 kcal mol−1), even though in the latter case there are two H-bonds to the 3-OH of the α(1-3)Man residue. Thus, the ΔΔH values for the monodeoxy analogs are not proportional to the number or type of H-bonds involved at specific hyroxyl groups of 1.This same lack of scaling is also present in the ΔΔG values (Table I). This is of particular interest since it has been suggested that the free energy associated with elimination of a H-bond between an uncharged donor/acceptor pair is 0.5-1.5 kcal mol−1, and between a neutral-charged pair 3.5-4.5 kcal mol−1 (20Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Cartger P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The data in Table I, however, indicate no such relationship in the free energy difference (ΔΔG) of monodeoxy analogs that represent the loss of one or more H-bonds such as 7 versus 8 and 9.The presence of nonlinear relationships in the ΔΔH and ΔΔG values for the deoxy analogs in Table I indicates other contributions to these terms such as solvent and protein effects. Thus, the magnitude of the ΔΔH and ΔΔG values represent not only the loss of the H-bond(s) involved, but also differences in the solvent and protein contributions to binding of 1 and the deoxy analogs. Indeed, a recent study suggests a substantial contribution of solvent to the ΔH of binding of 1 to ConA (21Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10533-10539Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, titration microcalorimetry measurements of the binding of deoxy analogs of a substrate to a macromolecule do not provide direct measurements of the free energy and enthalpy of the H-bonding involved.Enthalpy-Entropy CompensationEnthalpy-entropy compensation plots have previously been observed for carbohydrate interactions with lectins (22Schwarz F.P.

The plot shows a linear relationship with a slope of 1.55 and the correlation coefficient to 0.94. The enthalpy-entropy plot in Fig. 3 is similar to those reported earlier for other lectin-carbohydrate interactions in that their slopes are greater than unity (27Munske G.R. Krakauer H. Magnuson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Lemieux R.U. Chem. Soc. Rev. 1989; 18: 347-374Crossref Google Scholar), in contrast to antibody-carbohydrate interactions where the slope is often less than unity (25Brummell D.A. Sharma V.P. Anand N.N. Bilous D. Dubuc G.

Schnebli H.P. Concanavalin A as a Tool. John Wiley and Sons, New York1976Google Scholar, 2Lis H. Sharon N. Biochem. Plants. 1981; 6: 371-447Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to establish the nature of the molecular interactions between N-linked carbohydrates and ConA in order to understand the specificity of the lectin for cellular carbohydrates.ConA is a tetramer above pH 7 and a dimer below pH 6, with each monomer (Mr = 25, 600) possessing one saccharide-binding site as well as a transition metal ion site (S1) (typically Mn2+) and a Ca2+ site (S2) (3Kalb A.J.

The three-dimensional structure of the lectin at 1.75-Å resolution has been determined by x-ray diffraction analysis (6Hardman K.D. Agarwal R.C. Freiser M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 69-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a complex with Me-α-Man to 2.9-Å resolution (7Derewenda Z. Yariv J. Helliwell J.R. Kalb A.J. Dodson E.J. Papiz M.Z. Wan T. Campbell J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of ConA bound with methyl-3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-α-D-mannopyranoside to 2.3 Å has been reported (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Early studies by Goldstein and co-workers (9Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar) established that ConA has specificity for α-pyranose forms of Glc and Man, which contain similar hydroxyl group configurations at the 3-, 4-, and 6-positions. Monodeoxy derivatives of the monosaccharides at these positions showed essentially complete loss of binding to the lectin, thus establishing the specificity of the so-called “monosaccharide-binding site” in ConA. Later studies demonstrated that certain N-linked oligomannose and complex-type oligosaccharides possessed much higher affinities (∼50-fold or greater) than the monosaccharide methyl-α-D-mannopyranoside (Me-α-Man) (10Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), thus suggesting extended site binding interactions with the lectin. The trisaccharide moiety 3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-D-mannose, which is part of all N-linked oligosaccharides, was shown to bind with nearly 100-fold higher affinity than Me-α-Man, and to induce conformational changes in ConA similar to those of the larger N-linked carbohydrates (10Bhattacharyya L. Brewer C.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Brewer C.F. Bhattacharyya L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7306-7310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that the trimannosyl moiety in N-linked carbohydrates was primarily responsible for their high affinity binding to ConA.Detailed insights into the specificity of carbohydrate-protein interactions requires not only relative binding affinity data, but also thermodynamic data to establish whether extended binding site interactions occur. We recently described titration microcalorimetry studies of the binding of methyl-3,6-di-O-(α-D-mannopyranosyl)-α-D-mannopyranoside (1) (Fig. 1) to ConA (12Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The results showed that 1 possesses nearly 6 kcal mol−1 greater change in binding enthalpy (−ΔH) than Me-α-Man, thus providing direct evidence for extended recognition site by the lectin of the trimannoside epitope. Similar studies with deoxy analogs of the α(1-3)Man residue of the trimannoside established that the 3-OH on this arm is required for high affinity binding (13Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown III, R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In the present study a series of monodeoxy derivatives of the α(1-6) arm and “core” Man residue of the trimannoside, as well as dideoxy and trideoxy analogs of 1 (Fig. 1), were synthesized and their binding to ConA investigated by isothermal titration microcalorimetry measurements. In light of the recently reported x-ray crystal structure of ConA and the trimannoside (8Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the present results provide information on the energetics of binding of the trimannoside to ConA, and, in turn, on the structure of the complex in solution."

Chronic metabolic acidosis is known to induce negative calcium balance and bone loss by stimulating osteoclastic bone resorption, but the underlying mechanism is not known. The present studies were undertaken to evaluate whether chronic acidosis affects proton extrusion mechanisms in osteoclasts cultured on glass coverslips. Acidosis, mimicked experimentally by maintaining the cells at extracellular pH 6.5, rapidly lowered intracellular pH to 6.8. However, after 2 hours, a proportion of cells demonstrated the capacity to restore intracellular pH to near normal levels. To define the mechanism responsible for this recovery, the activity of individual H+ transport pathways was analyzed. We found that chronic acid treatment for up to 6 h did not significantly affect the cellular buffering power or Na+/H+ antiport activity. In contrast, chronic acidosis activated vacuolar H+ pumps in the osteoclasts. Although only ∼5% of the control cells displayed proton pump activity, about 40% of cells kept at extracellular pH 6.5 for 4-6 h were able to recover from the acute acid load by means of bafilomycin A1-sensitive proton extrusion. Conversely, the H+-selective conductance recently described in the plasma membrane of osteoclasts was clearly inhibited in the cells exposed to chronic acidosis. Following acid treatment, the activation threshold of the H+ conductance was shifted to more positive potentials, and the current density was significantly reduced. Considered together, these results suggest that induction of plasmalemmal vacuolar type ATPase activity by chronic acidosis, generated either systemically due to metabolic disease or locally at sites of inflammation, is likely to stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption and thus to promote bone loss.

https://openalex.org/W2115020557,"The extraordinary stability of globin mRNAs permits their accumulation to over 95% of total cellular mRNA during erythroid differentiation. The stability of human α-globin mRNA correlates with assembly of a sequence-specific ribonucleoprotein complex at its 3′-untranslated region. A naturally occurring anti-termination mutation, Constant Spring (CS), which permits ribosomes to enter the 3′-untranslated region of the α-globin mRNA, results in accelerated mRNA decay. To study the mechanism of this destabilization in vivo, we established transgenic mouse lines carrying the human αCS gene. Relative to wild-type human α-globin mRNA (αwt), αCS mRNA is destabilized in marrow erythroid cells. The poly(A) tails of both the αCS and αwt mRNAs show a periodicity of 20-25 nucleotides consistent with phased binding of poly(A) binding proteins. However, the mean size of poly(A) tails of the unstable αCS mRNA is significantly shorter than that of the αwt mRNA. Unexpectedly, the αwt and αCS mRNAs are of equal stability in peripheral reticulocytes, where their respective poly(A) tails shorten coordinately.

The phenotype and function of a cell are defined by the spectrum of its cytoplasmic mRNAs. The level of a specific mRNA is determined by the balance between its rates of synthesis and degradation. Recent studies in a variety of experimental systems highlight the central role of mRNA stability in the control of gene expression. The mechanisms that control this property appear complex and encompass distinct pathways for different subgroups of mRNAs (reviews in Refs. 1Surdej P. Riedl A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 3Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The half-lives of mRNAs in higher eucaryotes can differ by over 1000-fold, with a range of minutes to days (3Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). For example, the half-lives (t1/2) of c-myc and c-fos mRNAs are approximately 10-15 min (4Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while the t1/2 of globin mRNA is more than 24 h (5Aviv H. Volloch Z. Bastos R. Levy S. Cell. 1976; 8: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In some instances, mRNA stability may be a dynamic property that changes dramatically in response to developmental, environmental, or metabolic signals. The stability of an mRNA is a function of its sequence and structure and may reflect interaction(s) of cis elements with trans-acting factors. For example, the stability of the transferrin receptor mRNA is controlled by intracellular concentration of iron; at low iron concentrations the transferrin receptor mRNA is quite stable, while a rise in cytosolic iron triggers its accelerated decay (6Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). This control is mediated by interaction of a specific series of secondary structures in the transferrin receptor mRNA 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionCSConstant Springbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)PBSphosphate-buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidwtwild typehhumanmmouseRNPribonucleoproteinPABPpoly(A) binding protein. with an iron binding protein (6Klausner R.D.

Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). A common degradation pathway is initiated by shortening of the poly(A) tail, followed by removal of the 7-methylguanosine cap structure. The deadenylated and decapped mRNA is then degraded by a 5′→ 3′ exonuclease (7Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 8Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This pathway implies that there is communication between the 5′- and 3′-termini of the mRNA; the mechanism(s) involved in this interaction is not known (9Jacobson A. Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 451-489Google Scholar). In higher eucaryotes, deadenylation also frequently accompanies degradation of mRNA, although the mechanism of degradation subsequent to deadenylation remains to be established (10Chen C.Y. Shuy A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Two other less common degradation pathways are independent of prior deadenylation: direct 5′-decapping triggered by nonsense mutations (11Muhlrad D. Parker R. Nature. 1994; 340: 578-581Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and site-specific endonuclease cleavage in the 3′-UTR (12Brown B.D. Zipkin I.D. Harland R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1620-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The general importance of these pathways, how each is controlled, and how they might be interrelated are questions that are presently under study. The globin genes provide a unique model system with which to study mechanisms responsible for mRNA stability. During terminal erythroid differentiation, globin mRNAs accumulate to over 95% of total cellular mRNA (14Bastos R.N. Volloch Z. Aviv H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This remarkable enrichment of a single group of mRNAs relies on their unusually long half-lives as well as selective degradation of non-globin mRNAs (5Aviv H. Volloch Z. Bastos R. Levy S. Cell. 1976; 8: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Lodish H.F. Small B. Cell. 1976; 7: 59-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Bastos R.N.

Biol. 1985; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The importance of mRNA stability to globin gene expression is clearly demonstrated by the phenotype resulting from the loss of this property. For example, a UAA→CAA anti-termination mutation in the α-globin gene (Constant Spring, αCS), results in mRNA destabilization and consequent loss of over 95% expression from the affected locus (18Clegg J.B. Weatherall D.J. Milner P.F. Nature. 1971; 234: 337-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that αCS mRNA is destabilized by the physical entry of ribosomes into its 3′-UTR, which is permitted by the CS anti-termination mutation. This finding suggested that α-globin mRNA contains a stability determinant in this region (19Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8123-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies confirmed this hypothesis and identified the critical cis-determinant as a pyrimidine-rich motif in the 3′-UTR that functions in an erythroid-specific manner (20Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stability motif serves as an assembly site for a sequence-specific mRNA-protein (mRNP) complex (α-complex, 21). The presence of this complex correlates with α-globin mRNA stability; mutations that block assembly of the α-complex in vitro also destabilize the mRNA in vivo (20Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although structural studies have identified one component of the α-complex (22Kiledjian M. Wang X. Liebhaber S.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4357-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), its overall composition remains to be established. Although the importance of the α-complex to α-globin mRNA stability is apparent, the mechanism(s) of its stabilizing function remains to be defined. One approach to this problem is to follow the pathway of globin mRNA degradation triggered by a mutation that interferes with normal stabilizing functions. In the present report we describe a fully physiologic in vivo model system to facilitate such an approach. Transgenic mice that express readily detectable levels of αCS mRNA were established. The stability and structure of αCS mRNA in these mice can be characterized and compared with wild-type human α-globin mRNA (hα or αwt) expressed in a parallel set of transgenic lines. Using this model, we have focused our attention on the structure and dynamics of the poly(A) tail of hα-globin mRNA in early erythroblasts in the bone marrow and in mature reticulocytes in the peripheral blood. Our findings demonstrate a phased organization of the poly(A) tail, which is independent of mRNA stability and maintained during differentiation. The data also reveal a substantial effect of the αCS mutation on its poly(A) tail size. Finally, we present evidence for a switch in the mechanism of hα-globin mRNA decay during erythroid differentiation. The αCS mutation was introduced by splice-overlap extension/polymerase chain reaction (Ref. 20Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and included references) into the wild-type human α2-globin gene carried as a 1.4-kb PstI insert in the pSP72Hα2 plasmid (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were carried out using Vent polymerase (New England BioLabs) under the following conditions: 1 cycle (95°C for 5 min, 57°C for 15 s, and 73°C for 25 s), 28 cycles (92°C for 1 min, 57°C for 15 s, and 73°C for 25 s), 1 cycle (73°C for 3 min).

Reaction R1 contained 10 ng of pSP72Hα2 template, 100 pmol each of primers 589 (5′CTGCACAGCTCCTAAGCCA3′) and 717Reverse (5′GAGGCTTCCAGCTTGACGGTA3′), and yielded the expected 148-bp product. Reaction R2 contained 10 ng of template and 100 pmol each of primers 717 (5′TACCGTCAAGCTGGAGCCTC3′) and SP72U (5′TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA3′) and yielded the expected 240-bp product. 1 μl each of reactions 1 and 2 were combined, heat-denatured, reannealed, and amplified with primers 589 and SP72U as above except that the extension time was increased to 30 s. The expected 368-bp splice-overlap extension product was digested with SphI and BstEII and ligated into the SphI/BstEII site of pSP72Hα2. Aliquots of the ligation mixture were electroporated into competent DH5α cells, and ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened by restriction analysis of plasmid DNA. Candidate clones were purified and sequenced to ensure sequence fidelity. All transgenic mice were generated by the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. The αCS gene was released from its host pSP72 vector by EcoRI digest and introduced into the EcoRI site of the μLCR/pSP72 vector (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 8.0-kb μLCR/αCS fragment released by EcoRV/SalI digestion was purified from a 0.6% agarose gel over an Elutip column according to standard protocol (Schleicher & Schuell). The purified DNA was taken up in buffer (5 ng/μl) for injection into fertilized mouse oocytes (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic αCS mice were identified by dot blot analysis of tail DNA using a β-globin μLCR HSII probe. Six transgenic mouse lines carrying the normal α-globin transgene have been previously described (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); four additional lines constructed in the same manner were added for this study. Transgene copy numbers for αwt and αCS lines were in the same range. Transgene copy number was established by Southern analysis of EcoRI-digested tail DNA from F1 pups. A human α-globin promoter probe (0.6-kb NcoI fragment) detects a 23-kb fragment in the human genome and a 1.5-kb hα-globin transgene fragment. The amount of DNA loaded on each lane was normalized using a probe to the 3′-flanking region of the endogenous mouse ζ-globin gene (2.3-kb BamHI/EcoRI fragment), which detects a 4.5-kb fragment of the mouse genome. Adult transgenic mice were rendered anemic by three intraperitoneal injections of acetyl-2-phenylhydrazine (Sigma, 40 mg/g of body weight) over a 36-h period. Mice were decapitated 4.5 days after the initial injection, and blood was collected into heparinized (20 units/ml) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Femoral and tibial marrow was flushed into heparinized PBS using a 23-gauge needle. Total RNA was isolated from each tissue by lysis in 5 M guanidine thiocyanate solution (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 700 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 1% sarcosyl) and centrifugation through a 5.7 M cesium chloride cushion at 42,000 rpm for 16 h in a TL55 rotor (Beckman). The RNA pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol-precipitated. RNA purity and concentration were determined by A260/280 measurements. Heparinized blood from phenylhydrazine-treated mice was collected as described above, and cells were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g, washed in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in minimum essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. During each incubation, cell viability was verified by minimal release of hemoglobin into the media. Cell aliquots harvested at 0, 24, and 48 h were washed twice in PBS, and total RNA was isolated as described (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of decay of mouse α-globin mRNA in cultured reticulocytes, cell number for each aliquot was determined, and RNA was isolated in the presence of a trace amount of [35S]UTP-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (specific activity, 700,000 cpm/μg) to control for RNA extraction efficiency. The amount of mα-globin mRNA was determined per 5 × 105 cells by RNase protection assay. Antisense RNA probes complementary to the first exon-encoded region of the human α-globin mRNA and the second exon-encoded region of the mouse α-globin mRNA were synthesized from plasmids pGEM3αH and pGEM3αM (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human α-globin (hα-globin) probe was synthesized at 10 times the specific activity of the mα-globin probe by adjusting the amount of [α-32P]CTP in the transcription mix (Maxiscript transcription kit, Ambion). Total RNA isolated from mouse bone marrow (500 ng of total RNA) or reticulocytes (100 ng of total RNA) was mixed with an excess of hα- and mα-globin RNA probes in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), denatured at 75°C for 15 min, and then hybridized at 52°C for 16 h. Excess probe and unhybridized RNA were then digested by addition of 4 μg of RNase A and 200 ng of RNase T1 in a total of 200 μl of buffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA) and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 17 μl of 1:4 mix of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and SDS (10%), phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resolved on an 8% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel. Signal intensity was quantified on a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Poly(A) tail length was determined by a site-specific RNase H cleavage assay (7Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Total RNA (0.1-1 μg) was hybridized to oligonucleotide 662 (5′AACTTGTCCAGGGAGGCGTGC3′) and digested with 0.05 units/μl RNase H in 20 μl of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30°C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and then electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide, 8 M urea gel. The RNA fragments were electrotransferred onto a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was hybridized 16 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 5 × Denhardt's reagent with 106-107 cpm of probe/ml. Blots were then washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C, exposed, and scanned on a PhosphorImager. The probe, which corresponds to a 109-bp fragment of the hα-globin 3′-UTR, was amplified using primer HindIII/726 (5′TGGAAGCTTGCTGGAGCCTCGGTAGCCGT3′) and primer EcoRI/833 (5′CCGAATTCGCCGCCCACTCAGACTTAT3′) in a polymerase chain reaction containing 20 ng of pSP6Hα2FL template (α2-globin cDNA; 25), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, 0.08 mM dCTP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.), and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), for 1 cycle (95°C × 5 min, 56°C × 15 s, and 72°C × 35 s) and 30 cycles (95°C × 1 min, 56°C × 15 s, and 72°C × 35 s). The synthesized probe was purified on a G50 spin column (Boehringer Mannheim) prior to use. Cytoplasmic extracts were obtained by lysis of cells in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.05% deoxycholate, 0.2 mg/ml heparin, and anti-proteases (0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Nuclei and cell debris were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant protein concentration was estimated as described (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Standard protocols were followed for Western analysis and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) using polyclonal chicken anti-αCP antibody (1/10,000 dilution). 2M. Kiledjian and S. A. Liebhaber, unpublished results. Gel shift assay was performed as described (21Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an [α-32P]CTP-labeled hα-globin 3′-UTR RNA probe (50,000 cpm/μl) was incubated with 50-450 μg of protein extract for 30 min at 20°C; RNase T1 (1 units/μl) was added for an additional 10 min, and the complex was resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In humans, the presence of the CS anti-termination mutation in the α-globin mRNA results in accelerated message decay. To establish an in vivo model system in which to study the mechanism(s) of this accelerated decay, transgenic mouse lines that expressed the human αCS gene were generated. An αCS gene was constructed by introducing the CS mutation into the αwt globin gene by splice-overlap extension (see “Experimental Procedures”). The αCS gene was then ligated to a DNA fragment containing all four hypersensitive sites of the human β-globin locus control region (27Talbot D. Collins P. Antoniou M. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Greaves D. Nature. 1989; 33: 352-355Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar) to ensure erythroid-specific high level transgene expression (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five αCS transgenic lines were established and the transgenes mapped in F1 progeny from each line to certify integrity and to establish copy number (Fig. 1B). For the study of αwt mRNA stability, mice from previously described transgenic lines were utilized. The αCS and αwt transgenes are identical except for the single base substitution at the translation termination codon (Fig. 1A), and the transgene copy numbers are in the same range (23Liebhaber S.A. Wang Z. Cash F.E. Monks B. Russell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2637-2646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first goal was to demonstrate that the CS mutation destabilizes the hα-globin mRNA in mouse erythroid tissue. The relative stabilities of αwt and αCS mRNAs were compared using an RNase protection assay that takes advantage of the natural transcriptional silencing that occurs in bone marrow during erythroid differentiation. The ratio of transgene hα- to endogenous mα-globin mRNA in the bone marrow and in the peripheral blood reticulocytes determines two points on an mRNA decay curve (normalized stability, ((hα/mα)peripheral blood/ (hα/mα)bone marrow)). A representative study is shown in Fig. 2A, and the results from the 10 αwt globin lines and the five αCS lines are shown in Fig. 2B The average value of 0.85 for αwt mRNA indicates that its stability is equivalent (within experimental error) to that of the endogenous mα-globin mRNA. The mean value of 0.2 for αCS mRNA indicates that it is highly unstable relative to both mα- and hαwt-globin mRNAs. The 3-fold spread in the normalized stabilities among the αwt lines does not adversely affect the high significance of the difference between αwt and αCS stability (see “Discussion”). Therefore, this transgenic model system accurately reproduces the destabilization of the mutant αCS mRNA observed in humans. The αwt and αCS transgenic mRNAs were studied for the size and organization of their poly(A) tails. If accelerated decay were linked to deadenylation, we might be able to detect a difference in the poly(A) profile of the unstable αCS mRNA when compared with the stable αwt mRNA. The size of the human α-globin mRNA poly(A) tail was determined after site-specific RNase H cleavage of total RNA from bone marrow or peripheral blood (Fig. 3A). The digested fragments were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the 3′-terminal fragment was visualized by Northern blot analysis using a hα-globin mRNA 3′-UTR probe. Typical profiles for αwt and αCS globin poly(A) tail are shown in Fig. 3B In a parallel reaction, oligo(dT) was also added to the RNase H digestion, in order to generate a fully deadenylated 3′-terminal fragment (lane dT, Fig. 3B). The densitometric profiles of single lanes on the autoradiograph reflect the spectrum of poly(A) tail lengths in each sample (Fig. 3C). Analysis of αwt mRNA revealed that poly(A) tail lengths have a periodicity representing increments of 20-25 nucleotides (Fig. 3B). In the bone marrow, the αwt mRNA contains a dominant A60 peak flanked by peaks of lower intensity that correspond to A85 and A40 (Fig. 3B). By comparison, the poly(A) tail of the hα-globin mRNA in peripheral blood reticulocytes is partitioned into four peaks with an overall shift to a smaller mean size; although A60 is still the dominant peak, A85 decreases in intensity, and a significant A20 peak appears. Of note, we do not detect any evidence of fully deadenylated mRNA. These analyses of the αwt globin mRNA indicate that the poly(A) tail is organized in a modular fashion and that the mean poly(A) tail size decreases as bone marrow erythroid cells mature into peripheral reticulocytes. Therefore, α-globin mRNA poly(A) tail phasing is maintained despite its age-related shortening in differentiating erythroid cells. The size distribution of the αCS mRNA poly(A) tail was determined using the RNase H assay. The fully deadenylated αCS fragment migrated at the same position as the αwt fragment (data not shown), indicating that the 3′ end of both mRNAs were processed identically. In bone marrow, the αCS mRNA poly(A) tail was significantly shorter than the αwt and was present in two major peaks of A60 and A40 (Fig. 3, B and C). In reticulocytes, the αCS A40 peak became more prominent. In contrast to the αwt globin mRNA, there was no significant A20 signal. Thus, like the αwt mRNA, the αCS mRNA shows age-related, phased shortening of its poly(A) tail. However, the distribution of the poly(A) tail size on the αCS mRNA is significantly different than on the αwt mRNA in both the bone marrow and in peripheral reticulocytes. Under normal conditions, all erythroid mRNAs undergo final degradation over a 2-3-day period in peripheral blood reticulocytes. This terminal event in erythroid cell maturation may involve stability mechanisms and determinants distinct from those that favor rapid accumulation of globin mRNAs during the earlier phases of erythroid maturation. To directly assess this possibility, we followed mRNA decay during a 48-h ex vivo incubation of peripheral blood reticulocytes. Reticulocyte viability appeared fully maintained during incubation. Endogenous mα-globin mRNA levels fell by 70% during the 48-h incubation (Fig. 4A), indicating that this ex vivo incubation reproduces the reticulocyte mRNA clearance observed in vivo (28Russell J.E. Morales J. Liebhaber S.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 57,PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of transgenic αwt and αCS mRNAs were measured relative to endogenous mouse α-globin mRNA in ex vivo incubated reticulocytes over a 48-h period. A typical RNase protection assay is shown in Fig. 4B, and average stabilities from studies of four αwt and three αCS lines are plotted in Fig. 4C Consistent with the accelerated decay of the αCS mRNA in bone marrow erythroid cells, the initial levels of αCS mRNA were considerably lower than αwt mRNA levels. Surprisingly, however, the stabilities of the αCS and the αwt mRNAs were equivalent. Thus the αCS mRNA is unstable relative to the αwt mRNA in the bone marrow, but the αwt and αCS mRNAs decay at comparable rates in peripheral reticulocytes. The kinetics of poly(A) tail shortening were determined in the ex vivo incubated reticulocytes (Fig. 5). The αwt globin mRNA shortened over the 48-h incubation from an initial multipeak distribution to a single intense peak of A20. At the beginning of the incubation period, αCS mRNA was distributed into two peaks, A60 and A40. Like the αwt mRNA poly(A) tails, the αCS poly(A) tails that remain after an additional 48 h were shortened to a single A20 peak. Thus for both mRNAs there is a progressive shortening of the poly(A) tail to a minimal size of A20. Whether deadenylation precedes or parallels mRNA degradation during late reticulocyte differentiation is unknown. The appearance of the A20 peak in the αCS mRNA poly(A) tail, in coordination with a equivalent rate of decay for both αwt and αCS mRNA, suggests a switch in the degradation pathway of globin mRNA in the late stages of reticulocyte differentiation. αCS is degraded faster than αwt mRNA in marrow erythroid cells. The same accelerated decay of αCS mRNA has been noted in cultured MEL cells, which represent an early stage in terminal erythroid differentiation (19Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8123-8132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By comparison, both mRNAs are equally stable in peripheral reticulocytes. The stability of αwt mRNA in early erythroblasts (MEL cells) is dependent upon formation of an RNP complex on its 3′-UTR (21Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The convergence of αwt and αCS mRNA stabilities during terminal erythroid differentiation might therefore reflect a decrease in the ability of mature cells to assemble the α-complex and selectively protect the"

Since most cell types can produce both TGFβ receptors and ligand(s), the regulation of cellular responsiveness relies on the production of active TGFβ and its presentation to signaling receptors. Therefore, the role of receptor protein associations, turnover, and down-regulation is likely critical for the control of TGFβ signals and the modulation of overall cellular responsiveness. TGFβ-IIR levels have been shown to correlate with TGFβ responsiveness (15Sun L. Wu G. Willson J.K.V. Zborowska E. Yang J. Rajkarunanayake I. Wang J. Gentry L.E. Wang X.-F. Brattain M.G. J. Biol.

We have examined the biosynthesis and ligand-induced modulation of naturally expressed TGFβ-IR and TGFβ-IIR in CCL-64 mink lung epithelial cells, which are known to express abundant amounts of all three TGFβ receptors and are potently growth inhibited by exogenous TGFβ. CCL-64 mink lung epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in McCoy's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Subconfluent (∼80%) cell monolayers were labeled with 500 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (>1000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Irvine, CA) for 20 min in improved minimal essential medium lacking cysteine and methionine. After a quick wash with chase medium (McCoy's medium: 5% fetal calf serum, 300 μg/ml cysteine, 500 μg/ml methionine), the cells were incubated in chase medium for the indicated times. For steady-state labeling, cells were incubated with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label for 2.5 h in improved minimal essential medium lacking cysteine and methionine. Following labeling the cell monolayers were prepared as described below. Cell monolayers in 100-mm tissue culture plates were solubilized with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM NaMo4, 2 mM NaVO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4°C. After a 12,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min, the lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 30 min at 4°C and precipitated overnight with a polyclonal TGFβ-IR (V-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), TGFβ-IIR (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or TGFβ-IIR 2732 antibodies. The latter was raised against the extracellular domain of the human type II receptor overexpressed in Sf9 cells as a HIS-tagged protein and provided by Dr. Xiao-Fan Wang (Duke University, Durham, NC). This incubation was followed by a 1.5-h incubation with protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose particles were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and the immune complexes dissociated with lysis buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min at 95°C. The concentration of SDS was diluted to 0.1% with lysis buffer and a second immunoprecipitation with the same antibody was performed for 2.5 h at room temperature, the last 1.5 h in the presence of protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Cell lysates were subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with TGFβ-IR or TGFβ-IIR antibodies as described above. After washes the immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were treated with 50 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Sigma) in 17 mM phosphate-buffered saline, pH 5.5 (170 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer) for 24 h at 37°C or deglycosylated using an enzymatic deglycosylation kit containing NANase II, O-glycosidase DS, and PNGase F according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Control samples were treated with the same buffers lacking enzymes. After deglycosylation, a second immunoprecipitation was performed as described above, and the samples were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Cell monolayers in 6-well plates were preincubated in a binding buffer (128 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2% BSA) for 15 min at 37°C. Fresh binding buffer containing 1 ng/ml 125I-TGFβ1 (specific activity, 173 μCi/μg; DuPont NEN) with or without 100-fold excess unlabeled TGFβ1 (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) was added and the plates incubated in a 37°C water bath for different times ranging from 1 to 30 min. After incubation at 37°C the plates were quickly put on ice and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% BSA. 125I-TGFβ1 bound to cell surface receptors was acid washed with 50 mM glycine, pH 2.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2 M urea twice for 3 min at 4°C. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% BSA, cells were lysed with 1 M NaOH for 30 min at 37°C. 125I measurements from acid-washed and NaOH-lysed cells, representing both the surface bound not internalized and internalized ligand, respectively, were determined in a Gamma 7000 counter (Beckman Instruments). Binding was performed on adherent cells in 100-mm tissue culture dishes as described previously (24Arteaga C.L. Coffey Jr., R.J. Dugger T.C. McCutchen C.M. Moses H.L. Lyons R.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in binding buffer (see above) containing 1 ng/ml 125I-TGFβ1 with or without 100-fold excess unlabeled TGFβ1 for 4 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. After two washes with ice-cold binding buffer without BSA on ice, the bound 125I-TGFβ1 was cross-linked to cell surface receptors with 50 μM disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) for 15 min at 4°C in 10 ml of binding buffer without BSA. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer as described above (cell lysis and immunoprecipitation) and the lysates subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with TGFβ-IR or TGFβ-RII antibodies followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1.5 h. Immune complexes were then resolved by 5-15% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Exposures on PhosphorImager screens and image analysis with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) were used to visualize labeled proteins in some cases. For Western blotting, 100-μg aliquots of cellular protein were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry electrophoretic transfer (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with antibodies in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with TTBS for 10 min each. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulins (Amersham Corp.) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Recent studies using cycloheximide to block cellular protein synthesis have suggested that the turnover rate of TGFβ binding sites in bone cells is relatively fast (25Centrella M. Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18616-18622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since TGFβ-IR cannot bind TGFβ1 alone, these affinity binding studies provide clues only on the turnover of TGFβ-IIR protein. We have followed the fate of metabolically labeled receptors in CCL-64 mink lung epithelial cells. Subconfluent cultures were labeled with Tran35S-label for 20 min followed by chase with medium lacking label for variable times. The newly synthesized TGFβ-IIR first appeared as a ∼60-kDa form with a half-life of <30 min (Fig. 1A). This form was sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 1B). Since endoglycosidase H cleaves only high mannose oligosaccharides but not more complex structures, this result suggests that this ∼60-kDa form represents an ER, pre-Golgi precursor form. Within 15 min of the chase, a ∼70-kDa endoglycosidase H-resistant smear appeared with a longer half-life of approximately 60 min. This form was sensitive to deglycosylation by enzymes that remove all N- and O-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 1B), indicating it represents the mature type II receptor. TGFβ-IR was also first synthesized as a precursor form of molecular mass ∼53 kDa that was chased to a mature ∼55-kDa protein (Fig. 2A). The observed half-life of both precursor and mature forms was considerably longer than that of TGFβ-IIR. The longer persistence of the type I receptor precursor form indicates a less efficient ER processing compared with that of TGFβ-IIR precursor. The steady-state 35S-labeled mature TGFβ-IR was sensitive to N- and O-linked deglycosylation (Fig. 2B), thus indicating that the 55-kDa form represents the fully processed cell surface receptor. The higher molecular mass band was not blocked by competing immunizing peptide, indicating it is nonspecific (Fig. 2B). We analyzed next whether TGFβ could further influence the rapid turnover of TGFβ-IIR. For this purpose, subconfluent cells were labeled with Tran35S-label for 2.5 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium followed by chase with full medium. At the end of the labeling (time 0) both the precursor and the mature TGFβ-IIR could be immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates (Fig. 3A). The amount of the mature ∼70-kDa TGFβ-IIR was higher compared with the precursor form indicating that it represents the predominant and/or more stable receptor species. In cells that were treated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 for the last 20 min of labeling as well as throughout the chase, two other proteins coprecipitated with TGFβ-IIR: a ∼50-kDa and a ∼37-kDa protein, the latter corresponding to the size of TRIP-1 (TGFβ receptor interacting protein-1 (26Chen R.-H. Miettinen P.J. Maruoka E.M. Choy L. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 377: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar)). The identity of these proteins was not further confirmed, but their ability to coprecipitate with TGFβ-IIR antibodies in a ligand-dependent manner under stringent double immunoprecipitation conditions suggests a strong association induced by exogenous ligand. In the presence of TGFβ1 the half-life of the mature TGFβ-IIR was shortened to approximately 45 min (Fig. 3B). Labeling with Tran35S-label for 2.5 h in methionine/cysteine-free medium followed by chase with full medium indicated that the ∼55-kDa mature TGFβ-IR form was the predominant one (Fig. 4). Some TGFβ-IR protein could still be immunoprecipitated 18 h after the 2.5-h steady-state labeling indicating that TGFβ-IR half-life was considerably longer than that of TGFβ-IIR. Contrary to the results with TGFβ-IIR, the half-life of steady-state 35S-labeled TGFβ-IR was not considerably affected by TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 4). We addressed whether the rapid turnover of TGFβ receptors in the presence of ligand was due to endocytosis and degradation. To measure the rate of 125I-TGFβ1 internalization, cells were exposed to the radiolabeled ligand for different times at 37°C. Surface-bound ligand was released from the cell surface by an acid wash procedure. This buffer (pH 2.4) was shown to remove ∼95% of specifically bound 125I-TGFβ1 after 2 h of binding at 4°C, conditions under which no ligand internalization should occur (Fig. 5A, bars 2). To confirm the efficacy of our receptor stripping procedure, binding was performed in intact cells after acid wash. Cell membranes were not affected by the transient exposure to low pH, since 125I-TGFβ1 binding was comparable with that in non-pretreated cells (Fig. 5A, bars 3 versus bar 1). A time-dependent increase in acid-washable specific binding of 125I-TGFβ1 was observed (Fig. 5B).Very little ligand was internalized during the first 10 min of the experiment, and even after a 30-min incubation at 37°C the ratio of surface/internalized ligand was 0.25 (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the rapid turnover of TGFβ receptors in the presence of ligand may not be explained by endocytosis and subsequent degradation. This was further supported by Western blot analysis of TGFβ1-treated cells. An overnight incubation with exogenous ligand did not alter TGFβ-IIR content in CCL-64 cells (Fig. 5C). The possibility that the short half-life results from the release of the extracellular domain of TGFβ-IIR into the medium was investigated by immunoprecipitation of the chase medium after labeling with Tran35S-label (see above) with the polyclonal TGFβ-IIR antibody (#2732) raised against the receptor's extracellular domain. Even with a long exposure time no proteins were detected in the precipitated chase medium 1-3 h after cell labeling (data not shown), and small proteolytic fragments also were not detected in the precipitated cell lysates (Fig. 1A). Chen et al. (27Chen R.-H. Moses H.L. Maruoka E.M. Derynck R. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported recently that the cytoplasmic domains of type I and II receptors have an inherent affinity for each other even in the absence of the ligand. The interaction was shown to require kinase activity and thus depended on phosphorylation. Part of the receptors at cell surface exist as hetero-oligomers although TGFβ-IIR homo-oligomers predominate (28Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 29Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We studied the stage at which TGFβ-IR can associate with TGFβ-IIR by stripping oligosaccharide chains from receptor proteins with tunicamycin followed by 125I-TGFβ1 binding at 4°C, covalent cross-linking, and precipitation with TGFβ-IIR or -IR antibodies. Tunicamycin inhibits the formation of N-glycosidic linkages during protein synthesis with the newly synthesized proteins mimicking the precursor/ER form of the receptors. The trafficking of receptors to the cell surface was not eliminated by tunicamycin. Treatment with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin for 5 h was enough to deglycosylate TGFβ-IIR, whereas 24 h of treatment was needed for TGFβ-IR (Fig. 6), consistent with the longer half-life and slower processing in the ER of the type I receptor (Fig. 2). Deglycosylated TGFβ-IIR was able to bind exogenous ligand and associate with both fully processed TGFβ-IR (5 h, lane 2) and deglycosylated TGFβ-IR as judged by coprecipitation by TGFβ-IIR antibodies (24 h, lane 2) and TGFβ-IR antibodies (24 h, lane 4). However, deglycosylated TGFβ-IIR did not coprecipitate with TGFβ-IR antibodies (5 h, lane 4). This could well reflect a lower precipitation efficiency of the latter since TGFβ-IIR antibodies coprecipitated both deglycosylated TGFβ-IIR and mature TGFβ-IR (5 h, lane 2). The lesser amounts of deglycosylated TGFβ-IR that could be detected in the presence of tunicamycin (24 h panel) may reflect diminished trafficking to the cell surface, an alternation in the half-life of the ER form of TGFβ-IR, and/or a critical need of N-linked glycosylation in TGFβ-IR for ligand binding. These not mutually exclusive possibilities will require further study. In summary, native TGFβ type I and II receptors are processed differently and separately in mink lung epithelial cells, with the TGFβ-IIR protein exhibiting a more efficient ER processing and a much shorter half-life (approximately 60 min versus >12 h) than type I receptor. Studies with exogenous labeled ligand suggested that the fast turnover of TGFβ-IIR protein is not due to receptor endocytosis and subsequent degradation. This short metabolic half-life of native TGFβ-IIR, as measured directly by metabolic labeling, agrees with a recent study in osteoblasts. In this study, suppression of protein synthesis with cycloheximide reduced 125I-TGFβ1 binding to types I and II receptor with a half-life of 2 h (25Centrella M. Ji C. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18616-18622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The rapid reduction in binding to TGFβ-IR in this study may not have reflected the stability of newly synthesized type I receptor but could be explained by the reduction in type II receptor, critical for TGFβ-IR binding. Our direct biosynthetic studies suggest a more prolonged half-life for TGFβ-IR in epithelial cells. It is possible perhaps that the turnover of TGFβ receptors may be different in cells of different lineage and/or altered by endogenous secretion of receptor ligands. This speculation requires further study. The short metabolic half-life of TGFβ-IIR may have important implications for the reversible and rapid modulation of the many TGFβ-mediated cellular responses. In addition its different processing with that of TGFβ-IR allows for a possible additional mechanism of regulation of TGFβs actions. We thank Teresa C. Dugger for expert technical assistance and Dr. Peter Nørgaard for helpful discussions. Processing of the transforming growth factor β type I and II receptors. Biosynthesis and ligand-induced regulation.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 272Issue 27PreviewIn Fig. 4 of the above mentioned manuscript we identified an ∼55-kDa 35S-labeled band as the mature type I TGF-β receptor which was not altered in its turnover by exogenous (10 ng/ml) recombinant TGFβ1. For this experiment, receptor turnover was assessed in the absence of glycosidases. In a recent paper, Dr. Wellset al. (1) identify two species of type I receptors: an Endo H-sensitive population with a half-life of about 3 h and an Endo H-resistant population. By subtracting the amount of Endo H-sensitive receptor from the total amount (N-glycosidase F-treated) of TGF-βRI, the authors estimate that no more than 50% of the pulse-labeled TGF-βRI is converted to an Endo H-resistant form.

Malaria is still one of the world's most devastating infectious diseases, afflicting several hundred million people and killing close to two million children each year (1Sturchler D. Parasitol. Today. 1989; 5: 39-40Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly species, has become widely resistant to most available antimalarial therapies (2Wellhoner H.H. Neville Jr., D.M. Srinivasachar K. Erdmann G. J. Biol.

The mainstays of treatment and prophylaxis, the quinolines, are excellent parasitocidal agents for susceptible organisms but are becoming less and less efficacious. New antimalarials are desperately needed, and an agent that attacked the same vital target as chloroquine, but was not subject to the same resistance modes, would be highly desirable (4Olliaro P.L. Goldberg D.E. Parasitol. Today. 1995; 11: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Chloroquine and related drugs appear to work by accumulating to high concentrations in the parasite digestive vacuole (5Veignie E. Moreau S. Ann. Trop. Med.

Banyal H.S. Chevli R. Fitch C.D. Science. 1981; 214: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and inactivating critical proteases (8Vander Jagt D. Hunsaker L. Campos N. Scaletti J.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To counter this, the parasite polymerizes heme into a crystalline matrix called hemozoin, in which heme units are coordinated via a unique iron-carboxylate linkage (10Slater A. Swiggard W. Orton B. Flitter W. Goldberg D. Cerami A. Henderson G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). A family of molecules called histidine-rich proteins has been implicated in the polymerization reaction (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and lipids may also contribute to the process (12Bendrat K. Berger B. Cerami A. Nature. 1995; 378Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is postulated that once hemozoin formation has been initiated, extension of the polymer is able to proceed nonenzymatically (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Chloroquine can block this extension reaction, resulting in accumulation of toxic heme (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y.

We recently reported that selected hexadentate (N4O2) ethylenediamine-bis[propyl((R)-benzylimino)]Fe(III) complexes are hydrolytically stable and possess pharmacological potential resulting from a favorable balance of hydrophobicity and delocalized monocationic charge which enhance cell membrane permeability (31Sharma V.

Because members of the N4O2 class of metal(III) complexes are known to interact with at least one ATP-binding cassette transporter, we originally conceived that these compounds could be designed to target ATP-binding cassette homologs in P. falciparum As potential antimalarial agents, the hexadentate metal(III) complexes with the general structure shown in Fig. 1 offer tremendous flexibility, since their metal binding affinities can be varied by inserting appropriate donor atoms to match the requirements of various coordinated metals, including Fe(III), thereby enhancing stability of the intact complex (31Sharma V.

Chem. 1995; 34: 93-101Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We report that these compounds comprise a new class of readily synthesized antimalarials that blocks hemozoin formation. Additionally, while several agents were effective against chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant clones, one agent showed paradoxically selective toxicity solely against chloroquine-resistant clones in a non-pfmdr1-dependent manner. All reagents, solvents, and metal salts (nitrates and acetylacetonates of Al(III), Fe(III), Ga(III), and In(III)) were obtained from Aldrich or Alpha Chemical Co. as analytical grade materials. Heptadentate precursors of the desired Schiff base hexadentate ligands (1, Fig. 1) were obtained by condensation of the appropriate linear tetramine and three equivalents of substituted salicylaldehyde in ethanol or in dry methylene chloride as described previously (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A bis-salicylaldamine analog of 1 was obtained by condensation of the appropriate linear tetramine and two equivalents of 3-methoxy-substituted salicylaldehyde followed by in situ reduction of the Schiff base as described (40Wong E. Liu S. Lugger T. Hahn F.E. Orvig C. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 93-101Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 2V. Sharma, A. Beatty, D. E. Goldberg, and D. Piwnica-Worms, manuscript submitted. Heptadentate Schiff base precursors and Schiff base reduced analogs were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, infrared (IR), and mass spectrometry (fast atom bombardment-high resolution mass spectrometry) at the Washington University Resource for Biomedical and Bioorganic Mass Spectrometry Facility (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Metal complexes were obtained through the reactions of Schiff base precursors and reduced analogs with the appropriate metal salts in ethanol as described previously (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Resulting metal(III) complexes were characterized by 1H NMR (except for Fe(III) complexes), IR, fast atom bombardment-low resolution spectrometry and elemental analysis establishing structural identity and confirming purity. Plasmodium falciparum lines (HB3, FCR-3, Indochina-1/CDC (Indo-1), Dd2 and progeny of the HB3xDd2 cross (39Wellems T.E. Panton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. do Rosario V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A.

Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at 5% parasitemia, 2% hematocrit using human serum and erythrocytes, in a 3% oxygen, 3% carbon dioxide atmosphere. Synchronization of developmental stage was achieved by sorbitol treatment (42Lambros C. Vanderberg J. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Parasite growth inhibition and half-maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC50) of antagonists were determined by measuring [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation (43Desjardins R.E. Canfield R.J. Haynes J.D. Chulay J.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1979; 16: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). Parasites were incubated with antagonist for 24 h starting at the late ring stage, and then [3H]hypoxanthine was added for 4 h at the mid-trophozoite stage before harvesting parasites and assaying for incorporated radioactivity. To assay for verapamil reversal, parasites were incubated with antagonist ± verapamil for 72 h, and then [3H]hypoxanthine was added. All drugs were added as 1:1000 dilutions of a 10 mM dimethyl sulfoxide stock. Vehicle alone had no effect on [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation. The procedure used was modified from those of Slater and Cerami (14Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and Dorn et al. (44Dorn A. Stoffel R. Matile H. Bubendorf A. Ridley R. Nature. 1995; 374: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Hemin (50 μM) was incubated with parasite-derived hemozoin (2 μg/ml) in 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 (final volume 0.5 ml). After 16 h at 37°C, product was harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended by brief sonication in 1 ml of 2.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.1, with incubation at 37°C for 30 min. Centrifugation was repeated and the resultant pellet washed in 1 ml of 2.5% SDS with sonication. After centrifugation, the pellet was solubilized with 2.5% SDS, 50 mN NaOH (1 h at room temperature with intermittent mixing). Product was measured spectrophotometrically (A) at 400 nm. Control incubations had no added hemin or hemin alone, and the sum of their adsorption values was subtracted. Individual inhibitors or chloroquine was added directly to the incubations and was compared with incubations containing drug vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) alone. The histidine-rich protein II (HRP II)-mediated polymerization assay was performed as described previously (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) using 500 pmol of protein incubated at 37°C for 16 h in a 1-ml reaction with 50 μM hematin. The digestive vacuole proteases plasmepsins I and II and falcipain were purified and assayed using [14C]globin substrate as described previously (9Gluzman I. Francis S. Oksman A. Smith C. Duffin K. Goldberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were added as 1:1000 dilutions of a 10 mM dimethyl sulfoxide stock. All reagents and starting materials were inexpensive and commercially available, favorable practical considerations for the development of these agents. The synthesis and characterization of these compounds are described elsewhere (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Wong E. Liu S. Lugger T. Hahn F.E. Orvig C. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 93-101Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An appealing property of the ethylenediamine-N,N′-bis[propyl(2-hydroxy-(R)-benzylimino)] ligand 1 ((R)-ENBPI; Fig. 1) and the corresponding Schiff base reduced amino analog ((R)-ENBPA; Fig. 1) is their ability to efficiently form stable “holo-complexes” with a wide range of metal ions (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40Wong E. Liu S. Lugger T. Hahn F.E. Orvig C. Inorg. Chem. 1995; 34: 93-101Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Specifically, we synthesized complexes of the general structure 2 coordinating Al(III), Fe(III), Ga(III), and In(III) from the reactions of heptadentate Schiff base precursors and Schiff base amino derivatives with corresponding metal(III) acetylacetonates or hydrated metal(III) salts in refluxing ethanol or methanol, respectively. Formation of these metal(III) complexes from the ligands 1 (Fig. 1) results in formation of racemic mixtures of stereoisomers (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 45Sarma B.D. Bailar J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 5476-5480Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of Fe(III) in malarial metabolism and relative biocompatibility of this metal with the host, Fe(III) compounds were the target leads tested against P. falciparum trophozoites in intra-erythrocytic culture. P. falciparum killing curves for the 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Fe(III) derivative are shown in Fig. 2A IC50 values of 1 to 1.5 μM were obtained against chloroquine-sensitive HB3 as well as against resistant FCR-3, Indo-1, and Dd2 lines. Control experiments with chloroquine confirmed that the HB3 line was sensitive, whereas the others were chloroquine-resistant (Table I, bottom). While the 3-methoxy-ENBPI Fe(III) analog was as potent as the 4,6-dimethoxy analog against the chloroquine-sensitive line, the agent was less effective against the resistant FCR-3 and Indo-1 lines (Table I). Parasite death as measured by the [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay correlated well with direct blood smear counts. The drugs were also observed to be most effective at the mid-trophozoite stage. For example, using the 4,6-dimethoxy derivative, more mature parasites were resistant and less mature parasites grew normally until they developed into trophozoites, at which point they were killed by the treatment (Fig. 2B). Parasites cultured in the presence of drug showed greatly diminished hemozoin formation. In contrast, control parasites matured normally, developing a large digestive vacuole filled with hemozoin pigment, and then underwent normal schizogony.Table IAntimalarial activity of (R)-ENBPI metal(III) complexes against chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) and -resistant (CQR) P. falciparum clones in vitroMetal(R)-ENBPI complexesConcentrationClonesSubstitutionsHB3 (CQS)FCR-3 (CQR)Indo-1 (CQR)R3R4R6μM% growth inhibitionFe(III)OMeHH590.431.151.6Fe(III)HOMeOMe599.996.196.1In(III)HOMeOMe5NAANAANAAChloroquine0.0274.5NAANAA Open table in a new tab We therefore assessed the ability of drug to block heme polymerization in an in vitro assay. Heme was incubated with pre-formed hemozoin under acidic conditions in the presence of varying concentrations of the 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Fe(III) complex. The compound was a potent polymerization inhibitor with an IC50 of ∼4 μM (Table II). Control experiments confirmed an identical IC50 for chloroquine. Recent data suggest that the parasite's HRP II can initiate heme polymerization in the Plasmodium digestive vacuole (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Fe(III) complex showed equivalent potency in blocking polymerization using the HRP II assay (IC50∼ 4 μM).Table IIInhibition of Plasmodium culture (HB3) and hemozoin formation by (R)-ENBPI metal(III) complexes correlates with MDR1mediated drug resistanceENBPI ligandMetalParasite culture IC50Hemozoin IC50MDR1-mediated fold resistanceμMμM(R) = 3-MeOFe(III)2477Ga(III)>20502.6Al(III)>20302.6In(III)>20>501.4(R) = 4,6-Di-MeOFe(III)14>200Ga(III)32>200Al(III)33>200In(III)>20401.0 Open table in a new tab To determine whether coordination of Fe(III) per se was critical for antimalarial activity or whether overall conformations of the intact metallopharmaceutical conferred the desired effect, parasite culture and heme polymerization inhibition curves were also generated for 3-methoxy- and 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI complexes using a variety of coordinated metals including Ga(III), Al(III), and In(III) (Table II). An excellent correlation was found between inhibition of hemozoin formation and ability to kill the Plasmodium culture for all complexed metal species. In particular, note that the 3-methoxy-ENBPI Ga(III) complex was a relatively poor inhibitor of both HB3 culture growth and heme polymerization, whereas the 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Ga(III) analog was a potent inhibitor in both assays. Furthermore, the 3-methoxy-ENBPI Ga(III) complex was equally ineffective against the chloroquine-resistant FCR-3 line, whereas the 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Ga(III) analog was equally potent (data not shown). Interestingly, the potency of inhibition of both heme polymerization and HB3 Plasmodium culture correlated well with the fold resistance to the agents induced by expression of the human MDR1 P-glycoprotein in a cancer cell cytotoxicity assay (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Table II). To further determine if demetallation reactions were potentially involved in the mechanism of inhibition of heme polymerization, a variety of metal salts were directly tested in the hemozoin assay (Table III). Although ferric Fe(III) and Al(III) cations were potent inhibitors of the process (IC50 values of 0.7 μM and 1.5 μM, respectively), Ga(III) had little effect (IC50 = 100 μM), despite the substantial antagonist activity of (R)-ENBPI Ga(III) complexes. Conversely, while the In(III) cation showed modest inhibition (IC50 = 25 μM), the (R)-ENBPI In(III) complexes were completely ineffective. With the exception of modest activity of Fe(II), a variety of other physiological dicationic metals were ineffective (Table III). Control experiments demonstrated that the counter anions (iodide, nitrate, and perchlorate) were also without effect (data not shown). Therefore, the lack of correlation between potency of metal(III) salts and their corresponding (R)-ENBPI metal(III) complexes for inhibition of heme polymerization again pointed toward the intact holo-complex as the biochemically active component.Table IIIEffect of metal salts (10 μM) on heme polymerizationMetal% inhibition of heme polymerizationFe2+54 ± 2Fe3+100 ± 0Al3+94 ± 12In3+22 ± 1Ga3+0 ± 0Co2+−1 ± 12Cu2+−3 ± 2Ni2+−9 ± 2Zn2+5 ± 4Ca2+−6 ± 5Mn2+2 ± 1Mg2+0 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Because of the association between (R)-ENBPI metal(III) complexes and P-glycoprotein transport, and since the agents appeared to target the digestive vacuole in Plasmodium culture, assays were performed to examine possible inhibition of vacuolar protease action. The 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Fe(III) complex at 10 μM had no effect on the globin cleavage activities of aspartic proteases plasmepsins I and II nor of the cysteine protease falcipain (data not shown), each purified from cultured parasites. To explore additional aspects of structure-activity relationships, the reduced amine 3-methoxy-ENBPA Ga(III) complex (MR045) was synthesized. As with its imine analog (Table II), there was relatively poor activity against the chloroquine-sensitive HB3 clone in culture (Fig. 3; IC50> 20 μM). However, and quite remarkably, the compound was active against the chloroquine-resistant Dd2 clone (Fig. 3) as well as other resistant lines (IC50 = 0.5-1 μM). Similarly, the agent was a potent inhibitor of hemozoin formation in vitro (IC50∼1 μM; data not shown). Control experiments confirmed that verapamil, a known reversal agent (46Martin S.K. Oduola A.M. Milhous W.K. Science. 1987; 235: 899-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), indeed reversed chloroquine resistance in Dd2, while showing no effect on HB3 (Dd2: chloroquine (40 nM), 10% growth inhibition; verapamil (0.6 μM), 25%; chloroquine (40 nM) plus verapamil (0.6 μM), 87%. HB3: chloroquine (40 nM), 99% growth inhibition; verapamil (0.6 μM), 6%; chloroquine (40 nM) plus verapamil (0.6 μM), 99%. S.E. ± 2%; n = 3 each). However, verapamil did not alter MR045 susceptibility in chloroquine-resistant Dd2 nor reverse MR045 resistance of HB3 (Dd2: MR045 (1 μM), 99% growth inhibition; MR045 (1 μM) plus verapamil (0.6 μM), 99%. HB3: MR045 (1 μM), 11% growth inhibition; verapamil (0.6 μM), 12%; MR045 (1 μM) plus verapamil (0.6 μM), 34%. S.E. ± 2%; n = 3 each). To reconcile these hemozoin and verapamil data requires that the (R)-ENBPA Ga(III) complex, but not chloroquine, was acted upon by a verapamil-insensitive export or sequestration mechanism in HB3 parasites, whereas chloroquine, but not the Ga(III) complex, was acted upon by a verapamil-sensitive mechanism in Dd2 parasites. To further characterize the basis of this selectivity, the 3-methoxy-ENBPA Ga(III) complex was tested against 21 independent recombinant progeny of a genetic cross between sensitive HB3 and chloroquine-resistant Dd2 lines (39Wellems T.E. Panton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. do Rosario V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The pfmdr1 gene, which encodes Pgh1, has been shown not to map with the chloroquine resistance phenotype in this cross. In particular, a BamHI polymorphism at the 3′ end of pfmdr1 that uniquely identifies the inherited Dd2 parental gene is found in four clones (TC-05, QC-23, SC-01, and 3B-D5) of eight chloroquine-resistant progeny and in three clones (3B-B1, B1-SD, and TC-08) of eight chloroquine-sensitive progeny indicating that a gene separate from pfmdr1 is the major determinant of chloroquine resistance (39Wellems T.E. Panton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. do Rosario V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition to these 16 published clones, included herein are five more progeny from this same cross (C188, CH3-61, 116, C408, and D43) in which the inheritance linkage of the chloroquine resistance phenotype has been further refined. Chloroquine-resistant clone C408 and chloroquine-sensitive clone C188 contain genetic crossover markers that localize the chloroquine resistance determinant to a 36-kilobase segment of chromosome 7. 3X.-Z. Su, L. A. Kirkman and T. E. Wellems, unpublished observations. Control culture growth experiments confirmed chloroquine sensitivity for three clones (C188, CH3-61, 116; chloroquine (40 nM): >97 ± 1% growth inhibition) and chloroquine resistance for the remaining two clones (C408 and D43; chloroquine (40 nM): 3 ± 2% and 14 ± 5% growth inhibition, respectively). As shown in Fig. 4, all of the chloroquine-sensitive progeny were resistant to the ENBPA Ga(III) complex, whereas all of the chloroquineresistant progeny were susceptible to the new agent at 5 μM. This evidence indicated that the chloroquine resistance locus and the MR045 susceptibility locus of chromosome 7 were exclusively co-inherited in these haploid progeny. Disruption of hemozoin formation within the digestive vacuole requires that agents such as chloroquine be transported across several membrane bilayers, including the erythrocyte plasma membrane, the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, the parasite plasma membrane, and finally, the digestive vacuole membrane. Detailed mechanisms of chloroquine transport and their contributions to drug resistance have yet to be fully understood. Chloroquine is modestly lipophilic and possesses titratable protons that confer a net positive charge in acid environments. Thus, it has been proposed that diffusive transmembrane transport and drug trapping may account for concentrative accumulation of chloroquine within the digestive vacuole (reviewed in Ref. 47Slater A. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1993; 57: 203-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The net cationic charge provided by protonation of the agent or binding to high affinity sites within the vacuole (ferriprotoporphyrins or hemozoin) may prevent back diffusion of the compound (13Chou A. Chevli R. Fitch C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 48Sullivan D.J.J. Gluzman I.Y. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11865-11870Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Other contributions to chloroquine uptake and antimalarial action may involve its properties as an amphiphilic cation which enables adsorption onto phospholipid bilayers (49Wernsdorfer W. McGregor I.(eds) Malaria: Principles and Practice of Malariology. Churchill Livingstone, New York1988Google Scholar) and, as with many hydrophobic compounds possessing a delocalized monocationic charge (50Lichtshtein D. Kaback H.R. Blume A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 51Chernoff D.M. Strichartz G.R. Piwnica-Worms D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), may allow permeation across membranes and concentrative accumulation within cell interiors in response to the negative transmembrane potentials generated by living cells (52Ritchie R.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 43: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Additionally, membrane transporters may contribute either directly or indirectly as has been proposed, for example, with pfmdr1 (38van Es H. Karcz S. Chu F. Cowman A. Vidal S. Gros P. Schurr E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 53Foote S. Cowman A. Acta Trop. 1994; 56: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, interfering with or bypassing any one of the steps that regulate drug permeation or the site of action could confer chloroquine resistance. We report herein the identification of a new class of antimalarial compounds designed to permeate bilayers that demonstrate potent activity in Plasmodium culture and, significantly, against both chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant clones. Antimalarial potency of these compounds in culture correlated with their ability to inhibit heme polymerization, the most potent leads being the 4,6-dimethoxy-ENBPI Fe(III) and the 3-methoxy-ENBPA Ga(III) complexes. For the imino complexes, agents that lack significant parasitocidal activity in Plasmodium culture do not inhibit hemozoin formation in vitro It is unlikely that this can be attributed to differential demetallation reactions of the agents, since this study demonstrated poor correlation between metal(III) salts and intact ENBPI metal(III) complexes for inhibition of hemozoin formation under acidic conditions, and furthermore, the agents have been documented by 1H NMR and UV-visible spectroscopy to be hydrolytically stable at neutral pH (37°C) for 72 h (54Sharma V. Rao V. Reichert D. Crankshaw C. Welch M. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Nucl. Med. 1996; 37: 71-72PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular configuration may be relevant. Crystal structures of (R)-ENBPI Fe(III) and Ga(III) analogs show a trans configuration for the phenolic oxygens around the central coordination sphere (as in Fig. 1) (29Tsang B.W. Mathias C.J. Fanwick P.E. Green M.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 55Ito T. Sugimoto M. Ito H. Toriumi K. Nakayama H. Mori W. Sekizaki M. Chem. Lett. 1983; : 121-124Crossref Google Scholar). However, preliminary molecular modeling data suggest that the identity of the coordination metal in the central core has a profound influence on conformation of the molecule (54Sharma V. Rao V. Reichert D. Crankshaw C. Welch M. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Nucl. Med. 1996; 37: 71-72PubMed Google Scholar). Given the larger ionic radii of six-coordinated In(III) versus Fe(III) and Ga(III) (0.81 Å versus 0.65 and 0.62 Å, respectively) (56Shannon R.D. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1976; 32: 751-767Crossref Scopus (54783) Google Scholar), molecular modeling data suggest that steric constraints favor the cis configuration for the (R)-ENBPI Indium(III) compounds (54Sharma V. Rao V. Reichert D. Crankshaw C. Welch M. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Nucl. Med. 1996; 37: 71-72PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, several compounds preferring the trans configuration are recognized by human MDR1 P-glycoprotein (31Sharma V. Crankshaw C. Piwnica-Worms D. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3483-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), are able to block heme polymerization, and can produce parasite death as shown herein, whereas those favoring the cis configuration cannot, potentially tying together these various biological processes into a common metabolic pathway. While data suggest that conformations of the intact holo-complexes confer pharmacological activity, additional experiments will be required to fully evaluate the potential for acid hydrolysis and demetallation reactions in the digestive vacuole on the overall mechanism of action. The IC50 values for culture inhibition are in some cases slightly lower than those for in vitro heme polymerization. Several possibilities could explain this observation. First, the conditions for heme polymerization in the digestive vacuole could be sufficiently different from those in the assay to change the IC50 value. Second, the compounds could be accumulated against a concentration gradient in the digestive vacuole. Third, it is possible that blocking only a small amount of heme polymerization leads to build-up of enough toxic free heme to kill the intact parasites. The (R)-ENBPI metal(III) complexes had equivalent potency in the pre-formed hemozoin-initiated polymerization assay as in the HRP II-mediated assay. These were similar to results obtained for chloroquine. It has been shown that heme polymerization can be initiated by HRP II-mediated bonding of hemes (11Sullivan Jr., D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Once nucleation has occurred, polymerization can proceed nonenzymatically. Since both the (R)-ENBPI metal(III) complexes and chloroquine work on the hemozoin-seeded (protein-free) as well as the protein-mediated reactions, this suggests that the blockade is either at the nonenzymatic polymer extension phase of the reaction or a direct effect on the heme substrate. Detailed kinetics will be required to distinguish these possibilities. An unanticipated result of this study, as shown in Fig. 4, was the observation that one (R)-ENBPA Ga(III) complex (MR045), which possessed poor antimalarial activity against sensitive clones, showed selective and potent activity against all chloroquine-resistant progeny of a genetic cross (39Wellems T.E. Panton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. do Rosario V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This suggested that a gene for 3-methoxy-ENBPA Ga(III) susceptibility is located on the same 36-kilobase segment of chromosome 7 as the chloroquine resistance gene and likely is the same gene. Of note, the Schiff base (R)-ENBPI Ga(III) analog of this compound showed relatively poor cytotoxicity against both resistant and sensitive lines. Thus, the data indicate that the mechanism that confers chloroquine resistance in these organisms is selectively targeted by the 3-methoxy-ENBPA Ga(III) complex. One possibility is that a transport system is altered in chloroquine resistance (57Krogstad D.J. Gluzman I.Y. Kyle D.E. Oduola A.M.J. Martin S.K. Milhous W.K. Schlesinger P.H. Science. 1987; 238: 1283-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), by mutation of either the transporter or an associated transport regulator. Because chloroquine resistance maps away from the pfmdr1 gene in this cross (39Wellems T.E. Panton L.J. Gluzman I.Y. do Rosario V.E. Gwadz R.W. Walker-Jonah A. Krogstad D.J. Nature. 1990; 345: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), the data further imply that the chloroquine resistance activity cannot be attributed to the Pgh1 transporter. Additionally, unlike chloroquine, selective blockade of the chloroquine-resistant Dd2 line by MR045 was verapamil-insensitive. Thus, the unusual properties of 3-methoxy-ENBPA Ga(III) can be exploited to probe the mechanisms of chloroquine resistance. Clearly, additional experiments must be done to better understand the targeting of these agents, their mechanism of selectivity, and their bioavailability. There is great potential to vary the tetramine backbone and to substitute in a variety of positions on the aromatic ring in this class of compounds. The agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to synthesize, which is a crucial feature for success of a useful reagent or antimalarial drug. It is encouraging that a group of agents with scaffolds capable of incorporating biologically compatible metals like Fe(III) can act against the same putative molecular target as chloroquine but are not susceptible to the same drug resistance mechanisms.

However, it is not clear which, if any, of these kinases are responsible for initiating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates in vivo In the present study, we have utilized a mutant Jak1-deficient HeLa cell line, E1C3, and its parental Jak1-expressing counterpart, 1D4, to analyze the role of Jak1 in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events. IL-4 treatment rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 but not in E1C3 cells. IL-4-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 was pronounced in 1D4 cells, while no IL-4-induced Stat6 phosphorylation was detected in E1C3 cells. IL-4 also induced Stat6 DNA binding activity from lysates of 1D4 but not E1C3 cells utilizing a radiolabeled immunoglobulin heavy chain germline ε promotor sequence (Iε) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Reconstitution of Jak1 expression in E1C3 cells restored the ability of IL-4 to induce IRS and Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation.

In addition, IL-4 has been demonstrated to mediate a diverse array of proliferative and functional effects in cells of nonhematopoietic origin (1Paul W.E.

The multifunctional role of IL-4 is reflected by the ubiquitous expression of IL-4 receptors (IL-4Rs) in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types (2Lowenthal J.W. Castle B.E.

While IL-4Rα possesses a large cytoplasmic domain of approximately 500 amino acids, no consensus sequences for tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases have been identified. It has been demonstrated that IL-4 can also utilize the γ chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rγ) in a complex with IL-4Rα to enhance ligand binding and signal transduction (7Kondo M. Takeshita T.

However, it has not been determined which, if any, of these kinases are involved in mediating IL-4-induced phosphorylation of downstream signaling substrates under physiological conditions. In the present study, we have utilized a mutant HeLa cell line, originally isolated based on its lack of interferon responsiveness, that is deficient in Jak1 expression and its parental counterpart that does express Jak1 (31Loh J.E.

Samelson, and the human monocytic U937 and B lymphoid Ramos cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. Human recombinant IL-4 was obtained from Peprotech and insulin was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Murine anti-Jak1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories, anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, anti-Jak2, and anti-Jak3 sera were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and anti-Fes mAb was from Oncogene Sciences. The phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated IL-4 fluorokine receptor reagent kit was obtained from R & D Systems. Rabbit anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 sera were generated by immunization of rabbits with baculovirus-expressed rat IRS-1 protein or an IRS-2-specific peptide comprised of amino acid residues 1310 to 1322 (LSHHLKEATVVKE), respectively. The anti-IRS-1 serum very weakly recognizes IRS-2, while anti-IRS-2 serum does not recognize IRS-1. The anti-Stat6 peptide serum used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis was raised against amino acid residues 787-804 (GEDIFPPLLPPTEQDLTK) of human Stat6. The adherent 1D4 and E1C3 HeLa cell lines were treated with 0.5 mM EDTA to facilitate their removal from the substrate. HeLa and Ramos cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml. PE-conjugated IL-4 (10 μl) was added to 25 μl of washed cells. As a negative control, 20 μl of anti-human IL-4 neutralizing antibody was mixed with 10 μl of PE-conjugated IL-4 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition to the cell suspensions. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 16°C and washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% NaN3. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickenson). HeLa cells were washed twice and starved for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μg/ml transferrin and 10 nM selenium. After stimulation with IL-4 or insulin (100 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37°C, cells were diluted in PBS containing 100 μM Na3VO4. The cells were then lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM NaPPi, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. The total protein content of the lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of clarified cell lysates (0.5-1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with different antisera (1:500) plus 30 μl of protein G-coupled Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, solubilized with Laemmli buffer, boiled, and resolved by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). For direct immunoblot analysis, proteins from lysates of the various cell lines (200 μg) were directly resolved by SDS-PAGE without prior serum starvation. Immunoblot analysis was performed by transferring separated proteins onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) in Tris-glyceride buffer containing 20% methanol. The membrane was then treated for 1-2 h with 3% non-fat dry milk in TTBS (20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 154 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, 0.05% NaN3), incubated with antibodies in TTBS containing 0.5% BSA (TTBS-BSA) for 1 to 2 h (concentration of antibodies: 2 μg/ml for anti-Tyr(P) and 1:500 for the remaining antisera) and reacted with 125I-labeled protein A (3 × 105 cpm/μl) in TTBS-BSA for 1 h. Alternatively, bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). All procedures were done at room temperature, and membranes were washed extensively with TTBS after each treatment. After the final wash, the membrane was rinsed with distilled water, air dried and autoradiographed with an intensifying screen at −70°C. DNA oligonucleotide probes used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were annealed, labeled, purified, and whole cell extracts were prepared for EMSA essentially as described previously (14Kotanides H.

The sequence of one strand of the double-stranded Iε probe used for EMSA was 5′-GATCTAACTTCCCAAGAACAG-3′. Briefly, 1D4 and E1C3 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated for 10 min with IL-4 (100 ng/ml). Cells were washed once with PBS containing 100 μM Na3VO4 and solubilized in gel shift lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 μM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 167 mM NaCl, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 400 μM dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) by incubation on ice for 1 h and vortexing three to five times. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined. For EMSA, 5 μg of whole cell lysate were incubated with the 32P-labeled Iε probe in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 100 μM EDTA, 500 μM dithiothreitol, 6.0% glycerol, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 15 min. Complexes were subsequently fractionated on 0.22 × TBE (100 mM Tris borate (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA) 4.5% acrylamide gels. E1C3 cells (4 × 106) were plated in a 10-mm tissue culture dish 24 h before transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of a retroviral expression vector containing murine JAK1 cDNA (a kind gift from Dr. Warren Leonard) and 40 μg of carrier DNA using the calcium phosphate method. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were washed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 7-12 h. Cells were then serum-starved as described previously and used for subsequent experiments. To confirm that parental 1D4 HeLa cells expressed Jak1 and that mutant EIC3 HeLa cells were Jak1-deficient, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing an anti-Jak1 mAb. A 130-kDa protein was readily expressed in 1D4 cells, while no protein in this size range was observed in EIC3 cells (Fig. 1A). The 130-kDa protein was also detected in Jurkat cells that are known to express Jak1 (Fig. 1A). The status of Jak2, Jak3, and Fes expression in the two Hela cell lines was also examined by immunoblot analysis, since these tyrosine kinases have also been demonstrated to become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-4 treatment (24Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O.

A Jak2 degradation product of 97 kDa was also observed in all three lines. Anti-Jak3 serum specifically detected the expression of a 120-kDa protein in Jurkat cells, while no protein in this size range was observed in either 1D4 or E1C3 cells (Fig. 1A). A 92-kDa protein was detected in human U937 myeloid cells that are known to express Fes but not in 1D4 or E1C3 cells utilizing an anti-Fes mAb (Fig. 1A). Thus, mutant EIC3 cells do not detectably express Jak1, Jak3, or Fes but do express Jak2. IL-4Rs have been detected on a wide variety of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types at levels ranging from 100 to 5000 sites per cell (2Lowenthal J.W. Castle B.E. Christiansen J.

In order to compare IL-4-induced signal transduction events in the 1D4 and E1C3 cell lines, it was necessary to determine whether these lines expressed receptors capable of binding IL-4. As shown in Fig. 1B, 1D4 and E1C3 cells specifically bound PE-conjugated human IL-4. The human B Ramos cell line, which is known to express high levels of IL-4Rs (2Lowenthal J.W. Castle B.E. Christiansen J. Schreuers J. Rennick D. Arai N. Hoy P. Takebe U. Howard M. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 456-465PubMed Google Scholar), was also found to specifically bind PE-conjugated human IL-4. These results demonstrate that mutant E1C3 cells and their 1D4 parental counterpart express detectable levels of cell surface IL-4Rs. The ability of IL-4 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in 1D4 and E1C3 was next examined. Cells were serum starved and either untreated or stimulated with IL-4 or insulin. Insulin treatment was performed because it is known to mediate potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules, and evidence suggests that activated insulin receptors directly associate with and phosphorylate these substrates (34Gustafson T.A.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for either IRS-1 or IRS-2 and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing anti-phosphotyrosine. IL-4 treatment of 1D4 cells resulted in pronounced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, while no detectable phosphorylation of either substrate was observed in E1C3 cells in response to IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 2A and B). However, insulin treatment led to equivalent increases in the phosphotyrosine content of IRS-1 and IRS-2 molecules in both cell lines. Immunoblot analysis of the same samples with either anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 serum revealed that equivalent amounts of IRS proteins were present in each immunoprecipitate and that IRS expression was similar in both cell lines. 2X. H. Chen and L.-M. Wang, unpublished data. These results strongly suggest that IL-4-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation is mediated through activation of Jak1, while insulin-induced IRS phosphorylation does not require Jak1 expression. It has been established that IL-4 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 and binding of Stat6 to a specific DNA consensus sequence, TTCC(A > T,N)GGAA (13Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 14Kotanides H. Reich N.C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To determine if Jak1 expression is required for mediating these events, we first analyzed whether IL-4 could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat6 in the two HeLa cell lines. Lysates prepared from untreated or IL-4-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for human Stat6, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis utilizing anti-phosphotyrosine. While IL-4 stimulation of 1D4 cells resulted in evident tyrosine phosphorylation of a 100-kDa protein specifically recognized by anti-Stat6 serum, no tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in this size range was detected in response to IL-4 treatment of E1C3 cells (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot analysis of the same immunoprecipitated lysates with anti-Stat6 serum demonstrated that Stat6 expression levels were comparable in the 1D4 and E1C3 cell lines (Fig. 3B). Stat6 can be distinguished from other Stat proteins by its ability to bind to a specific consensus sequence found in the immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line promotor of the IL-4-responsive human Cε gene, designated Iε. To determine whether IL-4 could induce Stat6 binding activity in 1D4 and E1C3 cells, whole cell extracts from untreated or IL-4-treated cells were prepared and assayed for the induction of 32P-labeled Iε DNA binding activity by EMSA. IL-4 stimulation of 1D4 cells led to rapid induction of Iε binding, while no detectable binding activity could be observed after IL-4 treatment of E1C3 cells (Fig. 3C). Thus, Jak1 expression appears to be required for mediating IL-4-induced Stat6 activation. Since the E1C3 cell line was derived by mutagenesis with ethylmethane-sulfonate (31Loh J.E. Chang C.-H. Fodor W.L. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it remained possible that other functional defects could account for the inability of IL-4 to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation events in these cells. Therefore, a mammalian expression vector containing murine Jak1 cDNA was transiently transfected into E1C3 cells (E1C3/Jak1). Immunoblot analysis revealed that Jak1 protein levels attained in E1C3/Jak1 cells were equivalent to those in 1D4 cells (Fig. 4A). The E1C3/Jak1 transfected cells were untreated or stimulated with IL-4 and IRS, and Stat6 phosphorylation was examined. As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, the ability of IL-4 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, IRS-2, and Stat6 was restored in the E1C3/Jak1 transfected cells. The ability of IL-4 to induce binding of Stat6 to Iε as determined by EMSA was also reconstituted in the E1C3/Jak1 cells. 3B. K. R. Patel, unpublished data. These data provide conclusive evidence that Jak1 expression is required for mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS and Stat6 molecules in the HeLa cell system. A recent study demonstrated that Jak1 but not Jak2 or Tyk2 expression is crucial for IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules in a series of mutant derivatives of a human fibroblast cell line, HT 1080 (37Wang H.Y. Zamorano J. Yoerkie J.L. Paul W.E. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1037-1040PubMed Google Scholar). E1C3 cells express Jak2 (see Fig. 1A) and Tyk2 (32Loh J.E. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further excluding the possibility that these Janus kinases are involved in IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates. However, our results do not rule out the possibility that Fes or Jak3 may be capable of evoking IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation events in other cell types, since these kinases do not appear to be expressed in 1D4 or E1C3 lines. It has been reported that Fes expression appears to be limited to cells of the myeloid lineage (38Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P. Moore M.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2379-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since it is well established that IL-4 affects numerous cell types other than those of myeloid origin, the role of Fes in mediating IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrates would be severely restricted. Jak3 is also preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells (39Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3151-3160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several recent studies have indicated that IL-2Rγ expression is not necessarily required for IL-4 function (40Matthews D.J. Clark P.A. Herbert J. Morgan G. Armitage R.J. Kinnon C. Minty A. Grabstein K.H. Caput D. Ferrara P. Callard R. Blood. 1995; 85: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

Since Jak3 has been demonstrated to associate with IL-2Rγ (24Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Lui E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 27Izuhara K. Feldman R.A. Greer P. Harada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18623-18629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this further suggests that it is unlikely that Jak3 is the primary kinase utilized by IL-4 for eliciting its biological functions. We are presently attempting to express Jak3 and Fes in the E1C3 line to determine if these kinases can mediate IL-4-directed tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been demonstrated that a variety of cytokines and growth factors activate Jak1 (23Schindler C. Darnell J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). We have obtained preliminary evidence that interferon-α- and -γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules requires Jak1 expression. 4X. H. Chen, B. K. R. Patel, and L.-M. Wang, unpublished data. It will be of interest to determine whether other cytokines require Jak1 to direct tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS molecules or other substrates under physiological conditions. If so, this would suggest that Jak1 plays a central role in mediating signal transduction through multiple non-tyrosine kinase-containing receptors. In summary, our study strongly suggests that Jak1 is the primary kinase that couples with the IL-4R to initiate tyrosine phosphorylation of critical effector molecules involved in mediating IL-4 elicited signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2034141855,"The lymphoid-specific immunoglobulin μ heavy chain gene intron enhancer (μE) contains multiple binding sites for trans-acting nuclear factors. We have used a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays to reconstruct protein-DNA interactions on a minimal B cell-specific μ enhancer that contains three motifs, μA, μB, and μE3. Using ETS-domain proteins that transactivate the minimal enhancer in non-lymphoid cells, we show that (i) PU.1 binds coordinately to both μA and μB sites in vitro and (ii) in the presence of Ets-1, this factor binds to the μA site and PU.1 to the μB site. Two factors, TFE3 and USF, bind to the μE3 element. When the ETS proteins are present together with μE3 binding proteins, a three-protein-DNA complex is generated. Furthermore, we provide evidence for protein-protein interactions between Ets-1 and PU.1 proteins that bind to μA and μB sites, and between Ets-1 and TFE3 bound to the μA and μE3 sites. We propose that this domain of the μ enhancer is assembled into a nucleoprotein complex that contains two tissue-restricted ETS domain proteins that recognize DNA from the same side of the helix and one ubiquitously expressed bHLH-leucine zipper protein that binds between them, recognizing its site from a different side of the helix.

The immunoglobulin μ heavy chain (IgH) gene intron enhancer is a tissue-specific regulatory element that is necessary for expression of the IgH gene (1Nelsen B. Sen R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 133: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 2Libermann T.W. Baltimore D. Mol. Aspects Cell. Regul. 1990; 6: 399-421Crossref Google Scholar). Since the proposal of Alt and colleagues of the correlation between transcription and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements (3Alt F.W. Blackwell T.K. DePinho R.A. Reith M.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Immunol. Rev. 1986; 89: 5-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 4Yancopoulos G.D. Alt F.W. Cell. 1985; 40: 271-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 5Oltz E.M. Alt F.W. Lin W.-C. Chen J. Taccioli G. Desiderio S. Rathbun G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6223-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the μ enhancer has been considered a likely candidate to be the sequence that regulates rearrangements at this locus. Recently, this hypothesis has been directly verified in mice containing disrupted μ enhancer alleles (6Chen J. Young F. Bottaro A. Stewart V. Smith R.K. Alt F.W.

Thus, the enhancer is activated at very early stages of B cell differentiation, prior to the onset of DH to JH rearrangements. In addition, experiments in transgenic mice have shown that this enhancer is sufficient to direct expression of heterologous genes in B and T lymphoid cells (8Reik W. Williams G. Barton S. Norris M.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), such as those that bind to the μE5 site within the enhancer (23Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 24Kadesch T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 31-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several sites within the enhancer referred to as E motifs. These elements, μE1-μE5, fit the consensus CANNTG and bind proteins belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors (25Murre C. McCaw C.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 50: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1863) Google Scholar) that are expressed in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. We have previously shown that mutation of either μA or μB elements abrogates B cell-specific activity of a 170 nucleotide enhancer (μ170) that contains both these elements as well as μE1, μE3, and μE5. Mutation of individual E motifs in the enhancer reduces, but does not abolish, enhancer activity (2Libermann T.W. Baltimore D. Mol. Aspects Cell. Regul. 1990; 6: 399-421Crossref Google Scholar). For example, a mutation in μE3 results in a 2-fold reduction in the activity of μ170 (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Such results indicate functional redundancy among the several E motifs present in the μ enhancer. To simplify the enhancer for more detailed characterization, we have previously defined a 70-nucleotide minimal μ enhancer (μ70). This fragment contains only the μA, μB, and μE3 elements and activates transcription from a heterologous promoter in S194 plasma cells, when assayed either as a monomer or a dimer. Mutation of the μE3 element in μ70 results in a more drastic reduction of activity compared to the corresponding mutation in μ170. Based on these results we have proposed that the μA and μB elements define a minimal enhancer whose activity is raised by the presence of proximal E motifs (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The μA and μB sites bind members of the ETS domain protein family (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Steenbergen R. Murre C. Mol. Cell.

Binding of the B cell and macrophage-specific factor PU.1 to the wild type μB element and a panel of three nucleotide substitution mutants within the element correlates with the ability of the mutants to activate transcription. These results suggested that PU.1 was a likely candidate for a functionally relevant μB-binding protein. The μA site binds the lymphoid-restricted Ets-1 protein, and mutations in μA, but not μB, affect Ets-1 binding to the μ enhancer in vitro Furthermore, the minimal enhancer can be transactivated by co-expressing PU.1 and Ets-1 in COS non-lymphoid cells, thereby strengthening the idea that these factors can complement the lack of lymphoid-specific factors required for μ enhancer activity (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study we report the detailed interactions of ETS domain proteins and bHLH proteins with the minimal μ enhancer in vitro Methylation and ethylation interference assays show that the contacts made by PU.1 protein on the μB element are very similar to those made by Ets-1 protein bound to its cognate DNA site. These results indicate that these two most distantly related members of the ETS family recognize DNA similarly. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I footprint assays demonstrate that PU.1 protein binds coordinately to both μA and μB elements, although the μA site has a significantly lower affinity for PU.1 compared to μB. In contrast, full length Ets-1 protein binds only to the μA site, within the range of concentrations used in these experiments. When both proteins are present together, Ets-1 and PU.1 bind to the μA and μB sites respectively to generate a tri-molecular complex. The third cis component of the minimal μ enhancer is the μE3 element. Two μE3 binding proteins, TFE3 and USF, can bind to μ enhancer DNA in the presence of ETS domain proteins to generate a three protein-DNA complex in which all three sites, μA, μB, and μE3, are occupied. Furthermore, we provide evidence for protein-protein interaction between PU.1 and Ets-1, and Ets-1 and TFE3. We propose that the μ70 enhancer is activated by a nucleoprotein complex that contains two lymphoid-specific ETS-domain proteins that recognize DNA from one face of the helix and one ubiquitous bHLH-leucine zipper protein that binds between them, probably recognizing the DNA from a different side. The coding region of PU.1 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and cloned into SmaI-digested pGEX-3X: 5′ primer, 5′-G GGT AGG CCT ATG TTA CAG GCG TGC AAA ATG-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-CTG CAC GCT CTG CAG CTC TGT G-3′. The 5′ primer introduces three additional amino acids between the coding regions for glutathione S-transferase and PU.1. GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (28Smith D.B.

An overnight culture of HB101 cells transformed with the appropriate plasmid was diluted 1:10 in LB/ampicillin medium and grown for an additional hour. Expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mM for a further 3-5 h. After induction the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in NETN buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, l mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Extracts were prepared by sonication (three pulses for 10 s each) at 0°C. The insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and the fusion protein was purified from the supernatant by adsorption to glutathione-agarose. Briefly, sonicated supernatant was mixed with the affinity matrix at a ratio of 1 ml of a 50% slurry of beads for 1 liter of bacterial culture, with shaking for 1-2 h at 4°C. The slurry was poured into a 10-ml column and washed with 50 column volumes of cold NETN three times. Adsorbed proteins were eluted by the addition of reduced glutathione at a concentration of 5 mM. One column volume eluates were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside. and the most concentrated fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D.

A 1.2-kilobase pair PvuII-EcoR I fragment containing murine PU.1 cDNA was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase plus dNTPs and cloned into XhoI-digested, Klenow-treated pET14b plasmid (Novagen). For protein expression, the plasmids were transformed into the BL21 bacterial strain, and proteins were purified as specified by the manufacturer (Novagen Inc.). The coding region of murine Ets-1 was isolated as a BamHI fragment from the previously described expression vector pEVRF0-Ets (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). After filling in the ends, this fragment was cloned into pET-14b cut with BamHI and treated with Klenow to create blunt ends. His.Ets was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography. DNA fragments (residues 359-433) (29Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) from the wild-type, μA−, μB−, and M103 mutant enhancers (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) were isolated as Sau3AI-BamHI fragments (note that the BamHI site was introduced by site-specific mutagenesis of the first core site, and the mutation has no effect in transient transfection assays) and cloned into pSP72 cut with BamHI. For labeling each strand, these plasmids were linearized either with EcoR I or XbaI, treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, recut with XbaI or EcoRI, respectively, and a 102-base pair DNA probe purified by preparative acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Typical kinased preparations contained 4-6 × 106 Cerenkov counts/min/100 ng of DNA. Methylation interference assays were carried out using probes described above and GST.PU fusion protein. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to titrate protein levels to obtain 30-50% of the probe retained in the nucleoprotein complex. Ten analytic binding reactions were pooled and loaded onto a preparative 4% acrylamide gel and free and bound DNA extracted by electroelution. Subsequent steps were as described (30Jamieson C. Sen R. DNA Prot. Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 80-82Google Scholar). Ethylation interference assays were performed as described (31Siebenlist U. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) using the above probes and GST.PU fusion proteins. Alkali cleaved DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis through 8% polyacrylamide gels containing urea. The procedures of Gyuris et al. (32Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) were followed as described previously. LexA-PU.1 fusion proteins were generated in the vector pEG202. Full-length PU.1 (1-272) was isolated as a PvuII-EcoRI fragment, and a truncated PU.1 (101-272) was isolated as a NcoI-EcoRI fragment from pBS.PU. After treatment with Klenow enzyme to create blunt ends the fragments were cloned into pEG202 cut with EcoRI and filled in with Klenow. Fusion proteins with the B42 transcription activation domain were generated in the vector pJG4-5. pJG-PU, containing the full-length PU.1 gene cloned 3′ of the transactivation domain was produced by cloning the PvuII-EcoRI PU.1 fragment from pBS.PU into pJG4-5 cut with EcoRI and treated with Klenow. The XhoI-EcoRI fragment of pJG4-5 was replaced by the XhoI-EcoRI polylinker fragment from pSP72 to generate pJG72. pJG-Ets was generated by cloning the Ets-1 containing BamHI fragment from pEVRF-Ets into pJG72 cut with BamHI. The reporter plasmid used in these assays was pSH18-34 containing the GAL1 promoter with eight LexA binding sites fused to a lac Z gene. Quantification of β-galactosidase activity was carried out using a liquid assay as described previously (33Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. M. I.Y. Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harborn, NY1990: 155-159Google Scholar). The DdeI-HinfI fragment (residues 346-518) (29Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) from the wild-type, μA−, μB−, and M103 mutant enhancers was treated with Klenow enzyme and cloned into pSP72 cut with EcoRV. To generate probes for footprinting assays the plasmids were linearized with either EcoRI or BglII, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The fragment was obtained by recutting with either BglII or EcoRI, respectively, and isolated from preparative polyacrylamide gels. For footprinting reactions, 20,000 cpm of probe were incubated with PU.1 proteins in a final volume of 50 μl containing 25 μl of DNA probe mix (1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4% polyvinyl alcohol) containing 50 μg of bovine serum albumin in Buffer D. After incubation for 10 min on ice 50 μl of 10 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM CaCl2 were added, followed by DNase I for 1 min to a final concentration of 17 μg/ml, determined empirically. DNase I digestions were quenched by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 0.2 M NaCl, 250 μg/ml tRNA), and the DNA was purified after one extraction with phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated with ethanol. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing 6% polyacrylamide/urea gels. Gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and visualized by autoradiography. His.Ets-1 alone, or together with His.TFE3, His-p50, or bovine serum albumin, was incubated in a final volume of 12 μl (containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) for 10 min at room temperature. Proteolysis was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of 150 ng/μl trypsin and carried out for 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 2 × SDS sample buffer and heating to 100°C for 3 min, and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed using an anti-Ets-1 antibody (Santa Cruz SC350, 1:1000). Chemiluminescence detection was carried out using the ECL immunodetection protocol according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Corp.). His.Ets-1 and His.TFE3 were used at 400 ng/reaction, bovine serum albumin and p50 were used at 2 μg/reaction, and DNA was 20 ng of a 51-base pair double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing the μA, μE3, and μB motifs. COS and NIH3T3 cells were transfected with calcium phosphate using reporter plasmids containing wild-type, or mutated, μ70 dimers as described previously (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Transfections contained 2 μg of reporter and 2 μg of each transactivator. In those cases where only one, or no, transactivator was used, total DNA was made up to 6 μg using an empty expression vector. 48 h after transfection whole cell extracts were prepared and CAT enzyme assayed using 75 μg of heat-treated extracts for 1 h. S194 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran procedure using 5 μg of reporter plasmids and 2 μg of TFE3 expression vector, or the empty expression vector. Extracts prepared 48 h later were assayed for CAT enzyme expression by ELISA (CAT ELISA, Boehringer Mannheim). To identify nucleotides involved in PU.1 recognition of the μB element, we used methylation and ethylation interference assays. Preparative binding reactions were carried out with partially methylated μ enhancer DNA followed by separation of the protein bound DNA and free DNA by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Bound and free DNA were electroeluted, treated with piperidine to effect strand cleavage, and analyzed by electrophoresis through urea-containing sequencing gels. On the coding strand, methylation of four contiguous guanines affected PU.1 binding as shown by the significant depletion of the bands corresponding to these residues in the bound DNA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 4-6). On the noncoding strand, bands corresponding to three contiguous adenines were diminished in the bound DNA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1-3) identifying these residues as being important for nucleoprotein complex formation. Phosphate contacts were similarly assayed using ethylated probes in in vitro binding assays. On the noncoding strand, ethylation of four phosphates at the 3′ end of the μB site affected protein binding as shown by the absence of these bands in the bound DNA lanes (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Four additional phosphate contacts were identified on the coding strand at the 5′ end of the μB element (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6). These results are summarized in the helix diagram and sequence shown in Fig. 1C The A and G residues identified by methylation interference studies are marked with asterisks and include the two guanines that are part of the core GGA recognition site of ETS domain proteins. Methylation at the N3 position of adenines lies in the minor groove of the DNA and can affect protein binding by direct interference or by altering DNA conformation. PU.1 binding was diminished by methylation of 3 As on the noncoding strand lying up to five nucleotides upstream of the core GGA. Phosphates identified by ethylation interference are indicated by vertical lines in the sequence and black circles in the helix diagram. Nye et al. (34Nye J.A. Petersen J.M. Gunther C.V. Jonsen M.D. Graves B.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) have previously mapped at high resolution the DNA contacts made by Ets-1 protein. Methylation and ethylation interference assays described here, as well as induction of a DNase I hypersensitive site on the noncoding strand (see Fig. 6), indicate that the contacts made by PU.1 are similar to those described for Ets-1. We conclude that these two most divergent ETS domains recognize DNA by similar mechanisms. We have previously analyzed a panel of mutations within the μB sequence element by transfection into S194 plasma cells (12Nelsen B. Kadesch T. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3145-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides modified by the three mutations M102-104 are indicated by horizontal lines within the sequence in Fig. 1C In functional assays, M102 and M104 significantly decreased enhancer activity, whereas M103 had little or no effect. The effects of mutations M102 and M104 are readily explained by the strong adenine interferences that coincide with nucleotides changed in M102 and alteration of the GGAA core, including the fourth G identified by interference assays in M104. However, wild-type activity of M103 is harder to explain since this mutation changed three guanine residues that score strongly in the interference assay. In M103 the three guanines indicated were changed to three adenines, so one interpretation is that purine substitutions at these positions are tolerated by the PU.1 protein. Alternatively, it was possible that PU.1 bound to a different GGAA sequence located 3′ to the identified μB site in M103 resulting in the observed enhancer activity. To distinguish between these possibilities, we studied PU.1 binding to M103 in greater detail. Methylation interference analysis showed that modification of the three G residues located 3′ of the M104 mutation did not interfere with PU.1 binding (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-8) indicating that the putative downstream GGAA was not an alternate PU.1 binding site. Methylation of the remaining guanine (Fig. 1C, position 10) in the μB element, that was unaltered by the M103 mutation, partially inhibited PU.1 binding. On the noncoding strand, methylation of adenines at positions 4-6 (numbering as in Fig. 1C) affected PU.1 binding as observed with the wild-type site, showing that the protein recognized the M103 mutant μB element. Interestingly, we detected strong interferences with G and A residues that make up the adjacent μA element which we have shown binds the Ets-1 protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-8 marked μA). No residues within the μA site on the noncoding strand were identified by this assay (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-4). Involvement of the μA site in the binding of PU.1 to M103 was further confirmed by ethylation interference assays. Ethylation of coding strand phosphates within the mutated μB sequence resulted in partial interference with PU.1 protein binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 7-9), whereas phosphate residues within the μA sequence interfered more strongly. On the noncoding strand as well, ethylation within the μA motif interfered strongly and those within the μB motif interfered weakly with PU.1 binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). First, these results show that PU.1 does not bind an alternate flanking GGAA site, downstream of the μB element, in the M103 mutation. DNase I footprinting experiments described below further confirm this observation. Second, significant interference caused by nucleotide or phosphate modifications within the μA site indicates that optimal binding of PU.1 to the M103 mutant requires dual recognition of both μA site and the mutated μB site. A lesser role of the μA element in the wild-type context suggests in that case most of the binding energy comes from PU.1/μB interaction. Occupancy of both the μA and μB sites in the WT and mutant enhancers was directly visualized by DNase I footprinting assays. On the coding strand there was a conspicuous absence of bands corresponding to DNase I cleavage sites within the μB sequence with no added protein (Fig. 3). We observed protection in two regions that correspond to the 5′ end of the μB element and the 3′ flank of the μB element. In addition, two weak DNase I hypersensitive sites that fell between the regions of protection described above, were also induced in response to PU.1 binding (Fig. 3). Similarly, protection in the region of the μA element was also detectable, though weak. Surprisingly, a strong DNase I footprint was observed in a region 3′ of the μB element where several bands were protected and one prominent hypersensitive band induced (Fig. 3). The μ enhancer contains three elements homologous to the core element identified by mutational analysis of the SV40 enhancer, and this footprint maps to the region of the most downstream core site. Previous mutational analysis concluded that these core sites were not required for B cell-specific activity of the μ enhancer suggesting that PU.1 binding to this site may represent a nonfunctional interaction (35Kadesch T. Zervos P. Ruezinsky D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 8209-8221Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PU.1 binding to all three sites on the enhancer was more clearly discernible by analysis of the noncoding strand due to the induction of a strong DNase I hypersensitive site within each element (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-6). Addition of increasing amounts of GST-PU.1 fusion protein resulted in a dose-dependent increase of a band within the μB motif that was barely detectable in the absence of protein. A similar band was induced within the μA element (labeled μA) and the third core site (at the bottom of the gel). The location of the hypersensitive site within the μB sequence is shown in Fig. 1C and corresponds to the position where a similar band is induced in response to Ets-1 binding to its cognate sequence element. Using DNase I footprinting, Rivera et al. (26Rivera R.R. Stuiver M.H. Steenbergen R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7163-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have previously shown that PU.1 binds to both μA (π, in their nomenclature) and μB sequence elements. Analysis of the μB− and μA− (inactive) enhancer mutations showed that in each case only one of these two sites bound PU.1. With the μB− DNA probe, no hypersensitive band was observed at the μB site in the range of protein concentrations used (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-6), whereas the hypersensitive site at μA was still induced although higher concentrations of PU.1 were required. This is consistent with competition analysis that showed that the μA site bound PU.1 approximately 8-fold more weakly (data not shown). Conversely, only the hypersensitive band corresponding to μB site o"

To investigate the structural organization and function of TFIID, we have cloned and expressed a cDNA encoding the third largest human TFIID subunit, hTAFII100. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that hTAFII100 is an integral subunit that is associated with all transcriptionally-competent forms of TFIID. They further suggest that at least part of the N-terminal region lies on the surface of TFIID, while a C-terminal region containing conserved WD-40 repeats appears inaccessible. Both in vivo and in vitro assays indicate that hTAFII100 interacts strongly with the histone H4-related hTAFII80 and the histone H3-related hTAFII31, as well as a stable complex comprised of both hTAFII80 and hTAFII31. Apparently weaker interactions of hTAFII100 with TBP, hTAFII250, hTAFII28, and hTAFII20, but not hTAFII55, also have been observed. These results suggest a role for hTAFII100 in stabilizing interactions of TAFs, especially the histone-like TAFs, in TFIID. In addition, functional studies show that anti-hTAFII100 antibodies selectively inhibit basal transcription from a TATA-less initiator-containing promoter, relative to a TATA-containing promoter, suggesting a possible core promoter-specific function for hTAFII100.

https://openalex.org/W1984072766,"The release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ pumping pools and the entry of extracellular Ca2+ are tightly coupled events. The potent and specific intracellular Ca2+ pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, blocks Ca2+ accumulation and allows Ca2+ release from pools within mammalian cells, inducing major changes in endoplasmic reticulum function and cell growth. Recent studies characterized the pools of Ca2+ within permeabilized DC-3F/TG2 cells (a thapsigargin-resistant variant form of the DC-3F Chinese hamster lung fibroblast line, able to grow in 2 μM thapsigargin), revealing highly thapsigargin-resistant intracellular Ca2+ pumping activity capable of accumulating Ca2+ within an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-releasable Ca2+ pool (Waldron, R. T., Short, A. D., and Gill, D. L. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11955-11961). Using intact fura-2-loaded thapsigargin-resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells, the present study investigated the role of this unusual Ca2+ pumping activity in maintaining cytosolic Ca2+, generating Ca2+ signals, and mediating Ca2+ entry. The thapsigargin-resistant Ca2+ pumping pool was capable of generating rapid cytosolic Ca2+ signals in response to the phospholipase C-coupled agonist, oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid. The resting level of cytosolic Ca2+ in DC-3F/TG2 cells was 2-fold elevated compared with control cells (the parent DC-3F line), and transient extracellular Ca2+ removal induced a large “overshoot” in cytosolic Ca2+. The overshoot response was blocked by the Ca2+ influx inhibitor, SKF96365, and was kinetically identical to that induced in parent DC-3F cells after thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ pool emptying, indicating that the thapsigargin-resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells had “constitutively” opened Ca2+ entry channels coupled to an emptied or partially emptied thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pumping pool. Even though oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid-mediated Ca2+ release induced little Ca2+ entry, complete ionomycin-activated emptying of the thapsigargin-resistant Ca2+ pool in DC-3F/TG2 cells induced a large, sustained entry of Ca2+ that was also completely blocked by SKF96365. The results revealed that the thapsigargin-resistant Ca2+ pump does maintain physiological Ca2+ levels, is able to fill an agonist-responsive Ca2+ pool in DC-3F/TG2 cells, and is likely responsible for the ability of these cells to function and grow in the presence of thapsigargin. In addition, Ca2+ influx in the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells reflects emptying of pools that accumulate Ca2+ by both thapsigargin-sensitive and -resistant Ca2+ pumps; since these pumps accumulate Ca2+ in distinct pools in parent DC-3F cells, it is possible that more than one pool is coupled to Ca2+ influx in the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells.

Ca2+ signals in many cells comprise both release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools and entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. These two events are closely coupled, entry of Ca2+ being triggered by emptying of Ca2+ from pools in response to InsP3 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateERendoplasmic reticulumfura-2/AMfura-2 acetoxymethylesterSERCAsarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPaseSOCstore-operated channelLPAoleoyl lysophosphatidic acid.

In addition to controlling Ca2+ signal generation within the cytosol, the level of Ca2+ within pools mediates important control over intraluminal events including the essential ER functions of translation, folding, processing, and assembly of proteins (9Sambrook J.F.

Emptying of ER Ca2+ with either thapsigargin or other Ca2+ pump blockers, including 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone and cyclopiazonic acid, causes cells to undergo one of two different growth responses. DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells progress through S-phase and become arrested in a quiescent G0-like state in which they remain viable and stable for as long as 7 days (16Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D.

Other cells such as prostatic cancer cells enter an irreversible apoptotic state in which endonucleases are activated, DNA becomes fragmented, and cells undergo morphological degeneration and death (27Furuya Y. Lundmo P. Short A.D. Gill D.L. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6167-6175PubMed Google Scholar). One criterion that may determine these growth responses to Ca2+ pump blockade is the extent of Ca2+ influx activated by pool emptying. Prolonged Ca2+ influx via SOCs and hence sustained elevated cytosolic Ca2+ appears to trigger apoptosis (4Gill D.L. Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Short A.D. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1992; 26: 265-308PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci.

In the latter line, application of high serum or arachidonic acid induces the pool-depleted quiescent cells to synthesize new pump protein, to develop new functional Ca2+ pools, and to reenter the cell cycle (17Short A.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Even though thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ pool emptying has such profound effects on cell function and growth, a variant of the DC-3F Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line was recently developed that is resistant to thapsigargin (29Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resistant variant line, DC-3F/TG2, was generated by exposure of DC-3F cells to gradually increasing levels of thapsigargin over a 10-month period. Unlike the parent DC-3F cells that have a high sensitivity, cytotoxic response to thapsigargin, DC-3F/TG2 cells retain normal appearance and grow and divide in culture medium containing 2 μM thapsigargin (29Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This remarkable resistance to thapsigargin did not appear to stem from expression of high levels of the multidrug resistance factor, P-glycoprotein, which can confer resistance to toxic hydrophobic molecules; nor did it appear to reflect substantially increased levels of SERCA pump expression (29Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, the resistance is attributable to expression of a novel intracellular Ca2+ pump activity with 20,000-fold lower sensitivity to thapsigargin (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In spite of this vast difference in thapsigargin sensitivity, the resistant pump has similar high affinity for Ca2+ (Km 0.1 μM), ATP dependence, and sensitivity to vanadate as normal SERCA pumping activity (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A small amount of what appears to be the same thapsigargin-resistant pump activity is detectable in parent DC-3F cells; however, it does not mediate any Ca2+ accumulation within InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools; for this reason, it was considered that in parent DC-3F cells the resistant Ca2+ pump functions to accumulate Ca2+ within a pool that is distinct from the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells, InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools clearly exist, but in contrast with parent DC-3F cells, their uptake of Ca2+ occurs exclusively via the thapsigargin-resistant Ca2+ pump (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to this important Ca2+ pump distinction, other changes in Ca2+ pool function within resistant cells were noted, including differences in pool heterogeneity, anion permeability, and the translocation of Ca2+ between pools. From these results it was concluded that the cells contain two different Ca2+ pools distinguished by sensitivity to thapsigargin and that in the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells, InsP3 receptors are expressed within the pool accumulating Ca2+ via the thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ pump (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas these analyses using non-intact cells revealed that the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells contained thapsigargin-resistant Ca2+ pumps capable of accumulating Ca2+ within InsP3-sensitive pools, no information was available on the physiological function of these pools in intact cells. Two important questions remained to be addressed. The first was whether the Ca2+ pumping activity operating within the thapsigargin-resistant cells was able to fill agonist-releasable Ca2+ pools. The second was to determine whether release of Ca2+ from such pools was coupled to SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx. The results indicate that Ca2+ pools inside the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells are indeed functional, that the resistant pump accumulates Ca2+ within a pool that can be mobilized by agonists, and that emptying of this pool within the intact cells is coupled to activation of Ca2+ influx through authentic store-operated channels. The results also reveal that the activation of Ca2+ influx in the resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells reflects operation of both normal and resistant Ca2+ pumping activities possibly residing in distinct pools. DC-3F Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts were cultured in α-modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (29Gutheil J.C.

Selection of the thapsigargin-resistant DC-3F/TG2 cell line by successive culturing in the presence of increasing thapsigargin concentrations was described previously (29Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DC-3F/TG2 cells were cultured in α-modified Eagle's medium with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum together with 2 μM thapsigargin; as for the parent line, the cells also received a change of medium (still containing 2 μM thapsigargin) on the second day after passaging and were passaged the following day. Both cell types were also cultured on glass coverslips for use in intracellular Ca2+ measurements.

Cells were grown on glass coverslips as described above and fura-2-loaded by incubation with 2 μM fura-2/AM ester for 10 min at 20°C in Hepes-buffered Krebs medium (107 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 11.5 mM glucose, 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Under these conditions approximately 95% of dye was restricted to the cytosol as judged by the signal remaining after permeabilization with saponin. Fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored at 25°C using a PTI dual wavelength spectrofluorometer system with excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Calculations of free intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol.

Dye was considered saturated upon addition of 40 μM ionomycin, whereas minimum fluorescence ratio was determined in the presence of 10 mM EGTA together with ionomycin. For each of the traces shown, groups of 10-15 cells were analyzed. Unless indicated otherwise, all results are representative of a minimum of three experiments.

Whereas almost all mammalian cells accumulate Ca2+ within pools via intracellular Ca2+ pumps with extreme sensitivity to thapsigargin (24Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Wang J.C. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8801-8806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Davidson G.A. Varhol R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11731-11734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the DC-3F/TG2 thapsigargin-resistant cell line contains highly resistant Ca2+ pump activity (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unknown was whether this distinct Ca2+ pumping could function to sustain physiologically operational Ca2+ pools within intact thapsigargin-resistant cells. Initial experiments examined Ca2+ levels in parent DC-3F and resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells and cytosolic Ca2+ changes in response to exogenously added thapsigargin. Using fura-2-loaded parent DC-3F cells grown on coverslips, application of a high dose of thapsigargin (2 μM) induced a rapid and large increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). Although the peak Ca2+ level partially subsided with time, the increase in Ca2+ was persistent with time as a result of continued influx of Ca2+ through store-operated Ca2+ channels (see below). As shown in Fig. 1A, 30 min after thapsigargin addition, the level of Ca2+ was still above 120 nM. From many experiments, the mean resting level of Ca2+ in these cells (i.e. without thapsigargin) was measured as 27.7 ± 7.0 nM (n = 94), and the mean level of Ca2+ after 30 min of thapsigargin treatment was 148.4 ± 33.1 nM (n = 52). Even several hours following thapsigargin treatment this increased level of Ca2+ was maintained. We noted that in another cell type, the DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle line, although thapsigargin induced a similarly rapid and large Ca2+ increase due to pool release, the ensuing SOC-mediated influx of Ca2+ was short-lived due to rapid deactivation (7Gill D.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 883-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was considered that the efficient deactivation of SOCs may explain why DDT1MF-2 cells remain viable (albeit in a growth-arrested state) and able to undergo growth recovery with high serum treatment for up to 7 days following thapsigargin treatment (7Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 26: 1-19Google Scholar). In contrast, once treated with thapsigargin, DC-3F cells cannot be induced to reenter the growth cycle and undergo necrosis (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This may result from the cytotoxic action of the prolonged increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that follows thapsigargin-induced pool release. In marked distinction from the parent DC-3F cells, the thapsigargin-resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells showed no response to exogenously added thapsigargin. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1B, no change in cytosolic Ca2+ was observed after addition of either 100 nM or 2 μM thapsigargin. Although there was no effect of thapsigargin, it was clear from the data in Fig. 1B that the resting Ca2+ level in these cells was higher than in the parent DC-3F line. Indeed, from a large number of experiments, the mean resting level of cytosolic Ca2+ in resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells was 70.4 ± 15.5 nM (n = 154), that is approximately double that in the parent line. This suggested that either there was less Ca2+ pumping activity in these cells or that persistent entry of Ca2+ was occurring perhaps as a result of some degree of pool emptying. Although levels of plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps are unknown, the level of SERCA pump protein in resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells is slightly increased relative to parent DC-3F cells (29Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments described below indicate that there is an endogenously activated increased basal level of Ca2+ influx in resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells. The absence of a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pool in intact DC-3F/TG2 cells was consistent with observations that these cells lack thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ pumping activity. It was also clear from previous experiments with permeabilized DC-3F/TG2 cells that they express a highly thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ pump (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This activity has an IC50 for thapsigargin of approximately 4 μM, about 20,000-fold less sensitive than most of the Ca2+ pumping activity inside parent DC-3F cells, which has an IC50 for thapsigargin of approximately 200 pM (30Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interesting was the finding that a small fraction (approximately 20%) of the total pump activity in parent DC-3F cells has an IC50 for thapsigargin (4 μM) identical to that of pumping in resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells. From this it was inferred that both pump types are coexpressed in normal cells. However, each pump appears to function in a distinct Ca2+ pool; thus, from experiments with permeabilized DC-3F cells, the resistant pump did not function to accumulate Ca2+ within an InsP3-sensitive pool. In contrast, in permeabilized resistant DC-3F/TG2 cells, the resistant pump clearly did accumulate Ca2+ within an InsP3-releasable pool (30Waldr"

CDC25Mm, isolated as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and purified by various chromatographic methods, could stimulate the H-ras p21·GDP dissociation rate; however, its specific activity was 25 times lower than that of the isolated catalytic domain comprising the last C-terminal 285 residues (C-CDC25Mm285) and 5 times lower than the activity of the C-terminal half-molecule (631 residues). This reveals a negative regulation of the catalytic domain by other domains of the molecule. Accordingly, the GEF activity of CDC25Mm was increased severalfold by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain that cleaves around a PEST-like region (residues 798-853), producing C-terminal fragments of 43-56 kDa. In agreement with the presence of an IQ motif on CDC25Mm (residues 202-229), calmodulin interacted functionally with the exchange factor. Depending on the calmodulin concentration an inhibition up to 50% of the CDC25Mm-induced nucleotide exchange activity on H-ras p21 was observed, an effect requiring Ca2+ ions. Calmodulin also inhibited C-CDC25Mm285 but with a ∼100 times higher IC50 than in the case of CDC25Mm (∼10 μM versus 0.1 μM, respectively).

Together, these results emphasize the role of the other domains of CDC25Mm in controlling the activity of the catalytic domain and support the involvement of calmodulin and calpain in the in vivo regulation of the CDC25Mm activity.

A direct action of calmodulin was supported by the presence in the N-terminal region of CDC25Mm of an IQ domain, a sequence frequently found in proteins interacting with calmodulin (25Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell Supp. 1994; 5: 21AGoogle Scholar). Very recent experiments in vivo have indicated that PH1, coiled-coil and IQ domains act cooperatively to facilitate the activation of p140-rasGRF by calcium (17Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.-B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence in p140-rasGRF of two adjacent PEST sequences has suggested potential cleavage by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain (26Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell Supp. 1994; 5: 21AGoogle Scholar). Concerning in vitro properties, whereas C-terminal catalytic fragments spanning 256 to 488 amino acid residues have been biochemically characterized (3Jacquet E. Vanoni M. Ferrari C. Alberghina L. Martegani E. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24181-24183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schweighoffer F. Faure M. Fath I. Chevallier-Multon M.-C. Apiou F. Dutrillaux B.

Commun. 1995; 206: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), little is known about the functional properties in vitro of the full-length molecule comprising 1262 (CDC25Mm) or 1244 (p140-rasGRF) amino acid residues, of which the purification has yet to be reported.Therefore, with the aim at deepening our knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the activation of H-ras p21, we have produced and purified the full-length CDC25Mm as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and characterized its properties under well defined conditions in vitro The purified GEF shows a specific activity much lower than its isolated catalytic domain or the C-terminal half-molecule; it is inhibited by calmodulin and is specifically cleaved by calpain.DISCUSSIONThe biochemical characterization of purified full-length CDC25Mm shows that its noncatalytic moiety, comprising two PH, one DH, one coiled-coil and one IQ domain, has a regulatory function on the GEF activity of CDC25Mm. In fact, the specific activity of the full-length protein is ∼4% that of the isolated catalytic C-terminal fragment of 285 residues. The observation that the C-terminal half-molecule shows an activity, whose extent lies between the activity of the full-length CDC25Mm and that of C-CDC25Mm285, further confirms a regulatory function of the noncatalytic moiety of the molecule and supports the existence in the cell of mechanisms activating this GEF. This is in agreement with experiments in vivo showing that serum stimulation of NIH3T3 transformants leads to an increase in Ras·GTP only in cells expressing the entire CDC25Mm but not in cells expressing smaller C-terminal forms of CDC25Mm (9Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal region is essential for the response to serum. In line with this, is also the observation that the C-terminal truncated CDC25Mm lacking the last 600 amino acids behaves as dominant negative to the response to serum of the full-length molecule (9Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar).The specific cleavage by calpain around the PEST region increases the GEF activity due to the production of C-terminal fragments. The observation that the induced activity is of the same range as the activities of C-CDC25Mm631 and the p140-rasGRF C-terminal fragment of 456 residues (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) suggests that most noncatalytic domains participate in regulating the activity of the catalytic C-terminal conserved region. This indicates that the signal activating the productive interaction between the CDC25Mm C-terminal region and H-ras p21 evokes a global effect on the CDC25Mm molecule.It is known that the activity of calpain can be coordinated with that of calmodulin, as shown by the frequent presence on calmodulin-binding proteins of a PEST motif and the functional relationship between calpain action and calmodulin binding site (cf Ref. 34Molinari M. Maki M. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14576-14581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a large number of proteins (cf Refs. 30Reichsteiner M. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 433-440Google Scholar and 31Reichsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar), PEST sequences appear to represent a signal for rapid degradation by non-ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis that can involve calpain. Interestingly, in the mouse embryo brain a 58-kDa form of CDC25Mm was described, whereas in the more slowly metabolizing adult brain only the full-length 140-kDa protein could be detected (7Martegani E. Zippel R. Ferrari C. Coccetti P. Campiglio S. Denis-Donini S. Sturani E. Vanoni M. Alberghina L. Eur. J. Histochem. 1993; 37: 73-78Google Scholar). In the human brain, besides the full-length 140-kDa H-GRF, shorter forms of 43-50 kDa were reported (5Schweighoffer F. Faure M. Fath I. Chevallier-Multon M.-C. Apiou F. Dutrillaux B. Sturani E. Jacquet M. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1477-1485PubMed Google Scholar) that might also be present in tissues other than brain (11Guerrero C. Rojas J.M. Chedid M. Esteban L.M. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Font de Mora J. Santos E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1097-1107PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our work show that C-terminal CDC25Mm fragments of 43-56 kDa can originate from the action of calpain. Therefore, as reported in this work, activation of the GEF activity by calpain appears to be mediated by C-terminal fragments that are more active than the full-length molecule. In vivo, an eventual action of calpain could contribute to modulate the activity of CDC25Mm. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the expression of C-CDC25Mm285 in fibroblasts was found to enhance the GDP/GTP exchange activity on H-ras p21 and the tumor formation in the nude mice (35Zippel R. De Maddalena C. Porro G. Modena D. Sturani E. Vanoni M. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 4: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae rasGEF Cdc25p, containing a cyclin destruction box, has been described to display a rapid metabolism (half-life time, ∼20 min) due to proteolytic degradation (36Kaplon T. Jacquet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20742-20747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whether proteases also act on the mammalian rasGEF in vivo remains to be determined, since the half-life of CDC25Mm in neuronal cells is still unknown.From our results, Ca2+-calmodulin interacts efficiently with CDC25Mm, inhibiting the rasGEF activity with a IC50 of 0.1 μM, an effect dependent on Ca2+, corresponding approximately to an equimolar ratio between calmodulin and CDC25Mm. The course of inhibition with increasing amounts of calmodulin suggests a noncompetitive effect on the GEF activity of CDC25Mm. Hence, binding of calmodulin and p21 to CDC25Mm should concern distinct sites. The weak interaction of calmodulin with the catalytic domain of CDC25Mm suggests the possibility that in the three-dimensional conformation the IQ sequence at the N-terminal region (residues 202-229) and the C-terminal catalytic domain are vicinal.Calmodulin is in general known to activate calmodulin-binding proteins. However, in some cases such as calmodulin-kinase II, calmodulin-kinase IV, myosin light chain kinase and calcineurin, incubation with Ca2+/calmodulin has been shown to induce inactivation (cf Refs. 37Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and 38Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is interesting to mention that calmodulin-kinase IV interacts with calmodulin with high affinity, comparable to that of CDC25Mm (37Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), differently from calmodulin-kinase II which is inhibited only by high concentration of calmodulin (38Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Noteworthy is the relatively high concentration of EGTA required for abolishing the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent effect. Several recent studies have indicated that the conformation of the N-terminal and C-terminal calcium binding helix-loop-helix motifs of calmodulin depends on whether calcium-is bound or not (cf Ref. 39Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the affinity of EGTA for calcium is several orders of magnitude higher than that of calmodulin, this finding suggests that, when occupied, the Ca2+-binding site of calmodulin is little accessible to the chelating agent.From experiments in vivo (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), one would rather expect that Ca2+-calmodulin activates CDC25Mm. This difference with our results in vitro suggests the existence of other components affecting the action of calmodulin on CDC25Mm in the cell implying a more complex calmodulin-regulated mechanism. The same authors (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) report that calmodulin-bound p140-rasGRF isolated from stimulated cells and calmodulin-free p140-rasGRF isolated from unstimulated cells display the same GEF activity. The different experimental conditions may be the reason for the discrepancy between these and our results.In conclusion, our work supports a regulatory role of the N-terminal moiety of CDC25Mm on its catalytic domain and suggests that calmodulin and calpain act as modulators of the CDC25Mm activity in the cell. Very recently, Mattingly and Macara (13Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have reported on the basis of experiments in vivo a phosphorylation-dependent activation of CDC25Mm exchange factor by muscarinic receptors and G-protein βγ-subunits. The relationship between this effect and the calmodulin-dependent regulation remains an open question.

Very recent experiments in vivo have indicated that PH1, coiled-coil and IQ domains act cooperatively to facilitate the activation of p140-rasGRF by calcium (17Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.-B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

A direct action of calmodulin was supported by the presence in the N-terminal region of CDC25Mm of an IQ domain, a sequence frequently found in proteins interacting with calmodulin (25Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell Supp. 1994; 5: 21AGoogle Scholar).

Therefore, with the aim at deepening our knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the activation of H-ras p21, we have produced and purified the full-length CDC25Mm as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and characterized its properties under well defined conditions in vitro The purified GEF shows a specific activity much lower than its isolated catalytic domain or the C-terminal half-molecule; it is inhibited by calmodulin and is specifically cleaved by calpain. DISCUSSIONThe biochemical characterization of purified full-length CDC25Mm shows that its noncatalytic moiety, comprising two PH, one DH, one coiled-coil and one IQ domain, has a regulatory function on the GEF activity of CDC25Mm. In fact, the specific activity of the full-length protein is ∼4% that of the isolated catalytic C-terminal fragment of 285 residues. The observation that the C-terminal half-molecule shows an activity, whose extent lies between the activity of the full-length CDC25Mm and that of C-CDC25Mm285, further confirms a regulatory function of the noncatalytic moiety of the molecule and supports the existence in the cell of mechanisms activating this GEF. This is in agreement with experiments in vivo showing that serum stimulation of NIH3T3 transformants leads to an increase in Ras·GTP only in cells expressing the entire CDC25Mm but not in cells expressing smaller C-terminal forms of CDC25Mm (9Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal region is essential for the response to serum. In line with this, is also the observation that the C-terminal truncated CDC25Mm lacking the last 600 amino acids behaves as dominant negative to the response to serum of the full-length molecule (9Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar).The specific cleavage by calpain around the PEST region increases the GEF activity due to the production of C-terminal fragments. The observation that the induced activity is of the same range as the activities of C-CDC25Mm631 and the p140-rasGRF C-terminal fragment of 456 residues (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) suggests that most noncatalytic domains participate in regulating the activity of the catalytic C-terminal conserved region. This indicates that the signal activating the productive interaction between the CDC25Mm C-terminal region and H-ras p21 evokes a global effect on the CDC25Mm molecule.It is known that the activity of calpain can be coordinated with that of calmodulin, as shown by the frequent presence on calmodulin-binding proteins of a PEST motif and the functional relationship between calpain action and calmodulin binding site (cf Ref. 34Molinari M. Maki M. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14576-14581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a large number of proteins (cf Refs. 30Reichsteiner M. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 433-440Google Scholar and 31Reichsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar), PEST sequences appear to represent a signal for rapid degradation by non-ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis that can involve calpain. Interestingly, in the mouse embryo brain a 58-kDa form of CDC25Mm was described, whereas in the more slowly metabolizing adult brain only the full-length 140-kDa protein could be detected (7Martegani E. Zippel R. Ferrari C. Coccetti P. Campiglio S. Denis-Donini S. Sturani E. Vanoni M. Alberghina L. Eur. J. Histochem. 1993; 37: 73-78Google Scholar). In the human brain, besides the full-length 140-kDa H-GRF, shorter forms of 43-50 kDa were reported (5Schweighoffer F. Faure M. Fath I. Chevallier-Multon M.-C. Apiou F. Dutrillaux B. Sturani E. Jacquet M. Tocque B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1477-1485PubMed Google Scholar) that might also be present in tissues other than brain (11Guerrero C. Rojas J.M. Chedid M. Esteban L.M. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Font de Mora J. Santos E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1097-1107PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our work show that C-terminal CDC25Mm fragments of 43-56 kDa can originate from the action of calpain. Therefore, as reported in this work, activation of the GEF activity by calpain appears to be mediated by C-terminal fragments that are more active than the full-length molecule. In vivo, an eventual action of calpain could contribute to modulate the activity of CDC25Mm. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the expression of C-CDC25Mm285 in fibroblasts was found to enhance the GDP/GTP exchange activity on H-ras p21 and the tumor formation in the nude mice (35Zippel R. De Maddalena C. Porro G. Modena D. Sturani E. Vanoni M. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 4: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the homologous Saccharomyces cerevisiae rasGEF Cdc25p, containing a cyclin destruction box, has been described to display a rapid metabolism (half-life time, ∼20 min) due to proteolytic degradation (36Kaplon T. Jacquet M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20742-20747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whether proteases also act on the mammalian rasGEF in vivo remains to be determined, since the half-life of CDC25Mm in neuronal cells is still unknown.From our results, Ca2+-calmodulin interacts efficiently with CDC25Mm, inhibiting the rasGEF activity with a IC50 of 0.1 μM, an effect dependent on Ca2+, corresponding approximately to an equimolar ratio between calmodulin and CDC25Mm. The course of inhibition with increasing amounts of calmodulin suggests a noncompetitive effect on the GEF activity of CDC25Mm. Hence, binding of calmodulin and p21 to CDC25Mm should concern distinct sites. The weak interaction of calmodulin with the catalytic domain of CDC25Mm suggests the possibility that in the three-dimensional conformation the IQ sequence at the N-terminal region (residues 202-229) and the C-terminal catalytic domain are vicinal.Calmodulin is in general known to activate calmodulin-binding proteins. However, in some cases such as calmodulin-kinase II, calmodulin-kinase IV, myosin light chain kinase and calcineurin, incubation with Ca2+/calmodulin has been shown to induce inactivation (cf Refs. 37Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and 38Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is interesting to mention that calmodulin-kinase IV interacts with calmodulin with high affinity, comparable to that of CDC25Mm (37Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), differently from calmodulin-kinase II which is inhibited only by high concentration of calmodulin (38Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Noteworthy is the relatively high concentration of EGTA required for abolishing the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent effect. Several recent studies have indicated that the conformation of the N-terminal and C-terminal calcium binding helix-loop-helix motifs of calmodulin depends on whether calcium-is bound or not (cf Ref. 39Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the affinity of EGTA for calcium is several orders of magnitude higher than that of calmodulin, this finding suggests that, when occupied, the Ca2+-binding site of calmodulin is little accessible to the chelating agent.From experiments in vivo (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), one would rather expect that Ca2+-calmodulin activates CDC25Mm. This difference with our results in vitro suggests the existence of other components affecting the action of calmodulin on CDC25Mm in the cell implying a more complex calmodulin-regulated mechanism. The same authors (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) report that calmodulin-bound p140-rasGRF isolated from stimulated cells and calmodulin-free p140-rasGRF isolated from unstimulated cells display the same GEF activity. The different experimental conditions may be the reason for the discrepancy between these and our results.In conclusion, our work supports a regulatory role of the N-terminal moiety of CDC25Mm on its catalytic domain and suggests that calmodulin and calpain act as modulators of the CDC25Mm activity in the cell. Very recently, Mattingly and Macara (13Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have reported on the basis of experiments in vivo a phosphorylation-dependent activation of CDC25Mm exchange factor by muscarinic receptors and G-protein βγ-subunits. The relationship between this effect and the calmodulin-dependent regulation remains an open question. The biochemical characterization of purified full-length CDC25Mm shows that its noncatalytic moiety, comprising two PH, one DH, one coiled-coil and one IQ domain, has a regulatory function on the GEF activity of CDC25Mm. In fact, the specific activity of the full-length protein is ∼4% that of the isolated catalytic C-terminal fragment of 285 residues. The observation that the C-terminal half-molecule shows an activity, whose extent lies between the activity of the full-length CDC25Mm and that of C-CDC25Mm285, further confirms a regulatory function of the noncatalytic moiety of the molecule and supports the existence in the cell of mechanisms activating this GEF. This is in agreement with experiments in vivo showing that serum stimulation of NIH3T3 transformants leads to an increase in Ras·GTP only in cells expressing the entire CDC25Mm but not in cells expressing smaller C-terminal forms of CDC25Mm (9Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal region is essential for the response to serum. In line with this, is also the observation that the C-terminal truncated CDC25Mm lacking the last 600 amino acids behaves as dominant negative to the response to serum of the full-length molecule (9Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). The specific cleavage by calpain around the PEST region increases the GEF activity due to the production of C-terminal fragments. The observation that the induced activity is of the same range as the activities of C-CDC25Mm631 and the p140-rasGRF C-terminal fragment of 456 residues (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A.

However, in some cases such as calmodulin-kinase II, calmodulin-kinase IV, myosin light chain kinase and calcineurin, incubation with Ca2+/calmodulin has been shown to induce inactivation (cf Refs. 37Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and 38Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is interesting to mention that calmodulin-kinase IV interacts with calmodulin with high affinity, comparable to that of CDC25Mm (37Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 1070-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), differently from calmodulin-kinase II which is inhibited only by high concentration of calmodulin (38Ishida A. Kitani T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Noteworthy is the relatively high concentration of EGTA required for abolishing the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent effect. Several recent studies have indicated that the conformation of the N-terminal and C-terminal calcium binding helix-loop-helix motifs of calmodulin depends on whether calcium-is bound or not (cf Ref. 39Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the affinity of EGTA for calcium is several orders of magnitude higher than that of calmodulin, this finding suggests that, when occupied, the Ca2+-binding site of calmodulin is little accessible to the chelating agent. From experiments in vivo (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), one would rather expect that Ca2+-calmodulin activates CDC25Mm. This difference with our results in vitro suggests the existence of other components affecting the action of calmodulin on CDC25Mm in the cell implying a more complex calmodulin-regulated mechanism. The same authors (24Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) report that calmodulin-bound p140-rasGRF isolated from stimulated cells and calmodulin-free p140-rasGRF isolated from unstimulated cells display the same GEF activity. The different experimental conditions may be the reason for the discrepancy between these and our results. In conclusion, our work supports a regulatory role of the N-terminal moiety of CDC25Mm on its catalytic domain and suggests that calmodulin and calpain act as modulators of the CDC25Mm activity in the cell. Very recently, Mattingly and Macara (13Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have reported on the basis of experiments in vivo a phosphorylation-dependent activation of CDC25Mm exchange factor by muscarinic receptors and G-protein βγ-subunits. The relationship between this effect and the calmodulin-dependent regulation remains an open question. We are indebted to Dr. D. R. Lowy for sending the CDC25Mm gene cloned in pHC28 and Drs. J. B. Créchet, M.C. Parrini, C. Giglione, and I. M. Krab for fruitful discussion and advice."

BP26, a random photosynthesis-deficient mutant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 has a severely reduced PSI content, whereas its photosystem II is present in normal amount. The BP26 mutant is complemented by a novel gene, btpA, that encodes a 30-kDa protein. In this strain, a missense mutation in the btpA gene, resulting in the replacement of a valine by a glycine residue, significantly affects the accumulation of the PSI reaction center proteins, PsaA and PsaB. Northern blot analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of the transcripts from the psaAB operon, encoding these proteins, remain unaltered in the mutant strain. Hence the BtpA protein regulates a post-transcriptional process during the life cycle of the PSI protein complex such as 1) translation of the psaAB mRNA, 2) assembly of the PsaA/PsaB polypeptides and their associated cofactors into a functional complex, or 3) degradation of the protein complex. Close relatives of the BtpA protein have been found in nonphotosynthetic organisms, viz the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii, the eubacterium Escherichia coli, and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that these proteins may regulate biogenesis of other protein complexes in these evolutionarily distant organisms.

Integral membrane proteins participate in a wide array of biological processes. The thylakoid membranes of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms contain four major multisubunit protein complexes: photosystem I (PSI), 1The abbreviations used are: PSI and PSIIphotosystems I and IIChlchlorophyllORFopen reading frameTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidkbkilobase pair(s). photosystem II (PSII), cytochrome b6/f complex and ATP synthase.

In the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, the PSI complex mediates light-induced electron transport from plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 to ferredoxin (1Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 83-177Crossref Google Scholar, 2Chitnis P.G. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Nechushtai R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, PSI consists of eleven major polypeptides (4Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krau N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic, The Netherlands1995: 3-10Google Scholar). Among them, a heterodimer of two integral membrane proteins, PsaA and PsaB, forms the core of the PSI reaction center, that harbors nearly 100 antenna chlorophyll (Chl) molecules, and binds the majority of the electron transfer intermediates: P700, a Chl dimer; A0, a monomeric Chl; A1, a phylloquinone and Fx, an iron-sulfur center. The only other cofactor-binding protein, PsaC, coordinates two iron-sulfur clusters, FA and FB. Significant details of the architecture of the PSI complex have recently been revealed from the x-ray crystallographic analysis of this protein complex from a thermophilic cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus (4Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krau N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic, The Netherlands1995: 3-10Google Scholar). In particular, it was determined that each of the two reaction center proteins, PsaA and PsaB, contains thirteen α-helices, eleven of which are membrane-spanning. For multisubunit proteins such as PSI, an important issue is to understand how a cell continues to produce stoichiometric amounts of various subunits for their assembly into a functional membrane-bound complex (5Kuras R. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The molecular details of the biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus in general, and of the PSI complex in particular, in cyanobacteria have not been widely investigated. In the chloroplasts of vascular plants and green algae, subunits of various thylakoid localized protein complexes are encoded by various plastid genes as well as nuclear genes. The nuclear gene products are imported in the chloroplasts, where they associate with the appropriate plastid gene products, as well as many pigments and cofactors to form functional complexes. Several post-transcriptional processes play crucial roles in the expression, stabilization and assembly of a number of thylakoid proteins (6Gruissem W. Cell. 1989; 56: 161-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 7Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 39: 475-502Crossref Google Scholar, 8Rochaix J.-D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mullet et al. (9Mullet J.E. Klein P.G. Klein R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4038-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have shown that, in greening barley cells, the accumulation of chlorophyll-binding proteins (Chl-proteins) such as the CP43 and D1 proteins of PSII, depends on the availability of chlorophyll molecules. This is physiologically important, since the accumulation of free pigments in the thylakoids may lead to the production of free radicals that are extremely harmful to living cells. An interesting feature of post-transcriptional control is that during the translation of a Chl-protein such as D1, the ribosomes stall at defined positions on the corresponding mRNA so that chlorophyll and other cofactors have the opportunity to be correctly associated with the translated proteins (10Kim J. Klein P.G. Mullet J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14931-14938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Rochaix and co-workers (8Rochaix J.-D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Nickelsen J. van Dillewijn J. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) have identified various nuclear encoded proteins that regulate the translation of a number of Chl-proteins, such as the D2 and CP43 proteins of PSII. Danon and Mayfield (12Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) identified two RNA-binding proteins that regulate the expression of the D1 protein in Chlamydomonas Thus, a variety of post-transcriptional processes control the expression and assembly of the Chl-proteins of PSI and PSII in chloroplasts. In the prokaryotic cyanobacterial cells, effects of light and other environmental agents on the transcription of the psbA and psbD genes, encoding the D1 and D2 proteins, have been examined in detail (13Golden S.S. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic, The Netherlands1994: 693-714Crossref Google Scholar). However, post-transcriptional processes that regulate the expression of genes encoding Chl-proteins in cyanobacterial cells have not been adequately investigated. During recent years, the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter called Synechocystis 6803) has been widely used for molecular analysis of the form and function of the photosynthetic apparatus (3Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Vermaas W.F.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 457-481Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This organism is naturally transformable with exogenous DNA (15Grigorieva G. Shestakov S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 13: 367-370Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Under appropriate conditions, the introduced DNA molecules undergo homologous double reciprocal recombinations with chromosomal DNA, thus allowing directed gene replacement as well as phenotypic complementation of defined mutant strains (16Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). In addition, Synechocystis 6803 cells can grow photoheterotrophically, so that mutant strains impaired in photosynthesis can be propagated in glucose-enriched media. We have recently developed a method for selection of random photosynthesis-deficient mutant strains of Synechocystis 6803 (17Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This method utilizes a strain of Synechocystis 6803 for which glucose is toxic during prolonged incubation in the light. However, it can grow in the presence of glucose when its photosynthetic activity is inhibited (16Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Using this selection scheme, we have isolated a variety of photosynthesis-deficient mutants. For example, analysis of one of these mutant strains has led to the identification of an ABC transporter protein for manganese, the first high affinity transporter system for this transition metal identified in any organism (17Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized another such mutant strain, BP26. Using a complementation approach, we have cloned and sequenced a novel gene btpA, a mutation in which has significantly affected the form and function of the PSI complex in this mutant. Functional analysis of the BP26 mutant has indicated that the btpA gene is involved in the regulation of biogenesis of PSI reaction center complex at a post-transcriptional level. Enzymes for recombinant DNA work were from New England Biolabs; modified T7 polymerase (Sequenase) was from U. S.s Biochemical Corp.; [α-32P]dCTP (2000 Ci/mmol) for radioactive labeling of DNA fragments and α-35S-dATP (>1000 Ci/mmol) for DNA sequencing were from Amersham Corp. All chemicals used were of reagent grade. A glucose-sensitive isolate of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was a kind gift of Dr. C. P. Wolk, who obtained it from the American Type Culture Collection. The BP26 mutant was isolated during a previous study (17Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial cells were grown in BG11 medium (18Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar) at 30°C under 50 μE·m−2 s−1 of fluorescent light without glucose (autotrophic growth), or under 10 μE·m−2 s−1 of light in the presence of 5 mM glucose (heterotrophic growth). Solid medium was supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) agar, 0.3% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate and 10 mM TES-KOH, pH 8.2. Liquid cultures were grown with vigorous bubbling with room air. Growth of cyanobacterial strains was monitored by the measurement of light scattering at 730 nm on a DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco Instruments, Urbana, IL). Escherichia coli strain TG1 (supE hsdΔ5 thi Δ(lac-proAB) F′ (traD36 proAB+ laciq lacZΔM15)), used for the propagation of various plasmids, was grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pUC119 (20Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar) was used as the basic cloning vector. Rates of photosynthetic electron transfer reactions of intact Synechocystis 6803 cells were measured essentially as described previously (21Mannan R.M. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). During these assays, the wild-type and BP26 mutant samples were adjusted to equal cell densities at which the chlorophyll concentration of the wild-type cells was 5 μg/ml. Concentrations of chlorophyll in intact cells were measured after methanol extraction (22Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8701) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra and P700 chemical difference spectra were recorded on a DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco Instruments, Urbana, IL). P700 was quantitated by ascorbate-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized chemical difference spectra of thylakoid membranes as described elsewhere (23Mannan R.M. Whitmarsh J. Nyman P. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10168-10172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The samples were adjusted to 25 μg of Chl/ml (wild-type) or 8 μg of Chl/ml (BP26). Fluorescence spectra of intact cyanobacterial cells were recorded at 77 K on a home-built diode-array instrument as described previously (24Anbudurai P.R. Pakrasi H.B. Z. Naturforsch. 1993; 48c: 267-274Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Complementation of Synechocystis 6803 was performed according to a previously described procedure (17Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from Synechocystis 6803 cells was isolated as described earlier (25Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated according to Reddy et al (26Reddy K.J. Webb R. Sherman L.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 250-251PubMed Google Scholar). Southern and Northern hybridizations and other routine DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described previously (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). During Northern analysis, different amounts of each RNA sample were analyzed to ensure that the hybridization signals were within a linear range of detection (data not shown). DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure, using universal or custom-made oligonucleotides as primers. The final sequence was determined from both strands of the DNA fragments. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were performed using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software package (27Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). For data base searches, the BLAST (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) and BLITZ (the microbial underground network service at St. Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, London) programs were used. Thylakoid membranes from cyanobacterial cells were isolated essentially as described elsewhere (29Shukla V.K. Stanbekova G.E. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fractionation of proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunodetection of proteins on Western blots were performed as described elsewhere (24Anbudurai P.R. Pakrasi H.B. Z. Naturforsch. 1993; 48c: 267-274Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the D1, D2, CP47, and CP43 proteins were from Drs. M. Ikeuchi and Y. Inoue, and those against the PsaA-PsaB proteins were from Dr. I. Enami. A collection of random, photosynthesis-deficient mutant strains of Synechocystis 6803 was generated by using glucose as an agent for selection (17Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A number of these spontaneous mutants were deficient in their PSI activity. One such mutant, BP26, was chosen for further study. Under photoautotrophic growth conditions, the BP26 cells grew almost four times slower than the wild-type cells (Table I). However, in the presence of glucose (heterotrophic growth), the doubling rate of these mutant cells was comparable to that of the wild-type cells (Table I). Using artificial electron donors and acceptors, we examined the PSII- and PSI-mediated electron transport rates in intact cells that have been grown photoautotrophically. As shown in Table I, the PSII-mediated oxygen evolution rate in the BP26 cells was near normal, whereas its PSI-activity was only ∼20% of that in the wild-type cells. These data suggested that the BP26 mutant strain is specifically impaired in its PSI activity.Table I.Growth rates, light-mediated electron transport activities, and Chl/P700 ratios of Synechocystis 6803 wild-type (WT) and BP26 mutant strainsWTBP26Doubling time (h) in:BG11aLight intensity: 50 μE · m−2s−1.830BG11 + GbLight intensity: 10 μE · m2s−1.1112Electron transport rates (μmol O2/108 cells/h)H2O to DCBQ/FeCN (PSII)240210DAD/Asc to MV (PSI)8317Chl/P700 (mol/mol)130570a Light intensity: 50 μE · m−2s−1.b Light intensity: 10 μE · m2s−1. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1A shows the absorption spectra of wild-type and mutant cells. In the BP26 strain the absorbances at 440 and 680 nm, originating from chlorophyll molecules, were significantly reduced. In contrast, the peak at 625 nm, reflecting absorption by phycobilins, was not affected. The chlorophyll content of the mutant strain was estimated to be 15-20% of that in the wild-type cells. In addition, absorption spectra of isolated thylakoid membranes (Fig. 1B) revealed that the peak of chlorophyll a in the mutant strain was shifted to 675 nm. Similar phenomena have been observed in other cyanobacterial PSI-deficient mutant strains, and have been attributed to a loss of PSI-associated chlorophyll and retention of PSII-associated chlorophyll molecules (31Nyhus K.J. Thiel T. Pakrasi H.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The loss of chlorophylls and the consequent increase in the phycobilin-to-chlorophyll ratio resulted in the bluish color of the BP26 cells. In Synechocystis 6803 cells, most of the chlorophyll molecules are associated with the PSI complex. Hence, a reduced cellular content of chlorophylls may be due to a decreased level of this protein complex. Using chemical difference spectroscopy, we determined that on a total chlorophyll basis, the content of P700, the reaction center chlorophylls of PSI, was nearly 5-fold less in this mutant (Table I). In addition, low temperature (77 K) fluorescence spectra of intact cells revealed that the emission band at 725 nm, originating from the PSI complex, was substantially reduced in the mutant (data not shown). These spectroscopic data were supported by an analysis of thylakoid membrane proteins from these cyanobacterial cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, there is no detectable difference in the profiles of soluble proteins from the wild-type and mutant cells, while there is a significant difference in the polypeptide profiles of their thylakoids. In particular, in the mutant strain, the levels of PsaA and PsaB, the reaction centers proteins of PSI have been significantly decreased. It is noteworthy that the levels of a number of smaller polypeptides are also decreased in the thylakoids from BP26. Some of these proteins may be subunits of the PSI complex, since in the absence of the reaction center proteins, a number of other polypeptides of PSI do not accumulate (2Chitnis P.G. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Nechushtai R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against both PSI reaction center proteins, PsaA and PsaB, recognized a diffused band in the thylakoid membranes from the wild-type cells. On a protein basis, the BP26 cells had only 10-15% as much of these two polypeptides. In contrast, the amounts of D1 and D2, the reaction center proteins of PSII, as well as CP43 and CP47, the chlorophyll-binding proteins of PSII, were similar in the wild-type and BP26 cells, a finding that agreed well with the PSII-mediated electron transport activities described above. Taken together, these data indicated that the spontaneous mutation in the BP26 strain had affected the cellular content of the PSI complex. Based on the analysis of various targeted PSI-deficient mutant strains, it is known that the absence of other proteins of PSI does not affect the accumulation of the PsaA and PsaB proteins in cyanobacterial thylakoids (3Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, we reasoned that the dramatic decrease in the contents of these two polypeptides in the BP26 strain (Fig. 2) must have resulted because the mutation influences the accumulation of these reaction center proteins in the thylakoid membranes. To determine at what level this mutation effect the regulation of PsaA and PsaB biogenesis, we examined the transcript levels of the psaAB gene cluster in the mutant cells (Fig. 3). In Synechocystis 6803, two major transcripts are observed from this operon: a 5-kb transcript, that corresponds to the entire gene cluster, and a 2-kb transcript that corresponds to each of the individual genes, psaA and psaB (32Smart L.B. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both of these transcripts were present in similar amount in wild-type and BP26 cells (Fig. 3), indicating that the lesion in this mutant did not significantly affect the transcription of these genes. Thus, the defect in the BP26 mutant must effect the biogenesis of PSI at a post-transcriptional level. We determined that the BP26 mutant strain could not be complemented by any known structural genes for PSI, indicating that the mutation in this strain maps in an unidentified genetic locus. Next, chromosomal DNA from wild-type Synechocystis 6803 cells was digested with BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes and fractionated on a 0.7% low melting agarose gel. DNA fragments from individual slices of this gel were assayed for their ability to complement the BP26 cells. Fragments in the 1.5-2.5-kb range yielded the greatest number of transformants, and were cloned in the plasmid vector pUC119. One resultant recombinant plasmid could complement the BP26 mutant strain. Fig. 4A shows a restriction map of the 2-kb BamHI-HindIII DNA fragment cloned in this plasmid. Using deletion analysis, we mapped the mutation on a 0.6-kb Bsp120I-BglII fragment (Fig. 4B). Complementation of the BP26 mutant cells with this DNA fragment yielded transformants that had normal pigmentation, growth rates and photosynthetic activities (data not shown). Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA from wild-type cells revealed that the genetic information in this fragment is present in a single copy in the genome of Synechocystis 6803 (Fig. 4C). We determined the nucleotide sequence of the larger SalI-HindIII DNA fragment shown in Fig. 4A In this 1281-nucleotide long sequence (Fig. 5A), only one open reading frame (ORF) of significant length was identified. This ORF starts with a GUG initiation codon at nucleotides 289-291 and ends with a UGA termination codon at nucleotides 1150-1152. As shown in Fig. 5A, this ORF codes for a polypeptide of 287 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 30 kDa. Analysis of this sequence also revealed the presence of a gene encoding an Arg-tRNA that extends between nucleotides 42 and 107, and its deduced direction of transcription is opposite to that of the ORF287. To determine the molecular nature of the spontaneous mutation in the BP26 mutant strain, we cloned the corresponding 0.6-kb Bsp120I-BglII DNA fragment from these cells and determined its sequence. A comparison of this sequence with that from the wild-type cells revealed a single base substitution in the BP26 DNA. At the nucleotide position 440, a T to a G mutation (Fig. 5A) resulted in the substitution of valine 51 by a glycine residue in the ORF287-encoded polypeptide in the mutant strain. A directed inactivation of the ORF287 resulted in a phenotype similar to that of BP26 (data not shown). As discussed above, the ORF287 protein regulates the biogenesis of the PSI reaction center protein complex, and we have named this gene btpA (biogenesis of thylakoid proteins), and the encoded protein, BtpA. An analysis of the hydrophobicity profile of the sequence of the BtpA protein (Fig. 5B) indicated that this polypeptide is largely hydrophilic. The only significant hydrophobic segment is between residues 74 and 127, with two putative transmembrane spans. The deduced sequence of the BtpA protein was used to search for similar sequences in the nondegenerate GenBank™ sequence data base (September 1996). Such analysis revealed that the btpA gene has not been previously identified in Synechocystis 6803. The BtpA protein shared a high degree of similarity (79%) with the partial sequence (derived from a random sequencing project) of an ORF (GenBank™ accession no. Z47150) in Calothrix, another cyanobacterium. Interestingly, a highly significant similarity (64%) was found between BtpA and a hypothetical 28.9-kDa protein (GenBank™ accession no. U67554) in the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii (Fig. 6). The sequence of this ORF has been determined during the M. jannaschii genome sequencing project. However, the function of this protein in M. jannaschii cells is not known. In addition, the BtpA protein shared 55% sequence similarity with a hypothetical 29.4-kDa protein (GenBank™ accession no. P39364) in the bacterium E. coli and with a hypothetical 32.1 kDa protein (GenBank accession Z69383) in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans The sequences of these ORFs have also been determined during the respective genome sequencing projects, and their biological functions are currently unknown. Limited homologies were also found with a number of dehydrogenases, e.g. glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase. However, the regions of such homologies did not correspond to known cofactor-binding domains in these well studied enzymes. Finally, a significant similarity was found between BtpA and the product of the hypE gene in several bacterial species (34Rey L. Murillo J. Hernando Y. Hidalgo E. Cabrera E. Imperial J. Ruiz-Argueso T. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis has indicated that the hypE gene is necessary for the formation of the hydrogenase protein complex, although the protein encoded by this gene is not a structural component of the hydrogenase enzyme. The major objective of this communication has been the genetic and biochemical characterization of BP26, a random photosynthesis deficient mutant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. We have demonstrated that in this mutant, the steady state level of the PSI reaction center proteins, PsaA and PsaB, is significantly reduced, with an accompanied loss of most of the chlorophyll molecules and a 5-fold lower PSI-mediated electron transport activity. In contrast, the PSII activity of these cells is near normal, and the content of the PSII reaction center proteins D1 and D2 as well as content of chlorophyll-binding proteins CP43 and CP47 are not decreased in this mutant strain. Hence, the lesion in the BP26 strain had specifically affected the PSI complex. It is noteworthy, that this mutant is relatively light-tolerant and can grow photoautotrophically, although at a reduced rate (Table I). In contrast, a complete absence of the PSI reaction center complex in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 results in significant light-sensitivity of the cells (35Smart L.B. Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 36Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The light-tolerance of BP26 is possibly due to the presence of some active PSI complexes in this strain. The lesion in the BP26 mutant was not localized in any known structural gene for the PSI complex. We have shown that a novel gene, btpA, complements this mutant, and a missense mutation in this gene has resulted in the decreased level of PSI in these cells. PSI is a well studied enzyme, and its crystal structure has been described at a 4.5 Å resolution (4Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krau N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic, The Netherlands1995: 3-10Google Scholar). Moreover, the molecular identities of the major polypeptide components of this crystallized PSI complex are fairly well understood (2Chitnis P.G. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Nechushtai R. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 44: 23-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Schubert W.D. Klukas O. Krau N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Kluwer Academic, The Netherlands1995: 3-10Google Scholar). Analysis of the deduced sequence of the BtpA protein clearly indicated that it is not a structural protein of PSI, suggesting that the btpA gene regulates the cellular content of the PSI complex in Synechocystis 6803. The molecular details of the biogenesis of large multisubunit integral membrane proteins, such as PSI, remain poorly understood. A number of distinct biochemical processes are involved in the maintenance of the steady state level of such a membrane protein complex in a cell. These include transcription of the genes encoding the structural proteins, efficient translation of the mRNAs, integration of the nascent polypeptides in the thylakoid membrane, stoichiometric association of different subunit polypeptides as well as cofactors to form a functional complex, and ultimately regulated degradation of various components. Northern blot analysis of cellular RNA demonstrated that the mutation in BP 26 does not affect the accumulation of the transcripts of the psaAB gene cluster that encodes PsaA and PsaB (Fig. 3). This result strongly suggested that the BtpA protein regulates the biogenesis of the PSI reaction center proteins at a post-transcriptional level. One of the possible roles of the BtpA protein is in the efficient translation of the psaAB messenger RNA. A number of such translational activator proteins have been identified in yeast mitochondria (37Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 91-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of them, CBS1, is an integral membrane protein (38Michaelis U. Körte A. Rödel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that BtpA is a membrane-bound chaperonin-like protein that stabilizes the translational intermediates of the PSI reaction center complex. Stabilization of such intermediates of the large highly hydrophobic proteins PsaA and PsaB may be an important step in the proper assembly of various polypeptides and cofactors into a functional complex. A third possibility is that the BtpA protein may regulate the biosynthesis and availability of critically important cofactors in PSI, such as P700, the reaction center chlorophylls, or FX, an interpeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster. Finally, Collier and Grossman (39Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have recently identified NblA, a small protein, that controls the degradation of phycobilisomes, a soluble pigment-protein complex in cyanobacteria. In a similar manner, BtpA may be involved in regulating the rate of degradation of the PSI holocomplex. Further biochemical and genetic analysis of this novel protein is expected to unravel its exact function in the regulation of the steady state level of the PSI complex. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of BtpA with the GenBank™-EMBL sequence data base revealed that polypeptides homologous to BtpA are present in the archaeon M. jannaschii, the eubacterium E. coli, as well as the nematode C. elegans The sequences of all of these latter proteins were identified during the course of respective genome sequencing projects, and the function of none of them is currently known. The presence of BtpA-like proteins in at least three different kingdoms of life (Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, and Animalia) suggests that all of these proteins have an important common function in cellular metabolism. It is also noteworthy that the respective proteins in M. jannaschii, E. coli, and C. elegans are similar in length to BtpA, and have similar predicted secondary structures (data not shown). Given their close similarities with BtpA, we propose that these related proteins are also involved in the biogenesis or degradation of other membrane-bound multisubunit protein complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2045235316,"The interaction between P-glycoprotein (140-180 kDa) from the multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHRC5 and cyclosporin A was characterized using three different photoactivable cyclosporin A analogs. Two monoclonal antibodies, which are able to discriminate between two major domains of cyclosporin A (the cyclophilin and calcineurin binding domains), were used to detect the photolabeled proteins. A protein of 155 kDa corresponding to P-glycoprotein was much more strongly photolabeled in membranes of CHRC5 cells than in membranes of their drug-sensitive parent cell line AuxB1. The antitumor drug vinblastine and the reversal agents verapamil and cyclosporin A inhibited the photolabeling, and the nonimmunosuppressive derivative PSC-833 caused a stronger inhibition than cyclosporin A. P-glycoprotein photolabeled with cyclosporin A analogs was only detected with the monoclonal antibody that recognizes cyclosporin A and its metabolites, indicating that the calcineurin binding domain recognized specifically by the other antibody is not exposed. These results suggest that the portion of cyclosporin A that binds to calcineurin plays a role in the interaction of cyclosporin A with P-glycoprotein."

However, the presence of the mutated monomer in mixtures with normal collagen II increased the lag time for fibril assembly and altered the morphology of the fibrils formed. Collagen II is the major structural component of cartilage, in that it accounts for about 30% of the dry weight of developing cartilage and about 60% of the dry weight of adult articular cartilage (1Eyre D.R. Upton M.P. Shapiro F.D. Wilkinson R.H. Vawter G.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 39: 52-67PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wu J.-J. Woods P.E. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrils of collagen II are distended by the presence of water, proteoglycans, and other matrix components such as collagens IX and XI that bind to the surface of collagen II fibrils (3Piez K.A. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier, New York1984: 1-40Google Scholar, 4van der Rest M. Garrone R. Herbage D. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 6: 1-67Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like other fibrillar collagens, collagen II is first synthesized as a procollagen in which the three α chains of the monomer are extended by the presence of N- and C-propeptides. The processing of procollagen II to collagen II requires a procollagen N-proteinase to cleave the three chains of the NH2-terminal propeptide and a separate procollagen C-proteinase to cleave the three chains of the C-propeptide (5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). After processing of the procollagen by the two proteases, the resulting collagen II spontaneously forms fibrils. Over 50 mutations in the gene coding for collagen II (COL2A1) have been reported in patients with the heterogeneous cartilage disorders referred to as chondrodysplasias (5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I.

About half of the mutations in the COL2A1 gene causing human chondrodysplasias are single-base substitutions that convert codons for obligate glycine residues in the repeating -Gly-X-Y- sequence of the collagen triple helix to codons for amino acids with bulkier side chains (6Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 9Horton W.A. Hecht J.T. Royce P.M. Steinmann Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 641-675Google Scholar, 10Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. Hum. Mutat. 1996; PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining mutations are premature termination codons, RNA-splicing mutations, partial gene deletions, sequence insertions, or sequence duplications. One special class of mutations found in the human COL2A1 gene are single base substitutions that converted codons for Arg residues in the Y position of the repeating -Gly-X-Y- sequence of the triple helix to codons for Cys. The first Arg to Cys substitution was seen in a family with early onset generalized osteoarthritis together with features of a mild chondrodysplasia probably best classified as a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (15Ala-Kokko L. Baldwin C.T. Moskowitz R.W. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6565-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Subsequently, four additional families with a similar phenotype were seen with the same mutations in the codon for Arg-α1-519 (16Williams C.J. Rock M. Considine E. McCarron S. Gow P. Ladda R. McLain D. Michels V.M. Murphy W. Prockop D.J. Ganguly A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Of the total of five families with the Arg-α1-519 mutations, three may be related through an early Icelandic founder, and the other two are apparently unrelated (17Williams C.J. Considine E.L. Knowlton R.G. Reginato A. Neumann G. Harrison D. Buxton P. Jimenez S. Prockop D.J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Three additional probands with similar phenotypes were reported with a Cys for Arg substitution at α1-75 (18Holderbaum D. Bleasel J.F. Johsson H. Saxne T. Prockop D.J. Williams C.J. Moskowitz R.W. Matrix Biol. 1996; Google Scholar, 19Bleasel J.F. Bisagni-Faure A. Holderbaum D. Vacher-Lavenu M.C. Haqqi T.M. Moskowitz R.W. Menkes C.J. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 22: 255-261PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a similar Cys for Arg substitution at α1-789 was found in two unrelated probands with a severe phenotype of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (20Chan D. Taylor T.K.F. Cole W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15238-15245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chan D. Rogers J.F. Bateman J.F. Cole W.G. J. Rheumatol. 1995; 43: 37-38Google Scholar). The Cys for Arg substitutions in collagen II are of special interest because they are the first amino acid substitutions in the Y position of the repeating -Gly-X-Y- sequences of a collagen shown to cause a phenotype. They are also of interest because they are among the most frequently recurrent mutations in collagen genes among the more than 200 such mutations now reported (6Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 7Prockop D.J. Hulmes D.J.S. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.E. Mechan R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.

In addition, since the Arg-α1-519 and Arg-α1-75 mutations produce relatively mild phenotypes, they may be representative of mutations that cause relatively common disorders of connective tissue. Previously, we expressed the human COL2A1 gene in HT-1080 cells, a human tumor cell line that synthesizes the collagen IV found in the basement membrane but not any fibrillar collagen (22Tryggvason K.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7409-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As was shown previously, these cells are a very useful tool for producing properly folded and posttranslationally modified procollagen II (24Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L.

Here we have prepared recombinant human procollagen II containing the substitution of Cys for Arg at α1-519 found in three unrelated families with a mild cartilage disorder (15Ala-Kokko L.

In contrast to mutated procollagens containing Cys substitutions for obligatory Gly residues (6Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D.J.

Also, the mutated collagen did not assemble into fibrils under conditions in which the normal monomers readily polymerized. However, the presence of the mutated monomer in mixtures with normal type collagen II increased the lag time for fibril assembly and altered the morphology of the fibrils formed. Previously we prepared recombinant procollagen II by using a COL1A1/COL2A1 hybrid construct in which expression of the COL2A1 gene was driven by a promoter of the COL1A1 gene (25Ala-Kokko L. Hyland J. Smith C. Kivirikko K.I. Jimenez S.A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14175-14178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain a fragment of the COL2A1 gene coding for Cys at α1-519, genomic DNA was isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts (26Strauss W.M. Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

The genomic DNA was partially digested by SphI and used to prepare a cosmid library as described earlier (27Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. Matrix.

The 12-kb fragment contained a single base mutation that converted the codon -CGT- for Arg at position α1-519 to -TGT-, a codon for Cys. kilobase polymerase chain reaction. To assemble a COL1A1/COL2A1 hybrid construct containing the mutated α1-519 codon, the complete gene was assembled from four fragments: a 1.9-kb SphI-HindIII fragment from the 5′-end of the human COL1A1 gene (28Chu M.-L de Wet W.

Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); the 12-kb SphI-SphI fragment containing the mutated α1-519 codon; and two additional SphI-SphI fragments of 14 and 3.5 kb (25Ala-Kokko L. Hyland J. Smith C. Kivirikko K.I. Jimenez S.A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14175-14178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construct contained 476 base pairs of the promoter, the first exon, and most of the first intron of the COL1A1 gene extending up to +1,445 base pairs. The COL1A1 fragment was linked to 29.5 kb of sequences of the human COL2A1 gene that extended from the SphI site in the 3′-end of the second intron of the gene at +1,249 base pairs to about 3.5 kb beyond the major polyadenylation signal of the gene. For the first step of assembly, the Sphl site in the 5′-end of the 1.9-kb SphI-HindIII fragment and the SphI site in the 3′-end of the 3.5-kb SphI-SphI fragment were converted to SalI sites. The HindIII site in the 3′-end of the 1.9-kb SphI-HindIII fragment was converted to an SphI site. The two SalI-SphI and SphI-SalI fragments were then assembled into a SalI site in a modified cosmid vector by three-way ligation (27Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. Matrix. Biol. 1990; 10: 279-284Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the second step, the 14-kb SphI-SphI fragment with the wild type sequence and the 12-kb SphI-SphI fragment with the mutated α1-519 codon were inserted by three-way ligation into the SphI site of the construct obtained in the first step. To express the normal and mutated COL1A1/COL2A1 genes, the constructs were stably transfected into the human cell line HT-1080 by calcium phosphate precipitation, and clones were selected with G418 for expression of the co-transfected neomycin resistance gene (see Refs. 24Fertala A.

Transfected clones were screened for secretion of the recombinant protein by a Western blot assay using a polyclonal antibody specific for the C-telopeptide of collagen II (see Ref. 25Ala-Kokko L.

Positive clones were grown in 175-cm2 culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To prepare larger amounts of the recombinant protein, about 3 × 108 cells were seeded into six separate intercommunicating stacks of culture flasks (6,000 cm2 each; Cell Factory™, Nunc). After reaching confluency, the cell layer was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. To harvest the recombinant procollagen, the cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with L-ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium salt n-hydrate (Wako, Osaka, Japan) without fetal calf serum for 24 h on each of six successive days. In a few experiments, 0.8 or 0.2 μCi/ml 14C-labeled amino acids (DuPont NEN) were added to the medium to obtain 14C-labeled proteins. The 36 liters of medium from the six 24-h collections was concentrated 10-fold using a counterflow filtration system with a 100-kDa cutoff limit (PREP-SCALE™ TFF cartridge; Millipore). Proteins in the medium were further concentrated by precipitation with 176 mg/ml ammonium sulfate. Procollagen was then purified by chromatography on two anion exchange columns as described previously (24Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Ganguly A. Li S.-W. Ala-Kokko L. Anumula K.R. Prockop D.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cells expressing the mutated COL1A1/COL2A1 hybrid gene with a selective resin (RNeasy; Qiagen). The RNA was reverse transcribed with random primers (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and amplified by PCR with the primer pairs SW-13 (AGAGGTGCTCCCGGAAAC) and SW-12 (TCTCGCCAGGCATTCCCTG) directed to sequences spanning the region from 1321 to 2053 base pairs in the COL2A1 cDNA. The PCR product was separated by electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel, extracted, and sequenced by cycle sequencing with fluorescently labeled dNTPs on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Thermal stability of the collagen triple helix was assayed by brief protease digestion at varying temperatures with a trypsin and chymotrypsin mixture as described previously (24Fertala A.

To assay for intramolecular disulfide bonds, 14C-labeled procollagen was digested with the mixture of trypsin (100 μg/ml) and chymotrypsin (250 μg/ml) at 25°C for 5 min. The resulting collagen was assayed for the presence of protease-resistant α1(II) chains by electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in SDS under nonreducing conditions. Intermolecular disulfide bonds were assayed with the same procedure after the 14C-labeled pC-collagen II was converted to collagen by digestion with C-proteinase under the conditions used in the experiments on assembly of collagen II fibrils (see below). About 2 mg of purified procollagen II was digested by procollagen N-proteinase (EC 3.4.24.14) purified from chick embryo tendons (33Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 6 h at 32°C in 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij, and 0.01% NaN3 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, adjusted to pH 7.8 at 20°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 volume of 250 mM EDTA and 0.02% NaN3 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 at 20°C. The pC-collagen II was concentrated on a membrane filter (Amicon YM-100) under a pressure of 7 p.s.i. and purified with a gel filtration column (HiLoad™ Superdex™ 200 column; Pharmacia) in a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated, and proteins were eluted with 0.4 M NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions that contained pC-collagen II were combined and concentrated on a membrane filter (Amicon YM-100). For the studies on fibril formation, mutated pC-collagen II was 14C-labeled, but normal pC-collagen II was not. The pC-collagens and C-proteinase were dialyzed separately against fibril formation buffer (34Kadler K. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then stored in parafilm-sealed tubes under an atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air at −20°C. To initiate fibril formation, pC-collagen and C-proteinase were mixed at 4°C in a 250-μl polypropylene tube in a total volume of 20 μl to give a final concentration of 150 μg/ml pC-collagen and 50 units/ml C-proteinase. To study fibril formation in the presence of mutated collagen, normal and mutated pC-collagens II were mixed to provide solutions in which the concentration of normal pC-collagen II was 150 μg/ml but mutated pC-collagen II was added to give ratios of normal to mutated that were 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1. Therefore, the total concentrations of pC-collagen varied from 188 to 300 μg/ml. The concentration of C-proteinase was increased so that the time required for complete cleavage was about 60 min. After preparing the mixtures, the tubes were briefly flushed with water-saturated 10% CO2 and 90% air. The tubes were capped and incubated from 0.5 to 24 h at 37°C. The formed fibrils were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a separate tube. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of fibril formation buffer. Concentrated electrophoresis sample (5 ×) buffer was added to each sample to give a final concentration of 2% SDS, 2% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue in 62 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8 at 20°C. The samples were heated at 100°C for 3 min and separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in SDS. The gels were stained with colloidal Brilliant Blue G (Sigma), destained, and air-dried between two sheets of cellophane. Relative amounts of stained α1(II) chains were assayed with a laser densitometer (Ultrascan XL; Pharmacia). With 14C-labeled samples, the gels were also assayed with a phosphor storage plate (PhosphorImager 400S; Molecular Dynamics) for the pixel counts in the protein bands. The assay made it possible to detect as little as 0.1 μg of α1(II) chains in either the supernatant or pellet fractions. For dark-field light microscopy, mixtures of pC-collagen and C-proteinase (40 μl final volume) were placed in sealed chambers formed by gluing a plastic ring to a microscopic slide and capping the chamber with a coverslip (35Kadler K.W. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fibrils were photographed using a light microscope (model 9901; Zeiss). For the electron microscopy, a hanging drop system for fibril assembly was used to minimize aggregation of the fibrils (36Fertala A. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. Sieron A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 5 μl of a mixture containing pC-collagens and C-proteinase were transferred onto a Teflon-insulated wire mounted inside a screw cap to form a hanging drop. Then the drop on the wire was suspended above a small amount of fibril formation buffer, and the tube was tightly closed. The tube was submerged in the water bath at 37°C and incubated for 24 h. The whole drop was then transferred to a carbon-coated electron microscopic grid and stained negatively for 1 min with 1% phosphotungstate. The grids were examined with a transmission electron microscope (model 7000; Hitachi) at a magnification of × 3,000-50,000. Molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics (Onyx) computer system using the SYBYL software package, version 6.1 (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Models of the collagen II triple helix were created as described by Chen et al. (37Chen J.M. Sheldon A. Pincus M.R. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1995; 6: 1129-1159Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The parent model was generated with a 36-amino acid peptide in which the Arg at α1-519 was in the middle of the wild type sequence: GFP GER GSP GAQ GLQ GPR GLP GTP GTD GPK GAS GPA. To minimize end group effects, the amino terminus was substituted with an N-acetyl group and the carboxyl terminus with −NHCH3. The parent molecule was then modified to generate three mutated molecules in which a Cys residue was substituted at α1-518, α1-519, and α1-520. All the models were energy minimized using a conjugate gradient method and subject to repeating cycles of molecular dynamics using Kollman force fields and united atoms (38Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). Two hundred-picosecond dynamic trajectory runs were saved and analyzed for low energy conformers. To obtain a construct of the mutated COL2A1 gene, a 12-kb SphI-SphI fragment was isolated from a cosmid library prepared with genomic DNA from a proband previously found to have primary generalized osteoarthritis associated with a mild chondrodysplasia (15Ala-Kokko L. Baldwin C.T. Moskowitz R.W. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6565-6568Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The proband was heterozygous for a single base mutation that converted the codon for Arg at α-519 to a codon for Cys and that was co-inherited with the phenotype in his large family. The 12-kb SphI-SphI fragment was assembled into a COL1A1/COL2A1 hybrid construct in which expression of the COL2A1 gene was driven by a COL1A1 promoter (see Ref. 25Ala-Kokko L. Hyland J. Smith C. Kivirikko K.I. Jimenez S.A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14175-14178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construct was assembled in two steps, each of which required a three-way ligation. The gene construct was then used to prepare stable transfectants of the mammalian cell HT-1080 (24Fertala A.

A clone secreting the mutated procollagen II was isolated and used for preparation of the recombinant protein. To confirm the presence of the mutation in the expressed gene, total RNA was isolated from the clone, the RNA was reverse-transcribed, the resulting cDNA was amplified with a primer paired specific for the region containing the mutation, and the PCR product was sequenced. As indicated in Fig. 1, the results demonstrated that the codon of -CGT- for Arg at α1-519 was converted to -TGT-, a codon for Cys. To obtain adequate amounts of the recombinant mutated procollagen II for functional assays, 36 liters of medium from cultures of the clone were concentrated, and the protein was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography. The protein was shown to be homogeneous by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with colloidal Brilliant Blue G (not shown). To assay the thermal stability of the triple helix of the mutated collagen II, the protein was assayed by brief digestion with mixture of chymotrypsin and trypsin. As indicated in Fig. 2, there was no apparent difference in thermal stability between the mutated collagen II and normal collagen II. Of note was that the band below α1(II) chains seen previously with the sample of recombinant normal collagen II digested with a mixture of chymotrypsin and trypsin (39Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Ala-Kokko L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21232-21237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also present in mutated recombinant collagen II. The same band was seen after digestion of collagen II from chick sterna cartilage (not shown) with the chymotrypsin/trypsin mixture. A similar band after digestion of collagen II was also seen by Sokolov et al. (40Sokolov B.P. Sher B.M. Kozlov E.A. Tsvetkova T.A. Delvig A.A. Kalinin V.N. Biokhimiya. 1987; 53: 1828-1836Google Scholar, 41Sokolov B.P. Sher B.M. Kozlov E.A. Tsvetkova T.A. Rudakov S.S. Delvig A.A. Kalinin V.N. Med. Sci.

To assay the mutated procollagen for the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds within the triple helix, the purified protein was digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin at 25°C to remove the N- and C-propeptides. The resulting collagen was then assayed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in SDS under nonreducing conditions. No dimers of α1(II) chains were detected (not shown). Under the same conditions, a series of mutated procollagens I containing cysteine substitutions for obligate glycine residues were previously shown to form interchain disulfide bonds (see Ref. 42Torre-Blanco A.

https://openalex.org/W1988017018,"Prodynorphin mRNA and dynorphin B expression have been previously shown to be greatly increased in cardiac myocytes of BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters. Here we report that exogenous dynorphin B induced a dose-dependent increase in prodynorphin mRNA levels and stimulated prodynorphin gene transcription in normal hamster myocytes. Similar responses were elicited by the synthetic selective kappa opioid receptor agonist U-50,488H. These effects were counteracted by the kappa opioid receptor antagonist Mr-1452 and were not observed in the presence of chelerythrine or calphostin C, two specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors. Treatment of cardiomyopathic cells with Mr-1452 significantly decreased both prodynorphin mRNA levels and prodynorphin gene transcription. In control myocytes, dynorphin B induced the translocation of PKC-alpha to the nucleus and increased nuclear PKC activity without affecting the expression of PKC-delta, -epsilon, or -zeta. Acute release of either U-50,488H or dyn B over single normal or cardiomyopathic cells transiently increased the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. A sustained treatment with each opioid agonist increased the cytosolic Ca2+ level for a more prolonged period in cardiomyopathic than in control myocytes and led to a depletion of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in both groups of cells. The possibility that prodynorphin gene expression may affect the function of the cardiomyopathic cell through an autocrine mechanism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2001957577,"The dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) component of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) consists of 60 COOH-terminal domains as an inner assemblage and sequentially via linker regions an exterior pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) binding domain and two lipoyl domains. Mature human E2, expressed in a protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain at 27°, was prepared in a highly purified form. Purified E2 had a high acetyltransferase activity, was well lipoylated based on its acetylation, and bound a large complement of bovine E1. Electron micrographs demonstrated that the inner core was assembled in the expected pentagonal dodecahedron shape with E1 binding around the inner core periphery. With saturating E1 and excess dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) but no E3-binding protein (E3BP), the recombinant E2 supported the overall PDC reaction at 4% of the rate of bovine E2·E3BP subcomplex. The lipoates of assembled human E2 or its free bilipoyl domain region were reduced by E3 at rates proportional to the lipoyl domain concentration, but those of the E2·E3BP were rapidly used in a concentration-independent manner consistent with bound E3 rapidly using a set of lipoyl domains localized nearby. Given this restriction and the need for E3BP for high PDC activity, directed channeling of reducing equivalents to bound E3 must be very efficient in the complex. The recombinant E2 oligomer increased E1 kinase activity by up to 4-fold and, in a Ca2+-dependent process, increased phospho-E1 phosphatase activity more than 15-fold. Thus the E2 assemblage fully provides the molecular intervention whereby a single E2-bound kinase or phosphatase molecule rapidly phosphorylate or dephosphorylate, respectively, many E2-bound E1. Thus, we prepared properly assembled, fully functional human E2 that mediated enhanced regulatory enzyme activities but, lacking E3BP, supported low PDC activity."

PTHrP also modulates cell growth and differentiation of normal cells through mechanisms that include binding to cell surface-specific receptors as well as by possible intracellular routes. To understand the regulation of intracellular PTHrP expression, post-translational processing of PTHrP was investigated. Using cell-free translations it was shown that PTHrP can be ligated efficiently to multiple ubiquitin moieties. Both conjugation to ubiquitin and degradation of prepro-PTHrP synthesized in vitro were ATP-dependent. Translation in vitro in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 abolished the degradation of PTHrP. Treatment of cells, cotransfected with hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin and histidine-tagged prepro-PTHrP, with MG-132, led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated prepro-PTHrP. Deletion mutagenesis experiments indicated that both the prepro secretory domain and a PEST (amino acid residues Pro (P), Glu (E), and/or Asp (D), Ser (S), and Thr (T)) motif in the COOH-terminal region of the protein were not required as cis-acting determinants for ubiquitination. This is the first report of a wild-type secretory polypeptide serving as a substrate of the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway. These results suggest that the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway is involved in regulating the metabolic stability of intracellular PTHrP, and this regulation may be an important mechanism for modulating its effects on cell growth and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2090575510,"Prodynorphin gene expression was investigated in adult ventricular myocytes isolated from normal (F1B) or cardiomyopathic (BIO 14.6) hamsters. Prodynorphin mRNA levels were higher in cardiomyopathic than in control myocytes and were stimulated by treatment of control cells with the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 1, 2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol. Both chelerythrine and calphostin C, two PKC inhibitors, abolished the stimulatory effect of the diglyceride and significantly reduced prodynorphin gene expression in cardiomyopathic myocytes. Nuclear run-off experiments indicated that the prodynorphin gene was regulated at the transcriptional level and that treatment of nuclei isolated from control cells with 1, 2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol increased prodynorphin gene transcription, whereas chelerythrine or calphostin C abolished this transcriptional effect. Direct exposure of nuclei isolated from cardiomyopathic myocytes to these inhibitors markedly down-regulated the rate of gene transcription. The expression of PKC-alpha, -delta, and -epsilon, as well as PKC activity, were increased in nuclei of cardiomyopathic myocytes compared with nuclei from control cells. The levels of both intracellular and secreted dynorphin B, a biologically active product of the gene, were higher in cardiomyopathic than in control cells and were stimulated or inhibited by cell treatment with 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol or PKC inhibitors, respectively."

Recently, a tumor necrosis factor-like ligand of m4-1BB, m4-1BBL, as well as the human counterparts of 4-1BB (ILA) and 4-1BBL (h4-1BB and h4-1BBL, respectively) have been cloned.

Analogous to what has been observed in murine T cells, h4-1BB is expressed by activated T cells; however, unlike m4-1BB, transcripts encoding h4-1BB can be detected in activated human peripheral blood B cells (8Schwarz H. Valbracht J. Tuckwell J. von Kempis J. Lotz M. Blood. 1995; 85: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA encoding h4-1BB is also detected in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-activated or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-activated peripheral blood monocytes (8Schwarz H. Valbracht J. Tuckwell J. von Kempis J. Lotz M. Blood. 1995; 85: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, transcripts encoding h4-1BB can be detected in an activated human T cell line (Jurkat), in resting human B cell lines (Raji and Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cells from normal donors), and in a number of unstimulated and IL-1β stimulated nonlymphoid cell lines (8Schwarz H. Valbracht J. Tuckwell J. von Kempis J. Lotz M. Blood. 1995; 85: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of 4-1BB by activated murine and human T cells increases gradually over time. Studies using anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or concanavalin A-activated murine T cells showed that following activation the level of m4-1BB detectable on the surface of T cells steadily increases over 3 days (9Pollok K.E. Kim S.H. Kwon B.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Additionally, h4-1BB mRNA expression by anti-CD3 mAb-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be detected at 4 h and remains strongly expressed at 48 h (8Schwarz H. Valbracht J. Tuckwell J. von Kempis J. Lotz M. Blood. 1995; 85: 1043-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early evidence for a role of m4-1BB in the regulation of the immune response came from mAb cross-linking studies, which showed that co-immobilized suboptimal concentrations of an anti-CD3 mAb with the anti-m4-1BB mAb 53A2 could efficiently drive resting T cells to proliferate (7Pollok K.E. Kim Y.-J. Zhou Z. Hurtado J. Kim K.K. Pickard R.T. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 771-781PubMed Google Scholar). These studies were extended by Goodwin et al. (5Goodwin R.G. Din W.S. Davis-Smith T. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Farrah T. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Smith C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), who showed that CV-1 cells expressing m4-1BBL could significantly enhance the proliferation of IL-2- and concanavalin A-stimulated thymocytes. M4-1BBL-expressing CV-1 cells could also significantly enhance the proliferation of phytohemagglutanin-stimulated splenic T cells (5Goodwin R.G. Din W.S. Davis-Smith T. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Farrah T. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Smith C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Independent evidence for a role of 4-1BB in T cell activation came from studies which sought to identify the molecules responsible for the T cell costimulatory activity of the B cell lymphoma K46J. These studies showed that the costimulatory activity of K46J B cells could be blocked with a soluble alkaline phosphatase chimera of m4-1BB (m4-1BB-AP) but not with a soluble immunoglobulin chimera of CTLA4 (CTLA4-Ig) or mAbs against B7-1, B7-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or heat-stable antigen (10De Benedette M.A. Chu N.R. Pollok K.E. Hurtado J. Wade W.F. Kwon B.S. Watts T.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the results of experiments showing that stimulation of purified resting T cells by anti-CD3 mAb and fixed antigen presenting cells could be partially blocked with an immunoglobulin chimera of m4-1BB (m4-1BB/Fc) (11Hurtado J.C. Kim S.H. Pollok K.E. Lee Z.H. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3360-3367PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, m4-1BB/Fc was capable of blocking IL-2 production by purified T cells coactivated with anti-CD3 mAb and accessory cells (11Hurtado J.C. Kim S.H. Pollok K.E. Lee Z.H. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3360-3367PubMed Google Scholar). Similar studies with an anti-h4-1BB mAb (M14), or CV-1 cells expressing the h4-1BBL, showed that h4-1BB can function as a costimulatory molecule for resting human T cells and enhance the anti-CD3 mAb-driven apoptosis of chronically activated T cells (6Alderson M.R. Smith C.A. Tough T.W. Davis-Smith T. Armitage R.J. Falk B. Roux E. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Din W.S. Goodwin R.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of 4-1BB in T cell signaling, the cytoplasmic domain of m4-1BB contains a CXCXCP motif recognized by protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src family. Indeed, p56lck has been found to associate with m4-1BB in the CD8+ T cell line CTLL-2 (12Kim Y.-J. Pollok K.E. Zhou Z. Shaw A. Bohlen J.B. Fraser M. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1255-1262PubMed Google Scholar). Although extracellular matrix proteins and the high affinity TNF-like ligand have been shown to bind to m4-1BB, the relationship between the two ligand binding sites on m4-1BB has not been explored. It is also not clear whether h4-1BB is also able to bind extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we report on the results of experiments designed to investigate the relationship between the m4-1BB binding sites for its two ligands. Ligand cross-blocking studies were carried out to investigate if the m4-1BBL and extracellular matrix binding sites are distinct or not and to examine if this molecule can simultaneously bind to both ligands. These studies were extended using a series of truncated m4-1BB proteins and a panel of anti-m4-1BB mAbs to further define the m4-1BBL and extracellular matrix binding sites and their relative proximities. The recent cloning of the human homologues of 4-1BB and 4-1BBL allowed us to test the ligand binding properties of h4-1BB and to prepare murine/human 4-1BB chimeric proteins to further examine the two ligand binding sites on m4-1BB. COS cells were grown and maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Generation of the rat anti-m4-1BB monoclonal antibodies is described elsewhere. 2W. W. Shuford, K. Klussman, D. D. Tritchler, D. T. Loo, J. Chalupny, A. W. Siadak, T. J. Brown, J. Emswiler, H.

Ledbetter (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Seattle, WA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the full-length m4-1BB and CD40 molecules was generated and subcloned as described previously (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R.

The full-length h4-1BB cDNA was similarly generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primers: 5′-CCG AAG CTT GCT TTG CTA GTA TCA TAC CTG TGC-3′ and 5′-CCG CTG CAG GCT GTG ATA GCG GAT GAC TCA-3′. cDNA fragments encoding the extracellular region of murine and human 4-1BB and 4-1BBL were obtained by PCR. The soluble m4-1BB-Ig fusion protein, containing the CD5 signal sequence, was constructed and prepared as described (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Ledbetter J.A. Farr A.G. Aruffo A. Proc.

The soluble h4-1BB-Ig fusion protein, including its native signal sequence, was constructed and prepared as described (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Ledbetter J.A. Farr A.G. Aruffo A. Proc.

The soluble m4-1BBL fusion protein (sm4-1BBL) was constructed using the following primers: 5′-GCG GCG GAT CCC CGC ACC GAG CCT CGG CCA GCG-3′ and 5′-CGC TCT AGA GGA TAG TTC TCA TTC CCA TGG-3′. The m4-1BBL extracellular domain PCR product was digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into a BamHI/XbaI-cut CDM8 vector containing the extracellular region of Lyt2a (CD8) (13Hollenbaugh D.

The soluble m4-1BBdLN-Ig fusion protein (sm4-1BBdLN-Ig; containing residues 38-185) in which the LN-homologous domain is deleted was constructed and prepared as described (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Ledbetter J.A. Farr A.G. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Note that the cysteine at residue 44 is changed to a serine. The soluble chimeric m/h4-1BB-Ig fusion protein, in which the LN-homologous domain of m4-1BB was put in place of the LN-homologous domain of h4-1BB was constructed by a two-step “sew” PCR using plasmids encoding m4-1BB-Ig and h4-1BB-Ig as templates. The m4-1BB LN-homologous domain (residues 24-44) was generated using the following primers: 5′-AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG-3′, which primes in the vector sequence upstream of m4-1BB, and 5′-GCA GAC TGG ATT GTA TTT TCT GCA GAA GGT ACC AGG-3′. The h4-1BB domain (residues 46-187) was generated using the following primers: 5′-CCT GGT ACC TTC TGC AGA AAA TAC AAT CCA GTC TGC AGT CCC TGT CCT CCA AAT AGT TTG TCC AGC-3′ and 5′-GCA GAT CTT GCG GAG AGT GTC CTG GCT CTC TCG C-3′. The two PCR products were joined together using the flanking primers 5′-AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG-3′, which primes in the vector sequence upstream of m4-1BB, and 5′-GCA GAT CTT GCG GAG AGT GTC CTG GCT CTC TCG C-3′. The soluble chimeric h/m4-1BB-Ig fusion protein, in which the LN-homologous domain of h4-1BB was put in place of the LN-homologous domain of m4-1BB was constructed by an analogous two-step “sew” PCR using plasmids encoding m4-1BB-Ig and h4-1BB-Ig as templates. The h4-1BB LN-homologous domain (residues 1-45) was generated using the following primers: 5′-CCG AAG CTT GCT TTG CTA GTA TCA TAC CTG TGC-3′ and 5′-GCA AAT CTG ATT CCT GTT ATT ATC ACA GAA TGT ACC-3′. The m4-1BB domain (residues 45-185) was generated using the following primers: 5′-GGT ACA TTC TGT GAT AAT AAC AGG AAT CAG ATT TGC AAG AGC TGC CCT CCA AGT ACT TTC TCC AGC-3′ and 5′-GGC CGG ATC CTG CAA GGA GTG CCC TCC TGG TCC-3′.

The binding of purified m4-1BB-Ig to rat laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was tested using an ELISA assay as described (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Ledbetter J.A. Farr A.G. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10360-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Blocking by sm4-1BBL was tested by adding neat sm4-1BBL supernatant to the wells for 1 h at 22°C, followed by washing, and then the addition of biotinylated rat laminin. The binding of purified 4-1BB-Ig to s4-1BBL was tested using an ELISA assay. 96-well plates (Immulon-2, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with the anti-Lyt2a mAb 53-6 diluted to 1 μg/ml in PBS for 1 h at 22°C. The wells were blocked for 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed, and serial dilutions of s4-1BBL supernatants were added and incubated for 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed, and purified 4-1BB-Ig or CD40-Ig was added at 2.5 μg/ml in PBS and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:10,000; Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) was added and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed and treated with the EIA chromogen reagent (Genetics Systems, Seattle, WA) for 15 min at 22°C. The colorimetric reaction was quenched with 1 N H2SO4, and the optical density was measured on an ELISA plate reader at dual wavelengths of 450 and 630 nm. Blocking by rat laminin was tested by preincubating 4-1BB-Ig with rat laminin at 10 μg/ml. As an alternate format, purified 4-1BB-Ig (2 μg/ml) was captured on goat anti-human IgG Fc-coated wells as described previously (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Ledbetter J.A. Farr A.G. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10360-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Following washing, serial dilutions of s4-1BBL supernatants or purified s4-1BBL were added to the wells and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed and biotinylated anti-Ly-2 (CD8a) mAb (Caltag Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) diluted 1:200 in 1 × specimen diluent (SD, Genetics Systems, Seattle, WA) was added and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:2000 in 1 × SD was added to the wells and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed and treated with the EIA chromogen reagent as described above. Blocking by rat laminin was tested by incubating the wells with LN (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 22°C, followed by washing, then the addition of s4-1BBL. The binding of rat anti-m4-1BB mAbs to the various 4-1BB-Ig fusion proteins was tested using an ELISA assay. Purified 4-1BB-Ig (2 μg/ml) was captured on goat anti-human IgG Fc-coated wells as described previously (3Chalupny N.J. Peach R. Hollenbaugh D. Ledbetter J.A. Farr A.G. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10360-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The wells were then blocked for 1 h at 22°C. The wells were washed, and purified rat anti-m4-1BB mAbs were added at 10 μg/ml in 1 × SD and incubated for 2 h at 22°C. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:3000 in 1 × SD was added and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed and treated with the EIA chromogen reagent as described above. To examine the ability of the rat anti-m4-1BB mAbs to block laminin and m4-1BBL binding to m4-1BB-Ig fusion protein, an analogous ELISA assay was performed. Following incubation of the rat anti-m4-1BB mAbs (10 μg/ml in 1 × SD) on m4-1BB-Ig fusion protein-coated wells for 1 h at 22°C, biotinylated rat laminin (5 μg/ml) or purified sm4-1BBL (0.05 μg/ml) was added to antibody-containing wells and incubated 1 h at 22°C. Wells were washed, and sm4-1BBL was detected with biotinylated anti-Ly-2 (CD8a) mAb, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Biotinylated laminin was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin directly. Wells were washed and treated with the EIA chromogen reagent as described above. The binding of sm4-1BBL, sh4-1BBL, sgp39, and LN to m4-1BB, h4-1BB, and CD40 was tested by staining transfected COS cells. COS cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with full-length m4-1BB, h4-1BB, or CD40 cDNAs using DEAE-dextran (15Hollenbaugh D. Aruffo A. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Marqulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Washington, D. C.1994: 10.19.1-10.19.11Google Scholar). One day after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated. Two days later, cells were washed with PBS then recovered following incubation with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS containing 0.5 mM EDTA. Cells were stained with sm4-1BBL, sh4-1BBL, or sgp39 supernatants (1:10 in DMEM, 2% FBS) for 1 h on ice, followed by incubation with biotinylated anti-Ly-2 (CD8a) mAb (1:200 in DMEM, 2% FBS) for 45 min on ice, then avidin-FITC (1:500 in DMEM, 2% FBS; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min on ice. Cells were stained with biotinylated LN (10 μg/ml in DMEM, 2% FBS) for 2 h on ice followed by avidin-FITC (1:500 in DMEM, 2% FBS) for 45 min on ice. Flow cytometry was performed with a FACScan unit (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). At least 5000 viable cells were analyzed in each sample. Initially, segments of the 4-1BB extracellular region sequence were aligned manually against sequences of members of the TNFR family to identify TNFR repeat domains in 4-1BB. Due to the low sequence similarities, these alignments were guided by structural consensus residues of TNFR (18Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). 4-1BB sequence segments outside identified TNFR-like domains were then searched against the SwissProt and GenPept data bases using GCG programs. Obtained alignments for these regions were manually modified to adjust gaps. Our initial attempts to identify a ligand for m4-1BB showed that a m4-1BB-Ig fusion protein and COS and L cell transfectants expressing m4-1BB were able to bind to extracellular matrix proteins. Subsequently, using a similar m4-1BB-Ig fusion protein, another group identified and cloned a second m4-1BB ligand, which they named m4-1BBL (5Goodwin R.G. Din W.S. Davis-Smith T. Anderson D.M. Gimpel S.D. Sato T.A. Maliszewski C.R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Farrah T. Armitage R.J. Fanslow W.C. Smith C.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This molecule, which is expressed by activated T cells, is homologous to TNF. Although other lymphocyte cell surface receptors such as CD2, CD28, and integrins (for example lymphocyte function-associated molecule-1 and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)) have more than one ligand, 4-1BB is the first member of the TNFR family known to bind both a TNF-like molecule and extracellular matrix proteins. To gain a better understanding of the interaction of m4-1BB with its ligands, we carried out a series of binding and cross-blocking studies using m4-1BB-Ig, LN, and a soluble recombinant form of m4-1BBL, sm4-1BBL. As shown in Fig. 1A, sm4-1BBL bound to m4-1BB-Ig but not to the immunoglobulin fusion of the related receptor CD40, CD40-Ig. Ligand cross-blocking studies showed that the interaction between m4-1BB and sm4-1BBL was not blocked by preincubating m4-1BB with a high concentration of LN (10 μg/ml). Furthermore, the binding of sm4-1BBL to the LN-m4-1BB complex did not result in the displacement of LN, indicating that m4-1BB was capable of simultaneously binding to both ligands (Fig. 1C). However, preincubating m4-1BB with a high concentration of sm4-1BBL prevented LN from binding m4-1BB-Ig (Fig. 1B). In these studies, CD40-Ig binding to sm4-1BBL and LN was carried out to evaluate nonspecific binding. As reported previously, CD40-Ig was unable to bind to either m4-1BBL or LN (Fig. 1, A and B). These studies suggest that the interaction of m4-1BB with m4-1BBL and LN is specific, and that m4-1BBL and LN bind to distinct but proximal sites on m4-1BB. To further characterize the LN and m4-1BBL binding sites on m4-1BB, eight anti-m4-1BB mAbs were examined for their ability to block the binding of m4-1BB to either m4-1BBL or LN. As shown in Fig. 2A, six of the eight anti-m4-1BB mAbs effectively blocked the binding of m4-1BB to sm4-1BBL. On the other hand, seven of the mAbs were able to effectively block the interaction between m4-1BB and LN (Fig. 2B). As expected the interaction of m4-1BB with either m4-1BBL or LN could not be blocked with a mAb directed to gp39, the TNF-like ligand of CD40 (14Noelle R.J. Roy M. Shepherd D.M. Stamenkovic I. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6550-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). These findings provide further evidence that the m4-1BBL and LN binding sites of m4-1BB are distinct. A preliminary comparison of the amino acid sequence of the extracellular domain of m4-1BB with that of other proteins revealed the presence of regions homologous to both members of the TNFR family and LN. This observation led us to reexamine in more detail the extracellular domain organization of m4-1BB and its homology to other proteins. Consistent with an earlier proposal (2Mallett S. Barclay A.N. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 220-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), only two TNFR domains could be identified with certainty in the extracellular region of m4-1BB (Fig. 3). The two TNFR-like domains in m4-1BB are best aligned with TNFR domains 1 and 3, respectively. These two TNFR-like domains are not adjacent, but separated by a short cysteine-rich segment. Data base searches with the sequence of this short segment revealed significant matches of its cysteine pattern to that found in metallothionein (MT; Fig. 3). MT is a small cysteine-rich cytoplasmic protein, which binds divalent cations using clusters of cysteine residues (16Furey W.F. Robbins A.H. Clancy L.L. Winge D.R. Wang B.C. Stout C.D. Science. 1986; 231: 704-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and is not related to TNFR molecules. However, on the cell surface, a motif with cysteine spacing similar to MT may form a small and highly disulfide bond constrained domain. The region of m4-1BB/MT homology overlaps with the COOH-terminal region of the first TNFR-like domain of m4-1BB (Fig. 3). Although the structural significance of this overlap remains unclear, the finding that the two TNFR-like domains in m4-1BB may be connected by a constrained structural motif suggests that this domain organization may result in a “fusion” of the two TNFR domains. In contrast, the NH2-terminal region in m4-1BB displays sequence similarities to LN (Fig. 3). The x-ray structure of three consecutive LN-type epidermal growth factor-like modules was reported recently (17Stetefeld J. Mayer U. Timpl R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 644-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These modules were arranged in a linear “stacked” fashion, reminiscent of the gross domain arrangement of TNFR (18Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Based on th"
https://openalex.org/W2017888472,"The molecular and cellular basis for concerted Ca2+/lipid signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated. A unique gene (pkc-2) and cognate cDNAs that encode six Ca2+/diacylglycerol-stimulated PKC2 isoenzymes were characterized. PKC2 polypeptides (680-717 amino acid residues) share identical catalytic, Ca2+-binding, diacylglycerol-activation and pseudosubstrate domains. However, sequences of the N- and C-terminal regions of the kinases diverge. PKC2 diversity is partly due to differential activation of transcription by distinct promoters. Each promoter precedes an adjacent exon that encodes 5′-untranslated RNA, an initiator AUG codon and a unique open reading frame. PKC2 mRNAs also incorporate one of two 3′-terminal exons via alternative splicing. Cells that are capable of receiving and propagating signals carried by Ca2+/diacylglycerol were identified by assessing activities of pkc-2 gene promoters in transgenic C. elegans and visualizing the distribution of PKC2 polypeptides via immunofluorescence. Highly-selective expression of certain PKC2 isoforms was observed in distinct subsets of neurons, intestinal and muscle cells. A low level of PKC2 isoforms is observed in embryos. When L1 larvae hatch and interact with the external environment PKC2 content increases 10-fold. Although 77- and 78-kDa PKC2 isoforms are evident throughout post-embryonic development, an 81-kDa isoform appears to be adapted for function in L1 and L2 larvae. The molecular and cellular basis for concerted Ca2+/lipid signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated. A unique gene (pkc-2) and cognate cDNAs that encode six Ca2+/diacylglycerol-stimulated PKC2 isoenzymes were characterized. PKC2 polypeptides (680-717 amino acid residues) share identical catalytic, Ca2+-binding, diacylglycerol-activation and pseudosubstrate domains. However, sequences of the N- and C-terminal regions of the kinases diverge. PKC2 diversity is partly due to differential activation of transcription by distinct promoters. Each promoter precedes an adjacent exon that encodes 5′-untranslated RNA, an initiator AUG codon and a unique open reading frame. PKC2 mRNAs also incorporate one of two 3′-terminal exons via alternative splicing. Cells that are capable of receiving and propagating signals carried by Ca2+/diacylglycerol were identified by assessing activities of pkc-2 gene promoters in transgenic C. elegans and visualizing the distribution of PKC2 polypeptides via immunofluorescence. Highly-selective expression of certain PKC2 isoforms was observed in distinct subsets of neurons, intestinal and muscle cells. A low level of PKC2 isoforms is observed in embryos. When L1 larvae hatch and interact with the external environment PKC2 content increases 10-fold. Although 77- and 78-kDa PKC2 isoforms are evident throughout post-embryonic development, an 81-kDa isoform appears to be adapted for function in L1 and L2 larvae. Numerous hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters elicit receptor-mediated activation of phospholipases (Cγ, Cβ, D, and A2) and the concomitant production of phospholipid-derived second messenger molecules (1Nishizuka Y.

Activated PKCs catalyze the phosphorylation of substrate/effector proteins at specific Ser and/or Thr residues, thereby modulating their functions. PKC-mediated protein phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of many important processes, including secretion, ion channel activity, mitogenesis, gene transcription, and cell differentiation (1Nishizuka Y.

Distinctive properties of PKC isoenzymes also contribute to the diversity of responses elicited by phospholipid metabolites. In mammals nine genes encode 10 PKC isoforms (1Nishizuka Y.

These kinases differ in their substrate specificities, susceptibilities to activation by calcium and lipid second messengers, intracellular destinations after activation, and ability to undergo down-regulation. Reconstitution of PKC-mediated signaling in permeabilized cells and manipulation of PKC signaling pathways via transfection and microinjection indicate that individual PKCs control discrete physiological functions. Examples include the regulation of secretion, phospholipase Cγ activity, and mitogenesis by PKCs β, ε, and ζ, respectively (9Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H.

The relevance of the observations to physiological roles for individual PKCs in specific cells in intact organisms remains to be established. The spectrum of cellular responses to lipid second messengers also reflects differential expression of genes encoding PKC isoforms. Qualitative and quantitative differences in PKC isoform content are evident in many mammalian tissues (12Nishizuka Y.

Little is known about cis-regulatory elements and trans-acting proteins that govern activation or inhibition of PKC gene transcription. The non-parasitic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful system for investigations on functions and regulated expression of PKC isoforms. Adult C. elegans are composed of 959 somatic cells, which are organized into tissues that constitute digestive, reproductive, muscular, hypodermal, and nervous systems (23Sulston J. Wood W.B.

Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cellular and developmental biology of C. elegans have been characterized in exceptional detail and the lineage of each cell in the animal has been determined (23Sulston J. Wood W.B.

Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Numerous aspects of C. elegans development and homeostasis are controlled by signal transduction systems that are analogous to, or identical with, those operative in mammals (26Han M. Sternberg P. Cell. 1990; 65: 921-931Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 27Clark G.S. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Methods for production of mutant, transgenic and “knock-out” strains of C. elegans enable the analysis of gene promoter activities and gene functions in individual cells in situ (28Fire A.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) permits detection of specific proteins in individual cells of intact C. elegans at all developmental stages. We demonstrated the utility of this system by characterizing the C. elegans PKC1 gene (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This gene encodes a novel calcium-independent, diacylglycerol-activated PKC (nPKC) that is expressed exclusively in ∼75 sensory neurons and related interneurons. Another C. elegans nPKC (the product of the tpa-1 gene) has been characterized by Miwa and colleagues (35Tabuse Y. Sano T. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 36Sano T. Tabuse Y. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is thought that nPKCs mediate sustained, long-term, lipid-controlled signaling. In contrast, rapid (but transient) responses to many hormones/growth factors often require integration of signals carried by both lipids and calcium ions (1Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 2Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem.

Only classical PKCs (cPKCs, which correspond to the α, βI, βII, and γ isoforms in mammals) contain distinct binding sites for diacylglycerol and calcium. Concerted actions of the two activators promote translocation of cytoplasmic cPKCs to membranes and cytoskeleton and generate maximal levels of kinase activity (1Nishizuka Y.

J. 1992; 282: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that concerted lipid/calcium signaling is operative in C. elegans However, C. elegans cPKCs have not been characterized at the molecular level. Thus, to initiate investigations on functions and regulated expression of C. elegans cPKCs it is essential to clone and characterize relevant cDNAs and genes; discover mechanisms that govern the generation of cPKC diversity; identify cells in which the cPKC promoter(s) is/are active and cPKC polypeptides accumulate (to provide clues regarding isoform function in vivo); and characterize alterations in cPKC expression and intracellular localization during development. The Bristol N2 strain of C. elegans was grown at 20°C as described previously (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To synchronize C. elegans for developmental studies nematodes were hatched in the absence of nutrients and then transferred to plates containing Escherichia coli as a food source. Under these conditions, the worms develop synchronously into reproductive adults (39Wood W.B. Hecht R. Carr S. Vanderslice R. Wolf N. Hirsh D. Dev. Biol. 1980; 74: 446-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). L1 larvae were harvested 6 h after feeding, L2 larvae at 20 h, L3 larvae at 29 h, L4 larvae at 40 h, young adult worms at 53 h, and egg-laying adult nematodes at 75 h. A purified population of embryos was obtained by alkaline hypochlorite treatment of gravid C. elegans, as described by Sulston and Hodgkin (40Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 603-605Google Scholar). A cDNA that encodes a segment (residues 287-665, Fig. 1, A and B) of a novel C. elegans protein kinase C (named PKC2) was isolated from a complementary DNA library in bacteriophage λgt10, as described previously (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment (394 bp) was excised from the 5′-end of the cDNA (by digestion with EcoRI and NcoI) and used as a template to generate a random-primed, 32P-labeled probe. This probe was used to screen a C. elegans cDNA library in bacteriophage λZAP II (Clontech) as indicated in previous papers (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Fragments of C. elegans genomic DNA were generated by digestion with restriction endonucleases, fractionated in a 0.6% agarose gel, and transferred to a Nytran membrane as described previously (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Southern blot was probed with the 32P-labeled PKC2 cDNA (2 × 106 cpm/ml) described below. Conditions for hybridization, as well as high and low stringency washing of the membrane, are given in Hu and Rubin (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total C. elegans RNA was prepared as indicated in a previous paper (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was purified according to Sambrook et al. (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.R. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.26-7.29Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled, EcoRI fragment of PKC2 cDNA (nucleotides 885-2019, Fig. 1, A and B), which encodes the catalytic domain of the kinase, was used as a probe. PKC2 cDNAs and genomic DNA fragments containing the pkc-2 gene were subcloned into the plasmid pGEM7Z. DNA inserts were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure of Sanger et al. (44Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar) using T7, SP6, and custom oligonucleotide primers as described previously (38Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary DNAs corresponding to the 5′-terminal regions of PKC2 mRNAs were synthesized, amplified, cloned, and sequenced as detailed in Land et al. (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three rounds of amplification, via the polymerase chain reaction, were used to obtain PKC2 cDNAs. The 5′ primers were described previously (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial 3′ primer (5′-GCTCTAGATTATGCTGCTGGCGAGGATC-3′) contains the inverse complement of nucleotides 321-340 in the cDNA encoding PKC2 isoforms (Fig. 1A); the second 3′ primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGGTATCTACTCCTTTATCTGC-3′) contains the inverse complement of nucleotides 297-317 in PKC2 cDNA; the final 3′ primer (5′-GCTCTAGATGCGATTTGATTTCGTGAAT-3′) contains the inverse complement of nucleotides 123-142 in PKC2 cDNA. The first 8 nucleotides of each 3′ primer correspond to two irrelevant nucleotides and an XbaI recognition sequence (TCTAGA). Before the final round of cDNA amplification, primers and template were incubated at 100°C for 2 min and then annealed for 15 s at −70°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 70 mM KCl. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into the XbaI site of plasmid pGEM7Z and sequenced. Complementary DNAs encoded by three alternative 5′-terminal exons in the C. elegans pkc-2 gene were synthesized and cloned in pGEM7Z as described above (see Fig. 2 for sequences and nomenclature). Recombinant plasmids were linearized by digestion with PvuII and 32P-labeled antisense RNAs were synthesized by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (45Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisense RNAs for exons 1A, 1B, and 1C contain unique sequences of 122, 70, and 94 nucleotides, respectively, that are complementary to corresponding 5′ termini in subsets of PKC2 mRNAs. RNase protection analysis was performed with 20 μg of total RNA isolated from C. elegans at seven stages of development as described previously (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14820-14827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 729-bp HpaI-NcoI restriction fragment of PKC2 cDNA was subcloned into the pRSET-A expression plasmid (Invitrogen). This places cDNA encoding the calcium-binding region and part of the catalytic domain of PKC2 isoforms (residues 176-417, Fig. 1A) downstream from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and 42 codons that direct the synthesis of an N-terminal fusion peptide. The peptide contains a stretch of six consecutive His residues, which form a nickel binding domain. E. coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the expression plasmid and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 14 h at 22°C. The host bacterium contains a chromosomal copy of the phage T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the lac promoter. Bacteria were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described for previous studies (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PKC2 fusion protein was recovered in the pellet fraction. Recombinant PKC2 fusion protein was dissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl supplemented with 6 M urea and purified to near-homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography (in the presence of 6 M urea) as described previously (46Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When urea was eliminated by extensive dialysis against 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, the fusion protein remained soluble. Approximately 3 mg of highly-purified PKC2 fusion protein was obtained from a 500-ml culture of E. coli Samples of the PKC2 fusion protein were injected into rabbits (0.35-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of three booster injections) at Hazelton Corning Laboratories (Vienna, VA) for the generation of antisera. Serum was collected at 3-week intervals. Purified PKC2 fusion protein (0.7 mg) was coupled to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 resin (Bio-Rad), in 2 ml of 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 4°C for 4 h. Antiserum (2 ml) was adjusted to a final concentration of 20 mM MES buffer, pH 6.0, and mixed with the affinity resin for 2 h at room temperature. Next, the resin was packed into a column and washed with 20 mM MES, pH 6.0, containing 0.5 M NaCl until the flow-through reached an absorbance of zero at 280 nm. Bound IgGs were eluted with 3 ml of 0.5% acetic acid containing 0.15 M NaCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected into tubes containing sufficient 1 M Na2HPO4 to neutralize the acid and adjust the pH to 7.5. The IgG concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions containing IgGs were pooled and supplemented with 5 mg of albumin/mg of IgG. Subsequently, affinity purified IgGs were dialyzed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 50% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −20°C. Samples of proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in a 9% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (47Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylase (Mr = 97,000), transferrin (77,000), albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), and carbonic anhydrase (29,000) were used as standards for the estimation of Mr values. Cytosolic and particulate fractions of C. elegans and Sf9 cell homogenates were prepared as described previously (34Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of C. elegans proteins and polypeptides from Sf9 cells were blocked, incubated with antiserum (1:2000), and washed as described previously (48Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC2 isoforms were visualized by an indirect chemiluminescence procedure as previously reported (48Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2066857980,"T7 gene 5 DNA polymerase forms a complex with Escherichia coli thioredoxin (its processivity factor), and a 76-amino acid sequence (residues 258-334), unique to gene 5 protein, has been implicated in this interaction. We have examined the effect of amino acid substitution(s) in this region on T7 phage growth and on the interaction of the polymerase with thioredoxin. Among the mutations in gene 5, we found that a substitution of either Glu or Ala for Lys-302 yielded a protein that could not complement T7 phage lacking gene 5 (T7Delta5) to grow on E. coli having reduced thioredoxin levels. One triple mutant (K300E,K302E,K304E) could not support the growth of T7Delta5 even in wild type cells. This altered polymerase is stimulated 4-fold less by thioredoxin than is the wild type enzyme and the polymerase-thioredoxin complex has reduced processivity. The exonuclease activity of the altered polymerase is not stimulated to the same extent as that of the wild type enzyme by thioredoxin. The observed dissociation constant of the gene 5 protein K(300,302,304)E-thioredoxin complex is 7-fold higher than that of the wild type complex. The altered polymerase also has a lower binding affinity for double-stranded DNA."

Besides the duplicated nucleotide-binding motifs, EF-3 contains three blocks of lysine residues at the COOH-terminal end (23Sandbaken M. Lupisella J.A. Di Domenico B. Chakraburtty K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Of the last 57 residues of EF-3, 50% are charged. Of these, 40% are basic (24Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol.

Biophys. 1995; 32: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar). In this communication, we report the results of our studies defining the ribosome-binding domain of EF-3 using biochemical and molecular biological tools. All biochemical materials were obtained from standard sources as described in previous communications (11Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled ATP was obtained from Amersham Corp. TPCK-treated trypsin was obtained from Worthington; soybean trypsin inhibitor was from Sigma. The following buffers were used. Buffer A: 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; Buffer B: 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 50 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 3% (v/v) glycerol; Buffer C: 60 mM Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 5.0 mM Mg(OAc)2, 20 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM dithiothreitol; Buffer D: same as buffer B plus 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Buffer E: 60 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 50 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 2 mM spermidine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.008 trypsin inhibitory units/ml; Buffer F: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mM spermidine; Buffer G: 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl2, 600 mM KCl, 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; Buffer H: 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol; Buffer J: 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mM NH4Cl, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% (v/v) glycerol. Cell-free extracts (S-30), postribosomal supernatants (S-100), ribosomes, and ribosomal subunits from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were prepared essentially as described (11Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli ribosomes were prepared according to the procedures of Minks et al (27Minks M.A. Suryanarayana T. Subramanian A.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The concentrations of ribosomes and subunits were determined taking 1 A260 unit to be equivalent to 18.5 pmol of 80 S ribosomes, 24 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 56 pmol of 40 S subunits, and 27 pmol of 60 S subunits. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 10% gels as described (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 4°C for 4 h at 100 V using a Bio-Rad mini transblot unit. Proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were developed with polyclonal antibody to EF-3. 125I-Protein A was used as a secondary antibody for the detection of antibody cross-reacting materials (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). EF-3 was purified to homogeneity from an overexpressing yeast strain containing plasmid-borne YEF3 gene by a modified protocol of Kamath and Chakraburtty (22Kamath A. Chakraburtty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12596-12598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed purification protocol will be published elsewhere. EF-3 (0.6 mg/ml) in Buffer A was digested at 0°C with TPCK-treated trypsin at a EF-3/trypsin ratio of 125:1 (w/w). In experiments in which EF-3 was treated with trypsin in the presence of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits, EF-3 was preincubated at 30°C for 10 min in Buffer B with appropriate ribosomal preparations at a ribosome/EF-3 molar ratio of 2:1. The reaction mixtures were digested at 0°C with TPCK-treated trypsin at a EF-3/trypsin ratio of 10:1. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals as indicated in the figure legends, and reactions were terminated with 5-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (w/w) over trypsin. Samples were analyzed for ATPase activity in the presence and the absence of ribosomes according to our previously published protocol (11Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). GST-EF-3 fusion constructs were expressed in yeasts according to the protocols described elsewhere (30Mitchell D.A. Deschenes R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 3O. Kovalchuke, E. Pladies, and K. Chakraburtty, submitted for publication. Yeast vectors and the appropriate yeast strains for the expression of GST fusion protein were obtained from Dr. Robert Deschenes (University of Iowa, Iowa City). Truncated EF-3 protein was expressed as a GST fusion to facilitate separation from the wild type EF-3. Preparation of cell-free extracts and isolation of ribosomes were carried out as described.3 The GST-30-kDa fusion peptide was found to be stringently associated with the ribosomal fraction. Therefore, for the isolation of the fusion peptide, ribosomes (100 A260 units/ml) were incubated with 90 mM puromycin in Buffer F for 5 min at 30°C, and solid KCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 M, layered on top of a 33-ml continuous sucrose gradient (15-33%) in Buffer G. Gradients were centrifuged for 12 h at 131,000 × g in a SW 28 rotor. The fusion peptide was recovered from the top of the gradient, concentrated, and dialyzed four times for 1 h each against 250 ml of Buffer H. The dialyzed protein was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column (bed volume, 10 ml) preequilibrated with buffer H. After washing the column with 250 ml of Buffer H containing 150 mM NaCl, proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were eluted with Buffer H containing 20 mM glutathione. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed four times for 1 h each against 250 ml of Buffer J. Yeast ribosomes were incubated with increasing concentrations of the purified GST-30-kDa peptide in Buffer B at 30°C for 10 min. To detect ribosome-bound proteins, reaction mixtures were layered on top of 1-ml cushions of Buffer D containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and centrifuged for 1 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman Instruments TLA 100.2 rotor. Pelleted ribosomes were rinsed with the same buffer in order to remove loosely associated proteins. Ribosomal pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. The nucleotide hydrolytic activity of EF-3 was measured in standard assay conditions (12Kovalchuke O. Ziehler J. Chakraburtty K. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume of Buffer C for 5 min at 30°C. For the ribosome-stimulated EF-3 ATPase activity assays, 6.3 pmol of yeast 80 S ribosomes were included in the reaction mixtures in addition to the other components. The amount of 32Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP was measured according to standard protocol (11Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the functional domains of EF-3, highly purified protein was subjected to mild proteolysis. EF-3 was treated with TPCK-trypsin at 0°C and at a trypsin/EF-3 ratio of 1:125. Data presented in Fig. 1 show the time course of EF-3 fragmentation. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 1A) shows that EF-3 was degraded into two major fragments of approximate molecular mass 90 and 30 kDa. The 90-kDa fragment, designated as N peptide, appeared within 5 min of digestion and remained stable to further proteolysis up to 60 min. The 30-kDa fragment, designated as C1 peptide, was further degraded into smaller fragments during the course of digestion. The tryptic products generated were also visualized by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies raised against intact EF-3 protein (Fig. 1B). The two low molecular weight fragments having estimated molecular masses of 23 and 15 kDa (designated as C2 and C3 peptides, respectively) were generated from further degradation of the C1 peptide. Close examination of Fig. 1B revealed that the C1 peptide appeared at 5 min, after which the intensity of the fragment continued to diminish and was completely degraded after 20 min of digestion. The disappearance of fragment C1 followed the appearance of fragments C2 and C3. All three peptides disappeared by the end of 60 min of proteolysis. The effect of tryptic cleavage on the activity of EF-3 was followed by ATPase activity assays (Fig. 2). The time course of ATP hydrolysis revealed that about 75% of the intrinsic ATPase activity (ribosome-independent) of EF-3 was retained at the end of digestion (60 min). Ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity of EF-3 was rapidly inactivated within the first 10 min of reaction. The Western blot and the Coomassie Blue-stained gels show complete disappearance of intact EF-3 by 20 min of trypsin digestion (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 4-6). Therefore, the intrinsic ATPase activity observed at the end of digestion (60 min) is attributed to the N peptide and is not due to the presence of a residual amount of intact EF-3. In an attempt to identify the subdomain of EF-3 involved in direct interaction with ribosomes, we asked the question whether ribosomes will protect EF-3 from proteolytic cleavage and, if so, whether the protective effect is specific for yeast ribosomes. When EF-3 was treated with trypsin in the presence of ribosomes, the trypsin/EF-3 ratio was 1:10 compared with the ratio of 1:125 in the absence of ribosomes. The proteolytic products of EF-3 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by immunoblotting rather than by Coomassie Blue staining. This is to avoid interference by the ribosomal proteins in visualizing the tryptic fragments of EF-3. The concentration of trypsin used in these analyses has been shown to have minimal effect on the overall ribosomal conformation (32Gudkov A.T. Bubunenko M.G. Biochimie. 1989; 71: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results from the experiments on the protective effect of yeast ribosomes on the trypsinolysis of EF-3 are presented in Figs. 3, 4, 5. Data presented in Fig. 3 show the comparative proteolysis of EF-3 with trypsin in the absence and the presence of yeast 80 S ribosomes. The digestion pattern in the absence of ribosomes (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5) is identical to the one shown in Fig. 1. It is evident that the rate of EF-3 proteolysis was significantly slower in the presence of ribosomes. Much of EF-3 remained intact as judged from the intensities of the EF-3 bands (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-5). The two primary proteolytic products of EF-3 (N and C1 peptides) were protected from further degradation in the presence of ribosomes (Fig. 3B), and the protective effect was best seen for the C1 peptide. In the presence of ribosomes, C1 peptide was protected from further degradation, and hence the peptide accumulated during the time course of digestion (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-5). In the absence of ribosomes, C1 peptide was further degraded into C2 and C3 peptides (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-5). The molecular mass of the N peptide (90 kDa) remained unaltered either in the absence or in the presence of ribosomes (Fig. 3, A and B).Fig. 4Protection of EF-3 from tryptic degradation by yeast ribosomes and the subunits.

EF-3 was treated with trypsin in the presence of yeast 80 S ribosomes (lanes 3-7) or E. coli 70 S ribosomes (lanes 9-13) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots were taken at various time intervals and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

The positions of EF-3 and C1 peptide are indicated on the left Lane MW, molecular mass markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that the protective effect of yeast ribosomes on the C1 peptide is due to a direct physical association, ribosomes from the above reactions were isolated immediately after the termination of tryptic digestion. Immunoblot analyses of the ribosomal pellets showed that most of the C1 peptide remained associated with the 80 S ribosomes along with the undigested EF-3 (Fig. 3C, lanes 1-5). In contrast, the N peptide showed minimal binding and retention in the ribosomal fractions (compare the banding pattern in Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 1-5). We have previously demonstrated that, in heterologous translational systems, the requirement for EF-3 depends on the source of the 40 S subparticles (6Chakraburtty K. Kamath A. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we analyzed the protective effects of the 40 S and the 60 S subunits on the proteolysis of EF-3. The Western blot data presented in Fig. 4 indicate that both 40 S and 60 S subunits protected EF-3 from trypsin to the same extent (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 2-5) but showed differences in the protection of C1 peptide. In spite of the functional specificity of EF-3 for the 40 S subunits (6Chakraburtty K. Kamath A. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the C1 peptide appeared to be better protected by 60 S subunits (Fig. 4C, lanes 2-5). This, we assume, could be due to the higher binding affinity of EF-3 for the 60 S subparticles. Experimental data from the direct binding studies of EF-3 with ribosomes and subunits support this conclusion.3 In any case, intact 80 S ribosomes provided the maximum protection to EF-3 and to C1 peptide against trypsinolysis (Fig. 4D, lanes 2-5). The specificity of EF-3/ribosome interaction was further analyzed by comparing the tryptic digestion pattern of EF-3 in the presence of yeast 80 S and E. coli 70 S ribosomes. Data presented in Fig. 5A demonstrate that neither the yeast 80 S nor the E. coli 70 S ribosomal proteins were degraded significantly under the reaction conditions used in these analyses. EF-3 was extensively degraded in the presence of E. coli ribosomes (Fig. 5A, lanes 10-13, boxed area), whereas yeast 80 S ribosomes, as expected, protected EF-3 from proteolysis. Results of the immunoblot analyses presented in Fig. 5B substantiate the same conclusion. The C1 peptide appears to be somewhat protected by E. coli ribosomes (Fig. 5B, lanes 10-12). However, compared with 80 S ribosomes, the protective effect of E. coli 70 S ribosomes is insignificant. A molecular biological approach was taken to substantiate the experimental data obtained from the proteolytic cleavage analyses. For this, a construct was designed representing the C1 peptide containing all of the COOH-terminal basic amino acid residues of EF-3 including the three polylysine blocks (23Sandbaken M. Lupisella J.A. Di Domenico B. Chakraburtty K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This construct was designated as 30-kDa YEF3 The subcloned EF-3 fragment was expressed as a GST fusion in yeast in order to facilitate separation of the truncated protein from the chromosomally expressed wild type EF-3. Subcloning, overexpression, and purification of the GST-30-kDa fusion peptide will be described elsewhere. The localization of GST-C1 peptide in the cell-free extracts prepared from yeast overexpressing the fusion protein is shown in Fig. 6. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of two immunoreactive bands in the S-30 supernatant fraction. One of these bands has the molecular mass of 116 kDa, representing the wild type EF-3 protein. The second immunoreactive band has an approximate molecular mass of 52 kDa (22-kDa mass contributed by the GST peptide), representing the GST-C1 peptide (Fig. 6B, lane 2). The fusion peptide, like the wild type EF-3, remained associated with the ribosomal fraction (Fig. 6B, lane 4). The complete absence of fusion peptide in the postribosomal supernatant fraction (S-100) indicates that, in comparison with intact EF-3, GST-C1 peptide has high affinity for 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 6B, compare lanes 3 and 4). The stringent association of the fusion peptide with 80 S ribosomes can also be seen in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 3 and 4, boxed area). The GST protein expressed from the vector lacking the C1 peptide did not bind to yeast ribosomes (data not shown). Yeast cells overexpressing the GST-C1 peptide exhibited a slow growth phenotype (data not shown). We presume that a pool of ribosomes becomes unavailable for translation due to irreversible association of the fusion peptide to yeast ribosomes. The binding of the purified GST fusion peptide to yeast ribosomes is shown in Fig. 7. As a control, the binding of EF-3 to 80 S ribosomes was also included in these analyses. Increasing amounts of purified fusion peptide were incubated with yeast ribosomes. The presence of the fusion peptide in the reconstituted ribosomal fractions was detected by immunoblot analysis. As can be seen, much like intact EF-3 (Fig. 7B, lane 4), isolated 30-kDa-GST fusion peptide remained bound to yeast 80 S ribosomes (Fig. 7B, lanes 5-8). Biochemical and genetic investigations described in this communication provide evidence that the COOH-terminal end of EF-3 is involved in ribosome binding. Using proteolysis as a tool, we have demonstrated that the 116-kDa EF-3 protein is organized into two functional domains. The NH2 terminally derived large (90-kDa) subdomain of EF-3 containing the two ATP-binding cassettes is catalytically active in ribosome-independent functions. The COOH terminally derived small (30-kDa) domain retained the ribosome-binding activity. The NH2-terminal domain of EF-3 is relatively resistant to proteolysis, indicating that this part of the molecule may have a compact structural organization. On the other hand, the COOH terminally derived domain is relatively exposed and is further proteolyzed into smaller fragments. The NH2-terminal end of the N peptide is blocked and, therefore, it was not possible to obtain the sequence information for this peptide. Amino acid glutamine was identified as the NH2-terminal residue of the C1 peptide. A cleavage between residues 774 (Arg) and 775 (Gln) is consistent with the approximate molecular masses of the two peptides. Analyses of the C2 and C3 peptides (Fig. 1) indicate that all three peptides (C1, C2, and C3) contain glutamine at the NH2-terminal end (data not shown). The proposed primary trypsin cleavage site of EF-3 is shown below. The amino acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence data indicates that the COOH-terminal end of EF-3 is highly charged. Of the last 57 amino acid residues, 60% are charged. Of these, 40% are basic (23Sandbaken M. Lupisella J.A. Di Domenico B. Chakraburtty K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The positively charged lysine and arginine residues are organized in four distinct blocks as follows: RIEKKEDEEDKFDAMGNKIAGGKKKKKLSSAELR KKKKERMKKKKELGDAYVSSDEEF. The hydropathy test of this region of EF-3 suggests that the COOH-terminal end of the protein is exposed and, therefore, may interact with negatively charged molecules such as RNA and acidic ribosomal proteins (24Belfield G.P. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated a direct interaction between EF-3 and rRNA (26Kovalchuke O. Chakraburtty K. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 336-342PubMed Google Scholar). Site-specific mutational analyses are planned to identify the amino acid residues of EF-3 involved in the direct interaction with rRNA. A number of ribosomal proteins and translational factors are known to contact ribosomes through the COOH-terminal end (31Golden B.L. Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 33Hou Y. Yaskowiak E.S. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7038-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Yeh L.-C.C. Lee J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In that respect, yeast EF-3 seems to follow the same reaction mechanism. In the case of the bacterial elongation factor EF-G, the protein associates with ribosomes via the COOH-terminal Gln-495 and Gly-502 residues (33Hou Y. Yaskowiak E.S. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7038-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion or point mutations involving these amino acids severely affect the ribosome-dependent functions of bacterial EF-G (33Hou Y. Yaskowiak E.S. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7038-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basic amino acid residues in the COOH-terminal region of the yeast ribosomal protein L1 (34Yeh L.-C.C. Lee J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the bacterial ribosomal protein L6 (31Golden B.L. Ramakrishnan V. White S.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have been implicated as the binding sites for rRNA. In the case of yeast EF-3, the NTPase activity of the protein is enhanced 2 orders of magnitude by yeast ribosomes (6Chakraburtty K. Kamath A. Int. J. Biochem. 1988; 20: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to learn how information concerning the nucleotide-bound state of EF-3 is transmitted into its ribosome-binding domain (COOH-terminal domain) and its role in the conformational change of yeast ribosomes from the post- to the pretranslocational states during the peptide chain elongation reaction. An answer to this question is of fundamental importance since higher eukaryotes carry out this reaction in the absence of a physical homolog of yeast EF-3. We acknowledge the help of Dr. Liane Mende-Mueller of the Medical College of Wisconsin and Drs. Gary Davis and Carla Brini of Bayer Corporation for their help with the N-terminal analysis of EF-3 and the tryptic peptides; we are grateful to Dr. Karl Ziegelbauer of Bayer AG, Germany and Dr. Robert Tilton of Bayer Corporation, West Haven for many helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1966119926,"We have previously shown that prodynorphin gene expression was markedly increased in adult myocytes of BIO 14.6 cardiomyopathic hamsters and that nuclear protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in the induction of this opioid gene. Here we report that the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was significantly increased in resting and in KCl-depolarized cardiomyopathic myocytes compared with normal cells. In normal and in cardiomyopathic cells, KCl significantly increased prodynorphin mRNA levels and prodynorphin gene transcription. These effects were abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil. In control myocytes, the KCl-induced increase in prodynorphin mRNA expression was in part attenuated by chelerythrine or calphostin C, two selective PKC inhibitors. In these cells, KCl induced the translocation of PKC-alpha into the nucleus, increasing nuclear PKC activity. In resting cardiomyopathic myocytes, the increase in prodynorphin mRNA levels and gene transcription were significantly attenuated by the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxy-methylester being completely abolished when the chelating agent was administered in the presence of PKC inhibitors. KCl and the PKC activator 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol additively stimulated prodynorphin gene expression both in normal and in cardiomyopathic cells. Therefore, we conclude that PKC activation and intracellular Ca2+ overload may represent the two major signaling mechanisms involved in the induction of the prodynorphin gene in cardiomyopathic cells."

Western blotting analysis of rat and rabbit membrane fractions indicated that the antibody recognizes a 167-kDa protein expressed both in heart and in skeletal muscle (relative abundance: heart > slow muscle > fast muscle), but not in liver and kidney. The 167-kDa protein did not show altered electrophoretic mobility upon reduction and failed to bind several lectins, including wheat germ agglutinin.

Skeletal muscle is a specialized tissue converting chemical energy into mechanical work. For this reason, both the endo- and exosarcomeric compartments are equipped with a very well developed cytoskeleton, ensuring structural stability to the sarcomeres and to the myofibrils (1Waterman-Storer C.M. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise. 1991; 23: 1240-1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, skeletal muscle is equipped with a complex meshwork of skeletal muscle proteins, ensuring mechanical stability to the sarcolemma. Mechanical stress of membrane cytoskeletal actin filaments can be discharged to the extracellular matrix in at least two ways: the first is represented by the α- and β-dystroglycan complex, which binds dystrophin and actin-binding protein at the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma and merosin at the extracellular matrix side; the second is represented by vinculin (2Terracio L. Simpson D.G. Hilenski L. Carver W. Deker R.S. Vinson N. Borg T.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), talin, spectrin, and ankyrin localized to the costameres (3Tidball J.G. O'Halloran T. Burridge K. J.

In recent years, it has become clear that integrins play a major role in mediating interactions of muscle cells with the extracellular matrix and in muscle differentiation. Integrin receptors are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins composed of α- and β-subunits. Several isoforms of both α- and β-subunits have been characterized that are apparently expressed at different times in the process of muscle development (5Bozyczo D. Decker C. Muschler J. Horwitz A.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 72-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Studies of the β1-subunit revealed that it is localized to the myotendinous and neuromuscular junctions and to the costameres (6Damsky C.H. Knudsen K.A. Bradley D. Buck C.A. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1528-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Swadison S. Mayme R. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 257: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The importance of the structural role of β1-integrin was demonstrated in studies of Drosophila mutants lacking β1-subunit expression: the mutant showed an abnormal muscle tissue morphology, without proper organization of myofibers and the myotendineus junction (8Volk T. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Cell. 1990; 63: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Several integrins of the β1-subfamily have now been shown to play a role in muscle physiology during development, including α4β1 and its counter-receptor vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (9Rosen G.D.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In particular, the α5β1-integrin is involved in the adhesion of muscle to the extracellular matrix and has been shown to colocalize with dystrophin in the adhesion plaque-like structures of myoblasts and myotubes (16Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Boettiger D. Menko A.S. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 180-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This integrin connects the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton because it binds fibronectin outside the cell and talin and α-actinin inside the cell. It is also intriguing that integrin recognition motifs are also present in several intracellular muscle proteins, including the N terminus REDV sequence of dystrophin (17Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). To address the role of β1-integrins in muscle physiology, we carried out a screening of adult rat muscle tissues with a polyclonal antibody against the RGD-directed fibronectin receptor of Friend's erythroleukemia cells (α5β1-integrin). Unexpectedly, we detected a pattern of intracellular antigen distribution. Western blotting analysis indicated that the antibody recognized a 167-kDa protein expressed both in heart and in skeletal muscle, but not in liver and kidney. The 167-kDa protein is a peripheral membrane protein mostly associated with the luminal side of the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1 propanesulfonateIDAiminodiacetic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS3-(N) and, to a smaller extent, with the sarcolemma, while it is absent in the longitudinal tubules of the SR.

Partial protein sequences revealed a unique sequence that is not present in protein or DNA data bases, indicating that the 167-kDa protein is a novel muscle protein selectively localized to the SR. Indeed, rat fibroblast integrins were not recognized by either (i) a polyclonal antiserum against the peptide X-Leu-Gln-Val-Thr-Trp-Arg-Ile-Thr-Asn (the inner sequence of the 167-kDa protein) or (ii) the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum after affinity purification onto the 167-kDa protein. sarcoplasmic reticulum phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1 propanesulfonate iminodiacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3-(N) This study was carried out on male rats (albino Wistar) and rabbits (New Zealand) fed ad libitum with standard laboratory food and tap water. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the RGD-directed fibronectin receptor of Friend's murine erythroleukemia cells (α5β1-integrin) was prepared as described (18Bernardi P. Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An IgG fraction of the immune serum was prepared by protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and used in most of the experiments described in this study, as specified in the figure legends. This antibody has features similar to those of a previously described antibody (data not shown, but see Ref. 18Bernardi P. Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibodies reactive with the 167-kDa protein were purified from the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum by absorption onto immobilized 167-kDa protein obtained from two-dimensional gel separation and transfer onto nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose strips containing the 167-kDa protein were incubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline (0.15 M NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The nitrocellulose was washed three times with 0.15 M NaCl, once with 0.5 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20, and again three times with 0.15 M NaCl (5 min/wash). Antibodies reactive with the 167-kDa protein were detached by treatment with 0.2 M glycine, pH 2.8, for 30 s, and neutralized with 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8, to a final pH of 7.4 after transfer to a fresh test tube. A polyclonal antiserum against the peptide X-Leu-Gln-Val-Thr-Trp-Arg-Ile-Thr-Asn (Chiron Mimotopes Pty. Ltd.) (a 167-kDa protein internal sequence) was raised in New Zeland White rabbits by subcutaneous injections. For the first injection, we used 330 μg of peptide solubilized in PBS (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M Na2HPO4, and 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with Freund's complete adjuvant. Rabbits were boosted twice at ∼4-week intervals and six times at ∼2-week intervals with 330 μg of the peptide mixed 2:1 (v/v) with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Samples of soleus muscles were prepared from 3-4-month-old Wistar rats. Frozen sections (8-10 μm thick) were allowed to attach to glass slides treated with 2% gelatin in PBS. After saturation with preimmune serum for 30 min, the sections were incubated for 30 min with the antibody (50 μg/ml in PBS), washed thoroughly in PBS, and reacted with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. All incubations were carried out at room temperature. A membrane fraction from rat or rabbit fast-twitch muscle, kidney, and liver was prepared as follows. The minced tissues were passed in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a tight-fitting, rotating Teflon pestle in 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM imidazole, and 5 mM sodium EGTA, pH 7.0 (∼4 ml of solution were used per g of tissue). The homogenates were centrifuged at 6500 × gmax for 20 min in a refrigerated Sorvall RC5B centrifuge. The pellets were discarded, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 15,000 × gmax for 30 min. The supernatants were spun at 150,000 × gmax for 60 min in a Beckman L70 ultracentrifuge. The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in isolation buffer at ∼5 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Terminal cisternae from rabbit fast-twitch muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum were prepared by the following method. Briefly, 200-220 g of rabbit back and hind leg muscles were homogenized in 900 ml of 0.3 M sucrose and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, in a Waring blender for 2 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 7700 × gmax for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the homogenization and centrifugation steps were repeated for the pellet. The resulting supernatant was filtered through three layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 90 min in the Beckman ultracentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 2 M sucrose and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4; placed at the bottom of Ti-60 centrifuge tubes; and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 1.32, 1.11, 0.90, and 0.79 M sucrose in 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4 (5 ml/step). After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 90 min, the membranes banding at each interface were collected; diluted in 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4; and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min. Each pellet was resuspended in 0.3 M sucrose and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4; frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −80°C. The 0.79-0.90 M sucrose interface is enriched in T-tubules; the 0.90-1.11 M sucrose interface is enriched in longitudinal reticulum; the 1.11-1.32 M sucrose interface contains a mixture of longitudinal reticulum and terminal cisternae; and the 1.32-2 M sucrose interface is highly enriched in terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Triads were purified exactly as described (19Mitchell R.D. Palade P. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); resuspended in 0.3 M sucrose and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.1; frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −80°C. The isolation of the sarcolemma was carried out as described by Luise et al. (20Luise M. Presotto C. Senter L. Betto R. Ceoldo S. Furlan S. Salvatori S. Sabbadini R.A. Salviati G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 0.23 mM PMSF, 0.83 mM benzamidine, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM leupeptin, 0.7 mM pepstatin, and 76.8 nM aprotinin. For some experiments, a fraction enriched in the 167-kDa protein was prepared as follows. Rabbit slow-twitch (soleus) muscles (∼10 g) were homogenized using a Teflon-glass homogenizer in 50 ml of 20 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 0.3 M KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.0, for 20 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was homogenized in 40 ml of 5 mM histidine and 0.1 mM EGTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.6 M KCl, 5 mM histidine, 0.3 M sucrose, and 0.1 M EGTA and then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The final supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Terminal cisternae membrane fractions from rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle were prepared as described above. Approximately 200 mg of terminal cisterna membranes in 20 ml of 0.3 M sucrose and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, were diluted in 250 ml of 0.6 M NaCl, 20 mM Na2HPO4, and 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, and gently stirred at 4°C for 30 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 150,000 × gmax for 30 min. The resulting pellet, which was largely depleted of myosin, was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mM Na2HPO4 and 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4. After bringing the pH to 11.0 with 1 N NaOH, the suspension was gently stirred for 30 min at 4°C and ultracentrifuged as described above. The supernatant, which contained all of the 167-kDa protein, was brought to pH 7.4 with 1 N HCl, made 0.5 M in NaCl and 0.5% (w/v) in CHAPS, and further fractionated by chromatography on IDA-Zn2+-agarose (Sigma) as described below. Ten milliliters of IDA-Zn2+-agarose matrix were equilibrated with 10 volumes of acetate buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.5) followed by 5 volumes of 10 mM ZnCl2 in acetate buffer and by at least 10 volumes of acetate buffer to remove the excess zinc. After equilibration of the column with at least 20 volumes of binding buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM NaH2PO4, and 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, pH 7.4), the neutralized supernatant from the last centrifugation step (see above) was loaded onto the column, and the flow-through fraction was reapplied for five times. The flow-through fraction, which contained most of the 167-kDa protein, was dialyzed against 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM PMSF. A visible precipitate formed, which was collected by centrifugation and which contained the 167-kDa protein virtually free of sarcalumenin (see Fig. 4). SDS-PAGE (5-10% acrylamide continuous gradient gel, 50 μg of protein/lane) was carried out as described (23Leberer E. Timms B.G. Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10118-10124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Stains-all (Sigma) as described (24Cala E.S. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 265-275PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Federal Republic of Germany) for 4 h at 1 A with a Hoefer apparatus at 4°C (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Fozolon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose was stained with Ponceau Red (0.2%, w/v) in 3% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, photographed, destained in H2O, and finally blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% (v/v) defatted milk (blocking buffer). The blocking solution was discarded, and the nitrocellulose was incubated with (i) 10 μg/ml purified immune IgG, (ii) a 1:5 dilution of the polyclonal antiserum against the 167-kDa peptide, (iii) the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum after affinity purification onto the 167-kDa protein (see above), or (iv) a 1:100 dilution of anti-α5β1-integrin or irrelevant rabbit antiserum (see figure legends for details). The secondary antibody used was a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) or with peroxidase (Calbiochem) at the recommended dilution (1:20,000 and 1:5000, respectively) in blocking buffer. After removing the antibody solution, the blots were rinsed four times with Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 and finally developed with nitro blue tetrazolium or with Chemiluminescence (Boehringer Mannheim). Electrofocusing was carried out on 6% polyacrylamide capillary gels containing 2% Ampholine (Pharmacia Biotech AB; pH interval of 3.5-10). The second dimension was SDS-PAGE on 5-10% acrylamide continuous gradient slab gels. The proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a semidry apparatus (Hoefer) using a Towbin (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Fozolon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM glycine, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) methanol, and 2 mM dithiothreitol) for 1 h at ∼1.2 mA/cm2. The transferred protein was visualized on the membrane by a 5-min incubation in 0.1% (w/v) Serva blue R in 50% (v/v) methanol, followed by destaining in 70% (v/v) methanol for 5-10 min. The dried polyvinylidene difluoride membrane slices were cut into small pieces (∼1 mm2) and equilibrated for 1 h at room temperature in 10 μl of 1% (w/v) β-octyl glucopyranoside and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. Digestion was initiated by the addition of 1 μg of trypsin (Promega) in 1 μl of the same buffer and was carried out for 15 h at room temperature. Digestion was stopped by the addition 1 μl of 2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to the sample. The supernatant was collected; membrane pieces were washed twice with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; and each wash was pooled with the supernatant. The peptide mixture was resolved by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a capillary column (C18, 5 μm, 300 Å, 280 × 0.32 mm; LC Packings International, Zürich). The total flow was 3 μl/min, and the column was washed extensively with solvent system A (0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) before running a 60-min linear gradient from 0 to 70% solvent system B (80% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Peptides were collected directly onto trifluoroacetic acid-treated glass fiber discs that had been precoated with Polybrene. These were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 476A Protein Sequencer, with sequencing cycles being run according to standard protocols provided by the manufacturer. Normal rat kidney fibroblasts were grown to 90% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Poiesys, Padova, Italy) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 20 mM glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in a CO2 incubator. Cells in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks (Greiner) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then extracted on ice with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris/MOPS, pH 7.4, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.2 Mβ-octyl glucopyranoside (2 ml of extraction buffer/flask). After 20 min, the bottoms of the flasks were carefully scraped with a rubber policeman, and the extract was transferred to polypropylene test tubes. After a further 20 min on ice, the extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × gmax in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Samples were boiled with an equal volume of double-strength Laemmli gel sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) under nonreducing conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. To study the expression of β1-integrins in adult rat tissues, we screened a series of frozen sections with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the fibronectin receptor (α5β1-integrin) of Friend's erythroleukemia cells (18Bernardi P. Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No specific staining beyond the vascular compartment was seen in liver and kidney (data not shown), while a specific reaction was revealed with soleus muscle (Fig. 1) and with heart and extensor digitorum longus muscles (data not shown). It can be seen that besides the intense reactivity of endothelial cells in the capillaries surrounding the muscle fibers, the fluorescence displayed a clear reactivity with the muscle fibers themselves (Fig. 1B). A prominent banding pattern with periodicity of ∼1.3-1.5 μm could be observed, while no reactivity was detected with the secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1A). These experiments indicate that the antibody recognizes a muscle-specific antigen that appears to be expressed both in heart and in slow and fast skeletal muscle. The overall pattern of fluorescence distribution suggests, unexpectedly, that the antigen may be localized within either the T-tubules or the terminal cisternae. To identify the protein(s) responsible for the fluorescence labeling, a Western blot analysis of total membrane fractions from rat soleus muscle was carried out. Fig. 1C shows that the 167-kDa protein was recognized in rat soleus muscle (lane 1), but not in kidney (lane 2). As described above, the overall pattern of antigen expression in rat muscle suggested an intracellular distribution of the 167-kDa protein. This finding is strengthened by the fact that a protein of the same size was recognized by this rabbit antibody in rabbit muscles. Indeed, a 167-kDa protein was revealed in heart (lane 3), gastrocnemius (lane 4), soleus (lane 5), and psoas (lane 6) muscles from rabbit. The reaction with this protein was specific since an irrelevant rabbit antiserum gave no detectable signal (lanes 7-10), while the intensely stained band at ∼70 kDa was also detected by an irrelevant rabbit serum and is therefore not specific. Fig. 1D illustrates the pattern of distribution of the 167-kDa protein in rabbit tissues. The protein was detected in a total homogenate from skeletal muscle (lane 1), but not from liver (lane 2) or kidney (lane 3). The subcellular distribution of the 167-kDa protein in skeletal muscle was investigated further. It can be seen that the protein was not present in a cytosolic fraction (lane 4), while it was clearly detected in a total membrane fraction (lane 5), in purified sarcolemma (lane 6), and in the terminal cisternae of the SR (lane 7). This experiment clearly indicates that the 167-kDa protein is membrane-associated. To investigate the nature of the interactions of the 167-kDa protein with muscle membranes, a fraction enriched in terminal cisternae was exposed to increasing pH. The solubilized proteins and the membranes were then separated by either ultracentrifugation or filtration through 0.45-μm pore-sized filters, and each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with the anti-receptor antibody after transfer to nitrocellulose filters. Fig. 2 shows the Western blot of such an experiment. The 167-kDa protein was membrane-associated at pH lower than 9, was partially solubilized at pH 9, and was completely recovered in the soluble fraction at pH 10 or higher. These findings indicate that the 167-kDa protein is a peripheral membrane protein. To obtain information about its location, we subjected a terminal cisternae membrane fraction to controlled proteolysis with trypsin in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. After blocking the reaction by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor and boiling in SDS gel sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), Western blotting with the anti-receptor antibody was carried out after SDS-PAGE separation and transfer. Fig. 2B shows that the 167-kDa protein (arrow) could be digested by trypsin (lanes 3 and 4) only in the presence of detergent (lane 4) and that the detergent per se had no effect on the reactivity of the protein (lanes 1 and 2). In the molecular mass region of 165-170 kDa, SR terminal cisternae are enriched in two proteins, the 165-kDa sarcalumenin (22Leberer E. Charuk J.H.M. Clarke D.M. Green N.M. Zubrzycka-Gaarn E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3484-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leberer E. Timms B.G. Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10118-10124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 170-kDa histidine-rich protein (24Cala E.S. Scott B.T. Jones L.R. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 265-275PubMed Google Scholar, 25Picello E. Damiani E. Margreth A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows an SDS-PAGE separation of proteins from SR terminal cisternae, stained with Stains-all. Three polypeptides can be clearly identified in the 165-170-kDa range. Only the lower and higher molecular mass species underwent a metachromatic shift, while the intermediate-sized protein (arrow) maintained the original pink stain. Fig. 3B shows that the 167-kDa protein can be easily distinguished from histidine-rich protein and sarcalumenin on two-dimensional gels, owing to its slightly higher pI. We have further purified the 167-kDa protein from SR terminal cisternae by extraction at pH 11 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The extract, containing histidine-rich protein, sarcalumenin, and the 167-kDa protein (data not shown), was neutralized and further fractionated through an IDA-Zn2+-agarose column. As expected (26Porath J. Olin B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), sarcalumenin was recovered in the unbound fraction together with most of the 167-kDa protein, while histidine-rich protein remained bound to the column and could only be eluted with 0.1 M EDTA (data not shown). The flow-through fraction of the IDA-Zn2+-agarose column was finally dialyzed against 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM PMSF; and under these conditions, a precipitate formed that contained the 167-kDa protein, but not sarcalumenin, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3D) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 3C). Note that only one protein of 167 kDa could be identified, which did not undergo a color shift with the Stains-all dye (arrows). Western blotting of this preparation confirmed its identity to the 167-kDa protein (data not shown). We next used two-dimensional gel separation followed by transfer to nylon membranes for sequencing the N terminus of the 167-kDa protein, which yielded the sequence X-X-Phe-Gly-Tyr-Thr-Gly-Leu, and a trypsin cleavage fragment, which yielded the sequence X-Leu-Gln-Val-Thr-Trp-Arg-Ile-Thr-Asn. Surprisingly, these sequences did not match any known integrins or any sequence in the Swiss and EMBL data bases. These findings indicate that 167-kDa protein is a novel, muscle-specific protein of the SR terminal cisternae that has probably escaped attention so far because of its comigration with sarcalumenin. To understand the basis for its apparent cross-reactivity with the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum, we followed two strategies. In the first, we prepared rabbit antibodies against the synthetic peptide X-Leu-Gln-Val-Thr-Trp-Arg-Ile-Thr-Asn, modeled on the 167-kDa protein unique sequence. In the second, we used immobilized 167-kDa protein as an affinity matrix to purify specific antibodies from the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum. We then used the anti-peptide and affinity-purified antibodies to probe extracts from both rat 3T3 fibroblasts and a 167-kDa protein-containing muscle fraction in Western blots. Fig. 4A shows that while the anti-α5β1-integrin antiserum recognized both the β-integrin subunit of normal rat kidney fibroblasts (lane 1) and the 167-kDa protein in muscle (lane 2), the affinity-purified antibody failed to recognize β-integrin (lane 3), while, as expected, it still reacted with the 167-kDa protein (lane 4). Likewise, the anti-peptide antiserum recognized the 167-kDa protein in a membrane fraction from rabbit slow-twitch skeletal muscle (Fig. 4B, lane 2), but not β-integrin (lane 1). Note that a preimmune serum did not stain either β-integrin (lane 3) or the 167-kDa protein (lane 4). We must conclude that the 167-kDa protein and β-integrins are not antigenically related. The basis for the reactivity of our anti-integrin antiserum with the 167-kDa protein remains obscure. One possibility is that a protein related to the 167-kDa protein or an ∼140-kDa proteolytic product was present in the material used for immunization. Contamination by the “native” 167-kDa protein appears extremely unlikely because (i) the integrin was purified by sequential chromatographic steps on wheat germ agglutinin and DEAE-cellulose (neither of which binds the 167-kDa protein) prior to affinity chromatography on a fibronectin peptide and elution with GRGDSP (18Bernardi P. Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and (ii) only a single diffuse band of ∼140 kDa could be detected by silver staining after SDS-PAGE separation of the material used for immunization under reducing conditions (data not shown, but see Ref. 18Bernardi P. Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, integrin recognition motifs have been found in several intracellular muscle proteins, including the N-terminal REDV sequence of dystrophin (17Koenig M. Monaco A.P. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 219-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar), and in SR intraluminal proteins, as in the case of α2β1-integrin-calreticulin interactions (27Coppolino M. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Dedhar S. Wilkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The function of the 167-kDa protein remains to be elucidated and can only be a matter of speculation at present. Its muscle-specific expression and subcellular distribution, however, suggest a role in muscle cell physiology, which could be related to regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. Determination of the primary sequence of the 167-kDa protein is under way in our laboratories and should contribute to resolving the quest for its function."
