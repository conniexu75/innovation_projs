https://openalex.org/W2036259161,"Seventeen stratospherically collected particles-eight of which are classified as interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), seven of which are classified as probable terrestrial contaminants, and two of which have uncertain origins-were studied with a microprobe two-step laser mass spectrometer. Many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs) and their alkylated derivatives were identified in two of the eight IDPs. The PAHs observed include a high-mass envelope not found in meteorites or terrestrial contaminants and prominent odd-mass peaks suggestive of nitrogen-containing functional groups attached to aromatic chromophores. In addition, the complexity of the IDP mass spectra has no precedence in previous studies of meteorite samples or their acid residues. Extensive checks were performed to demonstrate that the PAH signals are not caused by terrestrial contaminants."

Seismic refraction results from 33°S indicate that these anomalies can be accounted for by variations in crustal thickness along a segment. The crust is thicker in the center and thinner at the end of the spreading segment, and these changes are attributable to variations in the thickness of layer 3. The results show that accretion is focused at a slow-spreading ridge, that axial valley depth reflects the thickness of the underlying crust, and that along-axis density variations should be considered in the interpretation of gravity data."
https://openalex.org/W2032823362,"The formation of high-quality thin films of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is important in many applications ranging from material reinforcement to molecular electronics. Laser ablation, a technique widely used to deposit a variety of inorganic materials, can also be used as a simple and highly versatile method for forming thin polymer films. The data presented show that PTFE films can be produced on various supports by the evaporation of a solid PTFE target with a pulsed ultraviolet laser. The composition of the ablation plume suggests that PTFE ablation and subsequent film formation occur by way of a laser-induced pyrolitic decomposition with subsequent repolymerization. The polymer films produced by this method are composed of amorphous and highly crystalline regions, the latter being predominantly in a chain-folded configuration with the molecular axis aligned parallel to the substrate surface."
https://openalex.org/W2055634916,"Submarine pillow basalts from Kilauea Volcano contain excess radiogenic argon-40 and give anomalously high potassium-argon ages. Glassy rims of pillows show a systematic increase in radiogenic argon-40 with depth, and a pillow from a depth of 2590 meters shows a decrease in radiogenic argon-40 inward from the pillow rim. The data indicate that the amount of excess radiogenic argon-40 is a direct function of both hydrostatic pressure and rate of cooling, and that many submarine basalts are not suitable for potassium-argon dating."
https://openalex.org/W2087926834,"Most carbon budgets require greening of the terrestrial biosphere as a sink for some of the excess carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuel burning and deforestation. Much of this storage is thought to occur in soils, but running counter to this conclusion is the observation that cultivation has reduced the agricultural reservoir of soil humus. Radiocarbon measurements in agricultural soils lend support to this browning of agricultural lands. Moreover, the loss is from the fast cycling portion of the humus."

https://openalex.org/W1990586212,Observational evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that large earthquakes excite the earth's natural wobble and produce the observed secular polar shift. Previous theoretical calculations based on elasticity theory and earthquake statistics had predicted a significant effect. There appear to be some premonitory signs of large earthquakes in the pole path.
https://openalex.org/W2017466972,"Shallow marine lime-mud sediments of the Ste. Genevieve Formation (Mississippian), in part of the Illinois Basin, underwent at least three diagenetic changes: (i) local dolomitization in seawater or a brine, producing dolostone having average δC13 of +2.5 per mille and δO18 of +1.9 per mille (versus PDB-1); (ii) more usually cementation of unreplaced CaCO3, in intrasediment seawater, yielding isotopically marine lime mudstone mainly composed of calcite, 4-micron or finer, with δO18 of from -1 to +1 per mille; (iii) later partial alteration of CaCO3 in permeable dolomitic rocks, by isotopically ""lighter"" waters, to calcite with an estimated δO18 of -10 per mille or less. Isotope data appraised by petrographic analysis thus suggest ""submarine"" cementation of these carbonates in shallow marine conditions."

Dislocation or growth planes were indicated. Incomplete exchange of potassium for barium produced zones with 20-angstrom periodicity, suggesting regular interstratification."

Therefore pyrethroid-like activity is not restricted to esters of cyclopropanecarboxylic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2069790522,"From comparison of theoretical and observed microwave brightness temperatures of Venus at 1.35 centimeters, the center of a water-vapor line, we obtain an upper limit of 0.8 percent for the water-vapor mixing ratio in the lower atmosphere. This limit is consistent with the amount of water vapor detected by Venera 4, the existence of aqueous ice clouds, and a greenhouse effect caused by water vapor and carbon dioxide. The computed spectra suggest that a sensitive procedure for detection of water vapor is examination of the wavelength region between I and 1.4 centimeters."
https://openalex.org/W2060574177,"Cross-correlation and cross-spectral methods are used in a laboratory modeling experiment to compute the drift velocity of a structure which undergoes internal rearrangement as it drifts in a uniform direction. Emphasis is placed on the problems of making such measurements in remote probing experiments, particularly in the study of irregularities in the solar wind plasma by radio star scintillation techniques, where the number of observing sites is limited to two or three."
https://openalex.org/W2012924208,"The Murray Fracture Zone is one of the principal east-west rifts in the crust of the northeast Pacific basin. As judged by bathymetric and magnetic surveys, the Murray approaches the Hawaiian Archipelago as a well-defined zone of ridges and troughs accompanied by strong, linear magnetic anomalies. It loses its topographic expression on encountering the Hawaiian Arch but can be traced magnetically to its intersection with the Hawaiian Ridge in the vicinity of Laysan Island (near 172 degrees W). All evidence tends to discount a previously suggested genetic relation between the Murray Fracture Zone and the Necker Ridge."

The project's surprise defeat has left them with few good alternatives. This article describes other high-energy physics projects being conducted, and projects to be constructed and carried out in the future. The loss of the SSC damages the United States' international reputation in high-energy physics, and the article concludes that the future for US high-energy research is bleak."
