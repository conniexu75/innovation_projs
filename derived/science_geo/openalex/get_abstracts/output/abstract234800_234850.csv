A rather exceptional resistance was shown by a strain of Nitrosomonas that was isolated from farmyard manure and in other respects appeared typical (oval rods, motile by means of a single polar flagellum, no growth in ordinary bacteriological media, no nitrite formation except from ammonia)."

https://openalex.org/W1983836453,"Simulium damnosum Theobald is a common biting fly in many parts of Africa and an important vector of human onchocerciasis. After the female has bitten a man, the blood in the hinder part of the insect's mid-intestine forms an approximately spherical mass, which, as Blacklock1 observed, retains its form when removed from the gut. During recent dissections, it was noticed that the blood was completely enclosed in a membrane which could not be detected in unfed flies. It was evidently produced by the wall of the mid-intestine during the blood-meal, and appeared to be a peritrophic membrane rather unlike those found in various other insects2. One of the membranes, removed from the insect, was sent to Dr. V. B. Wigglesworth, who examined it and found that it gave a positive chitosan test for chitin and confirmed that it was a peritrophic membrane. He also directed my attention to the presence of a peritrophic membrane in two other Nematocera, Anopheles maculipennis3 and Phlebotomus papatasii4. I have found one in Simulium griseicolle Becker."

https://openalex.org/W2089280809,"THE protein isolated from the pars neuralis of the pituitary by van Dyke et al.1 contains 1 I.U. per 61 µgm. Pressor, antidiuretic and oxytocic activities are present in constant amounts and in the same ratio found in crude posterior pituitary powder. This protein contains 4.3 per cent sulphur which appeared to be entirely in cystine. It seemed of interest to confirm the earlier conclusion that cystine is the only sulphur-containing amino-acid in the protein and to identify qualitatively as many amino-acids as possible."

https://openalex.org/W2033157403,"THE object of this note is to stress the importance of the microbiological factor in the afforestation schemes carried out so successfully by the Forestry Commission in such areas as the Culbin Sands. Through the help of Dr. Ovington, who supplied us with suitable samples, we were able to investigate the bacterial and mycological status of his quadrats in this area. For comparison with the open sand before thatching, we investigated the quadrat in the twenty-year-old tree area. Tables 1 and 2 give the results obtained for samples taken from these quadrats."

https://openalex.org/W2033352407,"THE very interesting nerve connexions of the taste-buds in the pig do not appear to have attracted attention. In this animal the taste-buds are almost entirely concentrated in the circumvallate papillæ, of which there is but one on each side. This is quite a large structure, about 0.5 cm. across, and contains about five hundred buds. In its base is a large ganglion containing nerve cells of two different types and obviously connected with the buds and the nearby glands of von Ebner which irrigate the vallum of the papilla. The nerve from this ganglion contains about three hundred and fifty fibres and constitutes rather more than half the total number of fibres making up the glossopharyngeal as it crosses the hyoid. The degenerative changes resulting when the nerve is cut at this level show that the fibres are the axons of the ganglion cells."

To my knowledge, no paper has presented data comparing the wetted and non-wetted cases."
