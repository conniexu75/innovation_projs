https://openalex.org/W2145750252,"The nucleoside analog 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) induced marked changes in the differentiated state of cultured mouse embryo cells and also inhibited the methylation of newly synthesized DNA. The DNA strand containing 5-aza-CR remained undermethylated in the round of DNA synthesis following analog incorporation. The extent of inhibition of DNA modification and induction of muscle cells in treated cultures were dependent on the 5-aza-CR concentration over a narrow dose range. Experiments with the restriction enzyme Hpa II, which is sensitive to cytosine methylation in the sequence CCGG, demonstrated that the DNA synthesized in 5-aza-CR-treated cultures was maximally undermethylated 48 hr after treatment. Three other analogs of cytidine, containing a modification in the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring [5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine(5-aza-CdR), pseudoisocytidine (psi ICR) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine(FCdR)] also induced the formation of muscle cells and inhibited DNA methylation. In contrast, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and 6-azacytidine (6-aza-CR) did not inhibit DNA methylation or induce muscle formation, whereas 5-6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (dH-aza-CR) was a poor inducer of muscle cells and a poor inhibitor of DNA methylation. These results provide experimental evidence for a role for DNA modification in differentiation, and suggest that cytidine analogs containing an altered 5 position perturb previously established methylation patterns to yield new cellular phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1973869185,"Cells of the inner layers of the epidermis contain small keratins (46-58K), whereas the cells of the outer layers contain large keratins (63-67K) in addition to small ones. The changes in keratin composition that take place within each cell during the course of its terminal differentiation result largely from changes in synthesis. Cultured epidermal cells resemble cells of the inner layers of the epidermis in synthesizing only small keratins. The cultured cells possess translatable mRNA only for small keratins, whereas mRNA extracted from whole epidermis can be translated into both large and small keratins. As no synthesis takes place in the outermost layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum), the keratins of this layer must be synthesized earlier, but in some cases they then become smaller: this presumably occurs by post-translational processing of the molecules during the final stages of differentiation. Stratified squamous epithelia of internal organs do not form a typical stratum corneum and do not make the large keratins characteristic of epidermis. Their keratins are also different from those of cultured keratinocytes, implying that they have embarked on an alternate route of terminal keratin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048137516,"The genes encoding human embryonic (ϵ), fetal (Gγ, Aγ) and adult (δ, β) β-like globin polypeptides were isolated as a set of overlapping cloned DNA fragments from bacteriophage λ libraries of high molecular weight (15–20 kb) chromosomal DNA. The 65 kb of DNA represented in these overlapping clones contains the genes for all five β-like polypeptides, including the embryonic ϵ-globin gene, for which the chromosomal location was previously unknown. All five genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand and are arranged in the order 5′-ϵ-(13.3 kb)-Gγ-(3.5 kb)-Aγ-(13.9 kb)-δ-(5.4 kb)-β-3′. Thus the genes are positioned on the chromosome in the order of their expression during development. In addition to the five known β-like globin genes, we have detected two other β-like globin sequences which do not correspond to known polypeptides. One of these sequences has been mapped to the Aγ-δ intergenic region while the other is located 6–9 kb 5′ to the ϵ gene. Cross hybridization experiments between the intergenic sequences of the gene cluster have revealed a nonglobin repeat sequence (∗) which is interspersed with the globin genes in the following manner: 5′-∗∗ϵ-∗Gγ-Aγ∗-∗∗δ-β∗-3′. Fine structure mapping of the region located 5′ to the δ-globin gene revealed two repeats with a maximum size of 400 bp, which are separated by approximately 700 bp of DNA not repeated within the cluster. Preliminary experiments indicate that this repeat family is also repeated many times in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1490688374,"Galactose-terminating ligands are specifically recognized by mammalian hepatocytes, internalized, and degraded within lysosomes. We have studied the effects of temperature on this process using 125I-asialofetuin and the perfused rat liver. Uptake and catabolism of 125I-asialofetuin continued but were progressively slowed as the temperature decreased from 35 degrees C to 20 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, lysosomal degradation completely stopped. Results of subcellular fractionation experiments and in situ electron microscopic autoradiography revealed that fusion between pinocytic vesicles and lysosomes did not occur below 20 degrees C, despite the continued endocytosis of 125I-asialofetuin and movement of pinocytic vesicles into the lysosome-Golgi region of the cell. Below 10 degrees C, endocytosis essentially stopped. Inhibition of the fusion step was reversed upon rewarming the liver to physiological temperature. By examining the reversal process the half-time for fusion between pinocytic vesicles and lysosomes was determined to be 7 min. This is the slowest metabolic event involved in the catabolism of asialofetuin by the liver both in the perfused organ and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2116947837,"The complete nucleotide sequence has been determined for the intron, its junctions and the flanking exon regions of the 21S rRNA gene in three genetically characterized strains differing by their ω alleles (ω+, ω− and ωn) and by their chloramphenicol-resistant mutations at the rib-1 locus. Comparison of these DNA sequences shows that: —ω+ differs from ω− and ωn by the presence of the intron (1143 bp), as well as by a second and unexpected mini-insert (66 bp) located 156 bp upstream within the exon, whose nature and functions are still unknown but whose striking palindromic structure may suggest a mitochondrial transposable element. —The two mutations C321R and C323R correspond to two different monosubstitutions, 56 bp apart in the ω− and ωn strains but separated by the intron in the ω+ strains. In relation to previous genetic results, a model is discussed assuming that the interactions of two different regions or genetic loci determine the chloramphenicol resistance, one of which contains the ωn mutations. —A long uninterrupted coding sequence able to specify a 235 amino acid polypeptide exists within the intron. This remarkable observation gives new insight into the origin of the mitochondrial introns and raises the question of the possible functions of intron-encoded polypeptides. Finally, sequence comparisons with evolutionarily distant organisms, showing that different rRNA introns are inserted at different positions of an otherwise highly conserved region of the gene, suggest a recent insertion of these introns and a mechanism for splicing after the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit."

It inhibits the tumor-induced motility of capillary endothelial cells as well as the spontaneous migration of other cell types.

Synthetic sulfonated glycosaminoglycans instilled intraluminally into bladders whose natural mucin layer has been removed are as effective as the natural mucin in preventing bacterial adherence. It also appears that adherence of calcium and protein is reduced in the presence of both the natural mucin layer and the synthetic sulfonated glycosaminoglycan sodium pentosanpolysulfate, suggesting that the antiadherence activity of both natural and synthetic surface glycosaminoglycans in the bladder extends to the molecular and ionic levels."

https://openalex.org/W1986529810,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis of α2M-protease complexes by normal human skin fibroblasts in culture was inhibited by the primary amines, methylamine and mono-dansylcadaverine. The latter was effective at a concentration two orders of magnitude lower than methylamine. Several observations indicated an intracellular mode of action of these amines, excluding interference with binding of α2M to the receptor. Inhibition of endocytosis was dissociated from lysosomotropic effects of these amines by kinetic analysis of endocytosis. As opposed to chloroquine and alkaline incubation conditions (pH 8.0), the amines reduced the maximal rate of endocytosis considerably, indicating a reduction in number of available receptors. This was confirmed by measuring binding at 4°C. Continuous recycling of receptors is indicated by the absence of down-regulation of number of receptors under conditions saturating for endocytosis of α2M complexes. We postulate that the primary amines, methylamine and mono-dansylcadaverine, interfere with the recycling of α2M receptors, while the chemical nature of the amines and the conditions under which inhibition becomes apparent point to the involvement of transglutaminase in this recycling."

https://openalex.org/W2065337493,"Abstract A dramatic stimulation of synthesis of flagellar proteins occurs in Chlamydomonas following flagellar removal or experimentally induced resorption of the flagella into the cell. In this report we show that this stimulation involves an increase in the levels of mRNAs for tubulin and many other flagellar proteins. Total RNA and poly(A) RNA were isolated from cells after deflagellation or flagellar resorption, and were then translated in the reticulocyte lysate system. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the translation products demonstrates that the RNA-directed in vitro synthesis of α and β tubulins, and a number of other flagellar proteins, increases after deflagellation or flagellar resorption. Surprisingly, the α-tubulin synthesized in vitro does not co-migrate on two-dimensional gels with mature flagellar α-tubulin. Moreover, in vivo labeling experiments show that the major α-tubulin synthesized in the cell after deflagellation co-migrates with the major α-tubulin made in vitro, not with the major α-tubulin present in the flagella. These results suggest that flagellar α-tubulin is synthesized as a precursor, and undergoes post-translational modification before assembly into the flagella. In addition, we report that the synthesis of tubulin and other flagellar proteins can be specifically inhibited, as well as stimulated. Treatment of cells with IBMX, which induces flagellar resorption, causes a marked decrease in the levels of translatable mRNAs for tubulin and other flagellar proteins, without affecting levels of mRNAs for nonflagellar proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2164291603,"Abstract We have taken advantage of the preferential digestion of active genes by DNAase I to investigate the chromosomal structure of embryonic and adult β-globin genes during erythropoiesis in chick embryos, and in particular to examine the question of hemoglobin switching during development. DNA in isolated red cell nuclei was mildly digested with DNAase I to about 10–15 kb, purified and restricted with a variety of restriction enzymes. The DNA was then separated on agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized with an adult-specific β-globin cDNA clone or a genomic clone containing the genes coding for both an embryonic and an adult β-globin chain. Preferential sensitivity of the respective globin genes was monitored by the disappearance of specific restriction bands after DNAase I digestion of nuclei. In embryonic red cells, both adult and embryonic β-globin genes are very sensitive to DNAase I; however, in adult erythroid lines, the embryonic β-globin gene becomes relatively more resistant but the adult gene remains highly sensitive. Controls showed that all globin genes were resistant to DNAase I in brain nuclei and nuclei from lymphoid cells. Thus the switch from embryonic to adult globin expression is associated with an apparent change in the chromosome structure of the embryonic globin gene as reflected in the gene becoming less accessible to DNAase I in adult red cell nuclei. Our results also show that the chromosomal structure of both adult and embryonic genes is altered in embryonic red cell nuclei; thus the nonexpressed globin gene (that is, the adult gene in embryonic red cells) has already been recognized to some degree and marked by the erythroid compartment. The sensitivity of the adult globin gene in embryonic cells may represent a pre-activation state of the chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W2032220787,Nerve processes and cell bodies containing leucine enkephalin were demonstrated in the sacral autonomic nucleus of the cat by immunocytochemical methods. Enkephalinergic preganglionic perikarya were seen only when axonal transport was blocked either by colchicine or by ventral root ligation. Ligation of the sacral ventral roots also produced damming of enkephalin immunoreactivity proximal to the S2 ligature. These data indicate that parasympathetic preganglionic neurons synthesize and transport enkephalin or enkephalin-like immunoreactive compounds to the periphery.
https://openalex.org/W2091092612,"Normal erythroid cells and both uninduced and induced erythroleukemia cells were stained with the leukemia-specific fluorescent probe merocyanine 540 and its analogs. The external membranes of normal intact cells bound the dye, but this general low-affinity binding was completely abolished by the addition of competing serum. In contrast, erythroleukemia cells bound the dye even in the presence of serum; binding was not affected by reversing the sign of the charge carried by MC540, but was abolished upon removal of certain hydrophobic side chains. When the erythroleukemia cells were induced to differentiate, the distribution of dye-binding regions was altered by the cell such that staining became localized to one region of the membrane. Concomitantly, conconavalin A binding sites were redistributed and became localized in the same region of the membrane as the merocyanine binding sites. Merocyanine 540 is thus shown to bind to a hematopoietic surface feature whose topological distribution is subject to cellular control during differentiation. This leukemia-specific marker may be one of several eliminated during enucleation of mammalian erythroid cells."

Isoenzymes in family B were free from carbohydrate, while those in family A were all glycoproteins. The carbohydrate moieties of family A isoenzymes were released from their polypeptide portions by hydrazinolysis and labeled by reduction with NaB[3H]4. The yield of total radioactive oligosaccharides indicated that family A isoenzymes all contain single asparagine-linked sugar chains in one molecule. The radioactive oligosaccharides were fractionated into one acidic and two neutral oligosaccharide fractions by paper electrophoresis and paper chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W2083133812,"RNAase P has been partially purified from three thermosensitive strains of E. coli and the thermal inactivation characteristics of each preparation have been determined. The RNAase P preparations from two of these mutant strains, ts241 and ts709, and the wild-type strain have been separated into RNA and protein components. Various mixtures of the reconstituted components have been checked in vitro for complementation of their thermal sensitivity properties. The protein component of RNAase P from ts241 and the RNA component of RNAase P from ts709, respectively, account for the thermal sensitivity of the RNAase P from the two strains. The amount of the RNA component of RNAase P is lower in ts709 than in ts241 or the wild-type parent, 4273. RNAase P partially purified from a revertant of the third mutant strain, A49, which maps at or near the ts241 mutation, has an altered charge when compared to the RNAase P from the parent strain, BF265. We conclude that mutations which affect either the protein or RNA component of RNAase P can confer thermal sensitivity on the enzyme both in vivo and in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2045091557,"In the hot plate test, substance P given intravenously at doses of 5 x 10-5 and 5 x 10-4 gram per kilogram caused analgesia, while lower doses caused hyperalgesia. The influence of substance P on nociception depended on the individual mouse's sensitivity to pain (control response latency). Analgesia was produced by substance P administered to mice with high sensitivity to thermic stimulation, whereas hyperalgesia occurred in mice whose control latencies were longer than normal. This result is interpreted as an indication that substance P is capable of normalizing responsiveness to pain and could be classified as a regulatory peptide."

We report a simple procedure for the isolation of pure (2'-5')(A)n synthetase from interferon-treated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The procedure involves differential precipitation of the ribosomal salt wash fraction with ammonium sulfate and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and CM-cellulose.

https://openalex.org/W1605867408,"Human plasm contains at least two distinct kininogens, designated high Mr and low Mr kininogens, that differ in their Mr and susceptibility to different kallikreins. By limited proteolysis, plasma kallikrein cleaves high Mr kininogen to liberate kinin and gives a molecule containing two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains. Following reduction and alkylation of the two-chain molecule, the heavy chain and the light chain were isolated, and antisera were raised in goats against the alkylated heavy and light chains. The anti-heavy chain antiserum immunoprecipitated both high Mr and low Mr kininogen, whereas the anti-light chain antiserum was specific for high Mr kininogen. Thus, the heavy chain of kinin-free high Mr kininogen and low Mr kininogen extensively share identical immunologic determinants. In contrast, the immunologic determinants of the isolated light chain are unique to high Mr kininogen. Using immunochemical techniques, it was shown that high Mr kininogen or the light chain derived from it forms a complex either with prekallikrein or with kallikrein. Titrations of prekallikrein or kallikrein with increasing amounts of either high Mr kininogen or its alkylated light chain indicated that the complexes contain equimolar amounts of each molecule. These results show that a single site for prekallikrein or kallikrein binding to high Mr kininogen resides in the light chain region of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W164470172,"Previous studies showed that the gene for RNA polymerase subunit alpha at 72 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome is co-transcribed with genes for ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) S11, S4, and L17, and probably S13. DNA sequence analysis of a deletion mutant has now established that the S13 gene is a part of the alpha operon and the gene order is promoter (P alpha), rpsM (S13), rpsK (S11), rpsD(S4), rpoA(alpha), and rplQ(L17). The DNA sequence extending 650 bases before S13 gene was determined. In vitro transcription experiments establish the probable location of the alpha promoter (P alpha) within this sequence. The start site is 94 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon (GUG) of the S13 gene. This promoter has features previously noted as common to E. coli promoters. However, comparison with four other sequenced promoters of r-protein operons shows no unique common features that might account for the common regulation of synthesis of r-proteins. This lack of sequence similarity in promoters of r-protein operons may be because r-protein synthesis is regulated at least partially at a post-transcriptional level."

https://openalex.org/W1987628611,"Two nonsecreting clones of MOPC 315 mouse myeloma cells were compared with a clone of the same cell line secreting λ light chains. All three clones synthesized λ chains but no detectable heavy chains. The two mutant clones which failed to secrete λ chains both synthesized an altered λ chain. The structural alterations were demonstrated by two independent methods for each mutant, and in each case were located in one peptide derived by cyanogen bromide cleavage. In one clone, the alteration was located in the N terminal 87 amino acids of the protein, and was thus present in the variable region of the light chain. In the other clone, the alteration was located between residues 88 and 175. Light chain precursors, and not mature light chains, were synthesized in a cell-free translation system from polyribosomes derived from each of the three cell lines. The structural alterations characteristic of the two mutant clones were also present on the λ chains synthesized in vitro. These results suggest that the mutant light chains were synthesized as precursor molecules and cleaved in vivo, and that the block in secretion occurred at some stage after precursor cleavage. For the MOPC 315 light chain, the synthesis and cleavage of a precursor polypeptide sequence may be necessary, but does not appear to be sufficient, for subsequent secretion of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W1561474484,"Treatment of HeLa cells with interferon results in the induction of an enzymatic activity designated 2'5'oligo(A) polymerase. The polymerase requires continuous presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for activity, since degradation of dsRNA abolishes synthesis of the oligomeric series pppA(2'p5'A)n. These oligonucleotides are formed initially at a constant rate with dimer synthesized faster than trimer, and the latter faster than tetramer. After 45 min, accumulation of the dimer declines whereas that of other oligomers still proceeds at a linear rate. These results suggest that an oligomer remains associated with the enzyme for possible consecutive additions of adenylate, since no significant accumulation of dimer precedes synthesis of trimer. The relative amounts of the different oligomers found at the end of a reaction may reflect an increasing probability of release as the oligomers are elongated. The accumulation of dimer, however, decreases when it becomes a substrate for adenylate addition; incorporation of isolated dimer into 2'5'-oligo(A) was directly shown. Other nucleotides with a blocked p5'A terminus, like A5'ppppp5'A and NADH, can serve as adenylate acceptors in the presence of dsRNA.

The binding isotherm of the spin label with AFP, as shown by a Scatchard plot, indicates the presence of a single high affinity binding site. The site-site relationship of the four endogenous ligands, arachidonate, bilirubin, docosahexaenoate, and palmitate, was determined by studying their effectiveness in competing for this anionic ligand binding site on AFP. Scatchard plots of the spin label in the presence of 1 to 3 molar equivalents of arachidonate, bilirubin, and docosahexaenoate and up to 6 molar equivalents of palmitate have been determined. The effectiveness of the four endogenous ligands in displacing the spin label from its primary binding site is bilirubin greater than or equal arachidonate approximately equal to docosahexaenoate greater than palmitate. These results indicate that polyunsaturated essential fatty acids and bilirubin share a high affinity binding site on AFP. We propose that the function of this anionic ligand binding site on AFP is for the transport of bilirubin and polyunsaturated fatty acids in fetal serum, as well as for the cross-placental transfer of this metabolite and of essential fatty acids."

As the concentration of ribonucleoside triphosphates in the reaction is decreased from 10 to 1 micro M, the extent of productive RNA chain initiation at these promoter sites drops precipitously at about 3 micro M. At 1 micro M substrate concentration, productive chain initiation from the A1 promoter does not occur even after extended incubation although the dinucleoside tetraphosphate pppApU is produced at a significant rate under these conditions. The reason for the inability of RNA polymerase to carry out productive RNA chain initiation at 1 micro M substrate concentration is not yet understood. The phenomenon is not due to substrate consumption, enzyme inactivation, or a requirement for a nucleoside triphosphatase activity in the reaction. The possibility is raised that there are additional nucleoside triphosphate binding sites on E. coli RNA polymerase which play some role in the process of productive RNA chain initiation."

Omission of leucine, phenylalanine, or arginine from the medium resulted in a rapid decrease in the incorporation of [3H]uridine into the acid-soluble pool and acid-insoluble material (RNA). Amino acid starvation inhibited the uptake of all ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides tested but did not affect the uptake of amino acids or glucose. In addition, under the conditions used, the omission of an amino acid did not result in a large decrease in amino acid incorporation into total protein. Treatment of cells with cycloheximide or emetine gave results similar to the effects of amino acid starvation, but in these experiments the inhibition of protein synthesis was essentially complete. Nucleotide pool sizes were also measured following amino acid starvation. ATP and UTP levels were essentially unchanged, but the dTTP pool size was decreased by 40%. The decrease in RNA synthesis in vivo in the absence of an essential amino acid was reflected in the endogenous RNA synthetic activity of isolated nuclei. However, when solubilized RNA polymerase activity was measured with calf thymus DNA as template, no significant difference was observed between control and amino acid-starved cells."
