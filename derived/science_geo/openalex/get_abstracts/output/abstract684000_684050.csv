https://openalex.org/W3212494403,"As a part of a larger qualitative study to understand HIV-risk factors and impacts on people living with HIV (PLHIV) (52 women and 40 men) in Belu and Yogyakarta, Indonesia, this paper reports the influences of cultural practices and religious beliefs on sexual relationships and behaviours of participants as contributors for HIV transmission. This study was conducted from June to December 2020. Data collection was conducted using one-one-one in-depth interviews. Participants were recruited using the snowball sampling technique. Data analysis was guided by a qualitative data analysis framework. The findings showed that cultural practices in Belu related to the use of bride wealth, managing spousal disputes, marriage, and condom use, influenced spousal relationships and sexual behaviours or practices which contributed to HIV transmission. Javanese cultural practices and expectation of an 'ideal wife', Islamic religious beliefs about expected husband-wife relationships, forbidden premarital sex, and the participants' individual interpretation of their religious beliefs about condom use spousal sexual relations, also influenced spousal sexual relations and behaviours, which supported HIV transmission among the participants. The findings indicate the need for HIV education programs that address cultural practices and religious beliefs for community members and population groups to enhance their understanding about HIV, condom use, and how cultural practices and religious beliefs play a role in HIV transmission. The findings also indicate the need for involvement of religious leaders in HIV education programs to bring insights to people and help them interpret their religious beliefs in health promoting ways. Future studies that explore different aspects of culture and religion which may contribute to HIV transmission are recommended."

The photonic-based radar technology is a promising candidate for delivering attractive applications to autonomous vehicles such as self-parking assistance, navigation, recognition of traffic environment, etc. Alternatively, microwave radars are not able to meet the demand of next-generation autonomous vehicles due to its limited bandwidth availability. Moreover, the performance of microwave radars is limited by atmospheric fluctuation which causes severe attenuation at higher frequencies. In this work, we have developed coherent-based frequency-modulated photonic radar to detect target locations with longer distance. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed photonic radar is investigated under the impact of various atmospheric weather conditions, particularly fog and rain. The reported results show the achievement of significant signal to noise ratio (SNR) and received power of reflected echoes from the target for the proposed photonic radar under the influence of bad weather conditions. Moreover, a conventional radar is designed to establish the effectiveness of the proposed photonic radar by considering similar parameters such as frequency and sweep time."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P . aeruginosa ) and Acinetobacter baumannii ( A . baumannii ) are common causes of NIs worldwide. The objective of this study is to determine antimicrobial resistance profiles and associated factors of Acinetobacter spp and P . aeruginosa NIs among hospitalized patients. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Dessie comprehensive specialized hospital, North-East Ethiopia, from February 1 to April 30, 2020. A total of 254 patients who were suspected of the bloodstream, urinary tract, or surgical site nosocomial infections were enrolled consecutively. Socio-demographic and other variables of interest were collected using a structured questionnaire. Specimens were collected and processed following standard microbiological procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 23 and p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Overall, 13% of patients had nosocomial Acinetobacte r spp and/or P . aeruginosa infections. The culture positivity rate was 16(6.3%) for Acinetobacte r spp and 18(7.1%) for P . aeruginosa . Patients admitted in the surgical ward (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR):10.66;95% confidence interval (CI):1.22–93.23), pediatric ward (AOR:14.37;95%CI:1.4–148.5), intensive care unit (AOR:41.93;95%CI:4.7–374.7) and orthopedics (AOR:52.21;95%CI:7.5–365) were significantly at risk to develop NIs compared to patients admitted in the medical ward. Patients who took more than two antimicrobial types at admission were 94% (AOR:0.06; 95% CI:0.004–0.84) times more protected from NIs compared to those who did not take any antimicrobial. About 81% of Acinetobacter spp and 83% of P . aeruginosa isolates were MDR. Amikacin and meropenem showed promising activity against Acinetobacter spp and P . aeruginosa isolates. Conclusion The high prevalence of MDR Acinetobacter spp and P . aeruginosa nosocomial isolates enforce treating of patients with NIs based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing results."
https://openalex.org/W3212340276,"China has set a goal to achieve peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. To achieve the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, China needs to address the challenge of the large and still growing CO2 emission base. This paper investigated the energy consumption and CO2 emission in Beijing from 2020-2035 based on the energy elasticity coefficient and contribution value of the sub-energy increment (CVSI) method. Beijing is one of the first cities in China to propose the ""carbon peak"" target as of 2020. From 2020 Beijing will strive to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. The results show that in 2035 the CO2 emission in Beijing may drop to 50% of 2020. This decline would be affected by economic growth, energy efficiency and the proportion of renewable energy use. Beijing's energy supply mainly comes from outside the region. Therefore, for Beijing, in addition to increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources outside the region, its own energy acceptance also needs to be strengthened, including strengthening energy storage construction, actively researching and promoting carbon capture and utilization of gas-fired units, which are effective ways to achieve carbon neutrality target."

Duration of diabetes, body mass index, serum HbA1c, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), APN, pentraxin 3 (PTX3), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and APN were measured and analyzed.One hundred and thirty-three participants were included. Compared to patients without diabetes, diabetic patients with DR had significantly elevated average serum APN levels (5.99±3.89 μg/ml versus 3.51±1.44 μg/ml, P = 0.002) and average AH APN levels (10.94±11.74 ng/ml versus 3.65±3.33 ng/ml, P<0.001). Serum APN was significantly correlated with AH APN (R = 0.512, P<0.001) and AH VEGF (R = 0.202, P = 0.020). The log serum APN was significantly correlated with intraocular cytokines, including log APN, log VEGF, log ICAM, log leptin, log PTX3, log PDGF, angiopoietin, C-reactive protein, and interleukins (IL)-5 and IL-10 (P<0.001, P = 0.020, P<0.001, P<0.001, P = 0.001, P<0.001, P = 0.008, P = 0.009, P<0.001, and P = 0.046, respectively). Log serum VEGF showed a significant correlation only with log AH VEGF (P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to evaluate the association of DR progression and cytokine concentrations; log Serum APN and log AH APN showed good correlation with the DR progression in each model.AH APN levels correlated well with DR development and progression. Serum APN could be a better marker for estimating intraocular cytokines, including both intraocular APN and VEGF concentrations in clinical field, than serum VEGF in DR patients."
https://openalex.org/W3214102989,"As a typical representative of tourism resources, the spatial distribution of A-level scenic spots has a profound impact on the layout of tourism industry. Scenic spot accessibility is also important for the development of tourism. However, the relationship of regional accessibility and spatial distribution of A-level scenic spots are understudied. The study used quantitative geography and geographic information system spatial analysis methods and analyzed the evolution of spatial distribution and regional accessibility of A-level scenic spots in Guangdong Province from 2001 to 2020. The results present the following: 1. Agglomeration distribution is the main distribution type of A-level scenic spots in Guangdong Province, and the spatial distribution is unbalanced. 2. From 2001 to 2020, the spatial distribution of A-level scenic spots in 21 prefecture-level cities of Guangdong Province has gradually developed from ""wide gap"" to ""relatively reasonable."" 3. Distribution density of A-level scenic spots in Guangdong Province has evolved into the main core area of high density. 4. Center of the gravity of A-level scenic spots in Guangdong Province developed from east to west during 2002-2007 and moved to the east after 2007. 5. Accessibility between A-level scenic spots and tourist source areas in Guangdong Province is good, with an evident aggregation phenomenon.

https://openalex.org/W3211708690,"We compared HbA1c values obtained from capillary blood collection kits versus venous whole blood collections in study participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.A total of 122 subjects, 64 with type 2 diabetes participating in the Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) Study and 58 with type 1 diabetes from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) Study, participated in the validation study. Capillary tubes were filled by fingerstick by the participants on the same day as the collection of venous whole blood samples in EDTA-containing test tubes and were mailed to the central laboratory. HbA1c in all samples was measured with the same high-performance liquid chromatography. GRADE participants also completed a questionnaire on the ease of performing capillary collections.Participants from 22 clinical centers (GRADE n = 5, EDIC n = 17) were between 35 and 86 years of age, with 52% male and diverse race/ethnicities. Venous HbA1c results ranged between 5.4-11.9% (35.5-106.6 mmol/mol) with corresponding capillary results ranging between 4.2-11.9% (22.4-106.6 mmol/mol). The venous and capillary results were highly correlated (R2 = 0.993) and 96.7% differed by ≤0.2% (2.2 mmol/mol). Of participants surveyed, 69% indicated that the instructions and collection were easy to follow and 97% felt the collection method would be easy to do at home.The capillary blood HbA1c results compared well with the conventional venous whole blood results. The capillary kits can be employed in other studies to reduce interruption of critical data collection and potentially to augment clinical care when in-person visits are not possible."
https://openalex.org/W3211803184,"Background Growth monitoring and promotion are the basic malnutrition preventive strategies usually used to assess the growth of children using anthropometric measurements in comparison with world health organization standards. However, the utilization of growth monitoring and promotion services is inadequate in most developing countries. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the utilization of growth monitoring and promotion service and associated factors among children aged 0-23-month in Banja District, Northwest Ethiopia, 2020. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2 to April 1, 2020. A total of 572 children were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.6 and analyzed using the statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25. Both binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses with a 95% confidence level were used to identify the associated factors. Statistical significance was set at p &lt;0.05. Results This finding revealed that the proportion of growth monitoring and promotion services utilization was 38.9% [95%CI: 34.8%, 43.0%]. Child age from 0-11 months [AOR = 4.98 (95% CI: 2.75,8.37)], mothers who can read and write Amharic language [AOR = 2.04 (95%CI: 1.02,4.08)], know the benefits of weighing their child monthly [AOR = 2.9 (95%CI: 1.23, 6.94)], presence of growth monitoring service nearby [AOR = 3.2 (95%CI: 1.59,6.31)] and monthly income ≥2000 Ethiopian birr [AOR = 1.75 (95% CI = 1.08, 3.02)] were some of the factors significantly associated with utilization of growth monitoring and promotion services. Conclusion and recommendation The findings indicate that utilization of growth monitoring and promotion services is mainly affected by child age, mother/caregiver ability to read and write Amharic language, having maternal information on the benefit of the weighing child, presence of service nearby health facility, and mother/caregiver monthly income. Preparation of growth monitoring charts in local language (Awigna) and creating awareness on the proper utilization of growth monitoring and promotion services is strongly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3212324819,"All approved coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in current use are safe, effective, and reduce the risk of severe illness. Although data on the immunological presentation of patients with COVID-19 is limited, increasing experimental evidence supports the significant contribution of B and T cells towards the resolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Despite the availability of several COVID-19 vaccines with high efficacy, more effective vaccines are still needed to protect against the new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Employing a comprehensive immunoinformatic prediction algorithm and leveraging the genetic closeness with SARS-CoV, we have predicted potential immune epitopes in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVs are main targets of antibody detection and have motivated us to design four multi-epitope vaccines which were based on our predicted B- and T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. The cardinal epitopes selected for the vaccine constructs are predicted to possess antigenic, non-allergenic, and cytokine-inducing properties. Additionally, some of the predicted epitopes have been experimentally validated in published papers. Furthermore, we used the C-ImmSim server to predict effective immune responses induced by the epitope-based vaccines. Taken together, the immune epitopes predicted in this study provide a platform for future experimental validations which may facilitate the development of effective vaccine candidates and epitope-based serological diagnostic assays."
https://openalex.org/W3213622876,"Current farm systems rely on the use of Plant Protection Products (PPP) to secure high productivity and control threats to the quality of the crops. However, PPP use may have considerable impacts on human health and the environment. A study protocol is presented aiming to determine the occurrence and levels of PPP residues in plants (crops), animals (livestock), humans and other non-target species (ecosystem representatives) for exposure modelling and impact assessment. To achieve this, we designed a cross-sectional study to compare conventional and organic farm systems across Europe. Environmental and biological samples were/are being/will be collected during the 2021 growing season, at 10 case study sites in Europe covering a range of climate zones and crops. An additional study site in Argentina will inform the impact of PPP use on growing soybean which is an important European protein-source in animal feed. We will study the impact of PPP mixtures using an integrated risk assessment methodology. The fate of PPP in environmental media (soil, water and air) and in the homes of farmers will be monitored. This will be complemented by biomonitoring to estimate PPP uptake by humans and farm animals (cow, goat, sheep and chicken), and by collection of samples from non-target species (earthworms, fish, aquatic and terrestrial macroinvertebrates, bats, and farm cats). We will use data on PPP residues in environmental and biological matrices to estimate exposures by modelling. These exposure estimates together with health and toxicity data will be used to predict the impact of PPP use on environment, plant, animal and human health. The outcome of this study will then be integrated with socio-economic information leading to an overall assessment used to identify transition pathways towards more sustainable plant protection and inform decision makers, practitioners and other stakeholders regarding farming practices and land use policy."
https://openalex.org/W3211625924,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O127 is encapsulated by a protective layer of polysaccharide made of the same strain specific O-antigen as the serotype lipopolysaccharide. Seven genes encoding capsule export functions comprise the group 4 capsule (gfc) operon. Genes gfcE, etk and etp encode homologs of the group 1 capsule secretion system but the upstream gfcABCD genes encode unknown functions specific to group 4 capsule export. We have developed an expression system for the large-scale production of the outer membrane protein GfcD. Contrary to annotations, we find that GfcD is a non-acylated integral membrane protein. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, light-scattering data, and the HHomp server suggested that GfcD is a monomeric β-barrel with 26 β-strands and an internal globular domain. We identified a set of novel protein-protein interactions between GfcB, GfcC, and GfcD, both in vivo and in vitro, and quantified the binding properties with isothermal calorimetry and biolayer interferometry. GfcC and GfcB form a high-affinity heterodimer with a KD near 100 nM. This heterodimer binds to GfcD (KD = 28 μM) significantly better than either GfcB or GfcC alone. These gfc proteins may form a complex at the outer membrane for group 4 capsule secretion or for a yet unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W3211895522,"The genus Ramicrusta (order Peyssonneliales) is a new record for Micronesia, with range expansions of Ramicrusta fujiiana and R . lateralis to Guam. In addition, four species ( Ramicrusta adjoulanensis , R . asanitensis , R . labtasiensis , and R . taogamensis ) are newly described from Guam using molecular and anatomical characters. Ramicrusta lateralis specimens from Guam share most anatomical features with the holotype description from Vanuatu, but the plants from Guam are more tightly adherent, rigid, and robust than those of Vanuatu. Ramicrusta adjoulanensis possesses a well-developed epithallus with frequent cell fusions, secondary pit connections, and lacking hair bases or trichocytes, similar to Ramicrusta bonairensis . Ramicrusta adjoulanensis differs from other Ramicrusta species in having occasionally free margins and being attached by frequently produced, relatively long rhizoids (75–100 μm long). Ramicrusta asanitensis shares features with many other species, but the thickness of the crust (upwards of 2 mm thick), heavy calcification in the epithallus, and the extent of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary growth, differentiate it from other Ramicrusta species. Ramicrusta labtasiensis shares features with its close relative Ramicrusta lateralis but possesses frequent, robust, and relatively long rhizoids (75–95 μm long) throughout its entire undersurface. Ramicrusta taogamensis resembles its close relative Ramicrusta appressa but is primarily distinguished by its generally well-developed epithallus with occasional secondary pit connections and cell fusions. The six species reported here make Guam equal to Vanuatu in currently having the highest known species richness of Ramicrusta in the world."
https://openalex.org/W3212053769,"There has been great interest in genetic risk prediction using risk scores in recent years, however, the utility of scores developed in European populations and later applied to non-European populations has not been successful. The goal of this study was to create a methylation risk score (MRS) for metabolic syndrome (MetS), demonstrating the utility of MRS across race groups using cross-sectional data from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN, N = 614 African Americans (AA)) and the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN, N = 995 European Americans (EA)). To demonstrate this, we first selected cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) sites measured on Illumina Methyl450 arrays previously reported to be significantly associated with MetS and/or component conditions in more than one race/ethnic group (CPT1A cg00574958, PHOSPHO1 cg02650017, ABCG1 cg06500161, SREBF1 cg11024682, SOCS3 cg18181703, TXNIP cg19693031). Second, we calculated the parameter estimates for the 6 CpGs in the HyperGEN data (AA) and used the beta estimates as weights to construct a MRS in HyperGEN (AA), which was validated in GOLDN (EA). We performed association analyses using logistic mixed models to test the association between the MRS and MetS, adjusting for covariates. Results showed the MRS was significantly associated with MetS in both populations. In summary, a MRS for MetS was a strong predictor for the condition across two race groups, suggesting MRS may be useful to examine metabolic disease risk or related complications across race/ethnic groups."

Quantitative data were collected to assess the provision of care and monitoring of health conditions in IVWEG through a survey that was self-completed by healthcare providers. Qualitative narrative data were collected to gain insight into IVWEG that seek care. We applied descriptive statistics, grouping analysis (GA) by hierarchical levels, and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Content analysis was applied to qualitative data.106 healthcare providers participated in the study, with the following characteristics: 94 (88.7%) females, 67 (63.2%) pardo race/color, 40 (37.7%) working in primary healthcare, and 49 (46.2%) nurses. In addition, 43 (40.6%) of the healthcare providers reported providing care to IVWEG. Among the providers, 89 (84%) had received training for assisting IVWEG. Additionally, 30 IVWEG were enrolled for interviews in the qualitative phase. The barriers to seeking care were language, distance to health units, and lack of money for transportation. The LAP proved to facilitate access to the health system by indigenous Venezuelans from the Warao ethnic group in Manaus. The study contributed to knowledge on a LAP addressed to IVWEG and helped improved their access to the health system, providing appropriate training for healthcare providers and other relevant actors by implementing a coherent and consistent public health policy at the local level."
https://openalex.org/W3213826048,"Due to the COVID-induced global collapse in demand for air travel, the year 2020 was a catastrophic one for the aviation industry. A dramatic drop in operating revenues along with continuing fixed expenses drained the cash reserves of airlines, with consequent risks of financial distress and, potentially, even of bankruptcy. Flag-carriers are a special group in the airline business-they are considered to have privileges in terms of the support given by governments while, on the other hand, are often viewed as having low efficiency and performance. This study aims to estimate for European airlines the interaction effect of being a flag-carrier (flagship) with the relationship between leverage, liquidity, profitability, and the degree of financial distress. Findings obtained from analysing 99 European airlines over a period of ten years, indicate that the negative influence of leverage on financial stability is higher in the case of flag carriers (flagship). The impact of liquidity and profitability on financial health is more positive for flagship than for non-flagship carriers. These findings are not limited to contributing to the existing literature, but also have significant practical implications for executives, managers, and policy makers in the European air transport sector."
https://openalex.org/W3165276026,"Numeracy is of critical importance for scholastic success and modern-day living, but the precise mechanisms that drive its development are poorly understood. Here we used novel experimental training methods to begin to investigate the role of symbols in the development of numeracy in preschool-aged children. We assigned pre-school children in the U.S. and Italy (N = 215; Mean age = 49.15 months) to play one of five versions of a computer-based numerical comparison game for two weeks. The different versions of the game were equated on basic features of gameplay and demands but systematically varied in numerical content. Critically, some versions included non-symbolic numerical comparisons only, while others combined non-symbolic numerical comparison with symbolic aids of various types. Before and after training we assessed four components of early numeracy: counting proficiency, non-symbolic numerical comparison, one-to-one correspondence, and arithmetic set transformation. We found that overall children showed improvement in most of these components after completing these short trainings. However, children trained on numerical comparisons with symbolic aids made larger gains on assessments of one-to-one correspondence and arithmetic transformation compared to children whose training involved non-symbolic numerical comparison only. Further exploratory analyses suggested that, although there were no major differences between children trained with verbal symbols (e.g., verbal counting) and non-verbal visuo-spatial symbols (i.e., abacus counting), the gains in one-to-one correspondence may have been driven by abacus training, while the gains in non-verbal arithmetic transformations may have been driven by verbal training. These results provide initial evidence that the introduction of symbols may contribute to the emergence of numeracy by enhancing the capacity for thinking about exact equality and the numerical effects of set transformations. More broadly, this study provides an empirical basis to motivate further focused study of the processes by which children's mastery of symbols influences children's developing mastery of numeracy."
https://openalex.org/W3212157625,"Non-invasive physiological monitoring can induce stress in laboratory animals. Sedation reduces the level of restraint required, thereby improving the validity of physiological signals measured. However, sedatives may alter physiological equilibrium introducing unintended bias and/or, masking the experimental outcomes of interest. We aimed to investigate the cardiorespiratory effects of four short-acting sedatives in juvenile guinea pigs.12 healthy, 38 (26-46) day-old Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs were included in this blinded, randomised, crossover design study. Animals were sedated by intramuscular injection using pre-established minimum effective doses of either alfaxalone (5 mg/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg), ketamine (30 mg/kg), or midazolam (2 mg/kg) administered in random order with a minimum washout period of 48 hours between agents. Sedative depth, a composite score comprised of five assessment criteria, was observed every 5-min from dosing until arousal. Physiological monitoring of cardiorespiratory status included measures of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and peripheral microvascular perfusion.Ketamine and alfaxalone were most effective in inducing stable sedation suitable for physiological monitoring, and diazepam less-so. Midazolam was unsuitable due to excessive hypersensitivity. All sedatives significantly increased heart rate above non-sedated control rates (P<0.0001), without altering blood pressure or microvascular perfusion. Alfaxalone and ketamine reduced respiratory rate relative to their control condition (P<0.0001, P = 0.05, respectively), but within normative ranges.Ketamine and alfaxalone are the most effective sedatives for inducing short duration, stable sedation with minimal cardiorespiratory depression in guinea pigs, while diazepam is less-so. However, alfaxalone is the most appropriate sedative for longitudinal studies requiring multiple physiological timepoints."
https://openalex.org/W3212455684,"The structural and functional brain characteristics associated with the excessive use of the internet have attracted substantial research attention in the past decade. In current study, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between internet addiction tendency (IAT) score and regional gray and white matter volumes (rGMVs and rWMVs) and brain activity during a WM task in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 1,154, mean age, 20.71 ± 1.78 years). We found a significant positive correlation between IAT score and gray matter volume (GMV) of right supramarginal gyrus (rSMG) and significant negative correlations with white matter volume (WMV) of right temporal lobe (sub-gyral and superior temporal gyrus), right sublobar area (extra-nuclear and lentiform nucleus), right cerebellar anterior lobe, cerebellar tonsil, right frontal lobe (inferior frontal gyrus and sub-gyral areas), and the pons. Also, IAT was significantly and positively correlated with brain activity in the default-mode network (DMN), medial frontal gyrus, medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex during a 2-back working memory (WM) task. Moreover, whole-brain analyses of rGMV showed significant effects of interaction between sex and the IAT scores in the area spreading around the left anterior insula and left lentiform. This interaction was moderated by positive correlation in women. These results indicate that IAT is associated with (a) increased GMV in rSMG, which is involved in phonological processing, (b) decreased WMV in areas of frontal, sublobar, and temporal lobes, which are involved in response inhibition, and (c) reduced task-induced deactivation of the DMN, indicative of altered attentional allocation."
https://openalex.org/W3213156732,"Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is an IgE-mediated allergic dermatitis in horses incited by salivary allergens from Culicoides spp. IBH does not occur in Iceland, as the causative agents are absent, however a high prevalence is seen in horses exported to Culicoides-rich environments.To study the natural course of sensitization to Culicoides allergens and identify the primary sensitizing allergen(s) in horses exported from Iceland utilizing a comprehensive panel of Culicoides recombinant (r-) allergens.IgE microarray profiling to 27 Culicoides r-allergens was conducted on 110 serological samples from horses imported to Switzerland from Iceland that subsequently developed IBH or remained healthy. Furthermore, a longitudinal study of 31 IBH horses determined IgE profiles the summer preceding first clinical signs of IBH (TIBH-1), the summer of first clinical signs (TIBH) and the following summer (TIBH+1). In a group of Icelandic horses residing in Sweden, effects of origin (born in Iceland or Sweden) and duration of IBH (<4 years, 4-7 years, >7 years) on Culicoides-specific IgE was evaluated. Sero-positivity rates and IgE levels were compared.At TIBH, horses were sensitized to a median of 11 r-allergens (range = 0-21), of which nine were major allergens. This was significantly higher than TIBH-1 (3, 0-16), as well as the healthy (1, 0-14) group. There was no significant increase between TIBH and TIBH+1(12, 0-23). IBH-affected horses exported from Iceland had a significantly higher degree of sensitization than those born in Europe, while duration of IBH did not significantly affect degree of sensitization.Significant sensitization is only detected in serum the year of first clinical signs of IBH. Horses become sensitized simultaneously to multiple Culicoides r-allergens, indicating that IgE-reactivity is due to co-sensitization rather than cross-reactivity between Culicoides allergens. Nine major first sensitizing r-allergens have been identified, which could be used for preventive allergen immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3213925469,"Parents' meaningful activities (occupations) and occupational balance are relevant to neonatal care. Valid and reliable self-reported measurement instruments are needed to assess parents' occupational balance and to evaluate occupational balance interventions in neonatal care. The aims of this study were to develop a self-reported questionnaire on occupational balance in informal caregivers (OBI-Care) and to examine its measurement properties including construct validity and internal consistency.A mixed method multicenter study design was employed. Items of the OBI-Care were created with parents of preterm infants based on qualitative research methods. Measurement properties were analyzed with quantitative data of parents of preterm infants. Construct validity was assessed by determining dimensionality, overall and item fit to a Rasch model, differential item functioning and threshold ordering. Internal consistency was examined by determining inter-item and item-total correlations, Cronbach's alpha and Rasch's person separation index. Fourteen parents participated in item creation. Measurement properties were explored in data of 304 parents. Twenty-two items, summarized in three subscales were compiled to the OBI-Care. Items showed an overall fit and except one item, an item fit to the Rasch model. There was no evidence of differential item functioning and all items displayed ordered thresholds. Each subscale had good values of person separation indices and Cronbach's alpha.The OBI-Care demonstrates construct validity and internal consistency and is thus a suitable measurement instrument to assess occupational balance of parents of preterm infants in neonatal care. OBI-Care is generic and can be applied in various health care settings."
https://openalex.org/W3214157295,"Objective To evaluate treatment satisfaction, disease outcomes, and perspectives of patients with poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with conventional synthetic, targeted synthetic, or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), we conducted a subgroup (post hoc) analysis of Japanese patients participating in the SENSE study. Methods Data for Japanese patients (n/N = 118/1629) from the global, multicenter, cross-sectional, observational SENSE study were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the global satisfaction subscore assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) version 1.4. Other patient-reported outcomes included self-reported RA medication adherence and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-RA. Patient perspectives included patients’ expectations and preference of pharmacologic treatment. Results Median (range) age and RA disease duration were 67.0 (18.0–87.0) years and 8 (0.0-54) years, respectively; 81.4% of patients were female. Mean (SD) TSQM global satisfaction subscore was 56.8 (17.5), and only 5.9% of patients reported good satisfaction with treatment (TSQM global ≥80). Mean (SD) self-reported treatment adherence using VAS was high (93.5% [13.8%]). Mean (SD) total work productivity impairment was 45.6% (32.0%); presenteeism contributed toward more total work productivity impairment (43.9% [30.4%]) than absenteeism (8.3% [24.4%]). Patients expected improvement in all parameters from their treatment, especially improvement in joint symptoms. Most patients (80.7%) preferred oral medication and 18.7% preferred monotherapy. Patient acceptability of potentially manageable side effects was high (7.5%-34.0%). Although most patients (81.3%) found combination therapy acceptable, 43.2% were receiving DMARD monotherapy. Conclusion Although most Japanese patients with RA with moderate-to-high disease activity were dissatisfied with their current DMARD treatment, high treatment adherence, high acceptability of combination therapy, high acceptability of manageable potential side effects, and preference for oral medication were reported. Data support the development of a more individualized and patient-centric approach for RA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3211482109,"Short response time for order processing is important for modern warehouses, which can be potentially achieved by adopting appropriate processing policy. The parallel processing policy have advantages in improving performance of many autonomous storage and retrieval systems. However, researchers tend to assume a sequential processing policy managing the movement of independent resources in shuttle-based compact storage systems. This paper models and analyses a single-tier of specialized shuttle-based compact storage systems under parallel processing policy. The system is modeled as a semi-open queueing network with class switching and the parallel movement of shuttles and the transfer car is modeled using a fork-join queueing network. The analytical model is validated against simulations and the results show our model can accurately estimate the system performance. Numerical experiments and a real case are carried out to compare the performance of parallel and sequential processing policies. The results suggest a critical transaction arrival rate and depth/width ratio, below which the sequential processing policy outperforms the parallel processing policy. However, the advantage of sequential processing policy is decreasing with the increasing of shuttle number, transaction arrival rate and depth/width ratio. The results also suggest an optimal depth/width ratio with a value of 1.75 for minimizing the expected throughput time in the real system. Given the current system configurations, the parallel processing policy should be considered when the number of shuttles is larger than 2 or the transaction arrival rate is larger than 24 per hour."
https://openalex.org/W3211506472,"Mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are bioactive particles that evoke beneficial responses in recipient cells. We identified a role for MSC-EV in immune modulation and cellular salvage in a model of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung injury (ALI) using pulmonary epithelial cells and exposure to cytokines or the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Whereas RBD or cytokine exposure caused a pro-inflammatory cellular environment and injurious signaling, impairing alveolar-capillary barrier function, and inducing cell death, MSC-EVs reduced inflammation and reestablished target cell health. Importantly, MSC-EV treatment increased active ACE2 surface protein compared to RBD injury, identifying a previously unknown role for MSC-EV treatment in COVID-19 signaling and pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of MSC-EV treatment was confirmed in an LPS-induced rat model of ALI wherein MSC-EVs reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and respiratory dysfunction associated with disease. MSC-EV administration was dose-responsive, demonstrating a large effective dose range for clinical translation. These data provide direct evidence of an MSC-EV-mediated improvement in ALI and contribute new insights into the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in COVID-19 or similar pathologies of respiratory distress."

Owing to the increase in the use of lenses, whether for medical or cosmetic purposes, the incidence of disease increases every year. Contamination of the lenses with the Acanthamoeba trophozoites or cysts may lead to eye infection and cause sight-threatening keratitis in human. We isolated Acanthamoeba spp. from new lenses, used lenses, and contact lens disinfecting solutions and identified them based on morphological characteristics and molecular test.New and used lenses and contact lens disinfecting solutions were cultured on monogenic media. Light and scanning electron microscope was used to identify Acanthamoeba spp. morphological features. Genotype identification was also evaluated using PCR sequencing of 18S rRNA gene specific primer pair JDP1 and JDP2.A hundred samples were examined, 29 (29%) were infected with Acanthamoeba spp. That belonged to two strains of Acanthamoeba (Acanthamoeba 41 and Acanthamoeba 68). 18S rRNA of the Acanthamoeba 41 had 99.69% sequence identity to Acanthamoeba castellanii clone HDU-JUMS-2, whereas Acanthamoeba 68 had 99.74% similar pattern to that of Acanthamoeba sp. isolate T4 clone ac2t4 that are morphologically identified as Acanthamoeba polyphaga. The obtained data revealed that the isolated strains belong to T4 genotype that was evolutionarily similar to strains isolated in Iran.Cosmetic lenses and disinfectant solutions are a major transmissible mode for infection. This genotype is common as the cause of Acanthamoeba keratitis. To avoid infection, care must be taken to clean the lenses and their preservative solutions and prevent contamination with the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W3211778614,"Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) regulate the biological processes of human diseases by genetic code expansion and cellular pathophysiology regulation; however, system-wide changes in PTM levels in the intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) brain remain poorly understood. Succinylation refers to a major PTM during the regulation of multiple biological processes. In this study, according to the methods of quantitative succinyllysine proteomics based on high-resolution mass spectrometry, we investigated ICH-associated brain protein succinyllysine modifications and obtained 3,680 succinylated sites and quantified around 3,530 sites. Among them, 25 succinyllysine sites on 23 proteins were upregulated (hypersuccinylated), whereas 13 succinyllysine sites on 12 proteins were downregulated (hyposuccinylated) following ICH. The cell component enrichment analysis of these succinylproteins with significant changes showed that 58.3% of the hyposuccinylated proteins were observed in the mitochondria, while the hyper-succinylproteins located in mitochondria decreased in the percentage to about 35% in ICH brains with a concomitant increase in the percentage of cytoplasm to 30.4%. Further bioinformatic analysis showed that the succinylproteins were mostly mitochondria and synapse-related subcellular located and involved in many pathophysiological processes, like metabolism, synapse working, and ferroptosis. Moreover, the integrative analysis of our succinylproteomics data and previously published transcriptome data showed that the mRNAs matched by most differentially succinylated proteins were especially highly expressed in neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes. Our study uncovers some succinylation-affected processes and pathways in response to ICH brains and gives us novel insights into understanding pathophysiological processes of brain injury caused by ICH."

Although these modern devices offer many opportunities, e.g. communication and research online, an in-depth understanding of how these devices affect our health, is lacking. Before a definite randomized controlled trial, the SCREENS pilot study was conducted to assess compliance to and feasibility of two interventions, a measurement protocol, and a survey-based recruitment strategy. Also, the potential of the interventions to impact leisure time spent non-sedentary in children six-to-ten years of age was explored.Families (N = 12) were recruited through a population-based survey sent out in October of 2018 to adults (N = 1,675) in the Municipality of Middelfart, Denmark. Families were randomized to one of two two-week interventions; an Evening Restriction intervention (no screen media use after six pm) and a General Restrict intervention (limit entertainment-based screen media to three hours/week/person). Intervention compliance was assessed objectively by measuring household TV usage, smartphone and tablet activity via an application, and via screen media diaries. During baseline and follow-up, as part of larger protocol, family members wore two triaxial accelerometers for seven consecutive days. The potential of the interventions to impact non-sedentary time was explored based on means and standard errors (SEs).Despite almost 85% and 75% reductions in leisure screen media use 0% and 50% of families were compliant in the Evening Restrict group and General Restrict group, respectively, based on strict a priori criteria. Participant feedback indicated that the General Restrict intervention generally was feasibly. Compliance to the accelerometry wear protocol was high (median non-wear was <1 hour/week). Moreover, the recruitment strategy was implemented and was feasible. The General restrict intervention might increase children's non-sedentary time (mean (SE): 36.6 (23) min/day, N = 6).The General Restriction intervention, the accelerometer wear protocol and recruitment strategy, appeared feasible.NCT03788525 at https://clinicaltrials.gov [Retrospectively registered; 27th of December, 2018]."
https://openalex.org/W3212610203,"Local support is critical to the success and longevity of fishery management initiatives. Previous research suggests that how resource users perceive ecological changes, explain them, and cope with them, influences local support. The objectives of this study were two-fold. First, we collated local fishers’ knowledge to characterize the long-term socio-ecological dynamics of the small-scale fishery of Sainte-Marie Island, in Madagascar. Second, we empirically assessed the individual- and site-level factors influencing support for fishery restrictions. Our results indicate that fishers observed a decline in fish abundance and catch sizes, especially in nearshore areas; many also perceived a reduction in fish sizes and the local disappearance of species. To maintain their catches, most fishers adapted by fishing harder and further offshore. Accordingly, fishers identified increased fishing effort (number of fishers and gear evolution) as the main cause of fishery changes. Collectively, our results highlight that the transition from a subsistence to commercial fishery, and resulting changes in the relationship between people and the fisheries, was an underlying driver of fishery changes. Additionally, we found that gender, membership to local associations, coping mechanisms, and perceptions of ecological health, were all interlinked and significantly associated with conservation-oriented attitudes. Conservation-oriented attitudes, however, were not associated with fishers’ willingness to decrease fishing. In the short-term, area-based restrictions could contribute to building support for conservation. In the long-term, addressing the underlying causes of the decline will necessitate collaborations among the various groups involved to progressively build livelihood flexibility. Collectively, our study provides additional insights on the individual- and site-level factors influencing support for fishery restrictions. It also highlights the importance of dialoguing with fishers to ensure that fishery management plans are adapted to the local context."
https://openalex.org/W3212984194,"The emergence of a pandemic is usually accompanied by different measures-economic, social, preventive, and (self)protective. In the case of the COVID-19, several preventive measures were formally enforced by state authorities in the majority of countries worldwide. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the intertwining of formal and informal social control could be observed. Hence, in this study a cross-sectional design was chosen to explore the issue in Slovenia. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first in the current literature to empirically test the general deterrence theory in pandemic circumstances (as external factors predicting individuals' compliance with the COVID-19 preventive measures). The results suggest an important role of informal punishment, with perceived informal severity being the only statistically significant factor from the general deterrence theory. In contrast to external factors, internal factors play a significantly greater role in promoting people's self-protective behavior in pandemic circumstances. During the unknown, the uncertain and delicate situations with which people have no previous experience, both personal beliefs about the effectiveness of measures and perceived self-efficacy are more important than fear of formal sanctions."
https://openalex.org/W3213190469,"To clarify whether the relaxation period during stretching affects the degree of elevated shear rate and the degree of reduction of arterial stiffness, we examined relaxation duration to build an adequate stretching protocol. In Experiment 1, the changes in cardiac output, the shear rate in the posterior tibial artery, and blood volume in the calf muscle were measured during recovery (0-60 s) from a single bout of one-legged passive calf stretching in 12 healthy young men. In Experiment 2, the effects of different relaxation periods (5-, 10-, 20-, and 60-s) of passive one-legged intermittent calf stretching (30-s × 6 sets) on the femoral-ankle pulse wave velocity (faPWV) as an index of peripheral arterial stiffness were identified in 17 healthy young men. As a result, the stretched leg's shear rate significantly increased from 0 to 10th s after stretching. The muscle blood volume in the stretched leg significantly reduced during stretching, and then significantly increased during the recovery period after stretching; however, cardiac output remained unchanged during stretching and recovery. Additionally, the reduction in faPWV from the pre-stretching value in the stretched leg was significantly larger in the protocol with 10-s and 20-s relaxation periods than that in the non-stretched leg, but this did not differ in the 5-s and 60-s relaxation periods. These findings suggest that the relaxation periods of intermittent static stretching that cause a high transient increase in shear rate (via reperfusion after microvascular compression by the stretched calf muscles) are effective to reduce arterial stiffness."

Four to nine choriocapillaris en face images were registered and averaged. The averaged images were then binarized and analyzed.The averaged choriocapillaris images showed a continuous capillary meshwork, whereas the unaveraged images had a granular appearance. The mean total area and size of flow voids were 0.99 ± 0.20 mm2 and 567.8 ± 201.5 μm2, respectively, and these values correlated positively with age (p = 0.002, R = 0.336 and p = 0.026, R = 0.247, respectively). Age-related gains in the mean total area and flow void size were 4.20 × 10-3 mm2 and 3.07 μm2 per year, respectively. However, the mean total area and flow void size had no significant correlation with axial length, subfoveal choroidal thickness, or sex.Multiple averaged en face swept source optical coherence tomography angiography is more effective than a single optical coherence tomography angiography scan for better visualizing the choriocapillaris. The total area and size of flow voids within a 3 × 3-mm macular area positively correlated with age. This technique can be useful for investigating the changes arising in macular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3212043299,"Apolipoprotein E E4 (APOE4) is a risk factor for cognitive decline. A high blood vitamin C (VC) level reduces APOE4-associated risk of developing cognitive decline in women. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effects of functional variants of VC transporter genes expressed in the brain ( SLC2A1 , SLC2A3 , and SLC23A2 ) on APOE4-associated risk of developing cognitive decline. This case–control study involved 393 Japanese subjects: 252 cognitively normal and 141 cognitively impaired individuals (87 mild cognitive impairment and 54 dementia). Database searches revealed that rs1279683 of SLC23A2 , and rs710218 and rs841851 of SLC2A1 are functional variants that are significantly associated with the altered expression of the respective genes and genotyped as three single nucleotide variants (SNVs). When stratified by SNV genotype, we found a significant association between APOE4 and cognitive decline in minor allele carriers of rs1279683 (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI, 1.05–3.87, p = 0.035) but not in the homozygote carriers of the major allele. Significant associations between APOE4 and cognitive decline were also observed in participants with major allele homozygotes of rs710218 (OR 2.35, 95% CI, 1.05–5.23, p = 0.037) and rs841851 (OR 3.2, 95% CI, 1.58–6.46, p = 0.0012), but not in minor allele carriers of the respective SNVs. In contrast, the three functional SNVs showed no significant effect on cognitive decline. Our results imply that functional SNVs of VC transporter genes can affect APOE4-associated risk of developing cognitive decline via altered VC levels in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3212411422,"In confirmatory cancer clinical trials, overall survival (OS) is normally a primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis under regulatory standards. After the tumor progresses, it is common that patients allocated to the control group switch to the experimental treatment, or another drug in the same class. Such treatment switching may dilute the relative efficacy of the new drug compared to the control group, leading to lower statistical power. It would be possible to decrease the estimation bias by shortening the follow-up period but this may lead to a loss of information and power. Instead we propose a modified weighted log-rank test (mWLR) that aims at balancing these factors by down-weighting events occurring when many patients have switched treatment. As the weighting should be pre-specified and the impact of treatment switching is unknown, we predict the hazard ratio function and use it to compute the weights of the mWLR. The method may incorporate information from previous trials regarding the potential hazard ratio function over time. We are motivated by the RECORD-1 trial of everolimus against placebo in patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma where almost 80% of the patients in the placebo group received everolimus after disease progression. Extensive simulations show that the new test gives considerably higher efficiency than the standard log-rank test in realistic scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W3212463594,"Because of the serious consequences of eating disorders on young women’s lives and because of the lack of specialised care facilities, assessing and implementing evidence-based prevention interventions is necessary. Switzerland, like other Western countries, has high prevalence rates of eating disorders. However, no prevention interventions have been evaluated in this country so far. This paper presents the protocol of a preliminary study with the aim to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of two interventions, the Body Project (BP) and the Healthy Weight Program (HW), for female students from French-speaking Switzerland. These two interventions were chosen because they have been widely evaluated and they proved to be effective in various countries. They take place in groups and include four weekly sessions over one month. Because of the pandemic situation, the group sessions will take place online on an collaborative platform. The design is a three-arm randomised controlled study. Ninety female students aged 18–25 and presenting with at least moderate body dissatisfaction will be randomised into three groups: (1) one-month BP intervention, (2) one-month HW intervention, and (3) one-month waiting-list control group followed by the BP intervention. Assessments of body dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalisation, dietary restraint, negative affect, and eating disorder psychopathology will be conducted before and after the interventions or waiting list and after a one-month follow-up. ANCOVA and ANOVA with repeated measures will be used to assess group differences and follow-up stability. Acceptability will be assessed with a questionnaire on participants’ satisfaction with the interventions, group discussion at the end of the intervention, and with participants’ rate of attendance to the group sessions. The study results will provide additional data on these two eating disorders prevention interventions and will suggest ways for their dissemination and further evaluation in Switzerland."

Only four novel modified AMPs (S61, S62, S63 and KLK1) provided the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 200-400 μg/ml against the Mab ATCC19977 strain. These four potential AMPs were further tested with 16 clinical isolates of clarithromycin resistant Mab. The majority of the tested strains (10/16 isolates, 62.5%) showed ~99% kill by all four AMPs within 24 hours with an MIC <50 μg/ml. Only two isolates (12.5%) with acquired clarithromycin resistance, however, exhibited values <50 μg/ml of four potential AMPs, S61, S62, S63 and KLK1 after 3-days-incubation. At the MICs level, S63 showed the lowest toxicity with 1.50% hemolysis and 100% PBMC viability whereas KLK1 showed the highest hemolysis (10.21%) and lowest PBMC viability (93.52%). S61, S62 and S63 were further tested with clarithromycin-AMP interaction assays and found that 5/10 (50%) of selected isolates exhibited a synergistic interaction with 0.02-0.41 FICI values. This present study demonstrated the potential application of novel AMPs as an adjunctive treatment with clarithromycin against drug resistant Mab infection."

The third generation of simulated monogastric animal digestion system was used for in vitro digestion experiment. By using single factor completely random design, the optimal supplement levels of single carbohydras were determined by the reducing sugar release amount and improved dry matter digestibility, which were the parameters representing the starch digestibility of the diet. Additionally, Box-Behnken response surface method was used to predict the optimal combination of 6 carbohydrases. The results showed that the optimistic zymogram of 6 carbohydrases in corn-soybean based diet for broilers aged 1 to 3 wk were 297.39 U/g glucoamylase, 549.72 U/g pullulanase, 3.01 U/g maltase, 1,455.73 U/g thermostable α-amylase, 278.64 U/g medium temperature α-amylase, and 1,985.97 U/g cold-active α-amylase, and the associated reduced sugar release amount and improved dry matter digestibility were 215.98 mg/g, and 6.23%, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted in vitro digestion experiments with diets supplemented with the predicted optimistic zymogram and found that the experimental reduced sugar release amount and improved dry matter digestibility were 219.26 mg/g and 6.31% respectively, whose errors to the predicted optimistic reducing sugar release amount and the improved dry matter digestibility were 1.05% and 1.02%. To sum up, the predicted optimal zymogram of 6 carbohydrases in the present study were capable to improve the starch digestibility in diet for broilers aged 1 to 3 wk, which were represented by increased reduced sugar release amount and improved dry matter digestibility."
https://openalex.org/W3212925249,"Hypothermia occurs commonly during surgery and can cause postoperative complications. We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of hypothermia in patients undergoing major surgeries.This prospective, observational, multicenter study of a nationally representative sample included all patients over 18 years of age admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). Thirty ICUs were selected randomly at national level. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients who developed postoperative hypothermia in the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Patients were divided into three groups based on temperature: <35°C, <36°C, and ≥36°C (no hypothermia). Patients' characteristics, postoperative complications, and risk factors were evaluated in all groups. To verify whether hypothermia was a strong risk factor for postoperative complications, a Kaplan-Meier curve was generated and adjusted using a Cox regression model.In total, 738 patients had their temperatures measured. The percentage of patients with temperature <35°C (median [Q1-Q3], 34.7°C [34.3-34.9°C]) was 19.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16.1-22.5) and that of patients with temperature <36°C (median [Q1-Q3], 35.4°C [35.0-35.8°C]) was 64% (95% CI = 58.3-70.0). The percentage of surgical complications was 38.9%. Patients with hypothermia were older, had undergone abdominal surgeries, had undergone procedures of longer duration, and had more comorbidities. A postoperative temperature ≤35°C was an independent risk for composite postoperative complications (hazard ratio = 1.523, 95% CI = 1.15-2.0), especially coagulation and infection.Inadvertent hypothermia was frequent among patients admitted to the ICU and occurred more likely after abdominal surgery, after a long procedure, in elderly patients, and in patients with a higher number of comorbidities. Low postoperative temperature was associated with postoperative complications."
https://openalex.org/W3213251908,"To explore the association between the strength of implementation of family planning (FP) programs on the use of modern contraceptives. Specifically, how strongly these programs are being implemented across a health facility's catchment area in Malawi and the odds of a woman in that catchment area is using modern contraceptives. This information can be used to assess whether the combined impact of multiple large-scale FP programs is leading to change in the health outcomes they aim to improve. We used data from the 2017 Implementation Strength Assessment (ISA) that quantified how much of family planning programs at the health facility and community health worker levels were being implemented across every district of Malawi. We used a summary measure developed in a previous study that employs quantitative methods to combine data across FP domains and health system levels. We tested the association of this summary measure for implementation strength with household data from the 2015 Malawi Demographic Health Survey (DHS). We found that areas with stronger implementation of FP programs had higher odds of women using modern contraceptives compared with areas with weaker implementation. The association of ISA with use of modern contraception was different by education, marital status, and geography. After controlling for these factors, we found that the adjusted odds of using a modern contraceptive was three times higher in catchment areas with high implementation strength compared to those with lower strength. Metrics that summarize how strongly FP programs are being implemented were used to show a statistically significantly positive relationship between increasing implementation strength and higher rates of modern contraceptive use. Decisionmakers at the various levels of health authority can use this type of summary measure to better understand the combined impact of their diverse FP programming and inform future programmatic and policy decisions. The findings also reinforce the idea that having a well-supported and supplied cadre of community health workers supplementing FP provision at the health facility can be an important health systems mechanism, especially in rural settings and to target youth populations."
https://openalex.org/W3213623836,"Practical use of risk predictive tools and the assessment of their impact on outcome reduction is still a challenge. This pragmatic study of quality improvement (QI) describes the preoperative adoption of a customised postoperative death probability model (SAMPE model) and the evaluation of the impact of a Postoperative Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) pathway on the clinical deterioration of high-risk surgical patients.A prospective cohort of 2,533 surgical patients compared with 2,820 historical controls after the adoption of a quality improvement (QI) intervention. We carried out quick postoperative high-risk pathways at PACU when the probability of postoperative death exceeded 5%. As outcome measures, we used the number of rapid response team (RRT) calls within 7 and 30 postoperative days, in-hospital mortality, and non-planned Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission.Not only did the QI succeed in the implementation of a customised risk stratification model, but it also diminished the postoperative deterioration evaluated by RRT calls on very high-risk patients within 30 postoperative days (from 23% before to 14% after the intervention, p = 0.05). We achieved no survival benefits or reduction of non-planned ICU. The small group of high-risk patients (13% of the total) accounted for the highest proportion of RRT calls and postoperative death.Employing a risk predictive tool to guide immediate postoperative care may influence postoperative deterioration. It encouraged the design of pragmatic trials focused on feasible, low-technology, and long-term interventions that can be adapted to diverse health systems, especially those that demand more accurate decision making and ask for full engagement in the control of postoperative morbi-mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3213697422,"Procedural learning is essential for the effortless execution of many everyday life activities. However, little is known about the conditions influencing the acquisition of procedural skills. The literature suggests that sensory environment may influence the acquisition of perceptual-motor sequences, as tested by a Serial Reaction Time Task. In the current study, we investigated the effects of auditory stimulations on procedural learning of a visuo-motor sequence. Given that the literature shows that regular rhythmic auditory rhythm and multisensory stimulations improve motor speed, we expected to improve procedural learning (reaction times and errors) with repeated practice with auditory stimulations presented either simultaneously with visual stimulations or with a regular tempo, compared to control conditions (e.g., with irregular tempo). Our results suggest that both congruent audio-visual stimulations and regular rhythmic auditory stimulations promote procedural perceptual-motor learning. On the contrary, auditory stimulations with irregular or very quick tempo alter learning. We discuss how regular rhythmic multisensory stimulations may improve procedural learning with respect of a multisensory rhythmic integration process."

Data on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and its subtypes among calves in the Republic of Korea (KOR) are sparse. Hence, our study aimed to investigate the prevalence and association between the age of calf and the identified Cryptosporidium spp. and to determine the genotypes/subtypes of Cryptosporidium spp. in pre-weaned calves with diarrhea in the KOR. A total of 460 diarrheic fecal samples were collected from calves aged 1-60 days and screened for Cryptosporidium spp. by the 18S rRNA gene. Species identification was determined using the sequencing analysis of the 18S rRNA gene, and C. parvum-positive samples were subtyped via the sequence analysis of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. Sequence analysis based on the 18S rRNA gene revealed the presence of three Cryptosporidium spp., namely, C. parvum (n = 72), C. ryanae (n = 12), and C. bovis (n = 2). Co-infection by these species was not observed. The infection rate was the highest in calves aged 11-20 days (26.1%, 95% CI 17.1-35.1), whereas the lowest rate was observed in calves aged 21-30 days (7.7%, 95% CI 0.0-16.1). The prevalence of C. parvum was detected exclusively in calves aged ≤20 days, and the highest infection rate of C. ryanae was seen in calves ≥31 days of age. The occurrence of C. parvum (χ2 = 25.300, P = 0.000) and C. ryanae (χ2 = 18.020, P = 0.001) was significantly associated with the age of the calves. Eleven different subtypes of the IIa family that belonging to C. parvum were recognized via the sequence analyses of the gp60 gene. Except for two (IIaA18G3R1 and IIaA15G2R1) subtypes, nine subtypes were first identified in calves with diarrhea in the KOR. IIaA18G3R1 was the most frequently detected subtype (72.2% of calves), followed by IIaA17G3R1 (5.6%), IIaA15G2R1 (4.2%), IIaA19G4R1 (4.2%), IIaA16G4R1 (2.8%), IIaA17G4R1 (2.8%), IIaA19G3R (2.8%), IIaA14G1R1 (1.4%), IIaA14G3R1 (1.4%), IIaA15G1R1 (1.4%), and IIaA19G1R1 (1.4%) These results suggest that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. is significantly associated with calf age. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate the high genetic diversity of C. parvum and the widespread occurrence of zoonotic C. parvum in pre-weaned calves. Hence, calves are a potential source of zoonotic transmission with considerable public health implications."
https://openalex.org/W3212347987,"In order to develop microbial additives for rabbit feed, a spore-forming bacteria was isolated from the feces of Hyla rabbit using reinforced clostridium medium (RCM). The 16S rDNA sequence of the bacterium was subjected to pairwise sequence alignment using BLAST; the colony morphology, and physiological, biochemical, and stress resistance were studied. The results showed that the bacterium was Clostridium sartagoforme, a gram positive anaerobe, which can produce spores. The colony diameter was 0.5 mm-2.5 mm, the diameter of the bacteria was 0.5 μm-1.0 μm × 2.0 μm-6.3 μm, and the spore diameter was 1 μm-1.2 μm × 1 μm-1.2 μm. C. sartagoforme can utilize various sugars and alcohols such as fructose, galactose, sorbitol, and inositol. It secreted cellulase into the extracellular environment to form a transparent hydrolysis circle in Congo red medium, it could not liquify gelatin, and the lysine decarboxylase reaction was positive. In liquid medium it entered the stable growth period after 9 h of inoculation. Additionally, it had good stress resistance with a survival rate that exceeded 53% after gastric juice (pH 2.5) treatment for 3 h, it grew in a medium with a bile salt concentration of 0.3%, and the survival rate exceeded 85% after 10 minutes at 80°C. Moreover, animal testing indicated that this strain has no adverse effects on the morbidity and mortality of rabbits. In summary, C. sartagoforme XN-T4 was isolated from rabbit feces. This bacterium has good resistance to stress, can decompose a variety of monosaccharides and polysaccharides including cellulose, which is relatively harmless for animal health."
https://openalex.org/W3212821048,"This study describes the development, evaluation and application of a computer vision and deep learning system capable of capturing sprinting and skeleton push start step characteristics and mass centre velocities (sled and athlete). Movement data were captured concurrently by a marker-based motion capture system and a custom markerless system. High levels of agreement were found between systems, particularly for spatial based variables (step length error 0.001 ± 0.012 m) while errors for temporal variables (ground contact time and flight time) were on average within ± 1.5 frames of the criterion measures. Comparisons of sprinting and pushing revealed decreased mass centre velocities as a result of pushing the sled but step characteristics were comparable to sprinting when aligned as a function of step velocity. There were large asymmetries between the inside and outside leg during pushing (e.g. 0.22 m mean step length asymmetry) which were not present during sprinting (0.01 m step length asymmetry). The observed asymmetries suggested that force production capabilities during ground contact were compromised for the outside leg. The computer vision based methods tested in this research provide a viable alternative to marker-based motion capture systems. Furthermore, they can be deployed into challenging, real world environments to non-invasively capture data where traditional approaches are infeasible."
https://openalex.org/W3213478609,"Studying different types of tooth movements can help us to better understand the force systems used for tooth position correction in orthodontic treatments. This study considers a more realistic force system in tooth movement modeling across different patients and investigates the effect of the couple force direction on the position of the center of rotation (CRot). The finite-element (FE) models of human mandibles from three patients are used to investigate the position of the CRots for different patients' teeth in 3D space. The CRot is considered a single point in a 3D coordinate system and is obtained by choosing the closest point on the axis of rotation to the center of resistance (CRes). A force system, consisting of a constant load and a couple (pair of forces), is applied to each tooth, and the corresponding CRot trajectories are examined across different patients. To perform a consistent inter-patient analysis, different patients' teeth are registered to the corresponding reference teeth using an affine transformation. The selected directions and applied points of force on the reference teeth are then transformed into the registered teeth domains. The effect of the direction of the couple on the location of the CRot is also studied by rotating the couples about the three principal axes of a patient's premolar. Our results indicate that similar patterns can be obtained for the CRot positions of different patients and teeth if the same load conditions are used. Moreover, equally rotating the direction of the couple about the three principal axes results in different patterns for the CRot positions, especially in labiolingual direction. The CRot trajectories follow similar patterns in the corresponding teeth, but any changes in the direction of the force and couple cause misalignment of the CRot trajectories, seen as rotations about the long axis of the tooth."
https://openalex.org/W3213760920,"The effects of TiO2 nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) together with antibiotics leaking into wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially the partial nitrification (PN) process remain unclear. To evaluate the combined impact and mechanisms of nano-TiO2 and antibiotics on PN systems, batch experiments were carried out with six bench-scale sequencing batch reactors. Nano-TiO2 at a low level had minimal effects on the PN system. In combination with tetracycline and erythromycin, the acute impact of antibiotics was enhanced. Both steps of nitrification were retarded due to the decrease of bacterial activity and abundance, while nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were more sensitive to the inhibition than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Nitrosospira at the genus level remained predominant under single and combined impacts. The flow cytometry analysis showed that nano-TiO2 enhanced the toxicity of antibiotics through increasing cell permeability. Our results can help clarify the risks of nano-TiO2 combined with antibiotics to PN systems and explaining the behavior of nanoparticles in WWTPs."
https://openalex.org/W3211355934,"The average geodesic distance L Newman (2003) and the compactness C B Botafogo (1992) are important graph indices in applications of complex network theory to real-world problems. Here, for simple connected undirected graphs G of order n , we study the behavior of L ( G ) and C B ( G ), subject to the condition that their order | V ( G )| approaches infinity. We prove that the limit of L ( G )/ n and C B ( G ) lies within the interval [0;1/3] and [2/3;1], respectively. Moreover, for any not necessarily rational number β ∈ [0;1/3] ( α ∈ [2/3;1]) we show how to construct the sequence of graphs { G }, | V ( G )| = n → ∞, for which the limit of L ( G )/ n ( C B ( G )) is exactly β ( α ) (Theorems 1 and 2). Based on these results, our work points to novel classification possibilities of graphs at the node level as well as to the information-theoretic classification of the structural complexity of graph indices."
https://openalex.org/W3211479607,"Although lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) is most often multisegmental, the predominant disease location and risk factors differ between patients. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), toe-brachial index (TBI), and toe pressure (TP) are predictive of outcome in LEAD patients. Previously, we reported a classification method defining the most diseased arterial segment (MDAS); crural (CR), femoropopliteal (FP), or aortoiliac (AOI). Current study aimed to analyze the associations between MDAS, peripheral pressure measurements and cardiovascular mortality.We reviewed retrospectively 729 consecutive LEAD patients (Rutherford 2-6) who underwent digital subtraction angiography between January, 2009 to August, 2011 and had standardized peripheral pressure measurements.In Cox Regression analyses, cardiovascular mortality was associated with MDAS and non-invasive pressure indices as follows; MDAS AOI, TP <30 mmHg (HR 3.00, 95% CI 1.13-7.99); MDAS FP, TP <30 mmHg (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.36-3.94), TBI <0.25 (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.34-7.63), ABI <0.25 (HR 5.45, 95% CI 1.56-19.0) and ≥1.30 (HR 6.71, 95% CI 1.89-23.8), and MDAS CR, TP <30 mmHg (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.19-8.27), TBI <0.25 (HR 7.71, 95% CI 1.86-32.9), and ABI <0.25 (HR 2.59, 95% CI 1.15-5.85).Symptomatic LEAD appears to be multisegmental with severe infrapopliteal involvement. Because of this, TP and TBI are strongly predictive of cardiovascular mortality and they should be routinely measured despite the predominant disease location or clinical presentation."
https://openalex.org/W3211652978,"Background Multicomponent physical exercise programs are a viable strategy for treating physical decline resulting from the aging process in older populations and can be applied in supervised and home-based modalities. However, the magnitude of the intervention effects in terms of physical function development may vary according to the modalities application due to different supervision degrees. Objective This study aims to compare the effects of supervision in a multicomponent exercise program in different application modalities (supervised vs. home vs. supervised+home) in neuromuscular adaptations, muscle strength, gait, physical function, and quality of life, analyzing the differences between intensity, volume, and density of home and supervised sessions in community older adults. Methods This protocol is a randomized controlled clinical trial with a sample of 66 older adults divided into three groups: supervised exercise (SUP = 22), home-based exercise (HB = 22), and supervised plus home-based exercise (SUP+HB = 22). The multicomponent exercise program will last 12 weeks, three times per week, for 60 min per session and include warm-up, balance, muscle-strengthening, gait, and flexibility exercises. The study’s primary outcomes will be neuromuscular function, composed of the assessment of muscle isokinetic strength, muscle architecture, and neuromuscular electrical activation. The secondary outcome will be physical function, usual and maximum gait speed with and without dual-task, and quality of life. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention (week 12). Conclusion This study will be the first clinical trial to examine the effects of different supervision levels on home-based exercises compared to supervised protocols. The results of this study will be essentials for planning coherent and viable home-based programs for older adults. Trial registration Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials.

https://openalex.org/W3212687410,"Preschool children suffer from morbidity attributable to Schistosoma mansoni. We compared a single and double dose of praziquantel treatment on the regression of S. mansoni associated morbidity in children less than six years in Uganda. We measured the sizes of spleen and liver as well as liver fibrosis before treatment and 8 months after treatment among children who either received one dose (n = 201) or two doses (n = 184) of praziquantel (standard oral dose of 40 mg/kg body weight). Heamoglobin measurements were also taken. Overall, liver enlargement reduced from 52.2% (95% CI (Confidence interval) 45.1, 59.3) to 17.9% (95% CI 12.9, 23.9) with a single dose and from 48.4 (95% CI 40.9, 55.8) to 17.9% (95% CI 12.7, 24.3) with a double dose and there was no significant difference between the changes in proportion of children with enlarged liver between the two treatment groups. The proportion of children with enlarged spleen was not significantly reduced in the group treated with either one or two doses, 47.8% (95% CI 41.7, 54.9) to 45.3% (95% CI 38.3, 52.4) and 48.4% (95% CI 40.9,55.8) to 40.8% 95% CI 33.6, 48.2), respectively. Liver fibrosis detected among children getting single dose (n = 9) or double doses (n = 13) resolved after treatment with praziquantel. The number of children with low heamoglobin significantly reduced from 51.2% (95% CI 44.1, 58.3) to 0.5% (0.2, 0.8) and 61.4% (95% CI 53.9,68.5) to 1.1% (95% CI 0.1, 3.9) after single and double dose treatment, respectively. These results suggest that there is no evidence of a difference in effect between one dose of praziquantel and two doses in reversing morbidity attributable to S. mansoni among children less than six years of age."
https://openalex.org/W3213357220,"The competition for nutrients in overnourished and still-growing adolescent sheep negatively impacts gestation length, colostrum supply and lamb birthweight, all of which may affect neonatal morbidity and survival to weaning. Herein perinatal complications and the requirement for supplementary feeding were analysed in relation to gestational-intake, and the degree of premature delivery and prenatal growth-restriction exhibited. Pregnancies were established by embryo transfer and the mean/standard deviation (SD) gestation length and birthweight of the optimally-fed control group (n = 100) was used to define early delivery and reduced birthweight categories (1.5 and 3.0 SDs below the control mean for each aspect). Control lambs were largely delivered at term (94%), and had a normal birthweight (92%), while very preterm (≤139days, 18.5%) and preterm delivery (140-142days, 54.8%), extremely low birthweight (ELBW; females ≤2838g and males ≤3216g, 21.1%) and low birthweight (LBW; females 2839 to ≤4001g and males 3217 to ≤4372g, 32.2%), were common in the overnourished group (n = 270, P<0.001). Accordingly, overnourished dams were more likely to lamb without assistance while the incidence of major dystocia was greater in controls. Initial lamb vigour at birth was independent of gestational-intake, delivery or birthweight category but both ELBW and very premature lambs required more assistance with feeding in the first 24h postnatal, primarily reflecting low colostrum availability. Indeed, relative to normal, ELBW lambs had a greater risk of experiencing mismothering, and enhanced likelihood of requiring supplementary feeding throughout the neonatal period (P<0.001). ELBW lambs also had a greater possibility of respiratory issues at birth (P<0.01) and renal complications (P<0.001), while very preterm delivery was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal tract problems (P<0.01). In spite of these complications, all-cause mortality was low (5.4%) suggesting that our proactive neonatal care regime can overcome many of the issues associated with extreme prematurity and low birthweight."
https://openalex.org/W3214248297,"In recent years, China has introduced the Universal Two-Child Policy (UTCP), which means that a couple can have two children. The implementation of this policy may affect female employment. Based on this background, this work aims to the impact of UTCP on the number and employment of Chinese women workers, and find out the countermeasures for the adverse impact of the policy. Firstly, the role of the Propensity Score Matching-Differences in Differences model is introduced, and the average and dynamic effects of UTCP on women's employment are discussed by using the Propensity Score Matching model. Secondly, the survey data on issues related to female employment after the implementation of UTCP from 2016 to 2020 is analyzed. Finally, a conclusion is drawn according to the survey data. The results demonstrate that the implementation of UTCP widens the income gap between men and women. Meanwhile, the younger the couple, the greater the income gap. Besides, the unemployment rate changes slightly after the introduction of the policy. As the growth rate of female income is significantly lower than that of men of the same age, UTCP has little impact on the employment of Chinese female workers, but has a great impact on the quality of employment. Among all the respondents, the proportion of employed men is higher than employed women, which is about 64% ~ 65%. However, it is still unknown whether age, education, family characteristics, nationality, occupations, and economic development of the province have a certain impact on female income, which is worth noting by follow-up research. On the whole, the full liberalization of the second child has little impact on the employment of female workers in China, but has a great impact on the quality of employment. The present work lays a foundation for the study of the impact of UTCT on female employment in future, and offers a certain reference for the further study of the impact of the policy on employment in the future."
