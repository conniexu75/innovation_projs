https://openalex.org/W2110389012,"CD4(+) T regulatory cells (T(regs)), which express the Foxp3 transcription factor, play a critical role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Here, we show that in mice, T(regs) were most abundant in the colonic mucosa. The spore-forming component of indigenous intestinal microbiota, particularly clusters IV and XIVa of the genus Clostridium, promoted T(reg) cell accumulation. Colonization of mice by a defined mix of Clostridium strains provided an environment rich in transforming growth factor-β and affected Foxp3(+) T(reg) number and function in the colon. Oral inoculation of Clostridium during the early life of conventionally reared mice resulted in resistance to colitis and systemic immunoglobulin E responses in adult mice, suggesting a new therapeutic approach to autoimmunity and allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2103659405,"Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a conserved sensor of intracellular energy activated in response to low nutrient availability and environmental stress. In a screen for conserved substrates of AMPK, we identified ULK1 and ULK2, mammalian orthologs of the yeast protein kinase Atg1, which is required for autophagy. Genetic analysis of AMPK or ULK1 in mammalian liver and Caenorhabditis elegans revealed a requirement for these kinases in autophagy. In mammals, loss of AMPK or ULK1 resulted in aberrant accumulation of the autophagy adaptor p62 and defective mitophagy. Reconstitution of ULK1-deficient cells with a mutant ULK1 that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK revealed that such phosphorylation is required for mitochondrial homeostasis and cell survival during starvation. These findings uncover a conserved biochemical mechanism coupling nutrient status with autophagy and cell survival."

However, low conversion efficiencies, particularly with CO(2) reduction, as well as utilization of precious materials have limited the practical generation of solar fuels. By using a solar cavity-receiver reactor, we combined the oxygen uptake and release capacity of cerium oxide and facile catalysis at elevated temperatures to thermochemically dissociate CO(2) and H(2)O, yielding CO and H(2), respectively. Stable and rapid generation of fuel was demonstrated over 500 cycles. Solar-to-fuel efficiencies of 0.7 to 0.8% were achieved and shown to be largely limited by the system scale and design rather than by chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1992793549,"Human social interactions crucially depend on the ability to represent other agents' beliefs even when these contradict our own beliefs, leading to the potentially complex problem of simultaneously holding two conflicting representations in mind. Here, we show that adults and 7-month-olds automatically encode others' beliefs, and that, surprisingly, others' beliefs have similar effects as the participants' own beliefs. In a visual object detection task, participants' beliefs and the beliefs of an agent (whose beliefs were irrelevant to performing the task) both modulated adults' reaction times and infants' looking times. Moreover, the agent's beliefs influenced participants' behavior even after the agent had left the scene, suggesting that participants computed the agent's beliefs online and sustained them, possibly for future predictions about the agent's behavior. Hence, the mere presence of an agent automatically triggers powerful processes of belief computation that may be part of a ""social sense"" crucial to human societies."

Hsp90 has also been suggested both to buffer against and to potentiate existing genetic variation in a population. To investigate the generality of these claims, Jarosz and Lindquist (p. 1820 ) screened 96 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains from various ecological niches—soil, fruit, sake, beer, and infected humans—as well as assessed their adaptive value under different growth conditions. Hsp90 determined the adaptive value of ∼20% of the genetic variation in baker's yeast, with half of the traits being buffered, and half potentiated by hsp90."

However, implementing the effect in a device is challenging. Wunderlich et al. (p. 1801 ) combine the concept of the spin Hall effect with that of a spin transistor, and build a nonmagnetic device in a which a spin current, injected by optical means, is “stripped” of its charge component, goes through a spin-modulation layer, and is detected using the inverse spin Hall effect. Such manipulation of the spin current may help in future spintronic applications."

The possible contribution of cancer germline (CG) genes to malignancy is unknown. Janic et al. (p. 1824 ; see the Perspective by Wu and Ruvkun ) found that CG genes are also expressed in Drosophila brain tumors caused by mutants in the gene lethal (3) malignant brain tumor . Moreover, inactivation of some of these genes suppressed fly tumor growth. Because some Drosophila CG genes are orthologs of human CG genes, it is possible that inactivation of germline genes may show human tumor suppressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2084969272,"A Safety Catch on Immune Response The complement system is an integral part of the innate immune system. When triggered, it initiates a cascade that marks intruders for elimination and stimulates immune responses. The key amplification step is cleavage of a complex comprising the complement fragment C3b and factor B (C3bB) by factor D (FD). Forneris et al. (p. 1816 ) now describe the crystal structure of C3bB and its complex with FD. The structures support a mechanism in which membrane-bound C3b stabilizes an open form of factor B (FB) that has its scissile bond accessible. FD binds through a site distant from its catalytic center to the open form of FB, which activates FD. The two conformational equilibria represent a double safety-catch that would allow tight regulation of this immune response pathway."

The whole process could be described in terms of the inertia of the domain wall. The distance traveled was simply proportional to the length of the current pulse used to move the wall, which should simplify implementation in a circuit or network architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1984360671,"Acceptance of marine protected areas (MPAs) as fishery and conservation tools has been hampered by lack of direct evidence that MPAs successfully seed unprotected areas with larvae of targeted species. For the first time, we present direct evidence of large-scale population connectivity within an existing and effective network of MPAs. A new parentage analysis identified four parent-offspring pairs from a large, exploited population of the coral-reef fish Zebrasoma flavescens in Hawai'i, revealing larval dispersal distances ranging from 15 to 184 km. In two cases, successful dispersal was from an MPA to unprotected sites. Given high adult abundances, the documentation of any parent-offspring pairs demonstrates that ecologically-relevant larval connectivity between reefs is substantial. All offspring settled at sites to the north of where they were spawned. Satellite altimetry and oceanographic models from relevant time periods indicated a cyclonic eddy that created prevailing northward currents between sites where parents and offspring were found. These findings empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MPAs as useful conservation and management tools and further highlight the importance of coupling oceanographic, genetic, and ecological data to predict, validate and quantify larval connectivity among marine populations."
https://openalex.org/W1970873002,"Increased intracellular cAMP concentration plays a well established role in leukemic cell maturation. We previously reported that U937 cells stimulated by H2 receptor agonists, despite a robust increase in cAMP, fail to mature because of rapid H2 receptor desensitization and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activation. Here we show that intracellular cAMP levels not only in U937 cells but also in other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines are also regulated by multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), particularly MRP4. U937, HL-60, and KG-1a cells, exposed to amthamine (H2-receptor agonist), augmented intracellular cAMP concentration with a concomitant increase in the efflux. Extrusion of cAMP was ATP-dependent and probenecid-sensitive, supporting that the transport was MRP-mediated. Cells exposed to amthamine and the PDE4 inhibitor showed enhanced cAMP extrusion, but this response was inhibited by MRP blockade. Amthamine stimulation, combined with PDE4 and MRP inhibition, induced maximal cell arrest proliferation. Knockdown strategy by shRNA revealed that this process was mediated by MRP4. Furthermore, blockade by probenecid or MRP4 knockdown showed that increased intracellular cAMP levels induce maturation in U937 cells. These findings confirm the key role of intracellular cAMP levels in leukemic cell maturation and provide the first evidence that MRP4 may represent a new potential target for leukemia differentiation therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1983377323,"The thermal motion of stiff filaments in a crowded environment is highly constrained and anisotropic; it underlies the behavior of such disparate systems as polymer materials, nanocomposites, and the cell cytoskeleton. Despite decades of theoretical study, the fundamental dynamics of such systems remains a mystery. Using near-infrared video microscopy, we studied the thermal diffusion of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) confined in porous agarose networks. We found that even a small bending flexibility of SWNTs strongly enhances their motion: The rotational diffusion constant is proportional to the filament-bending compliance and is independent of the network pore size. The interplay between crowding and thermal bending implies that the notion of a filament's stiffness depends on its confinement. Moreover, the mobility of SWNTs and other inclusions can be controlled by tailoring their stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W1964180981,"SR-A (class A macrophage scavenger receptor) is a transmembrane receptor that can bind many different ligands, including modified lipoproteins that are relevant to the development of vascular diseases. However, the precise endocytic pathways of SR-A/mediated ligands internalization are not fully characterized.

Our results suggest that different SR-A endocytic pathways have distinct functional consequences due to the activation of different signaling cascades in macrophages. IntroductionEndocytosis is characterized by the internalization of molecules from the cell surface into internal membrane compartments. It is important for diverse cellular signaling events. Two main pathways have been identified for receptor-mediated endocytosis: the clathrin-dependent and the caveolae/lipid raft-dependent endocytic pathways (1Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 2Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the most well characterized mechanism for mediating the internalization of membrane receptors into cells. It is also important for intracellular trafficking at the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (3Young A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis is involved in multiple biological processes, including mediating virus entry into host cells, internalizing glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and regulating certain signaling cascades. Caveola are cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane invaginations of a diameter of 60–80 nm, of which caveolin-1 is the main protein component required for caveola biogenesis (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Trafficking through these two endocytic pathways affects the amplitude and the on/off status of many signaling pathways. Thus, these endocytic processes contribute to the regulations of cell migration, cell cycle, cell polarity, apoptosis, and gene transcription (1Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 5Nesterov A.

Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Kodama T. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). SR-A can bind with an unusually broad range of polyanionic ligands, which includes modified lipoproteins, LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, and advanced glycation end products. Its broad specificity in binding with the ligands supports the multiple functions of SR-A in macrophage growth, adhesion to the substratum, cell-cell interactions, phagocytosis, and host defense (8Murphy J.E.

However, the molecular mechanisms enabling SR-A to exert multiple functions are still not well understood. It is reported that acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL), 2The abbreviations used are: acLDLacetylated low density lipoproteinDiI1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchloratePIpropidium iodide. a specific ligand of SR-A (17Goldstein J.L.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the VirB-dependent bacterial internalization induces localization of SR-A into the detergent-resistant membrane lipid rafts (20Kim S. Watarai M. Suzuki H. Makino S. Kodama T. Shirahata T. Microb. Pathog. 2004; 37: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which are sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched, and caveolin-containing domains that compartmentalize cellular processes.

We also showed that the internalization of SR-A and its ligand complex into cell is regulated by interaction of SR-A to its coupler (15Wang X. Zheng Y. Xu Y. Ben J. Gao S. Zhu X. Zhuang Y. Yue S.

In this study, we want to address the question of whether different functions of SR-A are carried out by different endocytosis pathways. We show that SR-A can be internalized by both clathrin- and caveolae-dependent pathways. The clathrin-dependent SR-A endocytosis activates ERK signaling. The caveolae-dependent pathway is required for p38 kinase and JNK signaling as well as caspase activation. Our results indicate for the first time that SR-A-mediated macrophage apoptosis may be selectively regulated by the caveolae-dependent endocytosis.DISCUSSIONThe uptake of modified lipoproteins by SR-A is thought to be central to foam cell formation, from which atherosclerotic lesion is generated and develops. However, the conflicting outcomes from multiple studies on the impact of SR-A in mouse models of atherosclerosis suggest the existence of pathogenesis mechanisms beyond lipid uptake (7Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S.

Invest. 2005; 115: 2192-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Foam cell formation is believed to represent one of the major events that activate the proinflammatory phenotype of lesional macrophages. SR-A has been found to initiate signaling cascades regulating not only lipid metabolism but also macrophage activation and inflammatory programs that may influence the development and stability of the atherosclerotic plaque. More importantly, SR-A has roles in the induction of apoptosis that may differentially impact early versus later more complex lesions (25Devries-Seimon T. Li Y. Yao P.M. Stone E. Wang Y. Davis R.J. Flavell R. Tabas I. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 32Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The molecular background underlying these multiple functions of SR-A is its unique ability to bind with broad array of ligands. As a member of the group of pattern recognition receptors that mediate the innate immune host response, SR-A can bind and “scavenge” modified forms of LDL, apoptotic cells, anionic phospholipids, β-amyloid peptide, and advanced glycation end products, as well as pathogens and pathogen-associated molecules (8Murphy J.E. Tedbury P.R. Homer-Vanniasinkam S. Walker J.H. Ponnambalam S. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 182: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 10Bowdish D.M. Gordon S. Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that SR-A can endocytose various ligands via different pathways. Multiple endocytic pathways are utilized by many other receptors. For example, bone morphogenic protein receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor have been shown to exert distinct functions by choosing different endocytic pathways (21Hartung A. Bitton-Worms K. Rechtman M.M. Wenzel V. Boergermann J.H. Hassel S. Henis Y.I. Knaus P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7791-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 33De Donatis A. Comito G.

We found that the distinct endocytic pathways of SR-A are independent on the concentration of ligand. Presence of ligand fucoidan did not influence SR-A choosing its endocytic routes. This is different from the epidermal growth factor receptor, which enters into the cell via different routes based on the dose of ligand (24Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 34Chen H. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Endocytosis is originally regarded as a mechanism to terminate signaling through receptor internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation. But it is now widely accepted as a fundamental organizer of cell signaling events (2Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 35Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar, 36Miaczynska M. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As we showed different signaling responses to SR-A ligands at 4 and 37 °C, signaling persists throughout the endocytic route of SR-A. Thus, endocytic signaling is not merely a “passive” extension of binding to the ligands by SR-A at the plasma membrane but a tool to achieve signal diversification and specificity (37Mills I.G. Semin Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 38Kholodenko B.N. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 173-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 39Kholodenko B.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). This may constitute the molecular mechanisms for the multiple functions of SR-A.Macrophage apoptosis occurs at all stages of atherosclerosis. In early lesions, it is mildly dangerous because apoptotic cells are efficiently cleared by neighboring macrophage. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, macrophage cell death leads to necrotic core formation and plaque destabilization (32Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 40Tabas I. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S12-S16Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 41Tabas I. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). SR-A plays an important role in both the induction of macrophage apoptosis and the clearance of these dying cells. Under conditions of hypercholesterolemia macrophages in the vessel wall are overloaded by modified lipoproteins, leading to a toxic accumulation of free cholesterol in the cell that result in endoplasmic reticular stress. Subsequently, engagement of SR-A pathways by modified lipoproteins or fucoidan triggers apoptotic cell death, indicating that SR-A signaling contributes to macrophage death and necrotic core formation (25Devries-Seimon T. Li Y. Yao P.M. Stone E. Wang Y. Davis R.J. Flavell R. Tabas I. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 32Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is believed to play a role in macrophage apoptosis (42Gargalovic P. Dory L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1622-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We showed that the SR-A-engaged apoptosis is primarily mediated by the caveolae-dependent endocytosis in macrophages. Furthermore, Frank et al. (43Frank P.G. Lee H. Park D.S. Tandon N.N. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the loss of caveolin-1 gene expression is protective against the development of aortic atheromas, with up to an 70% reduction in the atherosclerotic lesion area. It is possible that blockade of caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway may diminish macrophage apoptosis and thus inhibit atherosclerosis lesion development.In the present study, we further showed that fucoidan/thapsigargin-induced macrophage apoptosis is dependent on activation of p38 kinase and JNK. The proapoptosis properties of p38 kinase and JNK have also been reported in some other apoptosis models (44Deng Y. Ren X. Yang L. Lin Y. Wu X.

In addition, JNK2 is shown to be required for SR-A-mediated foam cell formation and atherogenesis (47Ricci R. Sumara G. Sumara I. Rozenberg I. Kurrer M. Akhmedov A. Hersberger M. Eriksson U.

Known as a signalosome, caveolae concentrate many signaling molecules, within one specialized plasma membrane domain including H-Ras, Src family, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (48Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Regulation of LPS-induced cytokine production by caveolin-1 involves the p38 kinase pathway (49Wang X.M. Kim H.P. Song R. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Thus, caveolin-1 and JNK2 may become potential targets to prevent SR-A-dependent apoptosis in endoplasmic reticulum stressed macrophages.In conclusion, our data demonstrated that SR-A/ligand internalization occurs through two endocytosis routes: clathrin- and caveolae-dependent pathways. Dosage of the ligands seems not to influence choice of the route by SR-A. Uptake of modified LDL by SR-A primarily go through the clathrin route. SR-A-induced apoptosis requires endocytosis through the caveola route, which is linked to p38 kinase and JNK activation (Fig. 8). SR-A may exert multiple functions by choosing distinct endocytic routes and the linked signaling in macrophages. IntroductionEndocytosis is characterized by the internalization of molecules from the cell surface into internal membrane compartments. It is important for diverse cellular signaling events. Two main pathways have been identified for receptor-mediated endocytosis: the clathrin-dependent and the caveolae/lipid raft-dependent endocytic pathways (1Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 2Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. Cell. 2006; 124: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the most well characterized mechanism for mediating the internalization of membrane receptors into cells. It is also important for intracellular trafficking at the trans-Golgi network and endosomes (3Young A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Caveolae/raft-dependent endocytosis is involved in multiple biological processes, including mediating virus entry into host cells, internalizing glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and regulating certain signaling cascades. Caveola are cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich plasma membrane invaginations of a diameter of 60–80 nm, of which caveolin-1 is the main protein component required for caveola biogenesis (4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Trafficking through these two endocytic pathways affects the amplitude and the on/off status of many signaling pathways. Thus, these endocytic processes contribute to the regulations of cell migration, cell cycle, cell polarity, apoptosis, and gene transcription (1Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 4Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 5Nesterov A.

Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Kodama T. et al.Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). SR-A can bind with an unusually broad range of polyanionic ligands, which includes modified lipoproteins, LPS of Gram-negative bacteria, and advanced glycation end products. Its broad specificity in binding with the ligands supports the multiple functions of SR-A in macrophage growth, adhesion to the substratum, cell-cell interactions, phagocytosis, and host defense (8Murphy J.E.

However, the molecular mechanisms enabling SR-A to exert multiple functions are still not well understood.

In this study, we want to address the question of whether different functions of SR-A are carried out by different endocytosis pathways. We show that SR-A can be internalized by both clathrin- and caveolae-dependent pathways. The clathrin-dependent SR-A endocytosis activates ERK signaling. The caveolae-dependent pathway is required for p38 kinase and JNK signaling as well as caspase activation. Our results indicate for the first time that SR-A-mediated macrophage apoptosis may be selectively regulated by the caveolae-dependent endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2003240710,"Sexual HIV-1 transmission by vaginal route is the most predominant mode of viral transmission, resulting in millions of new infections every year. In the absence of an effective vaccine, there is an urgent need to develop other alternative methods of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Many novel drugs that are currently approved for clinical use also show great potential to prevent viral sexual transmission when administered systemically. A small animal model that permits rapid preclinical evaluation of potential candidates for their systemic PrEP efficacy will greatly enhance progress in this area of investigation. We have previously shown that RAG-hu humanized mouse model permits HIV-1 mucosal transmission via both vaginal and rectal routes and displays CD4 T cell loss typical to that seen in the human. Thus far systemic PrEP studies have been primarily limited to RT inhibitors exemplified by tenofovir and emtricitabine. In these proof-of-concept studies we evaluated two new classes of clinically approved drugs with different modes of action namely, an integrase inhibitor raltegravir and a CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc as potential systemically administered chemo-prophylactics. Our results showed that oral administration of either of these drugs fully protects against vaginal HIV-1 challenge in the RAG-hu mouse model. Based on these results both these drugs show great promise for further development as orally administered PrEPs."

Crosses with distant relatives (outbreeding) can also be problematic and is prevented by unilateral interspecific incompatability (UI). In the nightshade family, SI functions within green-fruited species, whereas crosses between green-fruited and red-fruited species (which includes tomato) results in UI. Li and Chetelat (p. 1827 ) found a gene, related to known SI genes within this family, that differs in transcript length and function between individuals that are red-fruited and those that are green-fruited. A survey of species shows that the green-fruited species have a functional allele of this gene, whereas the transcript of this gene in red-fruited species, which are self-compatible, produce a putatively nonfunctional protein. These findings suggest that cultivated tomato may have lost the ability to pollinate other species within the same family, owing to the loss of this protein."

https://openalex.org/W1967933722,"The CB1 cannabinoid receptor is the most abundant G-protein coupled receptor in the brain and a key regulator of neuronal excitability. There is strong evidence that CB1 receptor on glutamatergic hippocampal neurons is beneficial to alleviate epileptiform seizures in mouse and man. Therefore, we hypothesized that experimentally increased CB1 gene dosage in principal neurons would have therapeutic effects in kainic acid (KA)-induced hippocampal pathogenesis. Here, we show that virus-mediated conditional overexpression of CB1 receptor in pyramidal and mossy cells of the hippocampus is neuroprotective and moderates convulsions in the acute KA seizure model in mice. We introduce a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome with a short stop element flanked by loxP sites, for highly efficient attenuation of transgene expression on the transcriptional level. The presence of Cre-recombinase is strictly necessary for expression of reporter proteins or CB1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. Transgenic CB1 receptor immunoreactivity is targeted to glutamatergic neurons after stereotaxic delivery of AAV to the dorsal hippocampus of the driver mice NEX-cre. Increased CB1 receptor protein levels in hippocampal lysates of AAV-treated Cre-mice is paralleled by enhanced cannabinoid-induced G-protein activation. KA-induced seizure severity and mortality is reduced in CB1 receptor overexpressors compared with AAV-treated control animals. Neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA3 field is specifically absent from AAV-treated Cre-transgenics, but evident throughout cortical areas of both treatment groups. Our data provide further evidence for a role of increased CB1 signaling in pyramidal hippocampal neurons as a safeguard against the adverse effects of excessive excitatory network activity."

Phospholipids are the major components of pulmonary surfactant, accounting for 90% of its composition by weight. The most abundant phospholipid class in pulmonary surfactant is phosphatidylcholine, mainly in the form of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and the second most abundant surfactant lipid class is phosphatidylglycerol (PG), with palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) as the dominant molecular species (25Wright S.M.

The mechanism by which M. pneumoniae causes asthma exacerbation is not well understood, but one plausible pathway is via the production of eicosanoids (prostaglandins and leukotrienes) from host cells. In this study, we show that membrane components of M. pneumoniae and live M. pneumoniae stimulate the release of eicosanoids from macrophages. We sought to characterize the eicosanoids elicited by M. pneumoniae via TLR2 receptors and quantify the role of POPG as an antagonist of this process. Our findings demonstrate that M. pneumoniae and its membrane components elicit a strong eicosanoid response from macrophages that is abrogated by the anionic surfactant phospholipid, POPG.

Adherent bacteria were harvested by scraping the flask with a rubber spatula and centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and centrifuged twice. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in PBS and layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (60, 52, 48, and 40%) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (SW28) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were recovered from 48–52% interface, mixed with PBS, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The purified cells were either used to challenge macrophages or further processed to produce membranes and lipoproteins. For membrane preparation, the purified M. pneumoniae pellet was resuspended in PBS, mixed with 3 volumes of distilled water, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were lysed completely by probe sonication on ice for a total of 2 min, using 30-s sonication and 30-s cooling cycles. Polymyxin B (100 μg/ml) was added to the lysed M. pneumoniae cells, and the preparation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to sediment membranes. The pellet was washed twice with polymyxin B and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The final M. pneumoniae membrane pellet was resuspended in PBS, homogenized, and used as the bacterial membrane fraction. For bacterial lipoprotein preparation, M. pneumoniae membrane was solubilized by the addition of 1% Triton X-114 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle shaking. Triton X-114-treated M. pneumoniae membrane was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The resulting cloudy solution was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature to separate the aqueous and detergent phases. The aqueous phase was again incubated with 1% Triton X-114 at 37 °C for 5 min and centrifuged to separate the phases. The last step was repeated once again. The Triton X-114 phases were pooled, and 3 volumes of methanol were added. The preparation was incubated at −80 °C overnight and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dried and suspended in PBS and used as bacterial lipoprotein (LPP). RAW264.7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. After stimulation, macrophages were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with PhosphoSafe lysis buffer containing Sigma protease inhibitor mixture.

https://openalex.org/W2023632053,"It is believed that the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is implicated in the metabolic perturbations associated with both sepsis and obesity (metabolic endotoxemia). Here we examined the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in skeletal muscle insulin resistance using LPS challenge in rats and mice as in vivo models of endotoxemia.Pharmacological (aminoguanidine) and genetic strategies (iNOS⁻/⁻ mice) were used to counter iNOS induction in vivo. In vitro studies using peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) or inhibitors of the iNOS pathway, 1400 W and EGCG were conducted in L6 myocytes to determine the mechanism by which iNOS mediates LPS-dependent insulin resistance. In vivo, both pharmacological and genetic invalidation of iNOS prevented LPS-induced muscle insulin resistance. Inhibition of iNOS also prevented insulin resistance in myocytes exposed to cytokine/LPS while exposure of myocytes to ONOO⁻ fully reproduced the inhibitory effect of cytokine/LPS on both insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and PI3K activity. Importantly, LPS treatment in vivo and iNOS induction and ONOO⁻ treatment in vitro promoted tyrosine nitration of IRS-1 and reduced insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation.Our work demonstrates that iNOS-mediated tyrosine nitration of IRS-1 is a key mechanism of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in endotoxemia, and presents nitrosative modification of insulin signaling proteins as a novel therapeutic target for combating muscle insulin resistance in inflammatory settings."
https://openalex.org/W1980490149,"Phylogenetic analysis has previously shown that plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are monophyletic with respect to the kinase domain and share an evolutionary origin with the animal interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase/Pelle-soluble kinases. The lysin motif domain-containing receptor-like kinase-3 (LYK3) of the legume Medicago truncatula shows 33% amino acid sequence identity with human IRAK-4 over the kinase domain. Using the structure of this animal kinase as a template, homology modeling revealed that the plant RLK contains structural features particular to this group of kinases, including the tyrosine gatekeeper and the N-terminal extension α-helix B. Functional analysis revealed the importance of these conserved features for kinase activity and suggests that kinase activity is essential for the biological role of LYK3 in the establishment of the root nodule nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia bacteria. The kinase domain of LYK3 has dual serine/threonine and tyrosine specificity, and mass spectrometry analysis identified seven serine, eight threonine, and one tyrosine residue as autophosphorylation sites in vitro. Three activation loop serine/threonine residues are required for biological activity, and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Thr-475 is the prototypical phosphorylated residue that interacts with the conserved arginine in the catalytic loop, whereas Ser-471 and Thr-472 may be secondary sites. A threonine in the juxtamembrane region and two threonines in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain are important for biological but not kinase activity. We present evidence that the structure-function similarities that we have identified between LYK3 and IRAK-4 may be more widely applicable to plant RLKs in general.

Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10763-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), which have diverged to fulfill different physiological roles. These genes all encode proteins with the same basic structure as follows: an extracellular region (containing various domains that presumably bind different types of ligands) followed by a single transmembrane-spanning segment and an intracellular region containing a Ser/Thr kinase-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the kinase domain is monophyletic and shares a common evolutionary origin with the human IRAK and Drosophila Pelle group of soluble Ser/Thr kinases. These kinases are quite closely related to the animal receptor Tyr kinase and the Raf kinase families (1Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

IRAK-4 contains an Arg before the catalytic Asp (an RD kinase), which interacts with a phosphorylated residue in the activation loop. It shares about 38% sequence identity with another family member, IRAK-1, which does not contain the Arg residue and thus is a non-RD kinase. Both IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses and play central roles in signal transduction via the related Toll-like receptors and interleukin 1 receptors (TLR/IL-1R family).

In this study, we aimed to determine whether LYK3 kinase activity is essential for nodulation in M. truncatula and to identify regions of the kinase domain that are important for signal transduction. Our results suggest a remarkable structural conservation between the kinase domain of LYK3 and human IRAK-4, which may suggest that both kinases are activated via similar mechanisms. We further argue that this structural and functional homology extends to other members of the plant RLK/RLCK family. For plant expression, the coding sequence of LYK3 was cloned in-frame with a C-terminal 3×FLAG epitope tag and in-between the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and terminator. Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); all constructs were sequenced to exclude PCR errors and to confirm the designed mutation(s). Agrobacterium rhizogenes ARqua1 strains, containing the constructs in the pBin+ vector, were used to produce M. truncatula lyk3-1 plants (19Catoira R. Timmers A.C. Maillet F. Galera C. Penmetsa R.V.

Complementation for root nodulation was analyzed following transfer into growth pouches and inoculation with Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 2011, carrying either a LacZ or GFP marker (22Lévy J.

The experiments were repeated at least twice. Subcellular localization of mutant proteins was analyzed using confocal microscopy by comparison of the localization of the C-terminal fusions of these proteins with sYFP2 (23Kremers G.J.

All proteins tested localized to the plasma membrane, like wild type. For expression in E. coli, the predicted intracellular region (aa 257–620) was cloned behind the GST tag in the vector pGEX-6P-1 (16Arrighi J.F. Barre A. Ben Amor B. Bersoult A. Soriano L.C.

Proteins were separated on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, and detected with antibodies and coupling to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as indicated in each figure. The antibodies were used as follows: anti-FLAG-HRP (Sigma, 1:5000), anti-GST-HRP (GE Healthcare, 1:10,000), and rabbit anti-phospho-Thr (1:1000), and rabbit anti-phospho-Ser (1:200) (all from Invitrogen) in combination with goat anti-rabbit-coupled HRP (Millipore, 1:25,000) and mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-Tyr (1:666 Millipore clone 4G10) in combination with goat anti-mouse-coupled HRP (Millipore, 1:12,500). The specificity of the anti-Tyr(P) antibodies was shown by competition of reactivity in the presence of 20 mm Tyr(P) or 20 mm each of Thr(P) and Ser(P). HRP was detected by chemiluminescence using the Immobilon Western blotting detection system (Millipore) and a digital camera (G-Box, Syngene, UK). About 50 μg of purified protein was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and in-gel digested with trypsin and/or V8 protease (25Borderies G. Jamet E. Lafitte C. Rossignol M. Jauneau A. Boudart G.

The resulting peptides were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using an Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Peptides were identified using Mascot software (version 2.2.03, Matrix Science, London, UK). For phosphopeptides, each MS/MS spectrum was manually inspected to ensure acceptable ion coverage and phosphorylation site identification (for details see supplemental Methods). The homology model of LYK3 kinase was built based on an alignment of the intracellular region of LYK3 (GenBankTM accession number CAM06621.1) with the IRAK-4 kinase sequence and on the protein crystal structure of IRAK-4 (Protein Data Bank code 2NRU) (2Wang Z.

The parameters and verification of the model were carried out as described (supplemental Methods). For MD simulations, models of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated kinase were soaked in a cubic box of water molecules and subjected to energy minimization and the equilibration step, followed by 7.3-ns long duration MD production using the AMBER8 program (University of California) with parameters for phosphorylated residues. The predicted architecture of LYK3 (16Arrighi J.F. Barre A. Ben Amor B. Bersoult A. Soriano L.C. Mirabella R. de Carvalho-Niebel F. Journet E.P. Ghérardi M. Huguet T. Geurts R. Dénarié J. Rougé P.

Science. 2003; 302: 630-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1A. The intracellular region (LYK3-IR, aa 257–620), containing a core protein kinase domain (aa 322–592), was used to search the Protein Data Bank using PSI_BLAST. Among all kinases for which the tridimensional structure is known, the human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) showed the closest sequence identity as follows: 33% over the alignment shown in Fig. 1B, in comparison with 32% for the plant Pto kinase (12Xing W. Zou Y. Liu Q. Liu J. Luo X. Huang Q. Chen S. Zhu L. Bi R. Hao Q. Wu J.W. Zhou J.M. Chai J. Nature. 2007; 449: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Highly conserved residues/motifs characteristic of all active kinases are identical in both the human and plant sequences, including the nucleotide-binding Gly-rich loop, a catalytic Lys in the “VAIK” phosphotransfer motif, the catalytic Asp in the HRD motif of the catalytic loop, and the DFG at the start of the activation segment (26Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar). The presence of the Arg in the HRD motif shows that both proteins are RD kinases (Fig. 1B). To determine whether kinase activity is required for the function of LYK3 in the development of root nodules in response to rhizobia bacteria (nodulation), site-directed mutagenesis was used to create specific mutants that were tested for both kinase activity and nodulation activity. The LYK3-IR was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was shown to have both autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities (Fig. 2A). Proteins containing mutations in each of four highly conserved kinase domain residues (Gly-334, Lys-349, Asp-441, and Gly-504; Fig. 1B) all lost both in vitro kinase activities, as expected (Fig. 2A). These mutants included one in the Gly-rich loop, G334E, which occurs in the strong lyk3-1 mutant allele (20Smit P. Limpens E. Geurts R. Fedorova E. Dolgikh E. Gough C. Bisseling T. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Wild-type and four LYK3 constructs containing the above mutations were then analyzed for their ability to complement the lyk3-1 mutant for nodulation activity (Fig. 2B); constructs of all four kinase-dead mutants failed to complement (Fig. 2C). To verify that the proteins were expressed, Western blot analysis showed that roots of at least 60% of the M. truncatula transgenic plants tested expressed the LYK3 proteins (data for the G344E mutant protein is shown in Fig. 2D). To check for correct subcellular localization, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) fusions of the wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in the N. benthamiana leaf expression system; all the proteins localized uniformly to a thin layer at the cell boundary (data for the G344E mutant protein is shown in Fig. 2E), identical to the localization of a plasma membrane marker labeled with mCherry (PM mCherry). This localization is different from a fluorescent protein cytosolic marker where the fluorescence is nonuniform at the cell boundary and also includes cytoplasmic strands and nuclei (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, both the wild-type LYK3 and the derived mutant proteins all localize to the plasma membrane. Together, the results suggest that kinase activity of LYK3 is required for its biological function. There is substantial evidence showing that IRAK/Pelle kinases and their plant RLK homologues are Ser/Thr kinases. Using antibodies to specific phosphorylated amino acids, we showed that the wild-type LYK3-IR protein, expressed in E. coli, is phosphorylated on both Ser and Thr residues (Fig. 3A). As the G334E mutant did not react with either of the antibodies, we can conclude that the phosphorylation of the wild-type LYK3 protein is due to autophosphorylation. To identify the phosphorylation sites, the wild-type protein was dephosphorylated by treatment with either λ-phosphatase or calf intestinal phosphatase and then rephosphorylated in vitro. The λ-phosphatase was more efficient in dephosphorylation, but the protein was not able to rephosphorylate during the time of the assay, whereas the calf intestinal phosphatase-treated protein successfully rephosphorylated (Fig. 3B). Both the untreated and the calf intestinal phosphatase-treated/rephosphorylated proteins were used for identification of the phosphorylated residues by LC-MS/MS analysis (supplemental Table S1). By using both trypsin and V8 protease digestion, almost 95% of the LYK3 sequence was covered in the MS spectra (Fig. 4). In total, the position of seven phosphorylated serines and eight phosphorylated threonines were identified (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S2). Seven of them were found in the juxtamembrane (JM) region, two in the C-terminal tail (C-tail), and five in the core kinase domain, including two threonines (Thr-472 and Thr-475) in the activation loop. In addition, two peptides suggested that the activation loop Ser-471 is also phosphorylated, although the phosphorylation position remains ambiguous (supplemental Fig. S2). It is noteworthy that phosphorylated Thr-433 was detected only after de- and rephosphorylation of the LYK3 kinase. This treatment of the protein also revealed that Tyr-283 in the JM region is a likely site of Tyr phosphorylation, although the phosphorylation position could not be confirmed with certainty by the LC-MS/MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). To further investigate this observation, the Tyr phosphorylation of a Y283F mutant protein was compared with the wild-type and to the kinase-dead G334E proteins using anti-phospho-Tyr antibodies. The antibodies did not react to the G334E protein, suggesting that the Tyr phosphorylation of the wild-type protein is due to autophosphorylation (Fig. 3C). The poor reactivity of the Y283F protein to the antibody suggests that Tyr-283 is a major site of Tyr phosphorylation but may not be the only site as weak reactivity was still observed (Fig. 3C). The antibodies used were highly specific as reactivity of the anti-phospho-Tyr antibody to the wild-type protein could be competed with Tyr(P) but not by Thr(P) and Ser(P) (Fig. 3D), and also the Y283F mutant still reacted like wild-type to the anti-phospho-Thr antibodies (Fig. 3C). Together, these results suggest that LYK3 has mixed Ser/Thr and Tyr kinase activity and autophosphorylates multiple Ser/Thr residues and probably at least two Tyr residues.FIGURE 4Autophosphorylation sites in the intracellular region of LYK3. The GST-LYK3-IR autophosphorylated protein was purified from E. coli, and the phosphoresidues were identified by LC-MS/MS. Identified phosphorylated residues of LYK3 are shaded and underlined; those that are ambiguous are not underlined. Regions not covered by the MS analysis are in gray.

Structure. 2006; 14: 1835-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to provide new insights into the architecture of the LYK3 kinase. In this structure (Protein Data Bank code 2NRU) two activation loop residues, Thr-345 and Ser-346, are phosphorylated (2Wang Z. Liu J. Sudom A. Ayres M. Li S. Wesche H. Powers J.P. Walker N.P. Structure. 2006; 14: 1835-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and both are required for full kinase activity (27Cheng H. Addona T. Keshishian H. Dahlstrand E.

To mimic the active state, the three identified phosphorylated residues in the activation loop of LYK3 (Ser-471, Thr-472, and Thr-475) were included in their phosphorylated forms. The model (Fig. 5A) shows the typical two-lobe structure of a kinase. The N-terminal lobe consists of the five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and the prominent α-helix, termed helix C (aa 355–369). The LYK3 model, similarly to the IRAK-4 fold, contains an N-terminal extension with an α-helix, (helix B, aa 311–319; Fig. 1B), which packs against the β-sheet. The characteristic Gly-rich loop (aa 329–334), which anchors the nontransferable phosphates of ATP, follows this region and is located between the first two β-strands. The N-terminal lobe is connected to the C-terminal one through a hinge loop that is immediately preceded by a tyrosine (Tyr-390), which is correctly located to play the role of the “gatekeeper,” controlling access to the back of the pocket. In the LYK3 model, Tyr-390 establishes a hydrogen bond with the highly conserved glutamate, Glu-362 (Fig. 5B). These two residues are part of a stable hydrogen bond network because Glu-362 also acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the nitrogen of the phenylalanine (Phe-460) backbone in the DFG motif (Fig. 5B). This network is identical to the one involving Tyr-262, Glu-233, and Phe-350 in the IRAK-4 crystal structure. The C-terminal lobe is formed by several α-helices, small flexible loops, and the larger activation segment (aa 459–487) containing the activation loop (aa 466–477). The structure of IRAK-4 in its active state revealed that Thr-345 is the prototypical phosphorylated residue of the activation loop that interacts with the arginine in the HRD motif of the catalytic loop (2Wang Z"

All such developments interact with the seabed to some degree and so a key need exists for suitable methodology to monitor the impacts of large-scale Marine Renewable Energy Installations (MREIs). Many of these will be situated on mixed or rocky substrata, where conventional methods to characterise the habitat are unsuitable. Traditional destructive sampling is also inappropriate in conservation terms, particularly as safety zones around (MREIs) could function as Marine Protected Areas, with positive benefits for biodiversity. Here we describe a technique developed to effectively monitor the impact of MREIs and report the results of its field testing, enabling large areas to be surveyed accurately and cost-effectively. The methodology is based on a high-definition video camera, plus LED lights and laser scale markers, mounted on a “flying array” that maintains itself above the seabed grounded by a length of chain, thus causing minimal damage. Samples are taken by slow-speed tows of the gear behind a boat (200 m transects). The HD video and randomly selected frame grabs are analysed to quantify species distribution. The equipment was tested over two years in Lyme Bay, UK (25 m depth), then subsequently successfully deployed in demanding conditions at the deep (>50 m) high-energy Wave Hub site off Cornwall, UK, and a potential tidal stream energy site in Guernsey, Channel Islands (1.5 ms−1 current), the first time remote samples from such a habitat have been achieved. The next stage in the monitoring development process is described, involving the use of Remote Operated Vehicles to survey the seabed post-deployment of MREI devices. The complete methodology provides the first quantitative, relatively non-destructive method for monitoring mixed-substrate benthic communities beneath MPAs and MREIs pre- and post-device deployment."
https://openalex.org/W1995374735,"T-box transcription factors figure prominently in embryonic cardiac cell lineage specifications. Mesenchymal precursor cells expressing Tbx18 give rise to the heart's pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (SAN). We sought to identify targets of TBX18 transcriptional regulation in the heart by forced adenoviral overexpression in postnatal cardiomyocytes. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) transduced with GFP showed sarcolemmal, punctate Cx43 expression. In contrast, TBX18-transduced NRCMs exhibited sparse Cx43 expression. Both the transcript and protein levels of Cx43 were greatly down-regulated within 2 days of TBX18 transduction. Direct injection of TBX18 in the guinea pig heart in vivo inhibited Cx43 expression. The repressor activity of TBX18 on Cx43 was highly specific; protein levels of Cx45 and Cx40, which comprise the main gap junctions in the SAN and conduction system, were unchanged by TBX18. A reporter-based promoter assay demonstrated that TBX18 directly represses the Cx43 promoter. Phenotypically, TBX18-NRCMs exhibited slowed intercellular calcein dye transfer kinetics (421 ± 54 versus control 127 ± 43 ms). Intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations in control NRCM monolayers were highly synchronized. In contrast, TBX18 overexpression led to asynchronous Ca(2+) oscillations, demonstrating reduced cell-cell coupling. Decreased coupling led to slow electrical propagation; conduction velocity in TBX18 NRCMs slowed by more than 50% relative to control (2.9 ± 0.5 versus 14.3 ± 0.9 cm/s). Taken together, TBX18 specifically and directly represses Cx43 transcript and protein levels. Cx43 suppression leads to significant electrical uncoupling, but the preservation of other gap junction proteins supports slow action potential propagation, recapitulating a key phenotypic hallmark of the SAN."
https://openalex.org/W1996348903,"Variability in cell-to-cell behavior within clonal populations can be attributed to the inherent stochasticity of biochemical reactions. Most single-cell studies have examined variation in behavior due to randomness in gene transcription. Here we investigate the mechanism of cell fate choice and the origin of cell-to-cell variation during mitotic arrest, when transcription is silenced. Prolonged mitotic arrest is commonly observed in cells treated with anti-mitotic drugs. Cell fate during mitotic arrest is determined by two alternative pathways, one promoting cell death, the other promoting cyclin B1 degradation, which leads to mitotic slippage and survival. It has been unclear whether these pathways are mechanistically coupled or independent. In this study we experimentally uncoupled these two pathways using zVAD-fmk to block cell death or Cdc20 knockdown to block slippage. We then used time-lapse imaging to score the kinetics of single cells adopting the remaining fate. We also used kinetic simulation to test whether the behaviors of death versus slippage in cell populations where both pathways are active can be quantitatively recapitulated by a model that assumes stochastic competition between the pathways. Our data are well fit by a model where the two pathways are mechanistically independent, and cell fate is determined by a stochastic kinetic competition between them that results in cell-to-cell variation."
https://openalex.org/W2055470287,"Background Early detection and treatment of tuberculosis cases are the hallmark of successful tuberculosis control. We conducted a cross-sectional study at public primary health facilities in Kampala city, Uganda to quantify diagnostic delay among pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, assess associated factors, and describe trajectories of patients' health care seeking. Methodology/Principal Findings Semi-structured interviews with new smear-positive PTB patients (≥15 years) registered for treatment. Between April 2007 and April 2008, 253 patients were studied. The median total delay was 8 weeks (IQR 4–12), median patient delay was 4 weeks (inter-quartile range [IQR] 1–8) and median health service delay was 4 weeks (IQR 2–8). Long total delay (>14 weeks) was observed for 61/253 (24.1%) of patients, long health service delay (>6 weeks) for 71/242 (29.3%) and long patient delay (>8 weeks) for 47/242 (19.4%). Patients who knew that TB was curable were less likely to have long total delay (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 0.28; 95%CI 0.11–0.73) and long patient delay (aOR 0.36; 95%CI 0.13–0.97). Being female (aOR 1.98; 95%CI 1.06–3.71), staying for more than 5 years at current residence (aOR 2.24 95%CI 1.18–4.27) and having been tested for HIV before (aOR 3.72; 95%CI 1.42–9.75) was associated with long health service delay. Health service delay contributed 50% of the total delay. Ninety-one percent (231) of patients had visited one or more health care providers before they were diagnosed, for an average (median) of 4 visits (range 1–30). All but four patients had systemic symptoms by the time the diagnosis of TB was made. Conclusions/Significance Diagnostic delay among tuberculosis patients in Kampala is common and long. This reflects patients waiting too long before seeking care and health services waiting until systemic symptoms are present before examining sputum smears; this results in missed opportunities for diagnosis."

We identified 24 ER membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligases and found Nixin/ZNRF4 to be central for the regulation of calnexin turnover. Ectopic expression of wild type Nixin induced a dramatic down-regulation of the ER-localized chaperone calnexin that was prevented by inactivation of the Nixin RING domain. Importantly, Nixin physically interacts with calnexin in a glycosylation-independent manner, induces calnexin ubiquitination, and p97-dependent degradation, indicating an ER-associated degradation-like mechanism of calnexin turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2094340377,"The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1984011934,"The mannose receptor (MR) is an endocytic type I membrane molecule with a broad ligand specificity that is involved in both hemostasis and pathogen recognition. Membrane-anchored MR is cleaved by a metalloproteinase into functional soluble MR (sMR) composed of the extracellular domains of intact MR. Although sMR production was initially considered a constitutive process, enhanced MR shedding has been observed in response to the fungal pathogen Pneumocystis carinii. In this work, we have investigated the mechanism mediating enhanced MR shedding in response to fungi. We show that other fungal species, including Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, together with zymosan, a preparation of the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mimic the effect of P. carinii on sMR production and that this effect takes place mainly through β-glucan recognition. Additionally, we demonstrate that MR cleavage in response to C. albicans and bioactive particulate β-glucan requires expression of dectin-1. Our data, obtained using specific inhibitors, are consistent with the canonical Syk-mediated pathway triggered by dectin-1 being mainly responsible for inducing MR shedding, with Raf-1 being partially involved. As in the case of steady-state conditions, MR shedding in response to C. albicans and β-glucan particles requires metalloprotease activity. The induction of MR shedding by dectin-1 has clear implications for the role of MR in fungal recognition, as sMR was previously shown to retain the ability to bind fungal pathogens and can interact with numerous host molecules, including lysosomal hydrolases. Thus, MR cleavage could also impact on the magnitude of inflammation during fungal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2001942289,"Dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a public health problem in many tropical countries. Recent clinical data have shown an association between levels of different chemokines in plasma and severity of dengue. We evaluated the role of CC chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2 and CCR4 in an experimental model of DENV-2 infection in mice. Infection of mice induced evident clinical disease and tissue damage, including thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration, lymphopenia, increased levels of transaminases and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and lethality in WT mice. Importantly, infected WT mice presented increased levels of chemokines CCL2/JE, CCL3/MIP-1α and CCL5/RANTES in spleen and liver. CCR1⁻/⁻ mice had a mild phenotype with disease presentation and lethality similar to those of WT mice. In CCR2⁻/⁻ mice, lethality, liver damage, levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ, and leukocyte activation were attenuated. However, thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration and systemic TNF-α levels were similar to infected WT mice. Infection enhanced levels of CCL17/TARC, a CCR4 ligand. In CCR4⁻/⁻ mice, lethality, tissue injury and systemic inflammation were markedly decreased. Despite differences in disease presentation in CCR-deficient mice, there was no significant difference in viral load. In conclusion, activation of chemokine receptors has discrete roles in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. These studies suggest that the chemokine storm that follows severe primary dengue infection associates mostly to development of disease rather than protection."

This study aimed to determine the frequency of delivery and newborn-care practices in southern Tanzania, where neonatal mortality is higher than the national average. All households in five districts of Southern Tanzania were approached to participate. Of 213,220 female residents aged 13-49 years, 92% participated. Cross-sectional, retrospective data on childbirth and newborn care practices were collected from 22,243 female respondents who had delivered a live baby in the preceding year. Health facility deliveries accounted for 41% of births, with nearly all non-facility deliveries occurring at home (57% of deliveries). Skilled attendants assisted 40% of births. Over half of women reported drying the baby and over a third reported wrapping the baby within 5 minutes of delivery. The majority of mothers delivering at home reported that they had made preparations for delivery, including buying soap (84%) and preparing a cloth for drying the child (85%). Although 95% of these women reported that the cord was cut with a clean razor blade, only half reported that it was tied with a clean thread. Furthermore, out of all respondents 10% reported that their baby was dipped in cold water immediately after delivery, around two-thirds reported bathing their babies within 6 hours of delivery, and 28% reported putting something on the cord to help it dry. Skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby after delivery was rarely practiced. Although 83% of women breastfed within 24 hours of delivery, only 18% did so within an hour. Fewer than half of women exclusively breastfed in the three days after delivery. The findings suggest a need to promote and facilitate health facility deliveries, hygienic delivery practices for home births, delayed bathing and immediate and exclusive breastfeeding in Southern Tanzania to improve newborn health."
https://openalex.org/W2068606587,"P2X(7) receptors are important in mediating the physiological functions of extracellular ATP, and altered receptor expression and function have a causative role in the disease pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the mechanisms determining the P2X(7) receptor function by following two human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations that replace His-155 and Ala-348 in the human (h) P2X(7) receptor with the corresponding residues, Tyr-155 and Thr-348, in the rat (r) P2X(7) receptor. H155Y and A348T mutations in the hP2X(7) receptor increased ATP-induced currents, whereas the reciprocal mutations, Y155H and T348A, in the rP2X(7) receptor caused the opposite effects. Such a functional switch is a compelling indication that these residues are critical for P2X(7) receptor function. Additional mutations of His-155 and Ala-348 in the hP2X(7) receptor to residues with diverse side chains revealed a different dependence on the side chain properties, supporting the specificity of these two residues. Substitutions of the residues surrounding His-155 and Ala-348 in the hP2X(7) receptor with the equivalent ones in the rP2X(7) receptor also affected ATP-induced currents but were not fully reminiscent of the H155Y and A348T effects. Immunofluorescence imaging and biotin labeling assays showed that H155Y in the hP2X(7) receptor increased and Y155H in the rP2X(7) receptor decreased cell-surface expression. Such contrasting effects were not obvious with the reciprocal mutations of residue 348. Taken together, our results suggest that residues at positions 155 and 348 contribute to P2X(7) receptor function via determining the surface expression and the single-channel function, respectively. Such interpretations are consistent with the locations of the residues in the structural model of the hP2X(7) receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2078361688,"Although there is increasing evidence suggesting that there may be subtle abnormalities in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) patients using modern neuroimaging techniques, most of these previous studies focused on the brain grey matter, leaving the underlying white matter abnormalities in IGE largely unknown, which baffles the treatment as well as the understanding of IGE. In this work, we adopted multiple methods from different levels based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze the white matter abnormalities in 14 young male IGE patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) only, comparing with 29 age-matched male healthy controls. First, we performed a voxel-based analysis (VBA) of the fractional anisotropy (FA) images derived from DTI. Second, we used a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) method to explore the alterations within the white matter skeleton of the patients. Third, we adopted region-of-interest (ROI) analyses based on the findings of VBA and TBSS to further confirm abnormal brain regions in the patients. At last, considering the convergent evidences we found by VBA, TBSS and ROI analyses, a subsequent probabilistic fiber tractography study was performed to investigate the abnormal white matter connectivity in the patients. Significantly decreased FA values were consistently observed in the cerebellum of patients, providing fresh evidence and new clues for the important role of cerebellum in IGE with GTCS."
https://openalex.org/W2078318769,"Background The Hedgehog (Hh)-signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of multiple vertebrate and invertebrate organ systems. Gli transcription factors are regulated by Hh-signaling and act as downstream effectors of the pathway to activate Hh-target genes. Understanding the requirements for Hh-signaling in organisms can be gained by assessing Gli activity in a spatial and temporal fashion. Methodology/Principal Findings We have generated a Gli-dependent (Gli-d) transgenic line, Tg(Gli-d:mCherry), that allows for rapid and simple detection of Hh-responding cell populations in both live and fixed zebrafish. This transgenic line expresses a mCherry reporter under the control of a Gli responsive promoter, which can be followed by using fluorescent microscopy and in situ hybridization. Expression of the mCherry transgene reporter during embryogenesis and early larval development faithfully replicated known expression domains of Hh-signaling in zebrafish, and abrogating Hh-signaling in transgenic fish resulted in the suppression of reporter expression. Moreover, ectopic shh expression in Tg(Glid:mCherry) fish led to increased transgene production. Using this transgenic line we investigated the nature of Hh-pathway response during early craniofacial development and determined that the neural crest skeletal precursors do not directly respond to Hh-signaling prior to 48 hours post fertilization, suggesting that earlier requirements for pathway activation in this population of facial skeleton precursors are indirect. Conclusion/Significance We have determined that early Hh-signaling requirements in craniofacial development are indirect. We further demonstrate the Tg(Gli-d:mCherry) fish are a highly useful tool for studying Hh-signaling dependent processes during embryogenesis and larval stages."
https://openalex.org/W2010050096,"Tumor suppressor RASSF1A (RAS association domain family 1, isoform A) is known to play an important role in regulation of mitosis; however, little is known about how RASSF1A is regulated during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. In the present study, we have identified Cullin-4A (CUL4A) as a novel E3 ligase for RASSF1A. Our results demonstrate that DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) functions as a substrate adaptor that directly interacts with RASSF1A and bridges RASSF1A to the CUL4A E3 ligase complex. Depletion of DDB1 also diminishes intracellular interactions between RASSF1A and CUL4A. Our results also show that RASSF1A interacts with DDB1 via a region containing amino acids 165–200, and deletion of this region abolishes RASSF1A and DDB1 interactions. We have found that CUL4A depletion results in increased levels of RASSF1A protein due to increased half-life; whereas overexpression of CUL4A and DDB1 markedly enhances RASSF1A protein ubiquitination resulting in reduced RASSF1A levels. We further show that CUL4A-mediated RASSF1A degradation occurs during mitosis, and depletion of CUL4A markedly reverses mitotic-phase-stimulated RASSF1A degradation. We also note that overexpression of CUL4A antagonizes the ability of RASSF1A to induce M-phase cell cycle arrest. Thus, our present study demonstrates that the CUL4A·DDB1 E3 complex is important for regulation of RASSF1A during mitosis, and it may contribute to inactivation of RASSF1A and promoting cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2007060179,"Exogenous stem cell delivery is under investigation to prevent and treat cardiac dysfunction. It is less studied as to the extent endogenous bone marrow derived stem cells contribute to cardiac homeostais in response to stress and the affects of aging on this stress response.To determine the role of bone marrow (BM) derived stem cells on cardiac homeostasis in response to pressure overload (PO) and how this response is altered by aging.Young (8 weeks) and old (>40 weeks) C57/b6 mice underwent homo- and heterochronic BM transplantation prior to transverse aortic constriction (TAC). We found that older BM is associated with decreased cardiac function following TAC. This decreased function is associated with decrease in BM cell engraftment, increased myocyte apoptosis, decreased myocyte hypertrophy, increased myocardial fibrosis and decreased cardiac function. Additionally, there is a decrease in activation of resident cells within the heart in response to PO in old mice. Interestingly, these effects are not due to alterations in vascular density or inflammation in response to PO or differences in ex vivo stem cell migration between young and old mice.BM derived stem cells are activated in response to cardiac PO, and the recruitment of BM derived cells are involved in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and maintenance of function in response to PO which is lost with aging."
https://openalex.org/W2030792479,"The renal-specific Na-K-2Cl co-transporter, NKCC2, plays a pivotal role in regulating body salt levels and blood pressure. NKCC2 mutations lead to type I Bartter syndrome, a life-threatening kidney disease. Regulation of NKCC2 trafficking behavior serves as a major mechanism in controlling NKCC2 activity across the plasma membrane. However, the identities of the protein partners involved in cell surface targeting of NKCC2 are largely unknown. To gain insight into these processes, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a kidney cDNA library for proteins that interact with the NKCC2 C terminus.

SCAMP2 associated also with the structurally related co-transporter NCC, suggesting that the interaction with SCAMP2 is a common feature of sodium-dependent chloride co-transporters. Heterologous expression of SCAMP2 specifically decreased cell surface abundance as well as transport activity of NKCC2 across the plasma membrane. Co-immunolocalization experiments revealed that intracellularly retained NKCC2 co-localizes with SCAMP2 in recycling endosomes. The rate of NKCC2 endocytic retrieval, assessed by the sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate cleavage assay, was not affected by SCAMP2. The surface-biotinylatable fraction of newly inserted NKCC2 in the plasma membrane was reduced by SCAMP2, demonstrating that SCAMP2-induced decrease in surface NKCC2 is due to decreased exocytotic trafficking. Finally, a single amino acid mutation, cysteine 201 to alanine, within the conserved cytoplasmic E peptide of SCAMP2, which is believed to regulate exocytosis, abolished SCAMP2-mediated down-regulation of the co-transporter.

IntroductionNKCC2 is an Na-K-2Cl co-transporter protein expressed exclusively in the mammalian kidney, where it provides the major route for sodium/chloride transport across the apical plasma membrane of the thick ascending limb (1Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). NKCC2 is therefore a pivotal protein in renal function, and exquisitely tight regulation of the apical co-transporter activity is paramount for maintaining extracellular fluid volume and acid-base homeostasis (2Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). It is the target of loop-diuretics extensively used in the treatment of edematous states and hypertension (3Gamba G. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1606-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent work implicates NKCC2 in the dysfunction of blood pressure regulation, raising new hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms behind some types of essential hypertension (4Ashton N. J. Hypertens. 2006; 24: 2355-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 5Richardson C. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3293-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 6Gamba G. Am. J.

Most importantly, inactivating mutations of the NKCC2 gene in humans causes Bartter syndrome type 1, a life-threatening kidney disease (8Simon D.B. Lifton R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F961-F966PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite this importance, little is known about NKCC2 regulation in renal cells, mainly because of the difficulty in expressing the co-transporter protein in mammalian cells (9Mount D.B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2006; 290: F606-F607Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As a consequence, although several studies have addressed various aspects of NKCC2 regulation (2Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 7Flatman P.W. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2008; 17: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Mount D.B. Am.

Chem. 2009; 284: 35348-35358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane trafficking of NKCC2 proteins in mammalian cells, in particular its regulation by protein-protein interactions, remain poor. Identifying and functionally characterizing a key and/or global protein interaction(s) and pathway(s) involved in the regulation of NKCC2 trafficking is important to understand its different physiological functions and dysfunctions.NKCC2 belongs to the cation-chloride co-transporter (CCC) 3The abbreviations used are: CCC, cation-chloride co-transporter; TAL, thick ascending limb; MTAL, medullary TAL; CTAL, cortical TAL; EGFP, enhanced GFP; OKP, opossum kidney; aa, amino acid(s); NCC, NaCl co-transporter; HEK, human embryonic kidney; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; NHE, Na+-H+ exchanger; MesNA, sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate; TGN, trans-Golgi network. family, which comprises two principal branches of membrane proteins (1Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). One branch includes the Na+-dependent chloride co-transporters composed of the Na+-K+-2Cl− co-transporters (NKCC1 and NKCC2) and the Na+-Cl− co-transporter (NCC). The second branch includes the Na+-independent K+-Cl− co-transporters. Members within this family are very homologous to one another, possessing 12 transmembrane-spanning domains, an N terminus of variable length, and a long cytoplasmic C terminus (2Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Given that the C-terminal domain of NKCC2 is the predominant cytoplasmic region, it is likely to be a major factor in the trafficking of the NKCC2 protein. In support of this notion, we recently demonstrated that a highly conserved motif at the COOH terminus dictates endoplasmic reticulum exit and cell surface expression of NKCC2 (11Zaarour N. Demaretz S. Defontaine N. Mordasini D. Laghmani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21752-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, there have been several reports demonstrating that the trafficking to the apical membrane of several ion transport systems depend upon protein-protein interactions involving their extreme C terminus (13Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F425-F429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, deleting the last three residues of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator chloride channel C terminus prevents its interactions with CAL, CAP70, and NHERF proteins and results in aberrant basolateral accumulation of the mutant protein (14Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The interaction of NHERF proteins with the NHE-3 C terminus regulates the trafficking of the exchanger protein to the apical surface of proximal tubule cells (17Donowitz M. Cha B. Zachos N.C. Brett C.L. Sharma A. Tse C.M. Li X. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). PDZ interactions mediated through the C-terminal tail of the Na-Pi co-transporter control its correct targeting to the renal proximal tubular brush border (18Hernando N. Déliot N. Gisler S.M. Lederer E. Weinman E.J. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11957-11962Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Similar to NHE-3, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator chloride channel, and Na-Pi, NKCC2 surface expression is also subject to regulation by intracellular protein trafficking (19Giménez I. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26946-26951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Ortiz P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal.

Chem. 2009; 284: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the protein-binding partners that control membrane sorting of NKCC2. More specifically, the identities of the protein partners of NKCC2 that orchestrate its exocytic insertion, endocytic retrieval, and recycling to and from the plasma membrane are scarcely known. Accordingly, identifying proteins that interact with the C-terminal tail of NKCC2 should help to further determine the mechanisms of regulated NKCC2 trafficking. In this report, we describe a novel protein-protein interaction between the C-terminal tail of NKCC2 and SCAMP2. SCAMP2 belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved tetraspanning integral membrane proteins (22Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To date, five isoforms of SCAMP (SCAMP1 to -5) have been identified in mammals and have been shown to be predominantly associated with recycling rather than degradation pathways (23Castle A. Castle D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3769-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Han C. Chen T. Yang M. Li N. Liu H. Cao X. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12752-12756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Indeed, SCAMPs are found mainly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endosomes and have been shown to play a role in endocytosis (26Fernández-Chacón R. Achiriloaie M. Janz R. Albanesi J.P. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12752-12756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and exocytosis (27Guo Z. Liu L. Cafiso D. Castle D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35357-35363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Liao H. Ellena J. Liu L. Szabo G. Cafiso D. Castle D. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10909-10920Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we show that SCAMP2 regulates the cell surface targeting of NKCC2 by controlling its exocytosis, revealing therefore a novel regulatory mechanism governing the trafficking of the co-transporter to the apical membrane.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified SCAMP2 as a novel interacting partner of NKCC2 through yeast two-hybrid screening of a human kidney cDNA library. Our results indicate that SCAMP2 interaction with NKCC2 is specific and depends on the first 108 aa of the co-transporter C terminus. SCAMP2 binds also to the structurally related co-transporter NCC (2Gamba G. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 423-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction with SCAMP2 is a common feature of Na+-dependent Cl− co-transporters. Functional studies demonstrated that co-expression of SCAMP2 specifically decreases NKCC2 transport activity by promoting its intracellular retention and therefore reducing its abundance at the cell surface. SCAMP2-induced decrease in surface NKCC2 is due to decreased exocytic insertion.SCAMP2 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved tetraspanning integral membrane proteins, which function as a carrier to the cell surface in post-Golgi recycling pathways (23Castle A. Castle D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3769-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 57Fernández-Chacón R. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7941-7950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we showed evidence for the specific binding of SCAMP2 to NKCC2. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we were able to detect the interaction in vivo between full-length NKCC2 and endogenous SCAMP2 protein in renal cells. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis, we observed that NKCC2 interaction with SCAMP2 is specific to the proximal region of the NKCC2 C terminus. This proximal region is highly conserved at the C termini of the Na+-coupled Cl−-co-transporters NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC. Accordingly, we were also able to show that SCAMP2 interacts with NCC. In contrast, ClC-5 and pendrin, two kidney chloride transporters (34Steinmeyer K. Schwappach B. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31172-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 35Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) that are not structurally related to the CCC family, failed to co-immunoprecipitate with SCAMP2, further supporting the specificity of the interaction of SCAMP2 with NCC and NKCC2 in renal cells. To identify the subcellular site of interaction of SCAMP2 with NKCC2, we visualized the subcellular distribution of the two proteins using confocal microscopy. NKCC2 and SCAMP2 showed considerable co-localization with endogenous Rab11, a commonly used marker of recycling endosomes (41Green E.G. Ramm E. Riley N.M. Spiro D.J. Goldenring J.R.

However, Rab11 has also been found to be associated with the TGN and post-Golgi vesicles (48Urbé S. Huber L.A. Zerial M. Tooze S.A. Parton R.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 58Satoh A.K. O'Tousa J.E. Ozaki K. Ready D.F. Development. 2005; 132: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), indicating that the site of interaction between SCAMP2 and NKCC2 could be identified as recycling endosomes and/or TGN membranes. Because SCAMP2 and NKCC2 also co-localized with internalized transferrin, our data are consistent with the view that NKCC2 interacts with SCAMP2 in recycling endosomes. They are in agreement with a previous study showing that the internalized transferrin-containing vesicles are fused with a pre-existing internal pool of SCAMP-positive membranes and then accumulate in the SCAMP-rich perinuclear region corresponding to the recycling endosomal compartment (23Castle A. Castle D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3769-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Also, a recent study by Diering and co-workers (59Diering G.H. Church J. Numata M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13892-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reported considerable co-localization of SCAMP2 with Rab11 in recycling endosomes.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28901-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SCAMP2-positive compartments contain the lipid raft marker follitin, supporting the idea that these structures could be also recycling endosomes. Thus, these findings together with our own suggest strongly that SCAMP2 interacts with NKCC2 in recycling endosomes. Of note, the co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both immature and mature forms of NKCC2 interact with SCAMP2, which may serve as an indication that in addition to recycling endosomes, NKCC2 may also interact with SCAMP2 in other intracellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum. This possibility is further supported by previous observations reporting partial co-localization of NKCC2 (11Zaarour N. Demaretz S. Defontaine N. Mordasini D. Laghmani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21752-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and SCAMP2 (33Lin P.J. Williams W.P. Luu Y. Molday R.S. Orlowski J. Numata M. J.

However, some high mannose glycosylated proteins (immature) that are trafficked to the cell surface traverse the Golgi apparatus without further processing (61Vagin O. Kraut J.A. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F459-F469Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As a consequence, for several membrane proteins, both immature and mature forms were detected at the plasma membranes (60Müller H.K. Wiborg O. Haase J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28901-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 62Johns T.G. Mellman I. Cartwright G.A. Ritter G. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Scott A.M.

Although only the mature form of NKCC2 is able to reach the cell surface, it is conceivable that, at least when using protein overexpression (62Johns T.G. Mellman I. Cartwright G.A. Ritter G. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Scott A.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a portion of immature wild type NKCC2 is delivered to post-Golgi compartments, including the TGN and recycling endosomes. Indeed, several reports provided evidence that recycling endosomes play a direct role in the biosynthetic pathway by serving as an intermediate during transport from the Golgi to cell plasma membranes (65Ang A.L. Taguchi T. Francis S. Fölsch H. Murrells L.J. Pypaert M. Warren G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 66Cresawn K.O. Potter B.A. Oztan A.

Renal. Physiol. 2006; 291: F707-F713Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These observations therefore raise the possibility of an interaction between the immature form of NKCC2 and SCAMP2 in the recycling endosomes and/or the TGN. Nevertheless, regardless of the site of such an interaction, we did not observe any effect of SCAMP2 co-expression on immature NKCC2 protein. In contrast, we showed evidence that SCAMP2 is specifically involved in the regulation of the intracellular trafficking of the mature form of the co-transporter protein.In support of trafficking as a regulator of NKCC2, previous immunolocalization experiments revealed that NKCC2 is expressed not only at the cell surface but also in a population of subapical vesicles (55Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, using immunocytochemistry, we showed a similar subcellular localization of NKCC2 proteins in cultured renal cells. When expressed alone, NKCC2 was detected at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments. In contrast, in cells co-expressing SCAMP2, we observed enhanced intracellular accumulation of NKCC2 and a consequent reduction in the expression of the co-transporter at the cell surface. Indeed, upon SCAMP2 co-expression, a significant fraction of NKCC2 disappeared from the cell membrane and clustered in an intracellular location, where it exhibited excellent co-localization with SCAMP2. These data suggested that SCAMP2 binding alters NKCC2 trafficking to the cell surface. To corroborate this observation, we used surface biotinylation and showed that the co-transporter expression at the cell surface was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion by SCAMP2 in HEK and OKP cells. To investigate whether a general disruption of vesicular trafficking in our cultured renal cells may underlie the SCAMP2 effect, we studied the effect of SCAMP2 on ClC-5, because this kidney chloride transporter is also expressed at the plasma membrane and in recycling endosomes (50Thakker R.V. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 787-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 51Mohammad-Panah R. Harrison R. Dhani S. Ackerley C. Huan L.J. Wang Y. Bear C.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54996-55007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast to NKCC2, overexpressed SCAMP2 protein did not interact with ClC-5 and had no effect on ClC-5 surface expression. Hence, these data suggest that the SCAMP2-V5 construct does not generally disturb trafficking of membrane proteins to and from the plasma membrane. Instead, it appears to specifically alter NKCC2 shuttling by interfering with its transit through recycling endosomes. Additional evidence for the specificity of SCAMP2 action on NKCC2 stems from the observation that SCAMP2 did not influence the distribution of Rab11 and internalized transferrin. Moreover, the specificity of SCAMP2-induced down-regulation of NKCC2 surface expression is also supported by a previous report demonstrating that NHE-5 interaction with overexpressed SCAMP2 in recycling endosomes promotes the cell surface targeting of the exchanger protein (59Diering G.H. Church J. Numata M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13892-13903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest strongly that SCAMP2 specifically regulates NKCC2 transit through recycling endosomes to inhibit its cell surface targeting.SCAMP2-induced down-regulation of NKCC2 membrane abundance could arise from a decrease in NKCC2 exocytosis to the plasma membrane and/or to an increase of NKCC2 endocytosis. To measure NKCC2 endocytic internalization, we prelabeled NKCC2 with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and then measured the ability of SCAMP2 to cause NKCC2 to shift to a location where the disulfide bond would be protected from MesNa. The results showed that 36 and 58% of surface NKCC2 is internalized over 15 and 30 min, respectively, and that SCAMP2 co-expression had no effect on the process. Hence, these studies suggest that the SCAMP2 effect on the amount of NKCC2 at the cell surface is not due to increased endocytotic internalization. To measure exocytic insertion of NKCC2, we preblocked surface proteins and then measured the ability to label new surface NKCC2 with biotin in the presence or absence of SCAMP2. The results showed that SCAMP2 induced a decrease in the exocytic insertion of NKCC2 into the plasma membrane. Studies by other investigators have shown that the function of SCAMP2 in regulated exocytosis involves the E peptide, a highly conserved segment lying at the cytosolic surface of the molecule and linking the second and the third transmembrane domains (22Hubbard C. Singleton D. Rauch M. Jayasinghe S. Cafiso D. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2933-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In particular, two residues within the E peptide, Cys201 and Trp202, were found to play a crucial role in this process (27Guo Z. Liu L. Cafiso D. Castle D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35357-35363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 56Liu L. Guo Z. Tieu Q. Castle A. Castle D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4266-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present work, individual mutation of cysteine 201 to alanine reversed SCAMP2-mediated down-regulation of NKCC2. Remarkably, SCAMP2 mutant was able to co-immunoprecipitate with NKCC2 protein, implying that SCAMP2 interaction with NKCC2, per se, is not sufficient to alter the co-transporter surface expression. A similar mechanism has been reported in the regulation of SERT by SCAMP2 (60Müller H.K. Wiborg O. Haase J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28901-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, the authors of the latter study demonstrated that a point mutation in Cys201 abolishes SCAMP2-mediated reduction in the cell surface expression and activity of SERT without disturbing the interactions between the proteins. The precise molecular determinants of NKCC2 interaction with SCAMP2 remain to be resolved. Nevertheless, regardless of the mechanisms involved in such interactions, our data clearly indicate that SCAMP2 decreases exocytotic trafficking of NKCC2, thereby down-regulating the co-transporter abundance in the plasma membrane, an effect for which the SCAMP2 cysteine 201 residue is required.Our findings implicate a role for SCAMP2 in the regulation of NKCC2 trafficking. However, very few if any proteins work in isolation. Appropriately, one may reasonably postulate that SCAMP2 works in concert with other NKCC2-binding proteins to create a synergetic effect on the co-transporter expression. In support of this idea, functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the C-terminal truncated isoform of NKCC2 reduced the co-transporter activity by preventing its arrival to the plasma membrane (68Meade P. Hoover R.S. Plata C. Vázquez N. Bobadilla N.A. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2003; 284: F1145-F1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously obtained evidence that aldolase binding to the proximal region of NKCC2 C terminus reduces NKCC2 surface expression (29Benziane B. Demaretz S. Defontaine N. Zaarour N. Cheval L. Bourgeois S. Klein C. Froissart M. Blanchard A. Paillard M. Gamba G. Houillier P. Laghmani K. J. Biol.

Additionally, the detection of NKCC2 proteins in Rab11-positive compartments, described here for the first time, may open new and important possibilities for studying the endocytic recycling and/or biosynthetic exocytotic membrane traffic of the co-transporter. Rab11, a small GTPase, is known to facilitate the recycling of membrane proteins from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane (47Jones M.C. Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in recycling, several reports suggested a ro"

https://openalex.org/W2108366332,"How do we estimate time when watching an action? The idea that events are timed by a centralized clock has recently been called into question in favour of distributed, specialized mechanisms. Here we provide evidence for a critical specialization: animate and inanimate events are separately timed by humans.In different experiments, observers were asked to intercept a moving target or to discriminate the duration of a stationary flash while viewing different scenes. Time estimates were systematically shorter in the sessions involving human characters moving in the scene than in those involving inanimate moving characters. Remarkably, the animate/inanimate context also affected randomly intermingled trials which always depicted the same still character.The existence of distinct time bases for animate and inanimate events might be related to the partial segregation of the neural networks processing these two categories of objects, and could enhance our ability to predict critically timed actions."
https://openalex.org/W2056920628,"The cholera toxin B pentamer (CtxB(5)), which belongs to the AB(5) toxin family, is used as a model study for protein assembly. The effect of the pH on the reassembly of the toxin was investigated using immunochemical, electrophoretic and spectroscopic methods. Three pH-dependent steps were identified during the toxin reassembly: (i) acquisition of a fully assembly-competent fold by the CtxB monomer, (ii) association of CtxB monomer into oligomers, (iii) acquisition of the native fold by the CtxB pentamer. The results show that CtxB(5) and the related heat labile enterotoxin LTB(5) have distinct mechanisms of assembly despite sharing high sequence identity (84%) and almost identical atomic structures. The difference can be pinpointed to four histidines which are spread along the protein sequence and may act together. Thus, most of the toxin B amino acids appear negligible for the assembly, raising the possibility that assembly is driven by a small network of amino acids instead of involving all of them."

Similarly, silencing of ribosomal L3 genes in Nicotiana tabacum resulted in significant alterations in plant growth, development, and ribosome biogenesis (37Popescu S.C. Tumer N.E. Plant J. 2004; 39: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, PIGGYBACK genes encoding 60S ribosomal proteins L10a, L9, and L5, specifically affect leaf patterning and development (38Pinon V. Etchells J.P. Rossignol P. Collier S.A. Arroyo J.M.

Mutations in genes encoding important factors for plant 60S ribosome maturation, such as AtNUC-L1, -L2, and PARL1, caused similar morphological and developmental defects to those for 60S ribosomal proteins (39Petricka J.J.

Although several genes involved in ribosomal protein biogenesis have been identified in Arabidopsis and rice (supplemental Table S1), few have been characterized. Like yeast and mammals, plants may also contain modules for ribosome biogenesis. YawG subfamily proteins represent important candidates for this process; however, despite increasing knowledge regarding the functional roles played by these proteins, plant homologs remain to be characterized. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of OsNug2 and AtNug2, orthologs of yeast Nug2 essential for pre-60S ribosomal subunit maturation, in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively. These proteins exhibit intrinsic GTPase activity and OsNug2 can rescue a lethal yeast nug2 null mutant. Through yeast two-hybrid screening of a rice cDNA library, OsL10a was identified as a putative 60S ribosomal protein. In particular, the GTP-bound form of OsNug2 shows increased affinity for the ribosome. A growth-defective phenotype of an AtNug2 knock-down mutant grown on medium containing cycloheximide (CHX) 4The abbreviations used are: CHXcycloheximideSCsynthetic completeFWfresh weightGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. seems to be caused by lower translational efficiency resulting from a failure in pre-60S processing. Thus, this work reveals that both OsNug2 and AtNug2 function in the maturation process of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit in plants. cycloheximide synthetic complete fresh weight guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. FASTA searches of the rice and Arabidopsis genomes were conducted using amino acid sequences from yeast YawG subfamily protein as a data base query. Sequence alignment of YawG subfamily proteins was performed using CLUSTAL W and BOXSHADE 3.21, for predictions with high homology sequences. OsNug2 (Os03g22890) and AtNug2 (At1g52980) cDNAs were prepared using reverse transcription (RT) and PCR. Primers were designed against nucleotide sequences deposited in the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 52 °C for 30 s (annealing), 72 °C for 1 min 30 s (elongation), and then 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified DNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then bands were eluted and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). For protoplast preparation, Arabidopsis was grown on agar plates containing MS/2 and 2% sucrose. RT-PCR analysis was performed on the japonica rice variety, Dongjin. Rice Oc cells were used for further experiments and prepared as described previously (41Baba A. Hasezawa S. Syono K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1986; 27: 463-471Google Scholar, 42Furukawa T. Syono K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 43-48Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For construction of the AtNug2 RNAi plasmid, a GUS fragment was used as a linker between AtNug2 fragments in the antisense and sense orientations. The 500-bp AtNug2 gene-specific region was produced by PCR amplification. This fragment was then cloned into the AscI-SwaI and BamHI-SpeI sites of pFGC1008. The resulting construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBL4404 and the recombinant strain was then used to transform Arabidopsis ecotype Col-0 plants by the floral dip method. Transformants were subsequently selected on MS/2 medium containing 30 μg/ml of hygromycin and 100 μg/ml of cefotaxim. For AtNug2 promoter-driven GUS expression, a 1,500-bp region upstream of AtNug2 was amplified by PCR and then inserted into the pCAMBIA 1381 binary vector. Transformations and selection of AtNug2 promoter:GUS constructs were performed in the same way as described for the AtNug2 RNAi plasmid. Total RNAs were isolated from various rice tissues using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (1 μg) was used for RT-PCR analysis. cDNA was prepared using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Fermentas, Canada) and oligo(dT18) primer, followed by amplification with specific primer pairs during 25 cycles of PCR. Histochemical localization of GUS activity was performed as described by Jefferson et al. (43Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8262) Google Scholar). In brief, wild-type or transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings, organs and tissues, were vacuum infiltrated in 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.2), 2 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 0.2% Triton X-100 containing 1 mm X-GlcA (Duchefa, Netherlands). Samples were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 12 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol to remove chlorophylls. Digital images were obtained using an Olympus SZX12 stereoscope (Olympus, Japan). GST-OsNug2 and GST-AtNug2 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant proteins were affinity purified using GST affinity columns containing glutathione-agarose 4B. Eluted proteins were further purified by gel-filtration chromatography (SuperdexTM 200 10/300 GL, Amersham Biosciences), followed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC; Amersham Biosciences) and concentration with Centriprep (Millipore). GTP hydrolysis assays were performed on poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose TLC plates with only a slight modification from the method described previously (44Seo H.S. Choi C.H. Kim H.Y. Jeong J.Y. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Bahk J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In brief, reactions were performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 16.5 nm [α-32P]GTP and each of the recombinant proteins at 30 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were sampled at appropriate time intervals and reactions were stopped with an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0). Each sample (1 μl) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was then developed in 0.5 m NaH2PO4 (pH 3.4). After drying, the plate was exposed to a screen and signals were visualized using the Cyclone PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Finally, spots were quantified using OptiQuant software (Packard Instruments). To measure the turnover values (kcat) of OsNug2 and AtNug2, reaction mixtures containing 3 μm GST-OsNug2 or GST-AtNug2 and 1 mm GTP in GTPase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 mm NaN3) were incubated at 30 °C for 15 h. The released phosphate was quantified with Biomol green regent (Biomol Research Laboratories), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The catalytic constant was derived from kcat = vmax/cOsNug2. UV cross-linking reactions were performed as described previously (44Seo H.S. Choi C.H. Kim H.Y. Jeong J.Y. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Bahk J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The purified GST-OsNug2 was incubated with 0.1 μm [α-32P]GTP in 20 μl of reaction mixture (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% glycerol) for 15 min at 30 °C and 40 μm of competitors (i.e. ATP, CTP, GTP, GDP, and GMP) were added for 15 min at 30 °C. The mixture was irradiated on ice at a distance of 3 cm for 10 min using mineral light at a wavelength of 254 nm. After UV cross-linking, reactions were stopped by the addition of 5× SDS gel-loading buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) for 30 min at room temperature with a low-speed shaking, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and exposed to a screen. Finally, the film was developed using the Cyclone PhosphorImager. The heterozygous diploid yeast strain S. cerevisiae Y26080 (MATa/MATα, his3Δ1/his3Δ1, leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0/LYS2, MET15/met15Δ0, ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0, YNR053c::kanMX4/YNR053c) was purchased from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). The strain was transformed with recombinant pYES2 plasmid containing OsNug2 cDNA under control of the gal1 promoter. Haploid progeny were produced by plating on sporulation medium (1% KOAc, 1.25% yeast extract, 0.1% glucose, and 2% agar) for 5 days. After zymolyase digestion, the tetrads were dissected. Sporulated yeast cells bearing plasmids were selected on synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura) and viability was checked on SC medium lacking methionine and uracil (SC-MU) or lacking methionine, uracil, and lysine (SC-MUK). BY4743 (MATa/MATα, his3Δ0/his3Δ0, leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0, met15Δ0/MET15, LYS2/lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) was used as a control. Total RNAs were isolated from yeast cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit system (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to specific regions, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Takara, Japan). Hybridization signals were visualized using a Cyclone PhosphorImager. For the RNA binding assay, total cell lysates were obtained from Oc cells and incubated overnight with GST or GST-OsNug2 in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm MgOAc, 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C. The reaction mixtures were incubated with glutathione-agarose 4B beads at 4 °C for 4 h and then the beads were washed three times with reaction buffer. Total RNAs were isolated from residual precipitates by adding phenol directly to the beads. Resuspended RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Hybridization was performed as described above, using probes for specific rRNAs. LexA-based yeast two-hybrid screening was performed according to Hybrid Hunter instructions (Invitrogen). A rice cDNA library was constructed in pYEStrp2, which contains the B42-activation domain. The library was screened with yeast strain EGY48/pSH18-4. Yeast cells were cotransformed with bait plasmid encoding the LexA DNA-binding domain fused to OsNug2 (LexA-OsNug2) and 100 μg of library plasmid. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan (SC-UHW). Colonies were replated onto synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine (SC-UHWL). Colonies that grew on selection medium after 2–4 days were picked and positive colonies were confirmed with a β-galactosidase assay. Selected clones were transformed into E. coli, isolated by antibiotic selection, and then the inserts were sequenced. 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using the tnt[regs] Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega). Labeled proteins were incubated with GST, recombinant GST-OsNug2, or GST-AtNug2, in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5 mm DTT at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then incubated with glutathione-agarose 4B beads at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with the reaction buffer and then boiled in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the gel was dried and the signal was developed with a Cyclone PhosphorImager. Transformation of Oc cell protoplasts was used for transient expression of GFP and RFP fusion proteins in rice, according to the method described by Chen et al. (45Chen S. Tao L. Zeng L. Vega-Sanchez M.E. Umemura K. Wang G.L. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2006; 7: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of GFP- or RFP-fused DNA constructs were mixed with 100 μl of suspended protoplasts and then a 40% polyethylene glycol/Ca2+ solution (40% PEG 4000, 0.4 m mannitol, and 100 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 m KOH) was added and mixed immediately by gentle shaking. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, 0.5 ml of W5 medium was added to dilute the PEG solution. Cells were incubated for a further 36 h in 1 ml of W5 solution at 22 °C. In the case of Arabidopsis, DNA encoding GFP and RFP fusion constructs (15 μg) were introduced into Arabidopsis protoplasts using the PEG-mediated transformation described previously (46Heo J.B. Rho H.S. Kim S.W. Hwang S.M. Kwon H.J. Nahm M.Y. Bang W.Y. Bahk J.D. Plant Cell Physiol. 2005; 46: 2005-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transformed protoplasts were incubated at 22 °C for 48 h. Expression of fusion constructs was observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus AX70 TR, Olympus, Japan). Ribosomal profiles were performed according to the method described by Bassler et al. (26Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), with the following modification. Oc cells were subcultured in 100 ml of R2S suspension medium and grown for 10 days at 30 °C, under light and with shaking at 80 rpm. After washing in ice-cold breaking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 50 μg/ml of CHX, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold breaking buffer containing 200 μg/ml of heparin and 1× complete protease inhibitors. Tungsten beads were added and cells were broken by five rounds of shaking for 2 min/resting for 2 min on ice, using a vibrating ball mill (Retsch, Germany). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Approximately 20 OD260 units of cleared supernatant were loaded gently onto the top of sucrose gradients (7 to 47%) and then ultracentrifuged with a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor for 15 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C. About 40 fractions (0.3 ml each) were collected and then examined for UV absorbance at OD260. Each fraction was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 50% acetone, followed by resuspension in SDS loading buffer. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-OsNug2 or anti-human L10a antibodies. To determine the preferential form of OsNug2 bound to ribosomes, 2 mm GDP, GTP, and GTPγS or ATP, were added to cell lysates and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h prior to sucrose gradient fractionation. Yeast Nug1, Nug2, and Lsg1 amino acid sequences were used to query the rice and Arabidopsis genome databases to identify YawG subfamily orthologs (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). Os03g22890 (OsNug2) and At1g52980 (AtNug2) were chosen for functional characterization as rice and Arabidopsis orthologs, respectively. The two plant Nug2s showed between 49 and 51% homology to the yeast proteins at the amino acid level (Fig. 1B). The GTP binding motifs in the middle domain were aligned in the order G5-G4-G1-G2-G3, which is consistent with the permuted feature typical of YawG proteins. In addition, RT-PCR analysis showed that OsNug2 was expressed ubiquitously in all rice tissues analyzed (Fig. 1C). Similarly, analysis of the GenevestigatorTM Arabidopsis microarray data base revealed that AtNug2 is also expressed ubiquitously. These findings suggest that OsNug2 and AtNug2 might be essential at all stages of plant growth and development. GST-fused full-length OsNug2 and AtNug2 genes were expressed in E. coli and recombinant proteins were purified by GST affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. First, the GTP hydrolysis activities of these two proteins were analyzed using radioisotope-labeled [α-32P]GTP. The GST-OsNug2 or GST-AtNug2 proteins were incubated with [α-32P]GTP. Aliquots were withdrawn at appropriate time intervals and then separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates. The amount of GDP released by the two GST-fused Nug2s proteins increased gradually with time, indicating intact GTP hydrolysis activity in vitro (Fig. 2A). By contrast, the free GST control exhibited no GTP hydrolysis activity. In addition, the kcat values of these two proteins were determined with a colorimetric assay. The kcat values of GST-OsNug2 and GST-AtNug2 were 0.12 ± 0.007 min−1 (n = 6) and 0.087 ± 0.002 min−1 (n = 4), respectively (Table 1). These values are similar to those of other YlqF/YawG family proteins examined previously in bacteria and yeast (21Daigle D.M. Brown E.D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2038777761,"The turnover of tumor suppressor p53 is critical for its role in various cellular events. However, the pathway that regulates the turnover of the Drosophila melanogaster DMP53 is largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence for the first time that the E2 ligase, Drosophila homolog of Rad6 (dRad6/Dhr6), plays an important role in the regulation of DMP53 turnover. Depletion of dRad6 results in DMP53 accumulation, whereas overexpression of dRad6 causes enhanced DMP53 degradation. We show that dRad6 specifically interacts with DMP53 at the transcriptional activation domain and regulates DMP53 ubiquitination. Loss of dRad6 function in transgenic flies leads to lethalities and altered morphogenesis. The dRad6-induced defects in cell proliferation and apoptosis are found to be DMP53-dependent. The loss of dRad6 induces an accumulation of DMP53 that enhances the activation of apoptotic genes and leads to apoptosis in the presence of stress stimuli. In contrast to that, the E3 ligase is the primary factor that regulates p53 turnover in mammals, and this work demonstrates that the E2 ligase dRad6 is critical for the control of DMP53 degradation in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2011591815,"Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the main protein in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, and the modulation of VDAC may be induced by the excessive release of extracellular glutamate. This study examined the role of glutamate release on VDAC-mediated apoptosis in an eleven vessel occlusion model in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were used for the 11 vessel occlusion ischemic model, which were induced for a 10-min transient occlusion. During the ischemic and initial reperfusion episode, the real-time monitoring of the extracellular glutamate concentration was measured using an amperometric microdialysis biosensor and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry. To confirm neuronal apoptosis, the brains were removed 72 h after ischemia to detect the neuron-specific nuclear protein and pro-apoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3, VDAC, p53 and BAX). The changes in the mitochondrial morphology were measured by atomic force microscopy. A decrease in the % of CBF was observed, and an increase in glutamate release was detected after the onset of ischemia, which continued to increase during the ischemic period. A significantly higher level of glutamate release was observed in the ischemia group. The increased glutamate levels in the ischemia group resulted in the activation of VDAC and pro-apoptotic proteins in the hippocampus with morphological alterations to the mitochondria. This study suggests that an increase in glutamate release promotes VDAC-mediated apoptosis in an 11 vessel occlusion ischemic model."
https://openalex.org/W1989701199,"S-nitrosation--the formation of S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) at cysteine residues in proteins--is a posttranslational modification involved in signal transduction and nitric oxide (NO) transport. Recent studies would also suggest the formation of N-nitrosamines (RNNOs) in proteins in vivo, although their biological significance remains obscure. In this study, we characterized a redox-based mechanism by which N-nitroso-tryptophan residues in proteins may be denitrosated.The denitrosation of N-acetyl-nitroso Trp (NANT) by glutathione (GSH) required molecular oxygen and was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Transnitrosation to form S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) was observed only in the absence of oxygen or presence of SOD. Protein denitrosation by GSH was studied using a set of mutant recombinant human serum albumin (HSA). Trp-214 and Cys-37 were the only two residues nitrosated by NO under aerobic conditions. Nitroso-Trp-214 in HSA was insensitive to denitrosation by GSH or ascorbate while denitrosation at Cys-37 was evident in the presence of GSH but not ascorbate. GSH-dependent denitrosation of Trp-214 was restored in a peptide fragment of helix II containing Trp-214. Finally, incubation of cell lysates with NANT revealed a pattern of protein nitrosation distinct from that observed with GSNO.We propose that the denitrosation of nitrosated Trp by GSH occurs through homolytic cleavage of nitroso Trp to NO and a Trp aminyl radical, driven by the formation of superoxide derived from the oxidation of GSH to GSSG. Overall, the accessibility of Trp residues to redox-active biomolecules determines the stability of protein-associated nitroso species such that in the case of HSA, N-nitroso-Trp-214 is insensitive to denitrosation by low-molecular-weight antioxidants. Moreover, RNNOs can generate free NO and transfer their NO moiety in an oxygen-dependent fashion, albeit site-specificities appear to differ markedly from that of RSNOs."
https://openalex.org/W1989234336,"Genome-wide gene expression profiling has become standard for assessing potential liabilities as well as for elucidating mechanisms of toxicity of drug candidates under development. Analysis of microarray data is often challenging due to the lack of a statistical model that is amenable to biological variation in a small number of samples. Here we present a novel non-parametric algorithm that requires minimal assumptions about the data distribution. Our method for determining differential expression consists of two steps: 1) We apply a nominal threshold on fold change and platform p-value to designate whether a gene is differentially expressed in each treated and control sample relative to the averaged control pool, and 2) We compared the number of samples satisfying criteria in step 1 between the treated and control groups to estimate the statistical significance based on a null distribution established by sample permutations. The method captures group effect without being too sensitive to anomalies as it allows tolerance for potential non-responders in the treatment group and outliers in the control group. Performance and results of this method were compared with the Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method. These two methods were applied to investigate hepatic transcriptional responses of wild-type (PXR+/+) and pregnane X receptor-knockout (PXR−/−) mice after 96 h exposure to CMP013, an inhibitor of β-secretase (β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 or BACE1). Our results showed that CMP013 led to transcriptional changes in hallmark PXR-regulated genes and induced a cascade of gene expression changes that explained the hepatomegaly observed only in PXR+/+ animals. Comparison of concordant expression changes between PXR+/+ and PXR−/− mice also suggested a PXR-independent association between CMP013 and perturbations to cellular stress, lipid metabolism, and biliary transport."

https://openalex.org/W1980740831,"Background The 14-3-3 proteins are structurally conserved throughout eukaryotes and participate in protein kinase signaling. All 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind to evolutionally conserved phosphoserine-containing motifs (modes 1 and/or 2) with high affinity. In Trypanosoma brucei, 14-3-3I and II play pivotal roles in motility, cytokinesis and the cell cycle. However, none of the T. brucei 14-3-3 binding proteins have previously been documented. Methodology/Principal Findings Initially we showed that T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins exhibit far lower affinity to those peptides containing RSxpSxP (mode 1) and RxY/FxpSxP (mode 2) (where x is any amino acid residue and pS is phosphoserine) than human 14-3-3 proteins, demonstrating the atypical target recognition by T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins. We found that the putative T. brucei protein phosphatase 2C (PP2c) binds to T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins utilizing its mode 3 motif (–pS/pTx1-2-COOH, where x is not Pro). We constructed eight chimeric PP2c proteins replacing its authentic mode 3 motif with potential mode 3 sequences found in Trypanosoma brucei genome database, and tested their binding. As a result, T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins interacted with three out of eight chimeric proteins including two with high affinity. Importantly, T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with an uncharacterized full-length protein containing identified high-affinity mode 3 motif, suggesting that both proteins form a complex in vivo. In addition, a synthetic peptide derived from this mode 3 motif binds to T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins with high affinity. Conclusion/Significance Because of the atypical target recognition of T. brucei 14-3-3 proteins, no 14-3-3-binding proteins have been successfully identified in T. brucei until now whereas over 200 human 14-3-3-binding proteins have been identified. This report describes the first discovery of the T. brucei 14-3-3-binding proteins and their binding motifs. The high-affinity phosphopeptide will be a powerful tool to identify novel T. brucei 14-3-3-binding proteins."
