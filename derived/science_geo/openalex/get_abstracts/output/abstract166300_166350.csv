A distinct subfamily of BH3-only molecules has been identified, but their exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we show that the BH3-only Bcl-2 family members, Dp5/Hrk and Bim, are induced upstream of the Bax checkpoint in neuronal apoptosis in a manner that shows significant dependence on JNK signaling. We also show that Dp5 and other BH3-only proteins kill cerebellar granule neurons in a Bax-dependent manner. These studies demonstrate that BH3-only members do not act independently in their proapoptotic activities but rather require the action of multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to produce cell death. The Bcl-2 family of proteins are key regulators of programmed cell death. A distinct subfamily of BH3-only molecules has been identified, but their exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we show that the BH3-only Bcl-2 family members, Dp5/Hrk and Bim, are induced upstream of the Bax checkpoint in neuronal apoptosis in a manner that shows significant dependence on JNK signaling. We also show that Dp5 and other BH3-only proteins kill cerebellar granule neurons in a Bax-dependent manner. These studies demonstrate that BH3-only members do not act independently in their proapoptotic activities but rather require the action of multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members to produce cell death. Bcl-2 homology nerve growth factor green fluorescent protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate brain-derived neurotrophic factor insulin-like growth factor-I Bcl-2 family members are defined functionally as either proapoptotic or antiapoptotic based on their ability to kill or protect cells in vitro and on the effect of gene deletion on cell death and tissue homeostasis in vivo. Bcl-2 family members share a number of conserved motifs known as Bcl-2 homology (BH)1 domains. In general, antiapoptotic molecules contain BH1–4. Proapoptotic molecules can be divided into two groups, multidomain proteins containing BH1–3 and the BH3-only subfamily. The functional and evolutionary segregation of the BH3-only subgroup from the rest of the family members is evident inCaenorhabditis elegans. The mammalian caspase and Apaf-1 gene families are represented by single genes in the roundworm, but the Bcl-2 gene family is represented by two genes: a Bcl-2-like Ced-9 containing multiple BH domains and the BH3-only family member Egl-1. Egl-1 was identified in a screen for worms defective in egg-laying. The mechanism for this defect is a gain of function resulting in the ectopic death of hermaphrodite-specific neurons (1Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Egl-1 loss of function results in a block in all somatic cell deaths, a phenotype similar to that of the Ced-3 and Ced-4 mutants (2Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Egl-1 is not necessary for germ cell death despite the necessity of Ced-3 and Ced-4 in this process (3Gumienny T.L. Lambie E. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Hengartner M.O. Development. 1999; 126: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), either indicating that furtherC. elegans BH3-only proteins exist or pointing to distinct biological pathways in cell death that exist in somatic and germ cells. The genetic model in C. elegans places the BH3-only Egl-1 upstream of the Bcl-2 family member containing multiple domains, Ced-9. Egl-1 is up-regulated transcriptionally in cells destined to die (1Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, TRA-1 inhibits Egl-1 expression. The Egl-1 gain of function mutant does not have an altered open reading frame but rather is mutated in a region of DNA that governs TRA-1 inhibition. Egl-1 binds Ced-9, disrupting the Ced-9/Ced-4 interaction and freeing Ced-4 to activate the caspase Ced-3. Although C. elegans has provided much useful information, the role of BH3-only proteins has become more diverse in vertebrate systems. In other words, the BH3-only gene family has evolved to respond to a variety of stimuli in different cell types via distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, the biochemical coupling of Bcl-2 proteins to caspase activation differs in C. elegans and vertebrate cells. The latter require efflux of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to activate caspases in the cytosolic apoptosome, whereas in C. elegans Ced-3 activation does not appear to involve cytochrome c. Several of the mammalian BH3-only Bcl-2 family members appear to be activated via different stimuli. Preexisting Bid is activated post-translationally via cleavage by caspase-8/FLICE in response to Fas or TNF receptor activation (4Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3787) Google Scholar). The truncated Bid cleavage product, p15, acts at the mitochondria to cause cytochrome c release (5Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism for cytochrome c release is unknown. Bad is another BH3-only member post-translationally modified. In healthy cells, Bad is phosphorylated by the prosurvival kinases Akt and protein kinase A (6del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 7Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In the phosphorylated form, Bad is sequestered in the cytosol by 14-3-3. Upon apoptotic stimuli, Bad becomes dephosphorylated, is released from the 14-3-3 tether, and is, therefore, free to perform its apoptotic function at the mitochondria. Bik is another BH3-only family protein the phosphorylation of which regulates biological activity (8Verma S. Zhao L. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4671-4676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Noxa is a BH3-only Bcl-2 molecule that was identified as a p53 target gene activated transcriptionally after DNA damage (9Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Dp5 and Bim are BH3-only members that are up-regulated transcriptionally after NGF withdrawal of sympathetic neurons (10Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Dp5 was identified in a screen for genes up-regulated after NGF deprivation (10Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and is the ortholog of the human gene, Harakiri (Hrk), identified by its ability to bind Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in a yeast two-hybrid screen (13Inohara N. Ding L. Chen S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1686-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Bim deletion delays, but does not block, the neuronal apoptosis that results from trophic factor withdrawal of neurons (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The activation of Bim seems to depend on cell type. In addition to being induced in neuronal apoptosis, Bim is subject to post-translational modification in nonneuronal cells. When bound to LC8 in the dynein motor complex, Bim is sequestered in the cytosol. However, apoptotic stimuli, in this case interleukin-3 deprivation of FDC-P1 cells, trigger release of Bim from the cytoskeleton enabling Bim to perform its apoptotic function at the mitochondria (14Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). These BH3-only family members are often studied for their ability to induce cell death when overexpressed in cell lines. It is not clear whether BH3-only proteins, when overexpressed, are sufficient to kill cells independently (15Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 16Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) or rather, as suggested by the C. elegans model, BH3-only proteins kill via a mechanism that requires Bcl-2 family members containing multiple BH domains. To address this question, one would have to identify a cell that requires a single given proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member with multiple domains to execute apoptosis in response to physiological stimuli. If BH3-only proteins acted only by interaction(s) with multidomain proapoptotic or antiapoptotic family members, one would predict that overexpression of BH3-only proteins would not kill a cell deficient in the critical proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member. On the other hand, if BH3-only family members can act independently, one would expect them to kill regardless of the presence or absence of the critical proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member. An additional requirement would be a cell type that normally undergoes transcriptional up-regulation of BH3-only family members, such that the ectopic expression mimics the physiological stimulus. The system wherein these questions can be addressed is provided by neurons from Bax-deficient animals in which death in response to trophic factor deprivation in multiple neuronal types is completely abrogated. An additional technical requirement is that these cells be transfectable such that BH3-only proteins can be ectopically expressed. Cerebellar granule neurons deprived of potassium are a well characterized model of neuronal programmed cell death. These neurons are both transfectable and dependent upon Bax (17Miller T.M. Moulder K.L. Knudson C.M. Creedon D.J. Deshmukh M. Korsmeyer S.J. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) to execute cell death in response to switching from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing levels of potassium. Trophic withdrawal of neurons, including the hyperpolarization of cerebellar granule neurons, results in the JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun. Inhibition of c-Jun function with neutralizing antibodies or dominant negative cDNA constructs can block the death that occurs after NGF deprivation of sympathetic neurons (18Estus S. Zaks W.J. Freeman R.S. Gruda M. Bravo R. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 19Ham J. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). CEP-1347, a small molecule inhibitor of JNK activation, completely blocks c-Jun phosphorylation in trophic factor-deprived neurons (11Putcha G.V. Moulder K.L. Golden J.P. Bouillet P. Adams J.A. Strasser A. Johnson E.M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 615-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant negative c-jun partially blocks Bim expression in NGF-deprived sympathetic neurons (12Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that Dp5 and Bim mRNA are induced in cerebellar granule neurons undergoing apoptosis in response to hyperpolarizing levels of potassium. The induction is Bax-independent, since it occurs regardless of Bax genotype and is moderately dependent on JNK signaling, because a majority of the induction can be blocked with CEP-1347, an inhibitor of JNK activation (20Maroney A.C. Glicksman M.A. Basma A.N. Walton K.M. Knight Jr., E. Murphy C.A. Bartlett B.A. Finn J.P. Angeles T. Matsuda Y. Neff N.T. Dionne C.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 104-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that granule cells can be killed by ectopic expression of Dp5 and that this killing is Bax-dependent, since it does not occur in Bax-deficient neurons. Finally, this seems to be a general phenomenon, since similar results were seen with the BH3-only family members, Bim and tBid. CEP-1347, a kind gift of Anna Maroney (Cephalon, Westchester, PA) was used at 500 nm. BDNF was a kind gift of Dr. Qiao Yan (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), and IGF-I was a kind gift of Monsanto Co. (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Cerebellar granule neurons were isolated as described (21Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, postnatal day 7 rat or mouse cerebella were dissected and minced with an iridectomy scissors. Tissue was then dissociated by trypsinization (Worthington; 0.3 mg/ml in HBSS for 15 min at 37 °C) followed by mechanical trituration with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette. Trypsin was neutralized with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and the cell suspension was passed through a 200-μm Nitex filter to remove any cell aggregates. For all experiments, neurons were plated into “K25+S” medium consisting of basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mmpotassium chloride, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Neurons were plated at 8 × 105 to 1 × 106/ml at 0.5 ml/well (2.0–2.5 × 105/cm2) in 24-well plates (Nunc Nalgene Inc., Naperville, IL). Prior to plating, wells were coated with 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine overnight and then washed three times with distilled water and allowed to dry. Aphidicolin (3.3 μg/ml) was added 24–48 h after plating to reduce the number of nonneuronal cells. For induction of cell death, neurons were washed twice and then switched to K5+S medium, which is identical to K25+S except that it contains 5 mm KCl instead of 25 mm. Cultures of sympathetic neurons were prepared as described (22Johnson M.I. Argiro V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 103: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, superior cervical ganglia were dissected from postnatal day 1 rats. Cervical ganglia were treated sequentially with 1 mg/ml type IV collagenase and 2.5 mg/ml trypsin (Worthington) for 30 min each at 37 °C followed by trituration through a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette. Neurons were plated in AM50 on 12-well plates at 30,000 neurons/well. Plates were coated with collagen prepared from rat tail tendons. NGF deprivation was performed by washing 5–6 daysin vitro cultures with NGF-free medium and then adding anti-NGF neutralizing antibodies. AM50 consists of minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal bovine serum (Harlan Bioproducts; Indianapolis, IN), 2 mm glutamine, 20 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine + 20 μmuridine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml 2.5 S NGF (Harlan Bioproducts). At the time of plating, 3.3 μg/ml aphidicolin (A. G. Scientific, San Diego, CA) was added to further reduce the number of nonneuronal cells. Because the presence of serum increases the required concentration of CEP-1347 to achieve bioactivity (23Maroney A.C. Finn J.P. Bozyczko-Coyne D. O'Kane T.M. Neff N.T. Tolkovsky A.M. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Troy C.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1901-1912PubMed Google Scholar), deprivation experiments were performed in serum-free medium. A modified N2 medium was used for these experiments consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 40 nmprogesterone, 30 nm sodium selenite, 100 μmputrescine, 10 μg/ml transferrin (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Bax-deficient mice and littermates were genotyped by performing PCR on tail biopsy DNA as described (24Deckwerth T.L. Elliott J.L. Knudson C.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. Snider W.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated from neuronal cultures by using the QuickPrep Micro mRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA was prepared with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed in the presence of [32P]dCTP for 21 cycles with the following primers: Dp5 sense, 5′-AGACCCAGCCCGGACCGAGCAA; Dp5 antisense, 5′- CTCTCTCTGTAGCTGGACCTC; BimEL sense, 5′-GGTAATCCCGACGGCGAAGGGAC; BimEL antisense, 5′-AAGAGAAATACCCACTGGAGGACC. Cyclophilin primers and conditions have been described previously (21Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel that was dried, and the bands were quantitated with the Molecular FX PhosphorImager and QuantityOne software. The average of the twot = 0 data points was taken as 100%, and all other time point data were quantified relative to that value. Primary neurons were transfected via a modified calcium phosphate procedure (25Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar, 26Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells that die in response to the transfection of proapoptotic molecules either do so before enough GFP is expressed to render them visible via fluorescence microscopy (i.e. with regard to amount of protein, the threshold for induction of apoptosis is lower than the threshold for visual detection) or lose their adherence to the dish. Because the percentage of primary neurons transfected is small (∼1%), one cannot appreciate a population of floating dead cells in the dish. We did not observe a population of cells that were GFP-positive with condensed nuclei that could be reliably quantitated for the analysis of apoptosis. Viable GFP-positive neurons were counted 48 h after transfection of enhanced GFP with the plasmids described. Enhanced GFP was from CLONTECH. Dp5 coding region (10Imaizumi K. Tsuda M. Imai Y. Wanaka A. Takagi T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18842-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), kindly provided by K. Imaizumi, was subcloned into pcDNA3. BimEL, BimL, BimS, and parental vector have been previously described (27O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by A. Strasser. t-BidGFP was kindly provided by R. Youle. In this transfection paradigm, a ∼90% concordance rate of transfection is achieved when neurons are transfected with two expression constructs as evidenced by GFP/LacZ colocalization (26Moulder K.L. Onodera O. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Johnson E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 705-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments involving the ability of neuroprotectants to rescue from Dp5 killing, neurons were placed in the presence of neuroprotectant immediately after transfection. Transfection experiments were performed at least three times in quadruplicate. The number of neurons cotransfected with pcDNA3 and GFP was set to 100%. Mean ± S.D. is shown. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed from cDNA time courses from wild-type cultures of mouse cerebellar granule cells undergoing programmed cell death in response to withdrawal of depolarizing levels of potassium. Dp5 mRNA was robustly induced after potassium deprivation (Fig. 1). Dp5 mRNA was expressed at low levels in potassium-maintained granule cells. The amount of Dp5 mRNA increased after hyperpolarization, reaching ∼1.6-, 5-, 6-, and 9-fold at 1, 3, 6, and 9 h postdeprivation, respectively (Fig. 1). Thereafter, the amount of Dp5 mRNA decreased because the neurons started to die after these time points (approximately half of the neurons are dead by 12 h). Because the neurons do not progress through the cell death program with complete synchrony, by the time the last neurons induced Dp5, the first to have done so may already be dead. To determine whether Dp5 induction occurred upstream or downstream of Bax action, the experiment was repeated by using cDNA time courses generated with neurons derived from Bax-deficient animals. Dp5 induction follows a similar time course of induction in Bax-deficient neurons, indicating that Dp5 induction occurs upstream of the Bax checkpoint. Specifically, a small induction of Dp5 mRNA occurred at 1 h postdeprivation (∼2-fold) followed by more dramatic inductions of 9-, 10-, and 30-fold at 3, 9, and 12 h postdeprivation, respectively (Fig. 1). The peak levels of Dp5 in Bax-deficient neurons were greater than that in wild type (30- versus 9-fold) because the Bax-deficient neurons do not die in response to the hyperpolarizing potassium. That Bax-deficient neurons subjected to apoptotic stimuli up-regulated BH3-only family members but did not die is indirect evidence that BH3-only family members did not act independently to induce death. Although the Dp5 levels remained above base line in Bax-deficient neurons as far as 96 h postdeprivation, peak levels of Dp5 mRNA levels were not maintained, and Dp5 levels fell from 30-fold at 12 h to 13-fold over control at 18 h and to 4-fold at the end of the experiment 96 h postdeprivation. The decrease in peak levels can be explained in part by the fall in global macromolecular synthesis that occurs in these neurons when hyperpolarized by low potassium (21Miller T.M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7487-7495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether BimEL was induced with a similar magnitude and time course as Dp5, we used the same cDNAs to examine BimEL expression in cerebellar granule neurons deprived of potassium. BimEL mRNA was induced with a similar magnitude and time course as Dp5 (Fig. 1), suggesting that these BH3-only proteins were coordinately up-regulated during neuronal apoptosis. To determine whether all BH3-only family member genes were up-regulated by trophic withdrawal, we examined whether Noxa, a known p53 target gene up-regulated transcriptionally by DNA damage, was induced after potassium deprivation of cerebellar granule cells. Noxa mRNA was not induced after potassium serum deprivation of both wild-type and Bax-deficient granule neurons (data not shown). Consistent with this lack of cross-talk, another known p53 target gene, Bax, was also not up-regulated after potassium serum deprivation of granule cells (data not shown). In addition, the BH3-only family members, Blk and Bid, were also not induced after potassium deprivation of cerebellar granule neurons (data not shown). To determine the effect of JNK signaling on the induction of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins, Dp5 and Bim, we examined mRNA levels for these genes in cerebellar granule neurons. Neurons were deprived of potassium for 4 h in the absence or presence of CEP-1347, an inhibitor of the JNK signaling pathway (20Maroney A.C. Glicksman M.A. Basma A.N. Walton K.M. Knight Jr., E. Murphy C.A. Bartlett B.A. Finn J.P. Angeles T. Matsuda Y. Neff N.T. Dionne C.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 104-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of c-jun mRNA, a result of JNK activation, was completely blocked in CEP-1347-treated cultures (data not shown). Other experiments demonstrate that CEP-1347 completely blocked c-Jun phosphorylation in cerebellar granule neurons deprived of potassium. 2C. A. Harris and E. M. Johnson, Jr., manuscript in preparation. Together, these data demonstrated that JNK activity was completely blocked by CEP-1347 in hyperpolarized granule neurons. Consistent with the results in Fig.1, Dp5 mRNA was up-regulated 6.3-fold after potassium deprivation but only 2-fold when neurons were deprived in the presence of CEP-1347 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, JNK inhibition reduced the Dp5 mRNA induction by ∼80% at this time point. Bim mRNA was induced to a similar level (5-fold) after potassium deprivation and 2.8-fold in the presence of CEP-1347. This corresponds to JNK inhibition blocking 55% of the Bim mRNA induction. The results further suggest that Dp5 and Bim were coordinately regulated upon trophic factor deprivation. To determine whether this incomplete block was true in other models of trophic factor withdrawal requiring macromolecular synthesis, we assessed the importance of JNK signaling in the induction of Dp5 and Bim that occurs after NGF deprivation of sympathetic neurons. Using primers to Dp5 and Bim, we performed semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR on mRNAs purified from either NGF-maintained neurons or neurons deprived of NGF in the presence or absence of CEP-1347 for 6, 12, or 18 h. The amount of Dp5 and Bim mRNA was greatly increased after NGF deprivation, ∼4-, 15-, and 13-fold for Bim at 6, 12, and 18 h, respectively (Fig. 2, B andC). In the presence of CEP-1347, Bim RNA increased 2-, 2-, and 3-fold at these time points, corresponding to an inhibition of 85% in the induction. Dp5 mRNA increased 17-, 47-, 50-fold in NGF-deprived neurons and 7-, 10-, and 15-fold in NGF-deprived, CEP-1347-saved neurons, corresponding to an inhibition of Dp5 gene induction of ∼75% after NGF deprivation. Overall, the data indicate that ∼75–85% of the induction of Bim and Dp5 mRNA seen after NGF deprivation can be accounted for by the JNK signaling pathway. The previous data (Fig. 1) demonstrating that Dp5 and Bim were induced in Bax-deficient neurons, yet these cells did not die, suggested that the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bax was required in BH3-only protein-mediated death. To test this hypothesis directly, we determined whether ectopic expression of Dp5 killed neurons in a Bax-dependent manner. Rat cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with a Dp5 expression vector or control vector along with a GFP reporter plasmid. Two days after transfection the number of viable neurons was assessed by counting live green fluorescent neurons. Dp5 transfection resulted in the death of most neurons as the yield of GFP neurons cotransfected with Dp5 was ∼25% compared with cells cotransfected with pcDNA3 (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with neurons derived from wild-type mice. To assess whether Dp5 required the action of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members containing multiple BH domains, we performed the identical experiment in neurons derived from littermate Bax-deficient animals. In striking contrast to wild-type mouse or rat neurons, Dp5 expression in Bax-deficient neurons resulted in similar numbers of GFP-positive neurons compared with pcDNA3-transfected neurons (Fig.4), indicating that Dp5 was unable to kill in the absence of Bax.Figure 4Dp5-induced apoptosis is Bax-dependent. Either Dp5 or pcDNA3 was cotransfected with GFP into Bax wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), or homozygous (−/−) deficient mouse granule neurons. Forty-eight hours later, the number of viable green neurons was counted. Dp5 kills wild-type neurons or hemizygous neurons (p < 0.001) but not Bax-deficient neurons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the Bax dependence of Dp5-induced killing could be generalized to other BH3-only family members, we transfected potassium-maintained rat granule neurons with BimEL, BimL, BimS, GFP-Bid, or GFP-tBid. These constructs robustly killed rat granule neurons, with tBid being the strongest inducer of death (data not shown). We then transfected Bim or tBid into wild-type and Bax-deficient mouse granule neurons. Again, these constructs robustly killed wild-type neurons (23 ± 2 and 2 ± 0% neuronal viability, respectively) but did not kill Bax-deficient neurons, since the number of Bim- and tBid-transfected neurons was similar to pcDNA3-control transfected neurons (80 ± 6 and 68 ± 5%, respectively, Fig.5). However, protection in Bax-deficient neurons against tBid was not as complete as that observed for Dp5 (p < 0.05). To determine whether JNK signaling was required for Dp5-induced killing, neurons were transfected with Dp5 in the presence of CEP-1347. After 48 h, the number of viable GFP-positive neurons was counted. CEP-1347 had no effect on Dp5-induced killing (Fig.6A), indicating that JNK signaling was not required for Dp5 apoptotic function. To determine whether prosurvival signaling pathways other than those stimulated by depolarizing levels of potassium could interfere with Dp5 function, Dp5-transfected neurons were placed in medium with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or BDNF (100 ng/ml) immediately after transfection. Both of these factors promote survival of granule neurons in the absence of depolarizing levels of potassium (28Lindholm D. Dechant G. Heisenberg C.P. Thoenen H. Eur. J.

We hypothesized that Rab11a-binding proteins exist as downstream effectors of its action. Here we define a family of four Rab11-interacting proteins: Rab11-Family Interacting Protein 1 (Rab11-FIP1), Rab11-Family InteractingProtein 2 (Rab11-FIP2), Rab11-FamilyInteracting Protein 3 (Rab11-FIP3), and pp75/Rip11. All four interacting proteins associated with wild type Rab11a and dominant active Rab11a (Rab11aS20V) as well as Rab11b and Rab25. Rab11-FIP2 also interacted with dominant negative Rab11a (Rab11aS25N) and the tail of myosin Vb. The binding of Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, and Rab11-FIP3 to Rab11a was dependent upon a conserved carboxyl-terminal amphipathic α-helix. Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, and pp75/Rip11 colocalized with Rab11a in plasma membrane recycling systems in both non-polarized HeLa cells and polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. GFP-Rab11-FIP3 also colocalized with Rab11a in HeLa cells. Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP2, and pp75/Rip11 also coenriched with Rab11a and H+K+-ATPase on parietal cell tubulovesicles, and Rab11-FIP1 and Rab11-FIP2 translocated with Rab11a and the H+K+-ATPase upon stimulating parietal cells with histamine. The results suggest that the function of Rab11a in plasma membrane recycling systems is dependent upon a compendium of protein effectors.

Zerial M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Whereas the precise mechanism of action remains poorly understood, individual Rab proteins localize to distinct intracellular vesicular compartments suggesting that each Rab has a well defined functional role. For example, Rab1 and Rab2 are perinuclear in location and function in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi translocation (2Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Rab6 is located on the Golgi and is involved in movement of vesicles through the organelle (3Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M.A. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Rab8 resides in the trans-Golgi/post-Golgi networks and regulates post-Golgi targeting to the plasma membrane (4Peranen J. Auvinen P. Virta H. Wepf R. Simons K. J.

The sub-apically localized Rab11 family is involved in vesicle recycling, plasma membrane recycling, and transcytosis (6Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1991; 6: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar) homologues have been identified. The Rab11 family now also includes two other gene products, Rab11b and Rab25 (15Bhartur S.G. Calhoun B.C. Woodrum J. Kurkjian J. Iyer S. Lai F. Goldenring J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Rab11a is sub-apically located in epithelial cells (16Goldenring J.R. Smith J. Vaughan H.D. Cameron P. Hawkins W. Navarre J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G515-G525PubMed Google Scholar) and is involved in vesicle recycling through the pericentriolar recycling endosome (8Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Rab11a colocalizes with transferrin receptor in recycling compartments of K562 cells, a human hematopoietic cell line, (17Green E.G. Ramm E. Riley N.M. Spiro D.J. Goldenring J.R. Wessling-Resnick M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and mutants deficient in GTP hydrolysis inhibit transferrin recycling (18Ren X. Xu G. Zeng J.

Although ubiquitous in expression, Rab11a is enriched in epithelial cells and gastric parietal cells (13Goldenring J.R. Soroka C.J. Shen K.R. Tang L.H. Rodriguez W. Vaughan H.D. Stoch S.A. Modlin I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G187-G194PubMed Google Scholar, 16Goldenring J.R. Smith J. Vaughan H.D. Cameron P. Hawkins W. Navarre J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G515-G525PubMed Google Scholar). In gastric parietal cells, Rab11a colocalized with the H+K+-ATPase and translocated to the secretory canaliculus upon stimulation with histamine (19Calhoun B.C. Lapierre L.A. Chew C.S. Goldenring J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C163-C170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dominant negative form of Rab11a inhibits acid sequestration in gastric glands (20Duman J.G. Tyagarajan K. Kolsi M.S. Moore H.H. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C361-C372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits recycling of polymeric IgA receptor and basolateral to apical transcytosis in MDCK1 cells (6Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently, Rab11a was also implicated in recruiting membrane to the cell surface in macrophages for phagocytosis (21Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and for cell membrane extension. Although the associations of Rab11a and the apical recycling systems is now well established, little is known about its physiological function. Studies have identified three Rab11-interacting proteins. The first protein, Rab11-binding protein (Rab11BP) or rabphilin 11, was isolated from bovine brain (22Zeng X. Ren M. Gravotta D. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Xu G. Shen T.H. Morimoto T. Adesnick M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), respectively, and interacted with the GTP-bound form of Rab11a (22Zeng X. Ren M. Gravotta D. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Xu G. Shen T.H. Morimoto T. Adesnick M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2840-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rab11BP/rabphilin 11 localizes to the pericentriolar recycling compartment in MDCK cells and HeLa cells and participates in transferrin recycling and membrane turnover events (22Zeng X. Ren M. Gravotta D. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Xu G. Shen T.H. Morimoto T. Adesnick M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25517-25524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Myosin Vb, the second Rab11a-interacting protein, was identified from yeast two-hybrid screening of a parietal cell cDNA library (24Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Myosin Vb interacts with all members of the Rab11 family: Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25. In MDCK and HeLa cells, myosin Vb associates with the Rab11a-containing plasma membrane recycling systems. Transfection of the tail of myosin Vb lacking the motor domain retards trafficking through the plasma membrane recycling systems (24Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Recently, a third protein, Rab11-interacting protein (Rip11), was reported to bind with Rab11 (25Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The Rip11 sequence was identified previously as pp75, a phosphoprotein that interacts with the 60-kDa SS-A and Ro autoantigens and may function as an autoantigen due to the presence of pp75 antibodies in the sera of some autoimmune disease patients (26Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). pp75/Rip11 was located in the apical recycling endosome of polarized epithelial cells and appeared to be involved in apical vesicle trafficking (26Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since only three interacting proteins for Rab11a have been recognized and because the function of the ubiquitously expressed Rab11a is still unclear, we hypothesized that other interacting proteins must exist. By utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen and EST data base searches, we have identified a family of four Rab11-binding proteins that have a highly conserved Rab11 family-binding amphipathic α-helical motif. Immunofluorescence and Western blot data show a close association between Rab11a and this family of interacting proteins. These results suggest that the functions of Rab11a in plasma membrane recycling systems are regulated by a complex compendium of interacting proteins. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from rabbit gastric parietal cells and primed with oligo(dT) to construct a parietal cell cDNA library in pAD-GAL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with an average clone length of 2.0 kilobase pairs. Rab11aS20V was mutated as described previously (6Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) from wild type Rab11a via a single base pair substitution and cloned into pBD-GAL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pBD-GAL/Rab11aS20V was transfected into the Y190 yeast strain to produce a stable bait line that was isolated on tryptophan-deficient media. The bait line was then transfected with 100 µg of parietal cell cDNA library plasmid and plated on media deficient in leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (TLH−) and supplemented with 2.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Following 4 days of growth, colonies were lifted onto filter paper, frozen twice for 10 s in liquid nitrogen, and incubated with 1.67 ml of X-gal stock (50 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside inN,N-dimethylformamide) in 100 ml of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4). Interactions were judged positive if the blue product from the β-galactosidase reaction was present within 3 h at room temperature. Positive clones were regrown on TLH− media (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and β-galactosidase activity was reconfirmed. Plasmids were then rescued from yeast and transformed into XL-1 Blue bacteria and selected on ampicillin. Isolated plasmids were sequenced by automated sequencing (Medical College of Georgia, Molecular Biology Core Facility) using pAD-GAL flanking vector sequences. The larger isolated cDNA clone was used to screen a UniZAP phage parietal cell cDNA library. Phage plaques were screened on duplicate filter lifts of 150-mm dishes plated with 50,000 plaque-forming units/dish. The filters were probed with [32P]dCTP random-primed labeled probe prepared from our original isolated cDNA sequence. Filters were washed to high stringency (65 °C, 0.2× SSC), and phage plaques demonstrating hybridization in both duplicate filter lifts were cloned to plaque purity through serial dilutional replating and screening. Sequences were then rescued into pBluescript using Exassist helper phage. The plasmid cDNA inserts were sized to identify the largest clones that were submitted for automated sequencing. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using a linked cDNA prepared from rabbit parietal cell mRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, 5 ng of parietal cell cDNA was utilized as template in the 12 buffer Fail-Safe PCR system (Epicentre Technologies) with the outer RNA linker primer (Ambion) and inner antisense gene-specific primer (5′ TGGGCAGGGACATGAGCACAT 3′). Advantage Taq polymerase (CLONTECH) was used in the 25-µl reactions (5 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 180 s; 5 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s, 70 °C, 180 s; and 20 cycles of 95 °C, 30 s, 68 °C, 180 s). The 750-nucleotide band obtained from buffer K of the Fail-Safe PCR kit was cloned into pTOPO-T vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced (MCG Molecular Biology Core Facility). An oligonucleotide for the start site of Rab11-FIP1 designed with aSacI site (5′ GCGCGAGCTCAATGGAGGCTGCAAGAGAAACCCAG 3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide containing a SacI site (5′ GAGCCTTTAGATCCACGCCCGAG 3′) was utilized to amplify the 542 amino-terminal nucleotides of Rab11-FIP1 from parietal cell cDNA. Following digestion with SacI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), this fragment was ligated (New England Biolabs ligase) to the carboxyl-terminal 1414 nucleotides of Rab11-FIP1 already cloned into the GFP-C2 vector. Rab11-FIP1 was then recloned in pET-30c and pAD-GAL. pAD-GAL4/Rab11-FIP1 mutant constructs were created utilizing PCR amplification and normal cloning techniques. Rab11-FIP2(KIAA0941), Rab11-FIP3(KIAA0665), and pp75/Rip11(KIAA0857) were identified utilizing Rab11-FIP1 to search the human EST data base. Rab11-FIP2(KIAA0941) and Rab11-FIP3(KIAA0665) were obtained as cDNAs from Dr. Osamu Ohara (Kazusa DNA Research Institute). The Rab11-FIP2 coding sequence was amplified from the KIAA0941 cDNA via PCR using a 5′ oligonucleotide with an EcoRI site (GCCGGAATTCAAACAGGACAGGATGATGCT) and 3′ oligonucleotide withSalI site (GGCGTCGACAATTGGCTTTATTAACTGTTAGAG) and ligated into pAD-GAL4 digested with EcoRI and SalI. The Rab11-FIP3 coding sequence was amplified from the KIAA0665 cDNA via PCR using a 5′ oligonucleotide with an EcoRI site (GCGGAATTCCTCGGGAGCATGGCGTCG) and 3′ oligonucleotide withXbaI site (CGCGTCTAGAGCTGGACCTTCCTGCCTCTACTTG) and ligated into pAD-GAL4 and EGFP-C2 digested with EcoRI andXbaI. pAD-GAL4/pp75/Rip11 was prepared as described previously (26Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid binary assays were conducted as follows. For 20 reactions, 25 ml of YPD liquid (CLONTECH) were inoculated with a single colony from the yeast strain Y190. The culture was grown overnight at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g. Yeast cells were resuspended in 10 ml of water and centrifuged again at 1000 × g. Yeast cells were resuspended in a 100 mm lithium acetate/Tris EDTA solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and incubated for 5 min. For each reaction, 20 µl of the lithium acetate/Tris-EDTA/yeast solution were added to a solution containing 20 µg of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, 120 µl of lithium acetate/Tris-EDTA/polyethylene glycol solution (100 mmLiAc, pH 7.5, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 40% polyethylene glycol), 200 ng of pBD-GAL4/construct plasmid, and 200 ng of pAD-GAL4 construct plasmid. The solution was mixed well and placed at 30 °C shaking for 30 min. Cells were then heat-shocked at 42 °C for 15 min. The yeast cells were pelleted at 1000 ×g for 30 s; the supernatant was removed; the cells were resuspended in 100 µl sterile water, and then the cells were plated onto a tryptophan- and leucine-deficient medium. The plate was incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and the colonies were lifted with a 70-mm filter paper disc. The discs were then processed for detection of β-galactosidase activity as detailed above. Observation of a blue color within 3 h was considered a positive result. Rab11-FIP1-(263–651) was cloned into pET-19b, and recombinant His-tagged Rab11-FIP1-(263–651) was expressed and purified as described previously (16Goldenring J.R. Smith J. Vaughan H.D. Cameron P. Hawkins W. Navarre J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G515-G525PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal Rab11-FIP1 antibody was produced against recombinant Rab11-FIP1-(263–651) at the University of Georgia Monoclonal Antibody Facility. Polyclonal Rab11-FIP2 antibody was produced in goat by Strategic Biosolutions (Ramona, CA) against peptide (NRQDYFDYESTN) spanning amino acids 395–406 of Rab11-FIP2 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit polyclonal pp75 was produced as described previously (26Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Full-length Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP1-(1–615), Rab11-FIP2, Rab11-FIP2-(1–465), and Rab11-FIP3 sequences were cloned into pET-30a, and recombinant expression protein was purified as described previously (16Goldenring J.R. Smith J. Vaughan H.D. Cameron P. Hawkins W. Navarre J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G515-G525PubMed Google Scholar). 2.5 µg of recombinant Rab11-FIP1, Rab11-FIP1-(1–615), Rab11-FIP2, Rab11-FIP2-(1–465), and Rab11-FIP3 proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked for 20 h in block/binding buffer (5% milk and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in TBS) at 4 °C. For Rab3a, Rab5, or Rab11a labeling with γ-35S-GTP, 40 pmol of His-tagged-Rab protein were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 35 µl of GTP-charging buffer (18 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8.1 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.3% CHAPS) with 5 µCi of γ-35S-GTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 4 µl of 100 mm MgCl2 were then added, and reactions were placed on ice. Labeled Rabs were transferred to 1 ml of block/binding buffer and rocked for 2 h. If the reaction required peptide blockade, Rab11-FIP1 peptide (KEFQVRELEDYIDNLLVRVMEETPNILRIP) or HT-31 peptide was added to final concentration of 500 µm in the 1 ml of block/binding buffer containing Rab11a γ-35S-GTP. The solutions with γ-35S-GTP-labeled Rab3a, Rab5, and Rab11a with or without peptide were then incubated with the membranes and 1 ml of block/binding buffer for 2 h. Membranes were removed and washed 5 times with block/binding buffer and 2 times with TBS. Membranes were imaged on PhosphorImaging screens (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for 16 h. Enriched parietal cell tubulovesicle preparation was conducted as described previously (28Basson M.D. Goldenring J.R. Tang L.H. Lewis J.J. Padfield P. Jamieson J.D. Modlin I.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). 20 µg of protein from each fraction were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (TBS with 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were then probed with the appropriate primary antibody in 2 ml of antibody incubation buffer (TBS with 2.5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h. Antibody dilutions were as follows: Rab11-FIP1 was used at 1:10,000; Rab11-FIP2 was used at 1:100; Rab11a (8H10-(16)) was used at 1:50; H+K+-ATPase was used at 1:50,000. Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min each with blocking buffer. Membranes were then probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 2 ml of antibody incubation buffer. All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:3000. Membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min in TBS and developed with Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Peirce) for 1 min followed by exposure to film (Kodak, Biomax-ML). HeLa cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips. MDCK cells were grown to confluence on Transwell filters. Primary rabbit parietal cells were isolated and maintained in culture for 2 days following harvesting on glass coverslips coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) as described previously (30Chew C.S. Ljungstrom M. Smolka A. Brown M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: G254-G263PubMed Google Scholar, 31Soroka C.J. Chew C.S. Modlin I.M. Hanzel D. Smolka A. Goldenring J.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 60: 76-87PubMed Google Scholar). Nocodazole and taxol treatment of MDCK cells was performed as described previously (7Casanova J.E. Wang X. Kumar R. Bhartur S.G. Navarre J. Woodrum J.E. Ray G.S. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 29Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Prior to fixing, all cells were washed 2 times with PBS (150 mm NaCl and 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). All cells were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed 3 times with PBS prior to storage at 4 °C in PBS. To stimulate parietal cells, media were changed 24 h after plating cells. Cells were then pretreated for 5 min with 10 µmomeprazole prior to the addition of 100 µm histamine for 30 min. Cells were then washed 3 times for 10 min with PBS and fixed as above. Transient transfection of GFP-Rab11-FIP3 into HeLa cells was conducted as described previously (24Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Staining of fixed cells was conducted as follows. Cells were blocked for 20 min with donkey serum solution (0.3% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 8 mm NaCl, 16.6% donkey serum) and then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies diluted in donkey serum solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS and then incubated with appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat Cy3, donkey anti-mouse Cy3, donkey anti-rabbit Cy3, donkey anti-mouse Cy5, or donkey anti-rat Cy5) for 2 h. Alexa488-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was included with fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies when staining parietal cells. Cells were washed 2 times for 5 min with PBS and 2 times for 5 min with 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Coverslips or filters were mounted onto slides using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). HeLa cells were observed utilizing a Zeiss Axiphot equipped with a SPOT digital imaging system. MDCK cells were imaged utilizing a Molecular Dynamics confocal microscope as described previously (6Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Parietal cells were imaged in confocal microscopy using single 0.3-µm optical sections. To identify proteins that interact with Rab11a, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rabbit parietal cell library was performed with dominant active Rab11a (Rab11aS20V). Two clones for an identical cDNA sequence were found to activate histidine production and to produce β-galactosidase. The cDNAs were 1692 nucleotides in length and 2000 nucleotides in length with open reading frames coding for 77 amino acids and 183 amino acids, respectively. Since no initiation site was found, the larger cDNA clone was used to screen a UniZAP phage parietal cell cDNA library. A cDNA clone of 2900 nucleotides was isolated, and it contained a 481-amino acid open reading frame without an in-frame upstream stop codon. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique was then utilized to obtain further sequence coding for the remaining 171 amino acids. The assembled full-length sequence (3519 nucleotides) contained an open reading frame coding for 652 amino acids and was named Rab11-Family Interacting Protein 1 (Rab11-FIP1) (Fig. 1). The homologous human protein is located on chromosome 2 containing 5 exons with 99% identity. Northern blot analysis of parietal cell RNA demonstrated a 3.2-kilobase pair mRNA species (data not shown). The results of the screen suggested that only the carboxyl-terminal 77 amino acids were required for binding of Rab11a. We therefore studied the interaction of truncations of Rab11-FIP1 with Rab11a. Truncated forms of Rab11-FIP1 containing amino acids 263–651 or amino acids 576–651 maintained an interaction with Rab11a (Fig.2A). However, truncations of Rab11-FIP1 that do not contain amino acids 616–651 lost their ability to interact with Rab11a (Fig. 2A). Hydropathy plot analysis of amino acids 615–651 indicated the presence of an amphipathic α-helix between amino acids 615 and 632 (Fig. 2B). Based on these results we have designated this region as the putative “Rab11 binding domain” (Rab11BD). A PROSITE search with the Rab11-FIP1 amino acid sequence did not reveal any significant structural motifs. However, the amino-terminal half of the protein did contain proline-rich domains. Since Rab11-FIP1 binding to Rab11a was dependent on a region containing an amphipathic α-helix, and because such α-helices are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions (32Colledge M. Scott J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 216-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that other proteins might exist that contain a similar Rab11a-binding motif. A computer BLAST search of the human GenBankTM EST data base yielded three homologous proteins with high carboxyl-terminal identity. One protein (KIAA0941) contained the identical 18-amino acid amphipathic α-helix sequence as in Rab11-FIP1, and the other two proteins (KIAA0665 and KIAA0857) showed high identity in the putative Rab11 binding domain (Fig.3A). Other than the helix, these three proteins demonstrated no significant identity with Rab11-FIP1. KIAA0941 was first published as one of 100 cDNAs isolated from human brain which code for large proteins (33Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). By utilizing the PROSITE domain search engine, KIAA0941 was found to contain a putative amino-terminal C2 domain that was similar to the C2 domain present in synaptotagmin (Fig. 3B). The KIAA0941 sequence is located on chromosome 10 with 5 exons and only 15.6% overall identity to Rab11-FIP1. KIAA0857 was initially published by Nagase and colleagues (34Ishikawa K. Nagase T. Suyama M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and first characterized as an autoantigen designated pp75 (26Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This same protein was subsequently identified as Rab11-interacting protein (Rip11) because GST-Rab11a affinity assays and immunocytochemistry showed a relationship between Rab11a"

In untreated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, GSK-3β was predominantly cytosolic, although a low level was also detected in the nucleus. The nuclear level of GSK-3β was rapidly increased after exposure of cells to serum-free media, heat shock, or staurosporine. Although each of these conditions caused changes in the serine 9 and/or tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK-3β, neither of these modifications was correlated with nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β. Heat shock and staurosporine treatments increased nuclear GSK-3β prior to activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and this nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β was unaltered by pretreatment with a general caspase inhibitor. The GSK-3β inhibitor lithium did not alter heat shock-induced nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β but increased the nuclear level of cyclin D1, indicating that cyclin D1 is a substrate of nuclear GSK-3β. Thus, the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β is dynamically regulated by signaling cascades, and apoptotic stimuli cause increased nuclear levels of GSK-3β, which facilitates interactions with nuclear substrates.

Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Although GSK-3β is considered a constitutively active enzyme, its activity is subject to regulation by intracellular signaling cascades. One of these regulatory mechanisms consists of site-specific phosphorylation of GSK-3β. The activity of GSK-3β is increased by phosphorylation of Tyr216, which can result from autophosphorylation (2Wang Q.M. Fiol C.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14566-14574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from intracellular signaling mechanisms (3Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,4Hartigan J.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21395-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Conversely, phosphorylation of Ser9 inhibits GSK-3β activity. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway is one of the signaling systems that leads to inhibition of GSK-3β by increasing Ser9 phosphorylation. In this signaling pathway PI3K is activated by growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which leads to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt (5Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently Akt can phosphorylate Ser9 of GSK-3β (6Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). Additionally, Ser9 of GSK-3β can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (7Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), p90Rsk, p70 S6 kinase (8Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), and protein kinase A (9Fang X., Yu, S.X. Lu Y. Bast Jr., R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Thus, multiple mechanisms are utilized to modify the activity of GSK-3β by phosphorylation. In addition to phosphorylation, the actions of GSK-3β may be modulated by regulation of its subcellular distribution. GSK-3β was initially considered to be a soluble cytoplasmic kinase (10Boyle W.J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, GSK-3β has the capacity to phosphorylate proteins within the nucleus, such as cyclin D1 (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (13Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This capacity implies the existence of nuclear, as well as cytosolic, GSK-3β, a localization for which there is some evidence. GSK-3β co-purified with glycogen in the rat liver nuclear pore lamina matrix (18Ragano-Caracciolo M. Berlin W.K. Miller M.W. Hanover J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and nuclear GSK-3β was identified in cell cycle-arrested NIH-3T3 cells treated with serum (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), in cardiomyocytes stimulated with endothelin-1 (19Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and in heat shock-treatedXenopus laevis oocytes (16Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29147-29152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, nerve growth factor withdrawal from PC12 cells and staurosporine treatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells increased Tyr216-phosphorylated GSK-3β in the nucleus, which may reflect changes in total GSK-3β levels, but these were not reported (20Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Thus, besides the prevailing concept that GSK-3β activity can be regulated by phosphorylation, these observations suggest that GSK-3β activity may also be controlled by regulation of its intracellular localization. In addition to its other functions, recent evidence indicates that GSK-3β is a key component of some apoptotic signaling cascades. Takashima et al. (21Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of rat cortical neurons with β-amyloid peptide increased GSK-3β activity and induced apoptosis, both of which were inhibited by treatment with GSK-3β antisense oligonucleotides. Additionally, Pap and Cooper (22Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) reported that transient overexpression of GSK-3β in PC12 cells and Rat-1 fibroblasts caused cells to spontaneously undergo apoptosis, and the GSK-3β-induced apoptosis was inhibited by activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In another cell culture model, Bijuret al. (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) reported that stable overexpression of modest levels of GSK-3β in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells did not alter basal indices of apoptosis but facilitated staurosporine- and heat shock-induced apoptosis, and this facilitation was attenuated by treatment with lithium, a direct inhibitor of GSK-3β (24Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Hetmanet al. (25Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of GSK-3β by transfection of rat primary cortical neurons with GSK-3β-binding protein, a protein that inhibits GSK-3β activity, protected cells from serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Additionally, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway protects cells from many apoptotic stimuli (26Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34266-34271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), an action that may be due, in part, to the inhibitory effect of Akt on GSK-3β activity (22Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Further evidence has supported the proapoptotic actions of GSK-3β (26Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34266-34271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Maggirwar S.B. Tong N. Ramirez S. Gelbard H.A. Dewhurst S. J.

(2001) Bipolar Disord., in pressGoogle Scholar), and many reports have shown that lithium is protective against a variety of proapoptotic insults (reviewed in Ref. 29Jope, R. S., and Bijur, G. N. (2001) Mol. Psychiatry, in pressGoogle Scholar), an action that is suggested to result from its inhibition of GSK-3β (1Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Because GSK-3β has been identified as a contributory factor in apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal, heat shock, and staurosporine, the present study examined whether the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β was regulated by proapoptotic conditions. Using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we report that each of these apoptosis paradigms induces a transient nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β that appears to be independent of changes in Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Furthermore, GSK-3β nuclear accumulation occurs early in the apoptotic process, preceding activation of caspases. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown as described previously (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For serum withdrawal, adherent cells were rinsed twice with serum-free media supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were cultured in serum-free media for the indicated time. For heat shock treatment, 100-mm tissue culture plates containing cells in serum-containing media were sealed with Parafilm and floated in a 45 °C water bath with gentle agitation. For staurosporine treatment, cells were maintained in serum-containing media. Caspase activity was measured as described previously (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from cells cultured in 100-mm plates by washing the adherent cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adding 500 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 nm okadaic acid). Lysed cells were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 2,700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the cytosol was further centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction. The nuclei in the pellet were washed three times by gently resuspending the nuclei in 200 μl of wash buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) and centrifuging at 2,700 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. For a final wash, the nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of wash buffer, layered over a cushion of 1 ml of sucrose buffer (1 m sucrose, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A), and centrifuged at 2,700 ×g for 10 min. The sucrose buffer containing non-sedimented cellular debris was discarded, and the pellet containing nuclei was washed in 100 μl of lysis buffer and centrifuged at 2,700 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove residual sucrose buffer. To measure relative GSK-3β immunofluorescence, nuclei were fixed with methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C, stained immunofluorescently with a mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3β antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and stained with 10 ng/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. The number of nuclei exhibiting GSK-3β immunofluorescence was determined using a FACSVantage flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) by first subtracting nuclei exhibiting background fluorescence and then counting 10,000 Hoechst 33342-positive nuclei. For immunoblotting, nuclear proteins were extracted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 nm okadaic acid. After extraction on ice for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations in the cytosolic and nuclear extracts were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Cell lysates for immunoblotting were prepared as described previously (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8% for GSK-3β, Akt, and PARP, and 10% for tubulin, histone, and caspase-3 immunoblots), transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3β (Transduction Laboratories), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-phospho-(Ser9)-GSK-3β, anti-phospho-(Ser473)-Akt, anti-total Akt, anti-active caspase-3 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), anti-histone protein (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), or anti-β-tubulin III (Sigma) antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence, and the protein bands were quantitated with a densitometer. Cells were cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and subjected to treatments as indicated. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol-acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3β antibody diluted in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Chemicon) diluted in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with 21 μg/ml anti-β-tubulin III antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with PBS and incubated with 5 μg/ml Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Chemicon) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed once with PBS and twice with deionized water and incubated with 50 ng/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole stain (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed with deionized water, mounted onto glass slides using Immu-Mount (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and examined by a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) set at 400× magnification. To immunoprecipitate GSK-3β, 50 μg of protein from nuclear extracts (0.5 μg/μl) was incubated with 0.75 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-GSK-3β antibody overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Extracts were incubated with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The immobilized immune complexes were washed twice with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Kinase activity was measured by mixing immunoprecipitated GSK-3β with 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 0.1 μg/μl recombinant tau protein (Panvera, Madison, WI). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2% SDS) was added to each sample to stop the reaction. Samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and proteins were separated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to a phosphoscreen overnight, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The efficiency of GSK-3β immunoprecipitation was determined by immunoblotting for GSK-3β. Immunoblots of cytosolic and nuclear fractions prepared from untreated SH-SY5Y cells revealed that although GSK-3β was predominantly located in the cytosol, it was also present in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1). Complete separation of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions was verified by immunoblotting each fraction for tubulin, a cytosolic protein, and histone, a nuclear protein. Fig. 1 shows that each fraction was free of contamination, as tubulin and histone were detected only in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions, respectively. To test whether the nuclear level of GSK-3β is subject to regulation by intracellular signaling cascades, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in serum-free media, a condition known to inactivate the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Serum withdrawal caused a marked increase in nuclear GSK-3β, which reached a maximum 75% increase above basal levels after 60 min (Fig. 2, A andB). Serum withdrawal did not change the total level of GSK-3β in whole cell lysates. Concomitantly with the serum withdrawal-induced increase in nuclear GSK-3β, there was a rapid decrease in the activation-associated phosphorylation of Ser473 of Akt, whereas the total level of Akt was unchanged. However, whereas the nuclear GSK-3β returned toward the basal level between 60 and 240 min of incubation in serum-free media, during this time the level of phosphorylated Akt remained low, at 25% of its level in control cells. Immunoblots of tubulin and histone confirmed the complete separation of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. Thus, these results revealed that the nuclear level of GSK-3β is dynamic and is subject to regulation by intracellular signaling activities. The correlation between the initial increase in nuclear GSK-3β and decrease in phosphorylated Akt was investigated further by applying agents that modulate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Treatment of cells in serum-free media with either of two PI3K inhibitors, 20 μm LY294002 or 40 nm wortmannin, increased the nuclear level of GSK-3β and decreased phosphorylated Akt to a greater extent than that caused by serum withdrawal alone (Fig.3, A and B). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 after serum withdrawal increased phosphorylated Akt and lowered the nuclear GSK-3β level to that measured in untreated cells. Treatment with LY294002 or wortmannin blocked the effects of IGF-1 on both phosphorylated Akt and nuclear GSK-3β levels. These results further support the conclusion that the level of nuclear GSK-3β is subject to regulation by intracellular signaling pathways. The effects of two apoptotic stimuli, heat shock and staurosporine, were measured on the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to heat shock (30 min at 45 °C) followed by incubation at 37 °C was shown previously to lead to apoptosis over a period of several hours (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present experiments used a paradigm of incubation of cells for 30 min at 45 °C followed by 30 min at 37 °C, a time at which caspase-3 activity was only beginning to increase (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) to test whether the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β was altered. Immunofluorescent staining of GSK-3β revealed that little GSK-3β was detectable in the nucleus in control cells (Fig.4A), but significant nuclear GSK-3β was evident after treatment with heat shock. This altered distribution of GSK-3β was assessed further by examining isolated nuclei prepared from control and heat shock-treated cells by flow cytometry. These measurements confirmed that there was a marked accumulation of GSK-3β in the nuclei after heat shock treatment (Fig.4B), as indicated by the rightward shift and greater magnitude of the GSK-3β immunofluorescence signal in nuclei after heat shock (gray peak) compared with controls (white peak). To further confirm that heat shock treatment induces GSK-3β nuclear accumulation, cells were treated with 100 nm okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor known to broadly inhibit nuclear import (30Kehlenbach R.H. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17848-17856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), prior to heat shock treatment. Okadaic acid alone decreased the basal level of GSK-3β in the nucleus (Fig.4C) and inhibited the heat shock-induced GSK-3β nuclear accumulation. Treatment with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B, a direct inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (31Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), alone increased the basal level of GSK-3β in the nucleus, and treatment with leptomycin B 2.5 h prior to heat shock treatment augmented the heat shock-induced GSK-3β nuclear accumulation. Together, these results demonstrate that heat shock induces GSK-3β to enter into the nucleus, and its levels in the nucleus can be modulated by mechanisms that regulate nuclear transport. To examine the temporal relationship between heat shock-induced accumulation of nuclear GSK-3β and activation of apoptosis, the time-dependent changes in heat shock-induced nuclear GSK-3β accumulation and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and the cleavage of PARP were measured. The nuclear level of GSK-3β was increased within 7.5 min of incubation of cells at 45 °C (Fig.5, A and B), and a maximum level of 277% of control was attained after 30 min of incubation at 45 °C. Upon incubation at 37 °C, there was a gradual decline in nuclear GSK-3β, which returned to near control levels after 240 min. Heat shock-induced caspase-9 activity was detected 30 min after heat shock treatment, considerably after the accumulation of nuclear GSK-3β had commenced. Similarly caspase-3 activation and PARP proteolysis were also detected after 30 min of heat shock treatment. Staurosporine is a widely used agent to induce apoptosis in many types of cells, including SH-SY5Y cells (23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 32Posmantur R. McGinnis K. Nadimpalli R. Gilbertsen R.B. Wang K.K. J.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Treatment with staurosporine (0.5 μm) caused a rapid increase in nuclear GSK-3β (Fig. 5, C and D), resulting in a 2-fold increase in nuclear GSK-3β levels within 5 min of treatment and a maximal increase after 15 min of treatment. Whereas increased nuclear GSK-3β was evident within 5 min of staurosporine treatment, the earliest activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and proteolysis of PARP was detected between 60 and 120 min of staurosporine treatment. These results demonstrate that the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β is a dynamic process regulated by heat shock and staurosporine and that it precedes activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The results with heat shock and staurosporine indicated that nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β preceded activation of caspases. To test this further, cells were preincubated with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Boc-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) (100 μm) 1 h prior to treatment with heat shock or staurosporine. Although pretreatment with BAF markedly reduced heat shock- and staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-3 and PARP proteolysis (Fig. 5E), BAF pretreatment did not affect heat shock- or staurosporine-induced accumulation of nuclear GSK-3β (Fig.5F). These results indicate that the nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β is an early event caused by apoptosis-stimulating agents that occurs upstream of caspase activation. GSK-3β activity is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser9. To test whether Ser9 phosphorylation regulates GSK-3β nuclear accumulation, cells were incubated without or with LY294002 and then subjected to serum withdrawal, heat shock, or staurosporine. Serum withdrawal and staurosporine treatment both decreased Ser9phosphorylation of cytosolic GSK-3β (Fig.6A), and this phosphorylation was further decreased in LY294002 pretreated cells. There was a concomitant increase in nuclear GSK-3β, and nuclear Ser9-phosphorylated GSK-3β was nearly undetectable after serum withdrawal or staurosporine treatments, suggesting that reduced Ser9 phosphorylation may facilitate nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β. In contrast, heat shock treatment caused a marked increase in the nuclear levels of phospho-Ser9 GSK-3β and total GSK-3β, and although LY294002 treatment reduced the nuclear level of phospho-Ser9 GSK-3β after heat shock treatment, the nuclear level of total GSK-3β was not decreased. These results indicate that Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β is unlikely to regulate the nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β. Phosphorylation of Tyr216 increases GSK-3β activity (34Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and Tyr216 phosphorylation was reported recently to be increased in the nucleus during staurosporine-induced apoptosis (20Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Serum withdrawal increased nuclear GSK-3β levels but did not change the level of phosphotyrosine GSK-3β. However, heat shock and staurosporine treatments caused increases in phosphotyrosine GSK-3β levels (Fig. 6B), equivalent to the nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β. All three treatments increased the activity of GSK-3β in the nucleus equivalent to the nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β. Taken together, these results indicate that nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β is independent of phosphorylations that regulate GSK-3β activity. Nuclear GSK-3β phosphorylates and induces the nuclear export of the cell cycle-associated protein cyclin D1 (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), a protein that regulates the G1/S transition. To examine whether heat shock-induced accumulation of nuclear GSK-3β affected cyclin D1, cells were treated with heat shock and lithium to inhibit GSK-3β activity. Lithium treatment alone did not affect the nuclear level of cyclin D1 (Fig.7, A and B). However, lithium concentration-dependently increased the heat shock-induced nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 without affecting the heat shock-induced increase in nuclear GSK-3β level. These results indicate that nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β contributes to the regulation of nuclear cyclin D1 levels. In addition to the well known regulation of GSK-3β by Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation, the results of the present study demonstrated that GSK-3β also can be regulated by redistribution within the cell. Three conditions known to induce apoptosis, serum withdrawal, heat shock, and staurosporine, all increased the nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β, and this redistribution appeared to be independent of site-specific phosphorylation of GSK-3β. In addition, the nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β induced by the apoptotic stimuli of heat shock and staurosporine preceded activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, an observation that may be relevant for apoptotic signaling cascades, because GSK-3β has previously been shown to contribute to the apoptotic signaling pathways induced by these treatments (22Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 23Bijur G.N. De Sarno P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7583-7590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the regulation of GSK-3β by phosphorylation, the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β is a dynamic process that also likely contributes to regulating the function of GSK-3β by controlling its accessibility to certain substrates. In light of recent findings that GSK-3β activity contributes to apoptotic signaling (reviewed in Ref. 1Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) it was particularly relevant to find that the apoptotic paradigms that are facilitated by increased GSK-3β activity, serum withdrawal, heat shock, and staurosporine, all induced GSK-3β nuclear accumulation. The intranuclear accumulation of GSK-3β was confirmed by inhibition of the nuclear transport machinery, as inhibition of nuclear import mechanisms inhibited the heat shock-induced nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β, and inhibition of the nuclear export-associated protein, CRM1, increased GSK-3β nuclear accumulation. One of the consequences of apoptosis is the disruption of the nuclear membrane by the action of caspases, thereby allowing the diffusion of cytosolic proteins in the nucleus (35Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, GSK-3β nuclear accumulation occurred prior to heat shock- and staurosporine-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, BAF, blocked caspase activation but did not prevent GSK-3β nuclear accumulation. These results indicate that the increase in nuclear GSK-3β levels precedes activation of the caspase cascade and therefore is independent of caspase activity and is an early event in apoptosis. Overall, these results demonstrate that the level of GSK-3β in the nucleus is dynamic and is subject to regulation by treatments that cause apoptosis. Because inhibition of GSK-3β attenuates apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 28Li, X., Bijur, G. N., and Jope, R. S. (2001) Bipolar Disord., in pressGoogle Scholar), the rapid accumulation of GSK-3β in the nucleus caused by apoptotic stimuli raises the possibility that phosphorylation of nuclear substrates by GSK-3β contributes, in part, to its facilitory effects on apoptosis. For example, nuclear GSK-3β phosphorylates, and thereby inhibits, the cell survival-promoting transcription factors heat shock factor-1 (14He B. Meng Y.H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29147-29152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and cAMP response element-binding protein (17Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 36Grimes, C. A., Jope, R. S. (2001) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic actions of nuclear substrates of GSK-3β may facilitate apoptosis. Although GSK-3β activity is regulated by Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation, the results presented here indicate that nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β caused by serum withdrawal, heat shock, and staurosporine was independent of phosphorylation at these sites. For example, heat shock and staurosporine had opposite effects on Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β, yet caused similar increases in the nuclear level of GSK-3β. Furthermore, the heat shock-, and staurosporine-induced increases in nuclear tyrosine phosphorylated GSK-3β were equivalent to the increases in total GSK-3β in the nucleus, indicating a lack of preferential nuclear accumulation of phospho-Tyr216-GSK-3β. Additionally, the magnitudes of the increases in nuclear GSK-3β activity were equivalent to the increases in nuclear GSK-3β levels. These results indicate that the recently reported increases in nuclear phospho-Tyr216-GSK-3β following treatments that induce apoptosis (20Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) likely reflect increased nuclear levels of GSK-3β rather than selective nuclear import of phospho-Tyr216-GSK-3β. Overall, these results suggest that Ser9 and Tyr216 phosphorylation do not regulate GSK-3β nuclear transport. Because these results demonstrate that the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β is a dynamic, regulated process, further investigations will be directed toward identifying the mechanisms responsible for nuclear import and export of GSK-3β. Nuclear GSK-3β has previously been shown to phosphorylate cyclin D1, which induces the export of cyclin D1 from the nucleus (12Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). To test whether nuclear GSK-3β accumulation after heat shock contributes to the regulation of nuclear cyclin D1 levels, the effect on cyclin D1 levels of inhibiting nuclear GSK-3β activity was tested using lithium, a selective inhibitor of GSK-3β (24Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). The paradigm of transiently treating cells with heat shock is particularly well suited for testing the regulation of cell cycle-associated proteins, such as cyclin D1, because short term exposure to heat shock induces a transient cell cycle arrest (reviewed in Ref. 37Kuhl N.M. Rensing L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 450-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and apoptosis. Treatment with lithium concentration-dependently increased nuclear cyclin D1 levels following heat shock, indicating that nuclear GSK-3β phosphorylated and facilitated the export of cyclin D1 from the nucleus in the absence of lithium. This action of lithium may contribute to its reported neuroprotective effects (1Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) by facilitating cell cycle arrest, thereby supporting recovery from potentially lethal stress. In summary, the results reported here demonstrate that stimuli that activate apoptotic signaling cascades that are known to be facilitated by GSK-3β induce a redistribution of GSK-3β from the cytosol to the nucleus early in the apoptotic process. These results indicate that besides site-specific phosphorylation, there is a spatial regulatory component associated with GSK-3β activity during apoptosis.

The association of these pathologies with changes in α4 and δ subunit expression and the observation that ligands with high affinity for α4βγ2 GABAA receptors are amethystic (35Suzdak P.D. Glowa J.R.

The development of such modulators has been held back on two counts. First, α4β3δ receptors cannot easily be expressed in transient recombinant systems, and so their properties remain unclear. Second, GABAA receptor drug-development programs have depended until now on difficult and time-consuming electrophysiological techniques or less sensitive radio-ion flux and pH methods for determining the effects of compounds on GABAAreceptor function (6Smith A.J.

Methods. 2000; 99: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have overcome these problems by creating a stable L(−tk) mouse cell line in which expression of α4β3δ receptors is under the control of a dexamethasone-induced promoter, and by developing an experimental system using fast ratiometric voltage-sensitive FRET (40Gonzalez J.E. Oades K. Leychkis Y. Harootunian A. Negulescu P.A. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to measure GABA-evoked changes in membrane potential. Fluorescence measurements of GABAA receptor function offer significant advantages because they are safe, are sufficiently sensitive to detect small potentiations and inhibitions, and can be miniaturized for future ultrahigh throughput applications. Furthermore, unlike high throughput radioligand binding assays, which have also been used for the development of GABAA receptor modulators, they can identify modulators regardless of their site of action. Here we describe the use of this novel fluorescence technique to characterize the pharmacological activation and modulation of GABAAreceptors with the subunit combinations α3β3γ2, α4β3γ2, and α4β3δ. L(−tk) cells were stably transfected, using a pMSGneo vector, with combinations of human GABAA receptor subunits. Expression of α, β, and γ subunits was controlled by a dexamethasone-inducible promoter as described previously (14Sur C. Farrar S. McKernan R. Atack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 41Hadingham K.L. Wingrove P.B. Wafford K.A. Bain C. Kemp J.A. Palmer K.J. Wilson A.W. Wilcox A.S. Sikela J.M. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1211-1218PubMed Google Scholar), whereas expression of δ subunits was constitutive. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using Myc-tagged subunits confirmed that δ subunits were only present at the cell surface if both α4 and β3 subunits were also present. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum (Fetalclone II) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were passaged weekly and for experiments were transferred to 96-well black-sided microtiter plates at a density that gave confluent monolayers on the days of experiments. Receptor expression was induced 24 h before experiments by replacing 50% of the medium with medium containing dexamethasone (1 µm final concentration). All experiments were performed in a low Cl− buffer (160 mm sodium d-gluconate, 4.5 mmpotassium d-gluconate, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were washed twice, leaving a 25-µl residual volume, and 55 µl of dye solutions were added to give final concentrations of 4 µmchlorocoumarin-2-dimyristoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (CC2-DMPE) and 1 µm bis(1,3-diethyl-2-thiobarbiturate)trimethineoxonol (DisBac2)(3). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature in darkness, cells were washed again, and 65 µl of dye solutions were added to give final concentrations of 1 µmDisBac2(3) and 0.5 mm tartrazine. Microtiter plates were then placed in a voltage/ion probe reader (VIPRTM; Aurora Biosciences Corp.), which performs automated additions of pharmacological stimuli and records fluorescence emission. Briefly, the VIPRTM consists of a Hamilton 2200 pipetter, an automated microplate positioning stage, and a fiber-optic illumination and detection system capable of measuring two emission wavelengths from eight wells simultaneously (40Gonzalez J.E. Oades K. Leychkis Y. Harootunian A. Negulescu P.A. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A 400DF15 filter was used in the excitation pathway, and 460DF45 and 580DF60 filters were used in the respective emission pathways. In all experiments, basal fluorescence was read for 8 s before addition of modulators, and then GABA was added 22 s later. Fluorescence emission from wells was recorded at 1 Hz. For each time point and for each fluorescence emission wavelength, we subtracted background fluorescence recorded from wells without cells in the same microtiter plate and calculated the ratio of fluorescence at 460 nm to that at 580 nm. GABA-evoked depolarizations were then expressed as a fractional change in this ratio. Algorithms written as Excel 97 (Microsoft Corp.) macros were used for automated calculations of fluorescence ratio and GABA responses (39Simpson P.B. Woollacott A.J. Pillai G.V. Maubach K.A. Hadingham K.L. Martin K. Choudhury H.I. Seabrook G.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 99: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and an iterative curve-fitting program (Prism, GraphPad Software Inc.) was used to fit concentration-effect relationships to a four-parameter logistic equation. DisBac2(3) and CC2-DMPE were from Aurora Biosciences Corp. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Life Technologies, Inc., and Fetalclone II was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Loreclezole was a gift from Janssen, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) was from Tocris (Baldwin, MO), and bretazenil was synthesized by Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories. Tartrazine, gluconate salts, and all other GABAA receptor modulators were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Previously, optical sensors of membrane potential operated through a slow redistribution of permeant ions or a rapid but insensitive perturbation of dyes attached to one face of the membrane (42Waggoner A.S. Grinvald F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1977; 303: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar, 43Loew L.M. Spectroscopic Membrane Probes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1988: 139-151Google Scholar, 44Loew L.M. Fluorescent and Luminescent Probes for Biological Activity. WAcademic, San Diego1993: 150-160Google Scholar). However, a recently developed membrane potential indicator, described in Fig. 1, uses FRET to provide a fluorescent readout of membrane potential that is both rapid and robust (45Gonzalez J.E. Tsien R.Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 269-277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Before using this technique to characterize cell lines expressing α4 subunit-containing GABAA receptors, we first established its pharmacological utility using cells expressing the well characterized subunit combination α3β3γ2. In low chloride medium, GABA-evoked depolarizations of cells expressing α3β3γ2 GABAAreceptors and loaded with CC2-DMPE and DisBac2(3) were rapidly transduced into decreased FRET, and, therefore, an increase in the ratio of fluorescence emission at 460 nm to that at 580 nm was seen (Fig. 2). The fluorescence emission ratio rose to a concentration-dependent plateau within 5 s that was sustained for >15 s. For the plateau phase of the response, measured as the mean normalized fluorescence emission ratio between 10 and 15 s after application of agonist, the half-maximal concentration (EC50) of GABA was 2.1 ± 0.2 µm, and the Hill slope (nH) was 1.5 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.E. of three experiments, Fig. 2b). We next examined receptor pharmacology by pretreating cells with compounds known to be active at α3β3γ2GABAA receptors and then applying a half-maximal concentration of GABA. α3β3γ2responses were blocked by the antagonists bicuculline (competitive) and picrotoxin (noncompetitive), potentiated by the benzodiazepine agonist zolpidem, and partially inhibited by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist dimethoxy-4-ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) (Fig.2c). These findings are highly consistent with those from electrophysiological experiments (38Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 240-244Google Scholar).Figure 2FRET-derived measurements of depolarizations mediated by α3β3γ2 GABAA receptors.a, L(−tk) cells expressing α3β3γ2GABAA receptors and loaded with the membrane potential indicator dye pair were stimulated with 30 (▪), 10 (●), 6 (▴), 3 (▾), 2 (♦), 1 (○), or 0.1 (⋄) µm GABA (shown by the black bar). The response shown is the ratio of fluorescence at 460 nm (f460) to that at 580 nm (f580) normalized to the mean ratio over the first 5 s of recording. b, the plateau ratio from a, taken as the mean between 10 and 15 s after addition of GABA, is shown as a function of GABA concentration. c, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of picrotoxin (●), bicuculline (▾), DMCM (○), or zolpidem (▴) before addition of GABA at a previously established half-maximal concentration (EC50). The effect of these compounds on GABA responses (calculated as for b) is shown as the percentage difference from control wells where no modulator was added. Maximum effects and EC50 values for these compounds were as follows: picrotoxin, −85% and 6.7 µm; bicuculline, −86% and 3.5 µm; DMCM, −28% and 0.044 µm; zolpidem, +32% and 0.055 µm. The data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having established that fluorescence measurements of GABAAreceptor function appear to reliably report receptor pharmacology, we then examined GABA-evoked changes in FRET using L(−tk) cells expressing either α4β3γ2GABAA receptors or the previously uncharacterized subunit combination α4β3δ. The kinetics of GABA-evoked depolarization were similar for these cells to those for cells expressing α3β3γ2GABAA receptors (Fig.3a). GABA, muscimol, and THIP were between 3 and 6 times more potent at α4β3δ receptors compared with α4β3γ2 (Figs. 2band 3b). The first detectable response to muscimol occurred 1 s earlier than that for GABA or THIP, but thereafter the three agonists evoked changes in fluorescence ratio with similar kinetics (Fig. 3c). Although less potent than GABA, THIP was a fully efficacious agonist at α4β3γ2receptors and a superagonist at α4β3δ (Fig. 3b). Responses mediated by both α4β3δ and α4β3γ2 receptors were inhibited by pretreatment with picrotoxin and bicuculline. Whereas picrotoxin (30 µm) inhibited the responses to all concentrations of GABA, bicuculline (30 µm) inhibited only submaximal responses, causing a 30-fold shift in the GABA concentration-response curve (Fig. 3d). We then examined the regulation of α4 subunit-containing GABAA receptors by a variety of known modulators of GABAA receptors, including benzodiazepines, steroids, and anesthetics (Table I). α4β3γ2 receptor-mediated responses were partially inhibited by pretreatment with DMCM, which had a similar efficacy to that at α3β3γ2.α4β3γ2responses were potentiated by nanomolar concentrations of bretazenil and Ro15-4513 but were insensitive to the classical benzodiazepine site agonists zolpidem and flunitrazepam (Fig.4). α4β3δ receptors were largely insensitive to the benzodiazepine site modulators used in this study with just two exceptions. First, Ro15-4513 inhibited α4β3δ-mediated responses, although with an EC50 100 times higher than that for its potentiation of α4β3γ2 receptors. Second, micromolar concentrations of ethyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate (β-CCE) potentiated responses mediated by both α4β3γ2 and α4β3δ receptors (Fig. 4). Micromolar concentrations of furosemide, an inhibitor of GABAAreceptors (20Wafford K.A. Thompson S.A. Thomas D. Sikela J. Wilcox A.S. Whiting P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 670-678PubMed Google Scholar, 46Korpi E.R. Lüddens H. Br. J.

The maximum effects shown are the mean of three experiments. β-CCM, methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate. Open table in a new tab L(−tk) cells expressing α4β3γ2 or α4β3δ receptors were pretreated with modulators of GABAA receptors before addition of GABA at half-maximal concentration. The effects of modulators on GABA responses (calculated as for Fig. 1b) were calculated as the percentage difference from the agonist response in parallel wells in which no modulator was added. The maximum effects shown are the mean of three experiments. β-CCM, methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate. α4β3γ2 and α4β3δ responses were potentiated by the anesthetics propofol and loreclezole and inhibited by the steroid pregnenolone (5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one). These compounds were of similar potency and efficacy at the two receptor types (Fig.5 and Table I). The steroid pregnanolone (5β-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one) inhibited, and alphaxalone (5α-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione) potentiated responses at both γ2- and δ-containing receptors. These agents had 3–4 times greater efficacy at α4β3δ compared with α4β3γ2 (Fig. 5). Alphaxalone, at concentrations above 3 µm, also directly activated GABAA receptors, evoking a depolarization of both cell types, again with greater efficacy at α4β3δ receptors (Fig. 5c). In contrast, applications of pregnenolone and pregnanolone, at concentrations of up to 30 µm, did not affect membrane potential directly. The barbiturate pentobarbital was another more efficacious (7-fold) potentiator of α4β3δ receptors compared with α4β3γ2 (Fig. 5b). As well as potentiating GABA responses, barbiturates can directly activate GABAA receptors, and this effect of pentobarbital showed the reverse subtype selectivity. Whereas high concentrations of pentobarbital depolarized cells expressing α4β3γ2 receptors, there was no discernible effect at α4β3δ (Fig.5c). In this study we have developed a novel fluorescence technique that provides rapid and sensitive measurements of GABAAreceptor function, and have used it to characterize a novel cell line expressing GABAA receptors with the composition α4β3δ. Our initial experiments, using cell lines expressing the previously characterized GABAAreceptor subunit combinations α3β3γ2 and α4β3γ2, demonstrated that GABAA receptor-mediated chloride fluxes were rapidly and reliably transduced into decreased FRET. In contrast to traditional fluorescence assays of membrane potential utilizing oxonol redistribution, GABA-evoked depolarization of cells loaded with CC2-DMPE and DisBac2(3) and excited with 410 nm light leads to a change in fluorescence emission that occurs within seconds rather than minutes. As previously reported, substitution of α4subunits for α3 did not affect GABA potency, which was similar to that previously reported for the same subunit combinations expressed in mammalian cells (6Smith A.J. Alder L. Silk J. Adkins C.E. Fletcher A.E. Scales T. Kerby J. McKernan R.M. Atack J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Knoflach F. Benke D. Wang Y. Scheurer L. Hartmut L. Hamilton B.J. Carter D.B. Mohler H. Benson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1253-1261PubMed Google Scholar). GABA-evoked responses were blocked by picrotoxin and bicuculline, and at α3β3γ2 and α4β3γ2 receptors, the efficacies and potencies of the benzodiazepines tested were very similar to published values (6Smith A.J. Alder L. Silk J. Adkins C.E. Fletcher A.E. Scales T. Kerby J. McKernan R.M. Atack J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Knoflach F. Benke D. Wang Y.

Woodward R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1364-1375PubMed Google Scholar). Thus FRET-derived measurements of membrane potential proved to be a sensitive and reliable indicator of GABAA receptor pharmacology. They gave results that were essentially indistinguishable from those for electrophysiological experiments and are likely to prove useful for studies of multiple receptor classes. While GABAA receptors composed of α, β, and γ subunits have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about the functional and pharmacological properties of receptor isoforms containing δ subunits. Receptors containing δ subunits in combination with α4, as occur in situ, have never been characterized. We therefore created a novel L(−tk) cell line in which expression of α4β3δ GABAA receptors was under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter, and used FRET-derived measurements of membrane potential to directly compare them to α4β3γ2 receptors. We found that δ subunits, compared with γ2, conferred higher affinity for all the agonists tested. The rank order for agonist potency muscimol > GABA > THIP was unchanged, but THIP acted as a superagonist at α4β3δ receptors, evoking substantially larger changes in FRET than either GABA or muscimol. Partial agonists at other GABAA receptor subtypes have been described, but no agonist has shown greater efficacy than GABA. An equally valid interpretation of this data, therefore, is that δ subunits, when combined with α4 and β3, confer partial agonism to GABA. The different potency, and perhaps efficacy, of GABA at α4β3γ2 and α4β3δ receptors suggest quite different physiological roles for these receptor isoforms. Low affinity receptors containing γ2 subunits may be suited to synapses where GABA is plentiful and a rapid dissociation rate is beneficial to high frequency signaling. Higher affinity δ subunit-containing receptors may, in an extrasynaptic location where GABA is at lower concentrations (48Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Brickley S.G. Cull-Candy S.G. Farrant M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2960-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have a modulatory role for which rapid responses are not required and for which a lower conductance is more appropriate. δ subunits were an important determinant of the effects of a variety of allosteric modulators, including benzodiazepines, steroids, and barbiturates. Substitution of γ2 subunits with δ abolished sensitivity to modulators acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. Although β-carbolines, such as β-CCE and methyl-β-carboline-3-carboxylate, inhibit GABAA receptors with high potency via the benzodiazepine binding site, they also potentiate GABA responses, with lower potency, via the loreclezole site present only on β2- and β3-containing receptors (10Stevenson A. Wingrove P.B. Whiting P.J. Wafford K.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 965-969PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the potentiation of both α4β3γ2and α4β3δ responses by β-CCE was almost certainly mediated by the binding site for loreclezole and does not indicate benzodiazepine sensitivity. Barbiturates are thought to potentiate the response of GABAA receptors irrespective of their subunit composition (47Whittemore E.R. Yang W. Drewe J.A. Woodward R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1364-1375PubMed Google Scholar). Both α4β3γ2 and α4β3δ responses were potentiated by pentobarbital. However, δ subunits, compared with γ2, conferred 7 times higher efficacy to pentobarbital. At micromolar concentrations, barbiturates have a second effect, directly activating GABAA receptors (50MacDonald R. Barker L. Nature. 1978; 271: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 51Borman J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 112-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). α4β3γ2 receptors were activated by pentobarbital, but this effect was abolished when γ2 subunits were substituted with δ. We conclude that δ and γ2 subunits affect both the modulation and activation of GABAA receptors by barbiturates. There may also be a role for β subunits since α4β3γ2 and α4β2γ2 receptors are activated by pentobarbital (47Whittemore E.R. Yang W. Drewe J.A. Woodward R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1364-1375PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the effect does not occur on α4β1γ2 (20Wafford K.A. Thompson S.A. Thomas D. Sikela J. Wilcox A.S. Whiting P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 670-678PubMed Google Scholar). α4β3γ2 and α4β3δ receptors were differentially modulated by steroids. In contrast to the stimulatory effect at other GABAA receptors (52Hevers W. Lüddens H. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 35-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), receptors containing α4subunits were inhibited by the naturally occurring neurosteroid pregnanolone. Furthermore, both pregnanolone and the synthetic anesthetic alphaxalone (52Hevers W. Lüddens H. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 35-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 53Turner D.M. Ransom R.W.

These data demonstrate that δ subunits are a critical determinant of neurosteroid efficacy, possibly accounting for the reduced behavioral effects of alphaxalone and pregnanolone in mice lacking δ subunits (55Mihalek R.M.

Our data imply that α4β3δ receptors may have a central role in these disorders and that new therapies might be developed by selective targeting of the steroid binding site of GABAAreceptors containing δ subunits. FRET-derived measurements of membrane potential provide the most robust and reliable high throughput assay of GABAA receptor function yet developed and will be an invaluable tool for characterizing novel subunit combinations and identifying new therapeutic modulators. When applied to cell lines expressing GABAA receptors with the subunit combinations α4β3γ2 and α4β3δ, this novel fluorescence technique revealed that δ subunits are an important determinant of the efficacy and potency of agonists and allosteric modulators. Of particular importance was the finding that α4β3δ receptors were markedly more sensitive to inhibition by pregnanolone, suggesting that this receptor subtype could be targeted for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome.

We now show that PP1 and PP2A serine-threonine phosphatases also have a positive role in Ras dependent Raf-1 activation. General serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitors such sodium fluoride, or ss-glycerophosphate and sodium pyrophosphate, or specific PP1 and PP2A inhibitors including microcystin-LR, protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor I(1) or protein phosphatase inhibitor 2 all abrogate H-Ras and K-Ras dependent Raf-1 activation in vitro. A critical Raf-1 target residue for PP1 and PP2A is S259. Serine phosphatase inhibitors block the dephosphorylation of S259, which accompanies Raf-1 activation, and Ras dependent activation of mutant Raf259A is relatively resistant to serine phosphatase inhibitors. Sucrose gradient analysis demonstrates that serine phosphatase inhibition increases the total amount of 14-3-3 and Raf-1 associated with the plasma membrane and significantly alters the distribution of 14-3-3 and Raf-1 across different plasma membrane microdomains. These observations suggest that dephosphorylation of S259 is a critical early step in Ras dependent Raf-1 activation which facilitates 14-3-3 displacement. Inhibition of PP1 and PP2A therefore causes plasma membrane accumulation of Raf-1/14-3-3 complexes which cannot be activated."

These findings suggest the possibility that mammalian Sprouty proteins are not general inhibitors of RTK-induced ERK signaling but are rather selective inhibitors of RTK signaling. However, most of these studies used an overexpression system, and biochemical analysis of a negative feedback function of endogenous Sproutys remains to be investigated. We recently identified novel family members of aSprouty-related EVH1domain-containing protein, SPRED (20Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). SPRED proteins contain an N-terminal EVH-1 (Ena/VASP homology-1) domain and a conserved cysteine-rich domain that is related to Sprouty. Like Sprouty, SPREDs also down-regulate Ras/ERK signaling (20Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of Ras/MAP kinase suppression and the functional relationship between SPRED and Sprouty at endogenous protein levels have not been clarified. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 are downstream targets of ERK and selective inhibitors of growth factor-mediated ERK activation. The results strongly suggest the presence of a Sprouty-sensitive and -insensitive ERK activation pathway. Human EGF and bFGF were purchased from PeproTech EC, Ltd. Polyclonal anti-ERK2 and anti-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Flag (M2) antibody and PDBu were from SIGMA. Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody was from Cell Signaling. Rabbit serum against mouse Sprouty4 was generated by injecting glutathione S-transferase-fused polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 1–160 of Sprouty4. Elk-1 activation was measured as described (21Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In all reporter assays, 2 × 105 293 cells were plated on 6-well dishes and transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Full-length cDNA of human Sprouty2, human p120-RasGAP, mouse Sprouty4, and dSPRED was cloned by polymerase chain reaction with primers designed against the published sequence from human placenta, 11.5 day mouse embryo, or 0–4-h Drosophila embryo cDNA libraries. Wild-type Sproutys, dSPRED cDNA, and mutants were subcloned intoEcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 with 6xMyc epitope tag at the N terminus or into EcoRI/SalI sites of Flag-pCMV2 (Kodak). cDNAs of mouse Sprouty4 corresponding to codon 1–196, human Sprouty2 corresponding to codon 1–204, and human Sprouty4 corresponding to nucleotides 8–768 of published sequence AF227516 (GenBank accession number) were cloned in T-vector (Promega) and used for riboprobe production. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (21Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected 293 cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin) and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with buffer A and once with buffer B (20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). ERK2 kinase activity was assayed in buffer B containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 100 μm cold ATP, 25 mm magnesium chloride, and 5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP; Upstate Biotechnology, Co.) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After stimulation of human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells with bFGF and EGF, Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 expression was induced rapidly (Fig.1, A and B). The mRNA accumulation was seen 1 h after stimulation and was not inhibited by the treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 1, B andC), a general translation inhibitor, indicating thatSprouty2 and Sprouty4 are early-response genes. To investigate the regulation of Sprouty gene expression, we used extracellular stimulation that activates the ERK pathway. PDBu activated ERK1/2 and induced a strong accumulation of both Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 mRNA (Fig. 1C). We confirmed PDBu-induced Sprouty4 protein accumulation by immunoblotting (see Fig.4C). On the other hand, in the presence of PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1, the ability of EGF, FGF, and PDBu to induce Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 mRNA was significantly attenuated (Fig.1C). These data suggest that activation of the ERK pathway by mitogenic stimuli induces Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 in cultured cells. It has been reported that during embryogenesis the expression of eachSprouty1–4 gene is associated with FGF signaling in both mouse and chick embryos, even though there are significant differences in the expression pattern among them (16Minowada G.

Therefore, in addition to spatial and temporal regulation, each Sprouty gene might be differentially regulated at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels.Figure 4Dominant negative Sproutys enhanced bFGF- but not EGF-induced ERK2 activation.

Cell extracts were analyzed by Western blots with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the functional difference in the inhibitory activity of Sproutys for several growth factors, we expressed the dSprouty, human Sprouty2, and murine Sprouty4 proteins under a constitutive heterologous promoter in 293 cells. SPREDs that contain the Sprouty-related domain were also examined (20Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Kato R. Shouda T. Matsumoto A. Miyoshi K. Tsuneoka M. Komiya S. Baron R. Yoshimura A. Nature. 2001; 412: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). As one of the nuclear targets of ERK is Elk-1, a transcription factor of the Ets family, EGF-induced activation of ERK can be monitored by measuring the rate of Elk-1-dependent transcription. The results show that expression of fly (dSPRED) and mouse SPRED (SPRED1) completely blocked the EGF-mediated activation of Elk-1, whereas expression of fly and mammalian Sproutys could not inhibit EGF-induced Elk-1 activation at all (Fig. 2A, left panel). By contrast, under the same experimental conditions, Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 as well as SPREDs suppressed bFGF-induced Elk-1 activation (Fig. 2A, right panel). Interestingly, although dSprouty has been shown to be a common RTK-induced ERK inhibitor, it did not function in the 293 human cell system (Fig. 2A). To confirm the selective effect of Sprouty4 on FGF- and EGF-induced ERK activation, we titrated an amount of Sprouty4 and SPRED1 plasmids and found that Sprouty4 could not inhibit EGF-induced Elk-1 activation (Fig. 2B, left panel) but suppressed FGF signaling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, right panel). The inhibitory effect of Sprouty4 on Elk-1 activity was about 70% at most, and Sprouty4 could not completely inhibit Elk1 activity even when the amount of plasmid was increased. Sprouty4 inhibited, but not completely, FGF-induced phosphorylation of the conserved TEY motif within the activation loop of ERK (Fig. 2C). Suppression of FGF-induced ERK kinase activity was confirmed by using an in vitro kinase assay (see Fig.3B). Again, Sprouty4 did not completely inhibit ERK activation. On the contrary, Sprouty4 could not reduce EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation but rather slightly enhanced it (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained with Sprouty2 (data not shown). We also found that Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 suppressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and c-Kit (data not shown) but not PDBu-triggered ERK activation (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that EGF and PDBu activate ERK mainly through a Sprouty-resistant pathway, whereas FGF and some other RTKs utilize both a Sprouty-sensitive and -resistant pathway. To investigate the roles of endogenous Sproutys on ERK activation, we searched the mutations of Sprouty4 that have a dominant negative effect against wild-type (WT) Sprouty4. Among the mutants we created, we identified a dominant negative effect by Y53A-Sprouty4, which carries the substitution of alanine for tyrosine 53. This Tyr53 was conserved among Sprouty proteins (Fig.3A) and was essential for the function of other Sproutys. 2A. Sasaki, T. Taketomi, T. Wakioka, R. Kato, and A. Yoshimura, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, C-terminal truncation resulted in just a loss-of-function mutant. As shown in Fig. 3B, the dC104 mutant of Sprouty4 did not affect the inhibitory effect of WT-Sprouty4 and SPRED1. Although the overexpression of the Y53A-Sprouty4 mutant overcame the inhibitory effect of WT-Sprouty4 but not SPRED1 (Fig.3B). Y53A-Sprouty4 could also overcome the inhibitory effect of WT-Sprouty2 (Fig. 3C). Y55A-Sprouty2, which carries the same mutation as Y53A-Sprouty4, inhibited WT-Sprouty2 and WT-Sprouty4 activity (Fig. 3D and data not shown). These data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms or targets are common between Sprouty2 and Sprouty4. Because dSprouty has been shown to interact with RasGAP in vitro (12Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Y53A-Sprouty4 on RasGAP. As shown in Fig. 3E, Y53A-Sprouty4 did not affect the RasGAP-induced suppression of ERK activation. This suggests that Y53A substitution is a dominant negative-type mutation that is specific to Sproutys. The molecular mechanisms of the dominant negative action of the Y53A mutant are currently not clear. However, our preliminary data suggest that Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 form homo- and hetero-oligomers through their cysteine-rich regions and that these dominant negative Sproutys still bind to WT-Sprouty2 and Sprouty4.2 Thus, we speculate that Sproutys function as oligomers and that dominant negative action may be achieved by replacing the WT-Sproutys with a nonfunctional mutant. To determine whether endogenous Sproutys are involved in regulating the FGF-induced ERK pathway, we transfected the dominant negative mutant Sproutys, and then ERK activation was measured with an anti-phospho ERK antibody (Fig.4, A and B). Transfection of Y53A-Sprouty4 and Y55A-Sprouty2 enhanced and sustained FGF-induced ERK activation (Fig. 4A). By contrast, under the same conditions, it did not enhance EGF-induced ERK activation (Fig. 4B). Because WT-Sproutys affect FGF- but not EGF-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2), the selective effect of Y53A-Sprouty4 and Y55A-Sprouty2 on FGF and EGF supports the dominant negative effect of these mutants against the endogenous Sproutys. Next we examined whether prior-expression of endogenous Sproutys suppresses FGF-induced ERK activation. Although PDBu induced Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 (Fig. 1C), they did not affect PDBu-induced ERK activity (ref.18 and Fig. 2E). Thus, we treated 293 cells with PDBu for 8–12 h to accumulate endogenous Sproutys, and then cells were stimulated with EGF or FGF (Fig. 4C). ERK activity returned to basal levels, but Sprouty4 protein remained at high levels after PDBu treatment (Fig. 4C, lower panel). EGF-induced ERK activation was slightly enhanced by PDBu treatment, whereas FGF-induced ERK activation was partially suppressed (Fig.4C). This PDBu-mediated down-regulation of FGF-induced ERK activation was not observed when Y53A-Sprouty4 was overexpressed (Fig.4D). These data suggest that the antagonistic effect of PDBu on FGF-induced ERK activation is, at least in part, attributed to the Sprouty proteins induced by PDBu. Therefore, we propose that Sproutys are a negative feedback regulator of ERK but that they exhibit different suppressive effect on ERK activity induced by different stimuli. Finally, we examined the physiological function of Sproutys on growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, which is dependent on the ERK pathway (23Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 24Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Sprouty4 mRNA was strongly induced in response to bFGF and NGF in rat PC12 cells (Fig.5A). Then, we examined the effect of WT-Sprouty4 or the Y53A dominant negative mutant on an FGF-mediated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. As shown in Fig.5B, WT-Sprouty4 blocked the neurite outgrowth induced by bFGF. In contrast, Y53A increased the number of differentiated cells at low bFGF concentration (Fig. 5C). Similar results were obtained for NGF-induced differentiation (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that Sprouty4 and probably other Sproutys are among the negative feedback regulators of FGF and NGF signaling in PC12 cells. As shown in these experiments, the dominant negative mutant Sprouty may be a useful tool for the study of physiological function of Sproutys. Previous studies suggested the presence of Sprouty-sensitive and -resistant ERK activation pathways in response to different stimuli (18Lee S.H. Schloss D.J. Jarvis L. Krasnow M.A. Swain J.L. J.

However, these studies used overexpression of WT-Sproutys, and the effect of endogenous Sproutys on ERK activity remained to be investigated. Because multiple Sprouty genes are induced by a single stimulus, and these genes have similar effect on ERK, the effect of antisense oligonucleotides or disruption of the single gene may be compensated by others. In the present study, we have developed dominant negative Sproutys and shown that endogenous Sprouty2 and Sprouty4 are physiological negative feedback regulators of FGF but not EGF-induced ERK activation. Interestingly, it has been shown that Sproutys regulate other signaling pathways in addition to ERK (19Impagnatiello M.A. Weitzer S. Gannon G. Compagni A. Cotten M. Christofori G. J.

The effect of endogenous Sproutys on other signaling pathways will be verified by using the dominant negative form of Sproutys. It has been reported that MAP kinase phosphatases including MKP-1 and MKP-2 are negative feedback regulators of the ERK pathway (26Bokemeyer D. Sorkin A. Yan M. Ahn N.G. Tempketon D.J. Dunn M.J. J.

However, MAP kinase phosphatases inhibit ERK by dephosphorylation, and therefore they can down-regulate ERK activation in response to any stimuli (28Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

Thus, Sproutys may play a role not only in the negative feedback loop of ERK but also in cross-talk among different stimuli. Further study of the mechanism of selective inhibition of ERK by Sproutys will uncover a novel signaling pathways toward ERK. We gratefully acknowledge Dr. E. Nishida and Dr. Y.

https://openalex.org/W2072098931,"The tumor suppressor gene PTEN(MMAC1/TEP1) is lost frequently in advanced prostate cancer (PCa). However, the function of PTEN in tumorigenesis is not understood fully. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of Bcl-2 in prostate tumors correlates with loss of the PTEN protein. This finding was verified by studies in the PCa cell lines DU145, PC-3, LNCaP, and an androgen-refractory subline of LNCaP. Transient transfection of PTEN into the PTEN-null cells resulted in decreased levels of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein. These effects appear to be mediated at the level of gene transcription, since a Bcl-2 promoter-reporter construct was down-regulated by ectopic expression of PTEN in LNCaP cells. The inhibition of Bcl-2 required the lipid-phosphatase activity of PTEN and was blocked by overexpression of a constitutively active form of Akt. Moreover, the transcription-regulatory protein cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) may be involved, since decreased phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 was detected following PTEN expression, and ectopic expression of CREB repressed completely the PTEN-induced inhibition of Bcl-2 promoter activity. Furthermore, cotransfection of Bcl-2 and PTEN expression vectors rescued PTEN-induced cell death but not G1 cell cycle arrest. Finally, forced expression of PTEN sensitized LNCaP cells to cell death induced by staurosporine, doxorubicin, and vincristine, and this chemosensitivity was attenuated by exogenous expression of Bcl-2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that loss of PTEN leads to up-regulation of thebcl-2 gene, thus contributing to survival and chemoresistance of PCa cells. These findings suggest that thePTEN gene and its regulated pathway are potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer.

The most effective therapy for advanced PCa for the past 50 years has been the removal of testicular androgens (2Huggins C. Hodges C.V. Cancer Res. 1941; 1: 293-297Google Scholar). However, a majority of tumors become metastatic and escape their dependence on androgens following hormonal therapy (3Crawford E.D. Eisenberger M.A. McLeod D.G. Spaulding J.T. Benson R. Dorr F.A.

Due to the limits of our understanding of the mechanism of PCa progression, there is no curable therapeutic option available for advanced PCa.

Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 1922-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). One of the downstream targets of phosphoinositide 3-kinase is the proto-oncogene AKT (also known as PKB) (20Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, activate Akt by binding to its pleckstrin homology domain. Active Akt modulates a number of downstream targets that affect apoptosis and cell cycling (21Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Thebcl-2 oncogene acts as an inhibitor of apoptosis by forming a dimer with the proapoptotic protein Bax, thereby blocking cytochromec release from mitochondria (31Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4790) Google Scholar). In the normal prostate, Bcl-2 is expressed only in basal epithelial cells (32Hockenbery D.M. Zutter M. Hickey W. Nahm M.

Campbell M.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6940-6944PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of Bcl-2 is frequently observed in prostate cancer and is implicated in the progression of androgen-dependent to androgen-independent PCa (33McDonnell T.J. Troncoso P.

Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar, 37Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar, 38Miyake H. Tolcher A. Gleave M.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying overexpression of Bcl-2 and its associated chemoresistance in PCa are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a causal relationship between PTEN loss and overexpression of Bcl-2 in prostate cancer. Transient transfection studies indicate that PTEN-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 requires not only its lipid phosphatase function but also its modulating effects on Akt and CREB signaling. In addition, we show that PTEN-induced chemosensitivity in PCa cells is achieved, at least in part, by inhibition of Bcl-2 expression. The prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). An androgen-refractory subline of LNCaP, LNCaP-Rf, was established by following the protocol described previously (39Kokontis J. Takakura K. Hay N. Liao S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP-Rf cells were cultured in androgen-deprived medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum instead of untreated fetal bovine serum. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion analysis. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for PTEN and/or Bcl-2 along with pEGFP-N1. 12 h after transfection, transfected cells were sorted for EGFP expression as described previously (40Thangaraju M. Kaufmann S.H. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33487-33496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Enriched cells (5 × 105) were seeded into the 35-mm plate. Following treatments with staurosporine (500 nm), doxorubicin (500 ng/ml), or vincristine (500 ng/ml) (Calbiochem), adherent and nonadherent cells were collected over the time course indicated. Cells were stained with trypan blue reagent (Sigma). Seventeen cases of prostate tumors were selected from the surgical pathology files at the Mayo Clinic from patients who had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy between 1991 and 1994. All patients had clinically localized prostate cancer, and none had received preoperative hormone or radiation therapy. The distribution of Gleason scores was as follows: Gleason 7 (seven cases), Gleason 8 (four cases), and Gleason 9 (six cases). The distribution of pathological TNM stage (1997) was as follows: T2bN0 (four cases), T3aN0 (three cases), T3bN0 (five cases), T3bN1 (two cases), and T3bN2 (three cases). Five-micrometer sections were cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and immunohistochemistry was performed. Sections were treated with 0.1 m citrate (pH 6.0) in an 800-watt microwave oven for 15 min for antigen retrieval. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (41Cheville J.C. Lloyd R.V. Sebo T.J. Cheng L. Erickson L. Bostwick D.G. Lohse C.M. Wollan P. Mod. Pathol. 1998; 11: 324-328PubMed Google Scholar) by using the Elite Avidin-biotin-peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Antibodies for immunohistochemistry staining of PTEN and Bcl-2 proteins are the same as those used for Western blot analysis. The association of Bcl-2 expression and PTEN loss was tested by using InStat software. Immunofluorescence studies were performed as described previously (42Papoutsopoulou S. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7300-7310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h after subculture. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and fixed for 10 min in 1× PBS, 2% sucrose, 3.7% formaldehyde. After one wash with 1× PBS, 0.1 m glycine for 5 min, cells were premeabilized and treated with blocking solution (1× PBS, 5% normal goat serum, 0.4% Triton X-100) for 20 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-PTEN mouse monoclonal antibody (6H2.1; Cascade BioScience) or anti-Bcl-2 murine monoclonal antibody (100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (1:100). Coverslips were washed 5 min each four times with solution (1× PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100). Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (1:1000) for 1 h. Following two washes, cells were counterstained with bisbenzimide (Sigma) at 1 µg/ml for 2 min. Coverslips were washed twice with 1× PBS and mounted on glass slides using ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Fluorecein and bisbenzimide fluorescence was detected with 488- and 385-nm, respectively, on a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal laser microscope. A full-length PTEN cDNA clone was provided by Dr. C. D. James (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). A wild-type PTEN expression plasmid (pCMV-PTEN) was constructed by subcloning the full-length cDNA into pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The PTEN open reading frame was confirmed by sequencing in both directions. PTEN mutants were generated by using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward primers used for polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis were the following: pCMV-PTEN-C124S, 5′-AGCAATTCACTCTAAAGCTGGAAAGGGACGAACTGGTG-3′; pCMV-PTEN-G129E, 5′-CTGTAAAGCTGGAAAGGAACGAACTGGTGTAATGATATGTGC-3′; pCMV-PTEN-G129R, 5′-CTGTAAAGCTGGAAAGAGACGAACTGGTGTAATGATATGTGC-3′ (the altered nucleic acids are underlined). All of the PTEN mutants were verified by sequencing. Oligonucleotides for the core promoter region of the human bcl-2 gene (from −1287 to −1652) were synthesized based upon the published sequences (43Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W.

A reporter construct containing the Bcl-2 promoter (pBcl-2-Luc) was generated by cloning the DNA fragment into the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The pRL Renilla luciferase vector was purchased from Promega. pUSE-Bcl-2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). pEGFP-N1 and pCMV-CREB were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A myristoylated form of Akt was provided by Dr. L. M. Karnitz (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Protein samples were prepared by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). Equal amounts of protein (15–50 µg) from cell lysates were denatured in sample buffer; subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8, 12, or 4–20% gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The filters were immunoblotted with specific primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A monoclonal antibody against PTEN (6H2.1) was purchased from Cascade BioScience (Winchester, MA). A monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (2-28-33) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against Bcl-2 (100), Bcl-XL (H-5), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (D-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), CREB, and phospho-CREB (Ser133) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Transient transfections of LNCaP and PC-3 cells were performed by electroporation. Total plasmid DNA (5–20 µg) was kept constant for all transfections by adding empty vectors and pEGFP-N1 plasmid (1–2 µg). Cells were mixed with DNA in 400 µl of growth medium. The DNA-cell mixture was transferred into a 4-mm cuvette (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA) and electroporated with a 150–300-V/10-ms pulse using a BTX T820 square wave electroporator (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). In each experiment, transfection efficiency was monitored 12 h after transfection by examining aliquots of cells under a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with a wavelength of 488 nm. Transfection efficiency was determined by the percentage of the green cells in the whole cell population. Routinely, 70–95% transfection efficiencies were obtained, and the cells with >75% transfection efficiency were used for further experiments. Northern blot analysis of Bcl-2 RNA expression was performed as described previously (46Huang H. Reed C.P. Zhang J.S. Shridhar V. Wang L. Smith D.I. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2981-2988PubMed Google Scholar). Cells transfected with pCMV-PTEN or a control vector were collected, and total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). Aliquots (15 µg) of cellular RNA were separated on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels. A fragment for human Bcl-2 cDNA in pB4 plasmid, purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, was used as a probe for Northern blot hybridization. After stripping, the blot was reprobed with a PTEN cDNA fragment (corresponding to the open reading frame of thePTEN gene) to monitor the ectopic expression of thePTEN gene. Regulation of Bcl-2 promoter activity was determined by using luciferase reporter assays. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfections, and cell lysates were prepared by adding lysis buffer directly to the cells on ice. Firefly luciferase andRenilla luciferase activities were determined using a dual luciferase kit (Promega), and Renilla luciferase activities of cells were used as internal controls. The cells were sorted for EGFP expression 12 h after transfection using FACS Vantage SE (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Enriched transfected cells were cultured for an additional 48 h. Cells were collected and fixed in freshly prepared ice-cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. After washing with 1× PBS, the cells were stained with 10 µg/ml propidium iodide and 50 µg/ml RNase A. Cells (1 × 106) were incubated for 30 min. Cell cycle distributions were determined by flow cytometry analysis using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Cells were lysed in HFS solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 µg/ml propidium iodide), and hypodiploid nuclei were counted by flow cytometry to identify those undergoing apoptosis. Cell cycle and apoptosis data were analyzed with ModFit II and WinMDI software, respectively. A number of studies have reported either loss of PTEN or overexpression of Bcl-2 in advanced prostate tumors (9Suzuki H. Freije D. Nusskern D.R. Okami K. Cairns P. Sidransky D. Isaacs W.B. Bova G.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 204-209PubMed Google Scholar, 10McMenamin M.E. Soung P. Perera S. Kaplan I. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4291-4296PubMed Google Scholar, 33McDonnell T.J. Troncoso P. Brisbay S.M. Logothetis C. Chung L.W. Hsieh J.T. Tu S.M. Campbell M.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6940-6944PubMed Google Scholar). However, no study has examined expression of both proteins in the same tumors. Therefore, we utilized immunohistochemistry to measure expression of PTEN and Bcl-2 in 17 cases of high grade (Gleason score 7 or higher) prostate tumors. As shown in TableI, there was an inverse correlation of PTEN and Bcl-2 staining in 82.4% of the tumors examined (41.2% exhibited negative staining for PTEN but positive staining for Bcl-2, whereas 41.2% exhibited positive staining for PTEN but negative staining for Bcl-2). Examples of each type of staining pattern can be seen in Fig. 1, where case A exhibits PTEN (+) and Bcl-2 (−), and case B exhibits PTEN (−) and Bcl-2 (+). Expression of both PTEN and Bcl-2 proteins was also examined in the PCa cell lines DU145, PC-3, LNCaP, and LNCaP-Rf, an androgen-refractory subline of LNCaP. As shown in Fig.2A, DU145 cells express PTEN, but not Bcl-2. In contrast, PC-3, LNCaP, and LNCaP-Rf cells express Bcl-2 but not PTEN. Expression levels of PTEN and Bcl-2 proteins in individual cells were further analyzed by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 2B, although PTEN protein was detected, no Bcl-2 protein was evident in DU145 cells. In contrast, Bcl-2 protein was observed, but no PTEN was detectable in PC-3, LNCaP, and LNCaP-Rf cells. Taken together, these studies show that Bcl-2 expression is inversely correlated with PTEN loss in many malignant prostate tissues and cell lines.Table ISummary of PTEN and Bcl-2 protein expression in prostate cancer tissues from radical prostatectomy specimensPTEN (−)1-aCases were scored as PTEN-negative when staining was lost in 60% or more of the malignant cells; otherwise they were scored as positive.PTEN (+)% (count/total)Bcl-2 (+)1-bCases were scored as Bcl-2-positive when staining was seen in 30% or more of the malignant cells; otherwise they were scored as negative.41.21-cLoss of PTEN and expression of Bcl-2 in these tumors were analyzed statistically using a linear correlation test (see “Experimental Procedures”).

To determine a causal relationship between the PTEN loss and Bcl-2 overexpression, we transiently transfected a PTEN expression vector into LNCaP and PC-3 cells. As shown in Fig.3, ectopic expression of PTEN in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells resulted in decreased levels of Bcl-2 protein in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, PTEN did not affect the expression of Bcl-XL, another antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, in either LNCaP or PC-3 cells (Fig. 3). We next examined the steady-state levels of Bcl-2 mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Bcl-2 mRNA was found to be down-regulated by PTEN expression in LNCaP cells (Fig.4A), suggesting that regulation of Bcl-2 expression by PTEN is at the transcriptional level or involves mRNA stability. In order to determine if transcriptional activity of Bcl-2 is modulated by PTEN expression, we utilized a reporter construct that contained the Bcl-2 core promoter region from −1652 to −1527, since both basal and growth factor-stimulated transcriptional activity of Bcl-2 is mediated by this region (27Wilson B.E.

https://openalex.org/W1593693427,"The microtubule-associated protein tau is a family of six isoforms that becomes abnormally hyperphosphorylated and accumulates in neurons undergoing neurodegeneration in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated the isoform-specific interaction of normal tau with AD hyperphosphorylated tau (AD P-tau). We found that the binding of AD P-tau to normal human recombinant tau was τ4L > τ4S > τ4 and τ3L > τ3S > τ3, and that its binding to τ4L was greater than to τ3L. AD P-tau also inhibited the assembly of microtubules promoted by each tau isoform and caused disassembly when added to preassembled microtubules. This inhibition and depolymerization of microtubules by the AD P-tau corresponded directly to the degree of its interaction with the different tau isoforms. In vitro hyperphosphorylation of recombinant tau (P-tau) conferred AD P-tau-like characteristics. Like AD P-tau, P-tau interacted with and sequestered normal tau and inhibited microtubule assembly. These studies suggest that the AD P-tau interacts preferentially with the tau isoforms that have the amino-terminal inserts and four microtubule binding domain repeats and that hyperphosphorylation of tau appears to be sufficient to acquire AD P-tau characteristics. Thus, lack of amino-terminal inserts and extra microtubule binding domain repeat in fetal human brain might be protective from Alzheimer's neurofibrillary degeneration.

Alzheimer's disease abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism-linked to chromosome 17 paired helical filaments microtubule-associated protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid A common feature among several neurodegenerative dementias called tauopathies, which include Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 and frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism-linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), is the accumulation in the brain neurons of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau, mostly polymerized into tangles of paired helical filaments (PHF). The number of neurofibrillary tangles is known to directly correlate to the degree of dementia in AD patients (1Tomlinson B.E. Blessed G. Roth M. J. Neurol.

Furthermore, the recent discovery of the co-segregation of specific mutations in the tau gene with disease in some pedigrees of FTDP-17 has confirmed that certain abnormalities in the tau protein can cause neurodegeneration and dementia in the affected individuals (4Poorkaj P.

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism of neurofibrillary degeneration is critical to developing a rational therapeutic treatment of AD and related tauopathies. Tau is one of the major and most studied microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in the central nervous system. It promotes assembly of tubulin both in vitro and in vivo into microtubules and maintains the microtubule structure (7Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Tau is a phosphoprotein, and its biological activity is regulated by its degree of phosphorylation (9Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5301-5305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In AD brain, tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and is present as cytosolic protein (10Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Zaidi T.

Unlike normal tau, which contains two or three phosphate groups, the cytosolic hyperphosphorylated tau from AD brain (AD P-tau) contains 5–9 mol of phosphate/mol of the protein (11Köpke E. Tung Y.-C. Shaikh S. Alonso A.del C. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24374-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tau is a family of six proteins derived from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing (14Himmler A. Drechsel D. Kirschner M.W. Martin Jr., D.W. Mol. Cell.

They differ in whether they contain three (τ3L, τ3S, or τ3) or four (τ4L, τ4S, or τ4) tubulin binding domains (repeats, R) of 31 or 32 amino acids, each in the C-terminal half, and two (τ3L, τ4L), one (τ3S, τ4S), or no (τ3, τ4) inserts of 29 amino acids each in the N-terminal portion of the molecule (Fig. 1). All of the six isoforms have been reported to be present in a hyperphosphorylated state in PHF (12Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Quinlan M. Tung Y.-C. Zaidi M.S. Wisniewski H.M. J. Biol.

Recently, a silent exon 10 mutation, N296N, has also been found to affect the alternate splicing of this exon, resulting in overexpression of 4Rτ (19Spillantini M.G. Yoshida H. Rizzini C. Lantos P.L. Khan N. Rossor N.N. Goedert M. Brown J. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 49: 939-943Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that AD P-tau sequesters normal tau, MAP1, and MAP2 and disassembles microtubules and that the dephosphorylation of AD P-tau eliminates this toxic property (20Alonso A.del C.

Here we show that (i) the binding of AD P-tau to normal τ4L > τ4S > τ4 and τ3L > τ3S > τ3, and that to 4Rτ tends to be greater than to the corresponding 3Rτ, and (ii) AD P-tau inhibits the assembly and disrupts the microtubules formed with any of the six tau isoforms, and this inhibition and depolymerization of microtubules by the AD P-tau corresponds directly to the degree of its interaction with the different tau isoforms. We also show that in vitrohyperphosphorylation of recombinant human tau by brain protein kinases converts it into an AD P-tau-like state.

The phosphocellulose-purified tau was further purified on a Sephacryl 300 column. The tau fraction was detected using the Tau-1 antibody, and the peak was concentrated, dialyzed, and lyophilized as described below for the normal brain tau. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. After dialysis against 5 mm MES and 0.05 mm EGTA, pH 6.8, tau was aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at −75 °C until used. Normal tau was purified as described (11Köpke E. Tung Y.-C. Shaikh S.

Once concentrated, the sample was dialyzed against 5 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.05 mm EGTA, aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at −75 °C until used. cDNAs of tau deletion mutants were prepared from human brain mRNA using specific primers by PCR with reagents and conditions described in the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amplification products were cloned into pBluescript II KS+/− (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide procedure of Sangeret al. (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Expressed and purified (FPLC-Mono-S; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) tau deletion constructs were analyzed as described (35Novak M. Kabat J. Wischik C.M.

Because monoclonal antibody Tau-1 recognizes tau only when it is not phosphorylated at Ser195/198/199/202, to detect AD P-tau, the blots were pretreated with alkaline phosphatase (196 units/ml) in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 h prior to incubation with the primary antibody (13Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.-C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4913-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of τ4L was performed using 100,000 × g brain extract from a 20-day-old rat as the source of protein kinases as described previously (38Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The mol of32P/mol of tau was calculated using [γ-32P]ATP of a known specific activity and, as control, the brain extract without exogenous tau. Different amounts (0.5, 1, 2, and 3 μg) of AD P-tau were dotted on nitrocellulose paper and overlaid with each recombinant human tau isoform or the tau deletion constructs (8 μg/ml). All of the incubations, blocking, and washing were done as previously described (39Kremer L. Dominguez J.E. Avila J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant tau isoforms were detected by using monoclonal antibody Tau-1, whereas monoclonal antibody MN37 was used for tau deletion constructs. The association between AD P-tau and recombinant taus by the sedimentation assay was carried out as described previously (21Alonso A.del C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Any of the six isoforms or the tau fragments (100 μg) was mixed with AD P-tau (8 μg) in a final volume of 100 μl of 100 mm MES buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μmaprotinin, and 1 μm leupeptin (binding buffer). The mixture was allowed to interact for 1 h at 30 °C and then was overlaid on 100 μl of 8% sucrose in the binding buffer and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. After centrifugation, 150 μl of the supernatant from the top was separated, and the rest, 50 μl, which contained the AD P-tau-N-tau complexes, was sonicated for 1 h in a bath sonicator and assayed for the levels of normal tau by radioimmuno-dot-blot assay using Tau-1 antibody. MAP-free tubulin was isolated from bovine brain by phosphocellulose chromatography of thrice-cycled microtubules as previously described (20Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Tau isoforms (83–333 μg/ml) were mixed at 4 °C with purified bovine brain MAP-free tubulin (2 mg/ml) and 1 mm GTP, all in polymerization buffer (100 mmMES, pH 6.7, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmMgCl2) in a final volume of 60 μl. Tau was added last to initiate the reaction. After rapid mixing, the samples were pipetted into quartz microcuvettes and equilibrated at 37 °C in a thermostatically controlled Cary 1 recording spectrophotometer. The turbidity of the reaction mixture was continuously monitored at 350 nm. For the disruption assay, after the steady state was reached, 10 μg/5 μl of AD P-tau was added, and the turbidity was monitored. For the inhibition experiments, an 83 μg/ml concentration of a tau isoform was mixed with 67 or 133 μg/ml AD P-tau before incubating with tubulin. The state of assembly of microtubules was confirmed by negative stain electron microscopy as described previously (40Wisniewski H.M. Merz P.A. Iqbal K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1984; 43: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the amino-terminal inserts and the extra repeat in the interaction of normal tau with AD P-tau, the binding of recombinant human isoforms and tau deletion constructs (Fig.1) to AD P-tau was studied by a dot-blot overlay assay. The AD P-tau had a tendency to bind to 4Rτ more than to 3Rτ (Fig. 2). In the case of the 4R isoforms, the binding to AD P-tau was τ4L > τ4S > τ4. The isoforms with 3R showed a similar tendency, i.e.τ3L > τ3S > τ3. No binding was detected to any of the tau deletion constructs that lacked the amino-terminal half of the molecule (i.e. τ4L244–441 and τ4L267–441). All of these findings taken together suggest that the N-terminal inserts promote the interaction of tau with AD P-tau. The tau construct, τ4L1–392, lacking the C-terminal 49 residues, showed a binding similar to that of the full-length tau, suggesting that this C-terminal region does not promote or inhibit the tau-AD P-tau interaction. The association of AD P-tau to different tau isoforms and deletion constructs was also studied by a sedimentation assay. The interaction of each recombinant tau isoform and the tau construct with AD P-tau was studied by mixing 100 μg of the recombinant protein with 8 μg of the AD P-tau in a final volume of 100 μl, and the aggregates formed were separated by centrifugation and assayed by a radioimmuno-dot-blot assays. The percentage of the recombinant tau in the aggregates is shown in Table I. The interaction with AD P-tau found was τ4L > τ4S > τ4; τ3L > τ3S > τ3; 4Rτ > 3Rτ. These results are consistent with those found by the dot-blot overlay assay, confirming that the tau-AD P-tau interaction is more favorable when the two N-terminal inserts are present in normal tau. The tau constructs that lacked the N-terminal half, τ4L244–441 and τ4267–441, did not bind to AD P-tau (Table I), suggesting that this region is required for the binding, and the C-terminal half of tau is not sufficient for this interaction.Table IBinding of τ4L, τ4S, τ4, τ3L, τ3S, τ3, τ4L1–392, τ4L244–441, and τ4L267–441 to AD P-tauPercentage of bound proteinBackground (no addition) (A)Total (addition of AD P-tau) (B)Difference (B − A)%%%τ4L8 ± 659 ± 1051 ± 4τ4S10 ± 550 ± 940 ± 7τ417 ± 723 ± 86 ± 1τ3L7 ± 549 ± 942 ± 6τ3S10 ± 528 ± 718 ± 2τ318 ± 920 ± 102 ± 1τ4L1–39210 ± 54 ± 930 ± 4τ4L244–44122 ± 623 ± 81 ± 2τ4L267–44121 ± 720 ± 8−1 ± 1The binding of recombinant taus to AD P-tau was studied by the sedimentation assay, and the quantitation of the bound recombinant proteins was determined by 125I-radioimmunodot-blot assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.

Since AD P-tau differentially interacted with different tau isoforms, we investigated the disruption by AD P-tau of microtubules assembled with the various tau isoforms. Recombinant tau isoforms (83 and 333 μg/ml) were mixed with isolated bovine tubulin (2 mg/ml), and the microtubule assembly was monitored at 350 nm. At steady state, 5 μl containing 10 μg of AD P-tau was added to 60 μl of the assembly reaction mixture. In the case of τ4L, τ4S, τ3L, and τ3S, the microtubules were disrupted by the addition of AD P-tau when the assembly was carried out either with 83 or 333 μg/ml of the recombinant tau (Fig. 3). In contrast, the microtubules formed with 333 μg/ml τ3 and τ4 (Fig.3, curve 1) were quite resistant to the disruption by AD P-tau, although disruption could be observed both by turbidimetry (Fig. 3A, curve 2) and by electron microscopy (Fig. 3B) when the assembly was performed with an 83 μg/ml concentration of these recombinant proteins. To examine the ability of AD P-tau to inhibit thein vitro assembly of microtubules induced by each tau isoform, τ4L, τ3L, τ3, and τ4 were mixed individually with AD P-tau before adding to tubulin and the assembly reaction was followed by turbidimetry. AD P-tau inhibited the assembly promoted by all of the isoforms (Fig. 4). However, the inhibition achieved was greater with τ4L than with τ3L, τ4, or τ3 at an AD P-tau concentration of 67 μg/ml (comparecurves 2 of τ4L with τ4, τ3L, and τ3). Almost complete inhibition was achieved in all cases with 133 μg/ml of AD P-tau (Fig. 4A, curves 3). These findings suggest that the tau isoforms that have the N-terminal inserts and the fourth repeat are more readily sequestered by AD P-tau than those that lack these inserts. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of microtubules at the lower concentration (67 μg/ml) of AD P-tau in the case of τ4, τ3L, and τ3, whereas only occasional microtubules were seen under this condition in the case of τ4L (data not shown). No microtubules could be seen at the higher concentration (133 μg/ml) of AD P-tau with any of the tau isoforms examined (Fig.4B, b, d, f, andh). In order to confirm the role of the abnormal hyperphosphorylation in converting tau into “AD P-tau-like” molecule, we in vitro hyperphosphorylated recombinant τ4L with the protein kinases present in the normal brain extract and studied the ability of this phosphorylated tau to bind normal tau and to inhibit microtubule assembly. Phosphorylation of τ4L with rat brain extract resulted in incorporation of ∼12–15 mol of phosphates/mol of the protein (phosphorylated tau, P-tau) during ∼24 h. Immunolabeling with phosphodependent antibodies to specific sites revealed that τ4L was phosphorylated at similar sites and to a similar extent as the AD P-tau, (Fig.5A). The sites found to bein vitro phosphorylated were: Ser262/356 (12E8); Ser195/198/199/202 (Tau-1); Ser396/404 (PHF-1); Thr231/Ser235 (M4); Ser422 (R145); Thr181 (AT270, Thr(P)181); Thr212/Ser214 (AT100); Thr205(Thr(P)205); Thr212 (Thr(P)212); Ser214 (Ser(P)214); Thr217(Thr(P)217); Ser396 (Ser(P)396). However, because of the lack of standards in which the protein was 100% phosphorylated at the sites examined, it was not possible to determine the percentage phosphorylation of these sites by Western blot analysis. Next we examined whether like AD P-tau, the in vitrohyperphosphorylated recombinant tau (P-tau) also bound to normal recombinant tau. For these studies, P-tau was dotted in different concentrations on a nitrocellulose membrane and overlaid with 3 and 6 μg/ml normal tau. P-tau was able to bind normal tau in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The association of P-tau to normal tau was also studied by sedimentation assay. The interaction of normal tau with P-tau was studied by mixing 100 μg of the normal protein with 4 μg of P-tau in a final volume of 100 μl, and the aggregates formed were separated by centrifugation and quantified by radioimmuno-dot-blot assay as above. The percentage of the normal tau in the aggregates is shown in Fig. 5C. Thus, like AD P-tau, P-tau could also sequester normal tau, both in a dot-blot overlay assay and in a sedimentation assay. To examine the ability of P-tau to inhibit the in vitro assembly of microtubules, normal τ4L at two different concentrations, 0.1 and 0.03 mg/ml, was mixed with increasing concentrations of P-tau before adding to tubulin, and the assembly reaction was followed by turbidimetry. P-tau inhibited the assembly promoted by normal τ4L (Fig. 5D). The sequestration and the inhibition of normal τ4L-induced microtubule assembly by P-tau suggest that hyperphosphorylation converts tau into an AD P-tau-like state. Independent of the etiology (i.e. genetic or nongenetic), the clinical expression (i.e. dementia in AD and most likely in other tauopathies such as FTDP-17) appears to require neurofibrillary degeneration. The cytoskeleton of the neurons affected in AD is disrupted and microtubules are rarely seen in neurons with neurofibrillary tangles (41Terry R.D. Wisniewski H.M. Gaitz C.M. Aging and the Brain. Plenum, New York1972: 89-116Google Scholar). The abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau seems to precede the presence of PHF (11Köpke E. Tung Y.-C. Shaikh S. Alonso A.del C. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24374-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bancher C. Brunner C. Lassmann H. Budka H. Jellinger K. Wiche G. Seitelberger F. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Wisniewski H.M. Brain Res. 1989; 477: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of the molecular mechanism by which the abnormal hyperphosphorylation might lead to neurofibrillary degeneration is critical to understanding the pathogenesis of AD and related tauopathies. Previously, we have shown that unlike normal tau, the AD P-tau does not promote but instead inhibits in vitromicrotubule assembly by sequestering normal MAPs and that this toxic behavior is solely due to the abnormal hyperphosphorylation, becausein vitro dephosphorylation converts AD P-tau into a normal-like protein (20Alonso A.del C.

Most recently we have found that hyperphosphorylation promotes the self-assembly of tau into tangles of PHF/straight filaments (38Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The present study shows that (i) the N-terminal half is required for the association of normal tau to AD P-tau; (ii) the binding of AD P-tau to normal tau is τ4L > τ4S > τ4 and τ3L > τ3S > τ3, and that to 4Rτ is >3Rτ; (iii) AD P-tau inhibits the assembly of microtubules promoted by each tau isoform and causes disassembly when added to preassembled microtubules and that these inhibitory activities of AD P-tau directly correlate to the degree of its association to the normal tau isoforms; and (iv) in vitro hyperphosphorylation converts normal tau into an AD P-tau-like toxic state. The lack of the N-terminal half, as in τ4L244–441or in τ4L267–441, completely abolished the sequestration by AD P-tau (Table I, Fig. 2), suggesting that the major site involved in the interaction is in the N-terminal half of the molecule or that the conformation acquired without the N-terminal half is such that tau cannot be sequestered by AD P-tau. Previous studies have shown that the minimal site for the tau-tau interaction of the normal protein comprises the microtubule binding repeats region (38Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Novak M.

A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), and we have postulated that the regions flanking these repeats, probably because of their positive charges, have an inhibitory effect on the interaction (38Alonso A.del C. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In AD P-tau, these flanking regions, especially the amino-terminal half, are highly phosphorylated (46Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 375-379Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 47Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), which probably results in neutralization of the inhibitory basic charges. The carboxyl-terminal half of tau, which has been shown to bind to microtubules (11Köpke E. Tung Y.-C. Shaikh S. Alonso A.del C. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24374-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Goode B.L. Denis P.E. Panda D. Radeke M.J. Miller H.P. Wilson L. Feinstein S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), contains the microtubule binding domains. Thus, taus lacking the N-terminal half would be able to induce microtubule assembly as well as being immune to sequestration by AD P-tau. Whether neurons vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration employ such a strategy for their survival in tauopathies is currently not known. Previously, we have shown that the association of tau with AD P-tau is probably of hydrophobic nature because it is inhibited both by 0.5% Triton X-100 and by 2 m NaCl, and the interaction increases with the increase in temperature from 4 to 37 °C (21Alonso A.del C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). In the present study, τ4L was found to be sequestered the best by AD P-tau. The presence of the acidic N-terminal inserts partially neutralizes the positive charge of the rest of the tau molecule and, along with the extra repeat, probably facilitates a hydrophobic interaction of τ4L with AD P-tau. Such a scenario might account for the increased vulnerability of the taus with N-terminal inserts to sequestration by AD P-tau. Like the two N-terminal inserts, the abnormal hyperphosphorylation that occurs in AD and other tauopathies also neutralizes the basic charge of tau and makes it more hydrophobic. Ruben et al. (49Ruben G.C. Ciardelli T.L. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Synapse. 1997; 27: 208-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have postulated, based on inverse temperature transition, that 5–9 phosphate groups are enough to neutralize tau's basic nature and that AD P-tau is more hydrophobic than normal brain tau because of its lower inverse temperature transition. We have found that 4Rτs have the tendency to be more sensitive to the interaction with AD P-tau than 3Rτs (Fig. 2, Table I). This observation might explain why, despite the higher levels of phosphorylation in fetal tau, τ3, which lacks both the extra repeat and the two N-terminal inserts, no neurodegeneration is observed. On the other hand, a neuron enriched in 4Rτs, as in the case of the intronic and the silent mutations of the tau gene in FTDP-17 (18Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 19Spillantini M.G. Yoshida H. Rizzini C. Lantos P.L. Khan N. Rossor N.N. Goedert M. Brown J. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 49: 939-943Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), will be more vulnerable than a normal neuron to the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau. With respect to the levels of 4Rτs in AD, the reports have been contradictory (50Liu W.-K Dickson D.W. Yen S.-H. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 387-394PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ksiezak-Reding H. Shafit-Zagardo B. Yen S.-H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In AD, an imbalance of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system has been proposed through a decrease in the phosphatase activity (52Gong C.-X. Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of tau and higher levels of 4Rτs provide optimal conditions for the disruption of the microtubule network, because the AD P-tau sequesters most the 4Rτs. In addition to abnormal hyperphosphorylation, glycosylation (43Wang J.-Z. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), ubiquitination (31Grundke-Iqbal I. Vorbrodt A.W. Iqbal K. Tung Y.C. Wang G.P. Wisniewski H.M.

However, as shown in the present study, only hyperphosphorylation of tau appears to be enough to convert normal tau into a toxic AD P-tau-like molecule. The tau in vitro hyperphosphorylated to a similar extent and in several of the same sites as the AD P-tau was found to bind normal tau in a similar proportion as the AD P-tau, both in the sedimentation and the overlay assays (Fig. 5). P-tau also mimicked AD P-tau in the ability to inhibit microtubule assembly. In conclusion, our findings suggest a scenario that is compatible both with the imbalance in the expression of tau isoforms and an imbalance in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system. The association between the AD P-tau and normal tau appears to be quite specific. In AD, FTDP-17, and other tauopathies, most likely upon hyperphosphorylation tau is released from microtubules. The released hyperphosphorylated tau sequesters normal tau and other MAPs, causing on one hand the disassembly of microtubules and on the other hand the self-assembly of the hyperphosphorylated protein into PHF and straight filaments. The disruption of the microtubules probably leads to neurodegeneration even in those neurons that do not contain PHF. Thus, inhibition of abnormal phosphorylation of tau might inhibit neurofibrillary degeneration in AD, FTDP-17, and other related tauopathies. Consistent with the present study, a paper by Wittmann et al. (57Wittmann C.W. Shulman J.M. Salvaterra P.M. Lewis J. Hutton M. Feany M.B. Science. 2001; 293: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) reported neuronal degeneration associated with hyperphosphorylation of tau in the absence of formation of filaments/tangles in transgenic Drosophila overexpressing wild type or V337M or R406W mutated forms of human tau.

https://openalex.org/W2314177115,"The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is required for growth, tumorigenicity and protection from apoptosis. IGF1R overexpression is associated with radioresistance in breast cancer. We used antisense (AS) RNA to downregulate IGF1R expression in mouse melanoma cells. Cells expressing AS-IGF1R transcripts were more radiosensitive in vitro and in vivo than controls. Also they showed reduced radiation-induced p53 accumulation and p53 serine 18 phosphorylation, and radioresistant DNA synthesis. These changes were reminiscent of the cellular phenotype of the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Cellular Atm protein levels were lower in AS-IGF1R-transfected cells than in control cells, although there was no difference in Atm expression at the transcriptional level. AS-IGF1R cells had detectable basal Atm kinase activity, but failed to induce kinase activity after irradiation. This suggests that IGF1R signalling can modulate the function of Atm, and supports the concept of targeted IGF1R downregulation as a potential treatment for malignant melanoma and other radioresistant tumours."

These data demonstrate that the molecular mechanisms underlying the survival factor function of NGF critically rely upon the continuous inactivation of p38 MAPK, a Bcl-2-modifying enzyme. nerve growth factor mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase antibody monoclonal antibody glutathioneS-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Madin-Darby canine kidney 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid resonance units mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP phycoerythrin poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase neurotrophin receptor Apoptosis is a highly structured and ordered process that in multicellular organisms eliminates superfluous, harmful, and metabolically perturbed cells (1Scaffidi C.

It can be triggered by specialized surface receptor molecules, such as CD95 or TNFR, or by stimuli as diverse as withdrawal of growth factors, exposure to cell “poisons” (such as staurosporine or taxol), corticosteroids, viral infections, or even hypoxia. All of these signals converge on the mitochondrial crossroads, whereby critical events, such as cytochromec efflux and formation of the apoptosome, take place under the control exerted by proteins of the Bcl-2 family (3Green D.R.

It is established that the proapoptotic members of the family, such as Bax, Bad, or Bag, form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane triggering cytochrome c release and that a subset of the family, the so-called “BH3-only” proteins (Bid, Bim, Noxa, Harakiri, etc.), enrolled in various cell types and metabolic conditions, facilitate their oligomerization and membrane insertion, initiating or augmenting their function (6Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the proposed mechanisms accounting for the function of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are diverse and somewhat less clear. In fact, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL can either directly combine with and inhibit the proapoptotic members or indirectly modulate their activity by interfering with the mitochondrial membrane events they cause (4Reed J.C.

In multicellular organisms, the fate of a given cell is under the social control exerted by the surrounding elements, which deliver life or death signals. A class of molecular inputs that keep alive the cell are the survival factors, whose surface receptors transmit signals that inhibit the pathways leading to cell death. Nerve growth factor (NGF)1 is the first and perhaps most representative protein of this class (23Levi-Montalcini R. Science. 1987; 237: 1154-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar).

In the present paper, we describe that, upon factor withdrawal, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in its active form rapidly translocates onto mitochondria, specifically interacts with Bcl-2, and phosphorylates it, an event that is followed by cytochrome c release from the organelle and by apoptotic cell death. Transfection experiments with Bcl-2 mutants bearing substitutions of Ser-87 or Thr-56 residues within the loop region showed increased resistance to apoptosis induced by NGF withdrawal. The observation that p38 MAPK is promptly dephosphorylated after NGF administration to factor-starved cells indicates that the cytokine modulates the enzyme activation to maintain survival of NGF-dependent cells. Neutralizing rat anti-human NGF mAbs (clone αD11) were kindly donated by Dr. A. Cattaneo (International School for Advanced Studies, Trieste, Italy), and always used at 10 µg/ml. Rabbit anti-human p38 MAPK, anti-human JNK, anti-human phosphorylated JNK, anti-human actin, anti-human PARP, and goat and mouse anti-human Bcl-2 Abs were purchased by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-human phosphorylated p38 MAPK was purchased by New England Biolabs. Anti-human hsp60 was purchased by Stressgen. Human recombinant active p38 MAPK-GST, JNK-GST, and Bcl-2-GST were purchased by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). HrATF2-GST was purchased by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human recombinant NGF was a generous gift of Dr. G. Ferrari (Fidia, Abano, Italy). The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, the inactive SB202474, the PD098059 MEK1/2 inhibitor, and the Trk-A inhibitor K252a were purchased by Calbiochem. Anisomycin was purchased by Sigma. Human recombinant Bcl-2-His6-(1–218) was expressed with a C-terminal His6 tag using pQE60 vector (Quiagen) in M15 cells (Escherichia coli). Recombinant protein was purified by resuspending 1-liter cell cultures in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8, with 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole. The cell suspension was incubated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 4 °C, sonicated to reduce viscosity, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-activated Hi-TrapTM chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified with an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia), using a wash step with 50 mm phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, until theA280 reached <0.01. Proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole, desalted against 10 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and stored at −20 °C. Resting B lymphocytes were obtained from human tonsils, and sIgD− subpopulation were purified by panning procedures using plastic Petri dishes coated with rabbit anti-human IgD antibodies, as described (24Torcia M. Bracci-Laudiero L. Lucibello M. Nencioni L. Labardi D. Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Aloe L. Garaci E. Cell. 1996; 85: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% Nutridoma for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. CESS and MDCK cell lines were purchased by ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. sIgD− B cells were cultured overnight at 2 × 105 cells/ml, washed, and incubated at 107cells/ml with human recombinant NGF (100 ng/ml) or with 10 µg/ml anti-NGF Abs or rat IgG. At different time intervals, cells were washed, lysed in sample buffer, run on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and stained with 0.1 µg/ml rabbit anti-human phosphorylated p38 MAPK or rabbit anti-human JNK. The reaction was visualized by ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were stripped at 56 °C and stained with 0.1 µg/ml rabbit anti-human p38 MAPK or anti-human JNK. For immunofluorescence analysis, sIgD− cells, treated with 10 µg/ml anti-NGF Abs or control Ig for 4 h, were incubated with 25 nmMitotracker (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C and then attached on poly-l-lysine-sensitized slides. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldheyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and, after saturation of slides with 5% low fat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in phosphate buffer, stained with 0.1 µg/ml rabbit anti-human p38 MAPK, anti-human phosphorylated p38 MAPK, or preimmune rabbit IgG, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The slides were analyzed by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. 108 cells were suspended in 5 mmTris, pH 7.4, with 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 µg/ml pepstatin for 30 min on ice, Dounce-homogenized, and centrifuged at 750 × g at 4 °C to obtain the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondrial fraction (pellett) and the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). For Western blot analysis, the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions were directly lysed in sample buffer, while the cytosolic fraction was vacuum-concentrated and subsequently suspended in sample buffer. The purity of each fraction was assessed by staining aliquots with Abs to hsp60 for mitochondria, to actin for cytosol, and to PARP for nuclei. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, mitochondrial fraction from 108 sIgD−cells, treated with 10 µg/ml anti-NGF antibodies or control IgG, were lysed in 10 mm Hepes, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, and immunoprecipitated with 1 µg/ml rabbit anti-p38 MAPK Abs, anti-Bcl-2 mAbs, or 1 µg/ml polyclonal rabbit IgG or mouse IgG, followed by protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose, respectively. The same approach was used with recombinant proteins; a mixture of 200 ng of rBcl-2-His6 and 200 ng of active rp38 MAPK-GST was immunoprecipitated with 1 µg/ml anti-Bcl-2, or with 1 µg/ml rabbit anti-p38 MAPK Abs or control Abs followed by protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed, run on 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose filter. 100 ng of human recombinant Bcl-2-His or hrp38 MAPK-GST were used as internal standard. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed using a BIACORE instrument with CM5 sensor chips and an amine coupling kit (BIACORE AB). For immobilization of proteins, the sensor chip was equilibrated with HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, plus 0.005% p20 surfactant) at 5 µl/min and then activated by injecting 35 µl of 0.2 mN-ethyl-N′-3-diethylaminopropylcarbodiimide, 0.05mN-hydroxysuccinimide. 35 µl of kinases or control protein at ∼20 µg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, were then injected. ExcessN-hydroxysuccinimide-esters on the surface were deactivated with 35 µl of 1 methanoldiamine-hydrochloride (pH 8.5), and noncovalently bound dimers were washed out with 10 µl of regeneration buffer (4 mGu-HCl buffered with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). Binding experiments were performed with 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2 as running buffer. For in vivo metabolic labeling, 107 sIgD− cells were incubated with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h in the presence of 1 µm okadaic acid or 10 µl of ethanol vehicle control, in phosphate-free medium, in the presence or absence of anti-NGF Abs, 25 µm SB203580, SB202474, PD098059, or 100 ng/ml NGF. Cells were then lysed as described, immunoprecipitated with anti-Bcl-2 Abs as reported above, and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and autoradiographed on Eastman Kodak Co. XAR films for 72 h at −20 °C. 108 sIgD− cells, treated with rat anti-NGF mAb for 12 h, were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm NaPP, 1 mm NaVO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin. 400 µg of proteins were immunoprecipitated in duplicate with 2 µg/ml rabbit anti-p38 MAPK Abs coupled to Sepharose beads or 2 µg/ml rabbit anti-JNK or with 2 µg/ml control rabbit IgG. The efficacy of immunoprecipitation was checked by Western blot analysis with anti-P38 MAPK Ab or anti-JNK Ab. Immune complexes were incubated with 0.25 µg of human recombinant Bcl-2-GST protein or Bcl-2-His6 or 0.25 µg of rATF-2-GST and 3 µCi of [32P]ATP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in the presence of 25 µm SB203580, or Me2SO as control, in 30 µl of kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO3). After 30 min at room temperature, samples were suspended in 2-ME sample buffer, run in SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak XAR films for 12 h at −20 °C. A kinase assay was performed in the same experimental conditions by using 0.25 µg of recombinant active or inactive p38 MAPK-GST or JNK-GST and 0.25 µg of rBcl-2-His. To assess the activity of recombinant proteins, 0.25 µg of active rp38 MAPK or rJNK-GST were incubated, with or without 25 µm SB203580, with 0.25 µg of rATF-2-GST in kinase buffer for 30 min in the presence of 3 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Mitochondrial and cytosolic (S100) fractions were prepared by resuspending cells (3 × 107) in 0.8 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4). Cells were passed through an ice-cold cylinder cell homogenizer. Unlysed cells and nuclei were pelleted via a 10-min, 750 × g spin. The supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet containing the mitochondrial fraction was suspended in modified mitochondrial isolation buffer with 75 mmMgCl2, containing active p38 MAPK or active JNK (0.25 µg), 200 µm ATP, and 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the mitochondrial mixture reactions were then centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, and supernatant and pellet proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was probed with anti-human cytochrome c peptide mAb (7H8.2C12, Pharmigen), diluted at 1:500. A secondary probe (1:5,000 dilution) with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MDCK cells, detached by trypsin-EDTA, were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 8 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer. Mitochondrial fractions were obtained as above and incubated for 30 min on ice and 15 min at 22 °C, with or without extracts of E. coli cells (8.5%, v/v), expressing Bcl-2-His6 or transformed with empty plasmid, obtained by lysing the cells with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1% CHAPS. 0.25 µg of active p38 MAPK or JNK, with or without 25 µm SB203580, was then added, and the phosphorylation reaction was performed in the presence of 200 µm ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 30 °C. Mitochondrial mixture reactions were then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and then supernatant and pellet proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with anti-human cytochromec mAbs. sIgD− B cell subpopulations were cultured at 5 × 106/ml, with 10 µg/ml anti-NGF mAb or control rat IgG, in the presence or absence of 25 µm SB203580 for 12 h, lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, run on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and stained with 1:1,000 anti-PARP mAbs, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Abs. Reaction was visualized by ECL. For annexin-V staining, the cells, cultured as above with anti-NGF antibodies in the presence or absence of SB203580, were washed once in PBS, incubated with 5 µg/ml PE-annexin-V (Alexis) in binding buffer (0.01 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells were analyzed by cytofluorimetry. For DNA fragmentation analysis, sIgD−, cultured at 5 × 106/ml, with 10 µg/ml anti-NGF mAb or control rat IgG, in the presence or absence of 25 µm SB203580 for 12 h, were diluted 1:1.5 with 5 mm Tris, 20 mmEDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.0, and allowed to lyse for 15 min on ice before centrifugation for 20 min at 27,000 ×g to separate intact chromatin (pellet) from DNA fragments (supernatant). Pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and pellet and supernatant samples were assayed for DNA content, using the diphenylamine reagent (1.5% diphenylamine in acetic acid plus 10% acetaldehyde) for 16 h at 30 °C. The optical density at 600 nm was measured for each sample. Percentage of DNA fragmentation was calculated as reported (24Torcia M. Bracci-Laudiero L. Lucibello M. Nencioni L. Labardi D. Rubartelli A. Cozzolino F. Aloe L. Garaci E. Cell. 1996; 85: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion. The full-length human-bcl-2 sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from lysates of freshly isolated human lymphocytes and cloned as a BglII/EcoRI fragment in pIRES2-EGFP vector (CLONTECH), using the following primers 5′-TTAGATCTATGGCGCACGCTGGGAGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGAATTCTCACTTGTGGCTCAGATAGG-3′ (reverse), yielding the wild type (WT) construct. To replace Thr-56, Ser-70, Thr-74, and Ser-87 with Ala, mutagenesis reactions using a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) were performed. The Δ-loop plasmid, containing the bcl-2 deletion mutant (Δ40–91 amino acids), was generated by two-step recombinant polymerase chain reaction using WT as template and two oligonucleotide pairs: 5′ - CCACGGGCCCGGCGCCCACATCTCCCGC-3′ with 5′-GCAGAGCTGGTTTAGTGAACCGTCA-3′ and 5′-GGGCCCGTGGTCCACCTGGCCCTCCGCCAA-′ with 5′- TATTCCAAGCGGCTTCGGCCAGTAA-3′. The two polymerase chain reaction products were mixed in the same polymerase chain reaction tube and reamplified with terminal primers. The resulting deleted cDNA was purified, digested withBglII and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, and ligated in the MCS of pIRES2-EGFP. All constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. Transient transfections of CESS cells were obtained by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2 × 106cells were seeded into six-well plates and incubated for 5 h in serum-free medium with 5 µg of test plasmid and lipids, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 72 h, cells were washed and analyzed by using the FL-1 detector of a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). For each sample, 104 cells were analyzed at a rate of 300 cells/s. The percentage of transfected cells was calculated after subtracting the nonspecific fluorescence of nontransfected cells and resulted in ≥30%. Apoptotic stimuli (10 µg/ml of anti-NGF Abs for 12 h or 200 nm K252a for 6 h) were added 72 h after transfection, and GFP+transfected cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by PE-annexin-V staining and cytofluorimetric analysis with both FL-1 and FL-2 detectors. In the NGF-responsive cell line PC12, deprivation of NGF is followed by rapid phosphorylation of two members of the MAPK family, p38 and JNK (28Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol.

In order to assess these events also in memory B lymphocytes, lysates from cells, initially starved (i.e. cultured at low cellular density (12 h at 2 × 105/ml) to dilute the autocrine factor) and then treated or not with exogenous NGF, were analyzed in Western blots with anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK or with anti-phosphorylated JNK Abs, which revealed p38 MAPK activation in NGF-starved cells, rapidly declining after NGF addition (Fig.1A); in contrast, equal amounts of phosphorylated JNK were observed under the same conditions (Fig. 1A). These results suggested that in memory B cells p38 MAPK was specifically involved in the NGF signaling, the difference between neural cells and memory B cells probably residing in the expression of p38 MAPK-specific, but not JNK-specific, phosphatase(s) in the latter cells, as described in other systems (32Chu Y.

Next, to characterize the molecular pathway comprising activated p38 MAPK and antagonized by NGF, we checked whether neutralization of endogenous NGF signaling with specific Abs (or with Trk-A inhibitor K252a, not shown) caused enzyme hyperphosphorylation, which indeed occurred at early times, as expected on the basis of similar results by others (28Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), while the total amount of protein increased at later times (Fig. 1B). In contrast, JNK was not hyperphosphorylated in the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). p38 MAPK is a serine-threonine kinase, whose known molecular targets are nuclear, such as ATF-2 or GADD153, or cytosolic, such as hsp27, proteins (33Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, its subcellular location is the cytosol, from where it is translocated to the nucleus, following metabolic activation (34Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). We next determined by immunofluorescence, using Abs specific for the activated form of p38 MAPK, the amount of memory B cells that scored positive upon NGF neutralization, detecting 73 ± 5% of brightly staining cells, versus 7 ± 2% in control cells, in three independent experiments. During these studies we observed, besides the nuclear staining, a spotted pattern of cytoplasmic staining (within a diffuse cytosolic context), that suggested an additional localization of the activated enzyme. Thus, to assess in detail the physical translocation events of activated p38 MAPK, confocal laser-scanning microscopy experiments were performed on memory B cells treated with anti-NGF or control IgG and with Mitotracker (a rhodamine-like mitochondrial dye) and then fixed and stained with p38 MAPK-specific Abs. Fig.2A shows that, after neutralization of endogenous NGF in memory B cells, a definite mitochondrial focusing of p38 MAPK from its cytosolic, diffuse location was evident, a localization of the enzyme that was so far undetected. Staining with specific Abs revealed that essentially only the activated enzyme translocated to mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Next, to confirm the above results, a biochemical analysis was performed on mitochondrial, nuclear, and cytosolic fractions from cells treated or not with anti-NGF Abs. Fig. 2B shows that p38 MAPK was detected in cytosol and nuclei of cells exposed to control Abs and that the enzyme also accumulated in mitochondria of cells treated with anti-NGF Abs. Interestingly, when the same filters were stained with Abs against the active form of p38 MAPK, specific bands were evident in the mitochondrial and nuclear fractions and completely undetectable in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2C). Thus, neutralization of NGF interaction with surface receptors was reflected into activation of a serine/threonine-kinase, whose mitochondrial localization opened the question regarding the function exerted by the enzyme in"

For the SK4/IK1 K+ channel, CaM bound to the proximal C terminus (“Ct1 ” domain) acts as the Ca2+ sensor. We now show that CaM interacting with the C terminus of SK4 also controls channel assembly and surface expression. In transfected cells, removing free CaM by overexpressing the CaM-binding domain, Ct1, redistributed full-length SK4 protein from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and decreased whole-cell currents. Making more CaM protein available by overexpressing the CaM gene abrogated the dominant-negative effect ofCt1 and restored both surface expression of SK4 protein and whole-cell currents. The distal C-terminal domain (“Ct2”) also plays a role in assembly, but is not CaM-dependent. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that multimerization of SK4 subunits was enhanced by CaM and inhibited by removal of CaM, indicating that CaM regulates trafficking of SK4 by affecting the assembly of channels. Our results support a model in which CaM-dependent association of SK4 monomers at their Ct1 domains regulates channel assembly and surface expression.

This channel, like other members of the SK family, is tethered tightly at its proximal C terminus (Ct1domain) to calmodulin (CaM), which opens the channel in the presence of elevated intracellular Ca2+ (7Khanna R.

The demonstration that SK channels and CaM can be activated by divalent metal ions in the same order of preference (21Cao Y.J. Houamed K.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has been interpreted to mean that CaM is both necessary and sufficient to account for Ca2+-dependent gating of SK channels. Recently, an x-ray crystallographic study suggested a structural model for gating of SK channels that involved coordinated, Ca2+-dependent interactions between CaM andCt1 domains (22Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Beyond the role of Ct1 in CaM binding and channel gating, very little is known about domains involved in SK function, such as channel assembly. SK channels lack the conserved N-terminal tetramerization domains of voltage-gated K+ channels (23Shen N.V. Pfaffinger P.J.

Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence that multimerization of SK channel subunits is regulated by the same molecule responsible for channel gating: CaM. We find that CaM regulates the surface expression of SK4/IK1 protein by regulating the multimerization of channels through intersubunit interactions between apposed Ct1 domains. For simplicity, we will call the channel SK4 in the remainder of this paper. Cloning and stable expression of human SK4 in CHO cells have been previously described (16Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In the present paper, the full-length human channel was tagged at its C terminus with either a hemagglutinin (HA) or FLAG epitope and subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Construction of SK4.Flag and some epitope-tagged deletion constructs has been previously described (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, the deletion mutants were called NM (encoding N terminus + six transmembrane domains), Ct1, Ct2 (distal C terminus), Ct1Ct2 (entire C terminus), NMCt1 (N terminus + transmembrane domains + proximal C terminus) andNMCt2 (N terminus + transmembrane domains + distal C terminus). They were constructed in the following manner: silentEcoRV and XhoI restriction sites were sequentially added just upstream of the leucine zipper domain of Ct2 in the SK4 cDNA using the Morph Mutagenesis kit (5′-3′, Arapaho, CO). Then, after replacing the stop codon with an XhoI site by PCR, the resulting amplification product was ligated to a pair of complementary oligonucleotides encoding either the FLAG or HA epitope and flanked by XhoI and NotI sites. The region of these cDNAs encoding Ct1Ct2 was then amplified by PCR using primers containing a consensus translation initiation sequence. The full-length SK4 (NMCt1Ct2) and the translatable Ct1Ct2 protoconstructs were then cut internally with either EcoRV or XhoI and re-ligated to excise specific SK4 regions; i.e. cutting withEcoRV generated NMCt2.Flag andCt2.Flag, whereas cutting with XhoI generatedNMCt1.Flag and Ct1.Flag. For electrophysiology experiments involving the co-expression of the wild-type channel construct with deletion mutants, the FLAG epitope was removed from the deletion mutants by PCR, and the products were subcloned into pTRACER (Invitrogen). CHO cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). For some experiments, they were stably transfected with pCDNA3 into which wild-type or HA-tagged SK4 cDNA had been subcloned. CHO cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, hypoxanthine + thymidine, and antibiotic/antimycotic. Stable cell lines were isolated and characterized (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 16Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and one clonal population expressing SK4 was chosen based on high channel expression (large whole-cell currents). Control cell lines expressing Kv3.1 (28Wang L.-Y. Gan L. Perney T.M. Schwartz I. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1882-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or a Kv1.3-GFP fusion protein 2R. Khanna, unpublished data. were generated by similar means. All tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Recordings were made at room temperature (22–25 °C) with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and electrodes (3–5 megaohms) were fabricated from World Precision Instruments glass (Sarasota, FL). The bath solution consisted of (in mm): 140 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 29 glucose, and 25 HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 30 KCl, 100 K-gluconate, 5 EGTA, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2), supplemented with 4.27 mm CaCl2 to obtain a free Ca2+concentration of 1.0 μm (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) based on a stability constant of 16.2 for gluconate. All chemicals were the highest purity available from Sigma. Data were acquired at a sampling rate of 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz prior to analysis with pCLAMP6.0 software. On-line series-resistance compensation (80–90%) was used to reduce voltage errors produced by large currents. Prior to recording from cells in the whole-cell configuration, CHO cells stably expressing human SK4 were transiently transfected with the pTRACER vector or with pTRACER harboring one of the deletion mutants:NM, Ct1, or Ct1Ct2. For transient transfection, 1 μg of cDNA in 100 μl of Optimem was mixed with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE in 100 μl of Optimem and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Each transfection mixture was supplemented with 800 μl of Optimem and transferred to a 35-mm Petri dish containing CHO cells (∼10% confluent) stably expressing SK4. After a 5-h incubation, the transfection medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated for another 12 h. Then, the medium was replaced with complete normal culture medium (as above). Cells were assayed for SK4 channel expression 3–15 h later (20–32 h after transfection) by measuring the current density (current/capacitance) of green fluorescent cells. For CaM overexpression, cDNAs used for transfection were supplemented with 0.5 μg of either pCDNA3 alone or pCDNA3 containing the mouse CaM cDNA. The CaM cDNA was obtained by searching GenBankTM for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing full-length CaM open-reading frames and then purchasing EST 481929 from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). After sequencing to confirm its identity, it was subcloned between the EcoRI (5′) and NotI (3′) sites of pCDNA3. For some recordings 10 μm recombinant chicken CaM protein (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to the pipette solution. Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described (12Khanna R. Roy L. Zhu X. Schlichter L.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C796-C806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells transiently transfected with various SK4 constructs and grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed for 5 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose. The fixative was removed by washing (3×, 10 min each) in PBS. Then the cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by washing in PBS (2×, 5 min each). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubating the cells overnight in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin. After washing in PBS (3×, 10 min each) the cells were incubated (2 h, room temperature) with either mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Sigma) in 3% bovine serum albumin. After washing antibody-labeled cells in PBS (3×, 10 min each), they were incubated in secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat or anti-mouse, Vector Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS (3×, 10 min each), then rinsed briefly in distilled water, and mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were obtained with a 40× quartz objective on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC1000). All transfections and imaging were done in a “blind” fashion. Stably expressed HA-tagged SK4 was assayed for interaction with the FLAG-tagged wild-type or deletion mutants described earlier (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using standard protocols (above), HA-tagged SK4-expressing cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of FLAG-tagged construct, plus either 1 μg of CaM/pCDNA3 or 1 μg of pCDNA3 vector alone. After 1–2 days, cells were lysed in cold ionic-detergent buffer (1% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS), and FLAG-tagged protein complexes were precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Precipitates were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions, transferred to nylon, and Western blotted with an anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cedarlane, Hornby, ON) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After some of the transient transfections described above, CHO cells were assayed for surface expression of full-length or deletion mutants of SK4 using a biotinylation assay (29Roquemore E.P. Banting G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2125-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All procedures were conducted at 4 °C, except as indicated. At 24–36 h posttransfection, CHO cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2(PBS-CM) and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 500 μl of 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate (EZ-link-Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin; Pierce Chemical Co.) Since the de-protonated form of the primary amine of lysine acts as a target for the sulfate group on biotin, this reagent selectively biotinylates lysine residues in proteins. It is cell-impermeant because of the negative charge on the sulfate group. The reaction was stopped by washing twice in PBS, then in 50 mm glycine to quench unbound biotin. The cells were then washed with PBS-CM and lysed in 1% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C. The lysate was diluted with four volumes of Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated for a further 60 min on ice. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubating solubilized CHO membranes (100 μg of protein) with Neutravidin-agarose (400 μl of a 50% slurry) (Pierce) pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. After rocking the reaction mixtures gently for 12–16 h at 4 °C, biotin-neutravidin-agarose complexes were harvested by centrifugation and washed three times with a 20-fold excess of lysis buffer and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mm NaCl. The beads were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This was followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody to detect total HA-tagged proteins at the cell surface or an anti-β-tubulin antibody (Oncogene Research) to confirm that intracellular proteins were not biotinylated. Where appropriate, data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the number of cells or experiments indicated. To test for significant differences (p < 0.05) between two conditions, a Student's t test was used. For current amplitudes, statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance, and differences were considered significant forp < 0.05 in a Student-Newman Keul posttest. We first tested whether overexpressing each of the domains, NM, Ct1Ct2, or Ct1, affects the formation of functional full-length channels. Each of these constructs or the control GFP-expressing vector (pTRACER) was transfected into CHO cells that stably expressed SK4, and whole-cell currents were recorded (Fig.1A). The current at +60 mV was divided by cell capacitance to normalize for cell size and expressed as average current density (Fig. 1B). Either Ct1Ct2or Ct1 greatly reduced the SK4 current density compared with vector-transfected cells; whereas, the NM region had no effect. This dominant-negative effect appeared to be specific to SK4, since Ct1 co-transfection did not reduce the voltage-activated Kv3.1 current in stably transfected CHO cells (Fig.1B). Because the Ct1 domain binds CaM (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), this raised the possibility that Ct1 overexpression reduced the current by acting as a CaM “buffer”, thereby reducing the amount of CaM available for channel gating. If so, gating should be restored by including excess CaM protein in the patch pipette during whole-cell recording. This strategy was ineffective (Fig.2); the ∼56% reduction in current caused by Ct1 overexpression was not relieved by infusing CaM protein into transfected cells (p < 0.01). In contrast, transfecting cells with CaM cDNA prevented the inhibition by co-transfected Ct1; the current was not significantly different from controls (p > 0.05). These data suggest that Ct1 over expression inhibits SK4 channels by limiting the amount of cellular CaM available at an early stage of channel assembly and/or trafficking, rather than by stripping channels at the plasma membrane of their Ca2+-binding gating subunits. To address the role of Ct1 in trafficking, CHO cells were co-transfected with SK4.HA, with or without Ct1 and CaM (as above) and assayed for localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. Expression of full-length SK4 was mainly at the cell surface, appearing as a ring around the cell periphery (Fig.3A), which in z-plane scans (not shown) appeared as a halo around the cell. The SK4 channel protein was localized to the cell surface whether overall channel protein expression was moderate (Fig. 3A, left) or high (right). Simultaneous overexpression of eitherCt1 (Fig. 3B) or Ct2 (Fig.3D) resulted in cytoplasmic retention of full-length SK4 subunits; z-plane scans (not shown) confirmed staining throughout the cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions. Consistent with the ability ofCt1 to titrate CaM availability, co-expression of CaM withCt1 restored the surface expression of full-length SK4 subunits and prevented their cytoplasmic retention (Fig.3C). As expected from the lack of CaM binding to theCt2 domain (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), overexpression of CaM did not reverse the effect of overexpression of Ct2; the SK4 protein staining remained diffuse and intracellular (Fig. 3E). Because confocal microscopy cannot prove that channels are inserted into the cell membrane, a cell-surface biotinylation assay was performed. CHO cells were first transfected with full-length SK4. After 24–36 h, non-permeabilized cells were treated with cell-impermeant sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. Labeled proteins were harvested by overnight incubation with Neutravidin beads, and the precipitates were analyzed by Western analysis with an anti-HA antibody. A specific SK4-sized band (∼48 kDa) was detected (Fig.4A, lane 3), indicating robust cell-surface expression. Bands were absent from control cells (vector-transfected, lane 1) or when cells were not exposed to biotin (lane 2). Biotinylation itself did not affect SK4 expression, as judged by Western analysis of whole-cell lysates (lower bands). As an internal control, blots were stripped and probed with a β-tubulin antibody to determine whether intracellular proteins were biotinylated: no β-tubulin bands were observed (not shown). Only Ct1 binds CaM, but since we previously observed that the Ct2 deletion mutant also failed to express current (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), we next asked whether both regions might be involved in SK4 trafficking. CHO cells were co-transfected with full-length SK4.HA and either Ct1 or Ct2. Co-expression ofCt1 decreased the amount of biotinylated SK4 (lanes 3 versus 5) at the cell surface by about 84% (Fig.4A, p < 0.01, Student's ttest). Ct2 co-expression (lane 7) decreased biotinylated SK4 at the cell surface by ∼97% (p < 0.01). These effects were specific for SK4 since surface biotinylation of another channel protein, Kv1.3, was unaffected by co-expression withCt1 or Ct2 (Fig. 4A, right panel, data summarized in Fig. 4B). The biotinylation results are in excellent agreement with the confocal microscopy images above, since Western analysis of CHO cell lysates (blot beneath Fig.4A, left) showed that none of the conditions significantly altered the overall expression of SK4 channel protein. Thus, Ct1 and Ct2 exert their dominant-negative effect by reducing cell-surface SK4 expression, not total channel protein. The dominant-negative effect of Ct1 on SK4 cell-surface expression was relieved by co-transfecting with CaM (Fig.4A, lanes 5 versus 6); the level of biotinylated SK4 at the cell surface was ∼2.3-fold higher than without CaM (Fig. 4B; p < 0.05). In contrast, SK4 surface expression was not restored by co-transfectingCt2 with CaM (lanes 7 versus 8): biotinylated SK4 protein remained at ∼4% of the control value. To assay more directly for interactions between channel subunits, CHO cells that stably expressed HA-tagged SK4 were first transiently transfected with a cDNA-encoding FLAG-tagged SK4. At 36–48 h posttransfection, cells were lysed and proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an anti-HA antibody was used for Western blotting. There was a clear band of the predicted size of an SK4 monomer with an HA epitope (∼48 kDa) (Fig.5A, lane 2), indicating a stable association between HA- and FLAG-tagged SK4 subunits. There was no band if the immunoprecipitating antibody was omitted (not shown) or if SK4.Flag was not included in the transfection mixture (lane 1). Notably, co-transfecting CaM cDNA significantly increased the amount of co-immunoprecipitated protein (lanes 3 versus 2), implying that CaM facilitates channel assembly. Because CaM binds to the Ct1 domain, assembly may involve linking of Ct1 domains in adjacent SK4 subunits (7Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 19Xia X.M. Fakler B. Rivard A. Wayman G. Johnson-Pais T. Keen J.E. Ishii T. Hirschberg B. Bond C.T.

If so, multimerization should be inhibited by overexpressingCt1 to titrate the available CaM. When untaggedCt1 was overexpressed, the anti-FLAG antibody no longer immunoprecipitated SK4.HA (lane 5). However, simultaneously overexpressing CaM restored interaction between HA-tagged and FLAG-tagged SK4 (lane 6). Again, none of the transfection combinations significantly changed the overall SK4 protein expression levels (lower panel). Fig. 5B shows a general model of monomer interactions based on these results. We envision that the endogenous CaM in CHO cells allows some channels to assemble, but that more assembly takes place when more CaM is available (lanes 2 versus 3). Ct1 overexpression appears to reduce channel assembly by buffering CaM (lane 5), a process that can be overcome by overexpressing CaM (lane 6). Our results support a model wherein CaM enhances SK4 self-association. To determine which channel domains interact, CHO cells that stably expressed full-length SK4.HA were transfected with vector,Ct1.Flag or NMCt2.Flag (Fig. 5C). Without CaM co-transfection, a small amount of SK4.HA co-immunoprecipitated with Ct1.Flag protein (lane 2). However, CaM co-expression dramatically increased the amount of co-immunoprecipitated product (lane 3). Interestingly,NMCt2.Flag, which lacks the Ct1 domain, also co-immunoprecipitated with full-length SK4 (lane 4), but this interaction was not increased by CaM (lane 5). Similar overall amounts of SK4 protein were expressed under all conditions (lower panel). As indicated in the model in Fig.5D, our results imply that more than one region is involved in channel assembly, but that Ct1 confers the CaM-dependence on channel assembly. We further examined interactions between Ct1 and channel protein domains by transiently transfecting Ct1. HA with either NMCt2.Flag or Ct1.Flag (Fig.6) and performing co-immunoprecipitations as before. In some batches, CaM was also co-transfected. Ct1did not co-precipitate with the Ct1-lacking polypeptide,NMCt2, whether or not CaM was over-expressed (lanes 1 and 2), implying weak or non-existent interactions between the CaM-binding domain (Ct1) and other domains. In contrast, Ct1.Flag co-precipitated with Ct1. HA(lane 6), an interaction that was greatly enhanced by CaM overexpression (lane 5). Western analysis of cell lysates showed no cha"

Stabilized p53 was activated by p38MAPK, resulting in G1arrest through induction of p21WAF1. Among the postulated phosphorylation sites involved in p53 stabilization or activation (Ser15, Ser20, Ser33, and Ser46), only Ser33 was phosphorylated. Furthermore, interaction of p53 with the transcriptional coactivator p300 was induced, and Lys382 of p53 was acetylated. Although inhibition of p38MAPK did not prevent nuclear accumulation of p53, phosphorylation of Ser33 was markedly suppressed by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38MAPK. Under these conditions, acetylation of Lys382 and induction of p21WAF1 were also inhibited, and cells with elevated levels of p53 showed normal cell cycle progression. Activated p38MAPK phosphorylated endogenous p53 at Ser33in living cells. In stable transformants expressing dominant negative MKK6, an upstream protein kinase of p38MAPK, p53 stabilization was induced normally following osmotic shock, but phosphorylation of Ser33, acetylation of Lys382, and induction of p21WAF1 were almost completely inhibited. These results suggest that phosphorylation at Ser33 by p38MAPK is critical for activation of p53 following osmotic shock. Phosphorylation of neither Ser15 nor Ser20 was needed in this activation.

Exposure of cells to hyperosmotic media initiates an immediate response that regulates cell volume. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, Hog1, has been implicated in this response. Activation of Hog1 up-regulates the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded by the gene for GPD1, which stimulates accumulation of glycerol, thus increasing intracellular osmolarity (1Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Mutants defective in Hog1 expression cannot grow in hyperosmotic media (2Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, exposure to hyperosmotic media causes activation of p38MAPK, a homologue of Hog1 (3Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). Although Hog1 is activated only by osmotic stress, p38MAPK is activated by a wide range of stress, such as osmotic shock, UV, heat shock, nutritional starvation, and cytokines. In vertebrates, some tissues such as small intestine (4Bohlen H.G. Unthank J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G438-G446PubMed Google Scholar) and colon (5Naftalin R.J. Pedley K.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) are routinely exposed to hyperosmotic tissue fluid, and in renal medulla, the osmolarity of the interstitial fluid of urinary tubules is often more than 5 times higher than normal (6Gottschalk C.W.

Mammalian cells accumulate and activate the tumor suppressor protein p53 after exposure to genotoxic or environmental stress like heat shock (7Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell.

Cell cycle arrest is mediated by enhancement of p53-dependent expression of p21WAF1, which is a general inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases. This checkpoint control enhances genetic fidelity by causing arrest at specific stages of the cell cycle when previous events have not been completed. p53 is a short-lived protein with a half-life of 20–40 min. This is due to its rapid ubiquitination by Mdm2 and subsequent degradation by 26 S proteasome (17Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 18Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). In this way, only a trace amount of p53 is detected in rapidly growing normal cells. Recent studies revealed that accumulation of p53 following genotoxic stress is mainly caused by suppression of degradation. Interaction of p53 and Mdm2 is mediated by an N-terminal region of p53 (Thr18–Lys24) (19Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar). X-ray and UV irradiation somehow activate ATM (12Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. El-Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V.

Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), respectively. These kinases then activate a downstream chk1 or chk2 checkpoint kinase, which phosphorylates Ser20 of p53 (21Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 phosphorylated at Ser20 escapes from degradation through diminished interaction with Mdm2 (23Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S.

Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In cells treated with hypoxia, the Mdm2 protein level is down-regulated, which is a likely mechanism for accumulation of p53 (25Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W. Murphy M. Derr J. Taya Y. Lowe S.W. Kastan M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 is also reported to be controlled by phosphorylation of p53 at critical serine residues in the N terminus. Activated ATM or ATR can phosphorylate Ser15in vivo and in vitro (27Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that UV and chemotherapeutic agents activate p38MAPK, and that activated p38MAPK phosphorylates Ser33 plus Ser46, and Ser33 alone, respectively (31Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 32Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojaz J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar). Another potential mechanism that may play a critical role in p53 activation is acetylation. In an in vitro experiment, Lys320 is acetylated by p300/CBP1-associated factor (33Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), while Lys373 and Lys382 are acetylated by p300/CBP (33Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 34Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser15 stimulates interaction between p53 and its transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP. Substitution of Ser15 causes a defect in p53-dependent transcriptional activation (35Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33048-33053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 36Dumaz N. Meek D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p300/CBP-mediated acetylation of p53 is commonly observedin vivo after treatment of cells with multiple p53-activating agents (37Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Until now, the molecular mechanisms of the stabilization and activation of p53 have been analyzed mainly with cells treated with DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, or UV. However, these agents produce different types of reactive radicals, which may damage cellular components along with the DNA. In such cases, multiple signaling pathways might be activated simultaneously, which complicates analysis of the overall response process. Compared with these treatments, osmotic shock and hypoxia seem simple, because they have little effect on DNA. Previously, we reported that nuclear accumulation of p53 is evoked in normal human fibroblasts cultured in hyperosmotic medium (38Sugano T. Nitta M. Ohmori H. Yamaizumi M. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1995; 86: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that p53 accumulated under hyperosmotic conditions was transcriptionally active in a murine renal inner medullary collecting duct cell line (mIMCD3) (39Dmitrieva N. Kultz D. Michea L. Ferraris J. Burg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18243-18247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of osmotic shock-induced p53 accumulation and its effect on the cell cycle checkpoint. In the present study, we found that p53 was transiently stabilized by hyperosmotic treatment, independently of phosphorylation of Ser15 and Ser20 in normal human fibroblasts. However, phosphorylation of Ser33 is critical for cell cycle arrest through induction of p21WAF1, and this phosphorylation is mediated by activated p38MAPK. Furthermore, osmotic shock enhances interaction of p53 with p300, resulting in acetylation of Lys382 of p53. These results clearly show that osmotic shock induces p53-dependent cell cycle arrest through activation of p38MAPK together with the immediate adaptation response. Mori (40Itoh T. Fujiwara Y. Ono T. Yamaizumi M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1267-1276PubMed Google Scholar) is a primary cell strain of normal human fibroblasts. H1299 and A549 are human lung carcinoma cell lines. MCF7 is a human mammary carcinoma cell line. Primary mouse fibroblasts were obtained from embryonic lungs of the C57BL-6J strain, and p53 gene knock-out mice (41Tsukada T. Tomooka Y. Takai S. Ueda Y. Nishikawa S. Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Takeda N. Suda Y. Abe S. Matsuo I. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3313-3322PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml) in a humidified 5% CO2incubator. For osmotic shock, Mori, H1299, A549, and primary mouse fibroblasts were treated in hyperosmotic medium containing 240 mm NaCl. This medium was prepared by adding 65 µl of 2m NaCl to 1.0 ml of culture medium containing 10% FCS. MCF7 cells were treated in hyperosmotic medium containing 260 mm NaCl. p38MAPK kinase inhibitors, SB203580 and SB202190, were purchased from Calbiochem. The concentration of solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, Me2SO) was kept constant at 0.1% in all cultures. To obtain stable transformants, A549 or MCF7 cells were transfected with 10 µg of pcDNA3-HA-MKK6AA or pcDNA3 by electroporation using an Electro Cell Manipulator (BTX, San Diego, CA), and stable transformants were selected with G418 at concentrations of 800 and 500 µg/ml, respectively. At least 10 independent clones were isolated. Expression of HA-MKK6AA was checked by indirect immunostaining using a monoclonal antibody against HA (HA.11, Babco). The clone expressing the highest level of HA was used. pCS3-Myc-p38MAPK, pME-HA-MKK6AA, and pcDNA3.1(+)-MKK6EE were kindly provided by Y. Gotoh (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). HA-MKK6AA was recloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). p53 cDNA was cloned into the pRc-CMV expression vector. To replace Ser15, Ser33, or both with alanine, the Quick Change™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Replacement at individual sites was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Mori and mouse primary fibroblasts were cultured on glass-coverslips. The cells were treated for various periods in hyperosmotic media containing 240∼260 mm NaCl. In control experiments, cells were irradiated with x-rays and incubated for various periods at 37 °C. These cells were prefixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 2 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then fixed with 80% methanol for 10 min at −10 °C. Cells were stained with antibodies against p53 (PAb1801, Calbiochem) for 30 min at room temperature. To detect phosphorylation of specific serine residues, anti-p53-Ser(P)15 (42Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M.

After a wash with PBS, the cells were stained with either FITC-conjugated anti-mouse or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or, in some cases, Rho-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. For staining of the phosphorylated Ser15, Ser33, or Ser46 of p53, cells were further stained with FITC-conjugated anti-goat IgG to enhance the intensity of fluorescence (Chemicon Internation Inc.). To detect the HA tag, monoclonal antibody against HA (HA.11, Babco) was used as the first antibody. After treatment in the hyperosmotic media, cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA and washed with PBS. Then, whole cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (1.7% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 17% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.083m Tris (pH 6.8)). p53 protein, p21WAF1 protein, Mdm2 protein, α-tubulin, and HA tag were detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies of PAb1801, OP64 (Oncogene Science), SMP14 (Neo Markers), OP06 (Calbiochem), and HA.11 (Babco), respectively. Phosphorylated Ser15, Ser20, Ser33, and Ser46 of p53 were detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-Ser15 (42Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C.

Immunoblots were developed with an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (107 to 108) were lysed in TEG buffer (26Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W. Murphy M. Derr J. Taya Y. Lowe S.W. Kastan M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1297-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and p300 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the protein (N-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose. The Sepharose beads were then washed, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter. p53 or p300 protein was detected with the antibody DO1 (Calbiochem) or N-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, using an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell cycle analysis was performed as described elsewhere (10Nitta M. Okamura H. Aizawa S. Yamaizumi M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in plastic dishes (60 mm in diameter) for at least 2 days. They were then treated in hyperosmotic media for various periods. Before harvest by trypsinization, cells were labeled with 10 µmbromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 20 min. The cells were fixed with 80% methanol on ice for 30 min and permeabilized by treatment with 2m hydrochloric acid and 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 45 min. They were then centrifuged and resuspended in 0.1 m sodium tetraborate solution (pH 8.5) to neutralize the acid. After a 30-min incubation with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (diluted 1:4; PharMingen), cells were treated with RNase A (100 µg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C and stained with propidium iodide (10 µg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. In total, 10,000 cells were analyzed with flow cytometry (FACS system, Beckton Dickinson). Total RNA was extracted from cells by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method. The concentration of RNA was equalized (100 µg/ml). Reverse transcription was carried out using the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). p53 cDNA was amplified with the following primers: 5′-ATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGAACAAGAAGTGGAGAATG-3′ (antisense). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was amplified with the primers 5′-ATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCT-3′ (antisense). The cDNA (0.1 µg) was added to 99 µl of a PCR mixture containing 200 µm each dNTP, 0.5 µm each primer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1× PCR buffer, 7 µmTaqstart antibody, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. PCR was performed for 27–36 cycles in an automated thermocycler with the following conditions: denaturing (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (57 °C, 1 min), and elongation (72 °C, 2 min). To minimize nonspecific reactions, the first cycle consisted only of denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min. The products (10 µl) were run on a 0.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Subconfluent monolayers of Mori cells in 6-cm dishes were incubated for 3 days in normal DMEM. The cells were incubated for 1.5 h in DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FCS without methionine and cystine, and then labeled with [35S]methionine (ICN) for 2 h in 4.0 ml of medium containing 0.2 mCi of [35S]methionine. After the labeling, the cultures were rinsed twice with DMEM without methionine and cystine, and then chased for various periods in 4.0 ml of conditioned medium containing 25 mm methionine, 25 mm cystine, and 240 mm NaCl. These cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. Radioactive p53 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against p53 (a mixture of PAb1801 and PAb421) and protein G-Sepharose. After the Sepharose beads had been washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed and fluorographed in 22.5% 2,5-diphenyloxizole in Me2SO. Microinjections with glass needles were performed as described elsewhere (45Yamaizumi M. Sugano T. Asahina H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1476-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To identify microinjected cells, cells were plated on glass coverslips on which small circles had been engraved with a diamond knife. Usually 50–100 of the cells in each small circle were miocroinjected for analysis. p38MAPKexpression plasmid (10 ng/µl) was microinjected into the nuclei of Mori cells with or without a constitutively active MKK6 (MKK6EE) expression plasmid (5 ng/µl). To see the effect of dominant negative MKK6, MKK6AA expression plasmid (50 ng/µl) was microinjected into Mori cells. H1299 cells were transfected with a pRenilla luciferase-CMV reporter plasmid (0.1 µg) and a luciferase reporter plasmid (0.4 µg) driven by one copy of the p53-responsive element motif of p21WAF1 (46El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), together with 0.1 µg of the various p53 expression plasmids using Superfect (Qiagen). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized toRenilla luciferase activity in each sample. All points are displayed as the mean and standard deviation of triplicate assays. When normal human fibroblasts were cultured continuously in hyperosmotic medium, nuclear accumulation of p53 was detected by immunostaining within hours. The accumulation was induced in medium containing 210–270 mm NaCl, but above 290 mmNaCl, cells shrank in a short time and detached from dishes. In most subsequent experiments, cells were cultured in medium containing 240 mm NaCl. Accumulation of p53 was detected as early as 3 h, and peaked around 6 h, as determined by either immunostaining (Fig. 1, A andB) or Western blotting (Fig. 1C). More than 90% of the treated cells showed positive staining for p53 with a similar level of fluorescence intensity. The amount of p53 protein returned to the basal level within 12 h even in the hyperosmotic medium. p21WAF1 is a major target of activated p53 (11Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar) and inhibits the cyclin-dependent protein kinase/cyclin complex, thus inducing cell cycle arrest at G1/S (47Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tlsty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Following the increase in the p53 protein level, the p21WAF1 protein level rose gradually with a peak at around 9 h, and then returned to the basal level within 24 h (Fig.1D). Accumulation of p53 and p21WAF1 with similar time courses was observed in a human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF7, which has been shown to have normal induction of p21WAF1 (48Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. Oren M. Chin D.M. Lyass L. Zelnick C.R. Kazarov A. Toyofuku W. Gray-Bablin J. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Nikiforov M. Haffner R. Gudkov A. Keyomarsi K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2535-2547PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, accumulation of p21WAF1 was detected in neither p53−/− mouse fibroblasts (41Tsukada T. Tomooka Y. Takai S. Ueda Y. Nishikawa S. Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Takeda N. Suda Y. Abe S. Matsuo I. Ikawa Y. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3313-3322PubMed Google Scholar) nor a human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 defective in p53 function (data not shown). These results indicate that the induction of p21WAF1 is dependent on p53. To determine whether up-regulated p21WAF1 evoked cell cycle arrest, cell cycle profiles were analyzed by flow cytometry. In proliferating normal fibroblasts (Mori), the percentage of cells in the S-phase was 11% (Fig. 2A(C) and Table I). However, in hyperosmotic medium, cells in the S-phase disappeared within 12 h (Fig. 2A, 12 h) and cell cycle arrest mainly at the G1-phase continued for more than 24 h (Table I). To confirm that activated p53 is required for cell cycle arrest in high salt medium, we analyzed and compared cell cycle profiles of primary cell strains derived from p53 knock-out and wild-type mice. Although p53+/+ fibroblasts showed a marked decrease in the S-phase population and an increase in the G1-phase population 12–24 h after osmotic shock, p53−/−fibroblasts grew without cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2B(12–24 h) and Table I). Since these two types of mouse cells have the same genetic background except for the p53 gene, these results indicate the absolute requirement of p53 for cell cycle arrest at G1/S.Table ICell cycle analysis after osmotic shock; percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/MCellsG1SG2/MMoriC1-aControl cells before the osmotic shock.62112712 h7841824 h8401648 h80317p53+/+C1-aControl cells before the osmotic shock.54262012 h7512424 h7502548 h74323p53−/−C1-aControl cells before the osmotic shock.53222512 h53192824 h55172848 h552025Percentages in each phase were determined from the cell cycle patterns in Fig. 2.1-a Control cells before the osmotic shock. Open table in a new tab Percentages in each phase were determined from the cell cycle patterns in Fig. 2. The amount of p53 could be controlled at each step from transcription of the gene through to degradation of the protein. To determine whether transcription levels changed before and after osmotic shock treatment, the total amount of p53 mRNA was measured by an RT-PCR method. As shown in Fig.3A, no change was observed during at least 6 h of incubation. We could not determine the production rates of p53 protein by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine, because of changes in the incorporation efficiency of the isotope after osmotic shock. To examine changes in the stability of p53, pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine were performed. As shown in Fig.3B, whereas in non-treated cells (Non-treated) labeled p53 disappeared rapidly, in osmotic shock-treated cells, the protein was markedly stabilized for at least 4 h. These results suggest that p53 is accumulated mainly because of a transient enhancement of protein stability following osmotic shock. To analyze the mechanism of stabilization of p53, we determined the Mdm2 protein levels of MCF7 cells following osmotic shock. We chose this cell line since the cells showed accumulation of p53 on osmotic stress and relatively high levels of Mdm2"

To explore the functional implication of MR in pathophysiology, transgenic mouse models were generated using the proximal human MR (hMR) promoter to drive expression of hMR in aldosterone target tissues. Tissue-specific analysis of transgene expression in two independent transgenic animal (TG) lines by ribonuclease protection assays revealed that hMR is expressed in all mineralocorticoid-sensitive tissues, most notably in the kidney and the heart. TG exhibit both renal and cardiac abnormalities. Enlarged kidneys were histologically associated with renal tubular dilation and cellular vacuolization whose prevalence increased with aging. Renal clearance studies also disclosed a significant decrease in urinary potassium excretion rate in TG. hMR-expressing animals had normal blood pressure but developed mild dilated cardiomyopathy (increased left ventricle diameters and decreased shortening fraction), which was accompanied by a significant increase in heart rate. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a 2- to 5-fold increase in cardiac expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, and early growth response gene 1 as detected by microarrays; renal serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase was also induced significantly.

Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar), a ligand-activated transcription factor belonging to the steroid receptor superfamily (2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M.

MR is closely related to the glucocorticoid receptor, with which it shares high sequence, structural, and functional homologies. Although glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones are able to bind MR with the same affinity, several molecular mechanisms intervene to allow specific aldosterone responses despite the large prevalence of plasma glucocorticoid levels (3Farman N. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F181-F192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MR was found initially to be expressed in sodium-transporting epithelia such as the distal nephron, colon, salivary, and sweat glands. It is now well established that MR is also expressed in a large variety of non-epithelial tissues including the hippocampus (4de Kloet E.R. Van Acker S.A. Sibug R.M. Oitzl M.S. Meijer O.C. Rahmouni K. de Jong W. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the cardiovascular system (5Lombes M. Alfaidy N. Eugene E. Lessana A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Circulation. 1995; 92: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and brown adipose tissue (6Zennaro M.C. Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Walker F. Ricquier D. Lombès M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1254-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In tight epithelia, aldosterone is an important regulator of electrolyte and water homeostasis via its binding to MR, inducing sodium reabsorption, and potassium excretion (7Verrey F. Pearce D. Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Summa V. Zecevic M. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1277-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, by acting on volemia, MR has a key role on blood pressure control. Although aldosterone enhances epithelial amiloride-sensitive sodium channels (ENaC), as well as Na+/K+-ATPase expression and activities, it seems unlikely that these sodium channels and pumps represent primary mineralocorticoid-induced genes. Recently, the serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (sgk) has been recognized as an early aldosterone-induced protein (8Chen S. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P.

Cole T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This serine-threonine kinase was also shown to stimulate ENaC activity, consistent with its important role in the early phase of aldosterone-stimulated sodium transport. The aldosterone-MR system has also been shown to play a critical role in the cardiovascular system as aldosterone excess, combined with a high salt diet, has been reported to cause cardiac fibrosis in rats (11Brilla C.G. Pick R. Tan L.B. Janicli J.S. Weber K.T. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms by which aldosterone modulates cardiovascular function are far from being well understood, it has been suggested that it may potentiate angiotensin II and β-adrenergic agonist effects. In the brain, MR is also involved in neuronal long-term potentiation and in the central regulation of blood pressure, stress, and behavior (4de Kloet E.R. Van Acker S.A. Sibug R.M. Oitzl M.S.

Funder J.W. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1987; 14: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) remain to be explored. Recent advances in the understanding of the in vivo function of MR were obtained by genetic ablation in mice (17Berger S. Bleich M. Schmid W. Cole T.J. Peters J. Watanabe H. Kriz W. Warth R. Greger R. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9424-9429Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The MR knockout mice, which presented with sodium and water wasting, hyperkaliemia and hyponatremia, died within the first week of life. This phenotype, closely resembling type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (18Zennaro M.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), can be rescued by intraperitoneal injections of sodium chloride solution (19Bleich M. Warth R. Schmidt-Hieber M.

A strong activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was noted (20Hubert C. Gasc J.M. Berger S. Schutz G. Corvol P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however the reduction in sodium reabsorption capabilities was surprisingly not accompanied by a concomitant and coordinate decrease in ENaC expression. To better understand the role of MR in various tissues and investigate its contribution to physiopathological disorders, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing MR, to create a receptor gain of function model. We have shown previously that the human MR (hMR) gene is composed of ten exons (21Zennaro M.C. Keightley M.C. Kotelevtsev Y. Conway G.S. Soubrier F. Fuller P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) including the two first untranslated exons 1α and 1β. The P1 and P2 regions upstream of exons 1α and 1β, respectively, have been characterized as functional alternative promoters (22Zennaro M.-C. Le Menuet D. Lombès M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In vivo characterization of P1 and P2 promoters in transgenic mice has been studied by means of targeted oncogenesis using SV40 large T antigen. The proximal P1 promoter exhibited a widespread pattern of activity, directing a relatively strong transgene expression, most notably in the distal nephron and heart. In contrast, the activity of the distal P2 promoter was ∼10 times weaker than P1 and more spatially limited (23Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Penfornis P. Walker F. Zennaro M.C. Lombès M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7878-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To develop MR-induced physiopathological models, we created transgenic mice in which expression of hMR was placed under the control of the P1 promoter. Herein is described the study of the renal and cardiac phenotypes of two P1.hMR transgenic lines and subsequent modifications of specific gene expression associated with these phenotypes. Targeted overexpression of hMR in these transgenic mice results in the appearance of a mild dilated cardiomyopathy associated with increased heart rate; transgenic mice also developed nephropathy with decreased renal potassium excretion. These results underline the major role of MR as a regulator of cardiac and renal function and provide a suitable system to further explore molecular mechanisms involved in heart and kidney diseases. The P1.hMR plasmid was constructed using the optimized transgenic vector H31 kindly provided by L.-M. Houdebine (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Jouy en Josas, France). A HindIII-AvaII fragment (−965, +216) containing ∼1 kilobase pair of hMR P1 proximal promoter sequence and the beginning of exon 1α was blunt-ended by Klenow polymerase and inserted in the unique BstXI cloning site of the H31 plasmid to generate the P1-H31 vector. TheAflII-XmaIII fragment of hMR 3750 plasmid containing 2995 bp of hMR cDNA from position 203 to 3198, including the full-length coding sequence, was blunt-ended and inserted into the unique SmaI cloning site P1-H31 vector (see Fig.1). The P1.hMR transgene was separated from plasmid vector sequences by NotI digestion and purified after 0.7% low melting agarose gel electrophoresis with Elutip-D columns (Schleicher & Schüll) and ethanol precipitation. Transgene DNA resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA was microinjected into fertilized oocytes obtained from B6D2 mice at the Service d'Expérimentation Animale et de Transgénèse (CNRS, Villejuif, France). The ability of P1.hMR construct to generate hMR messenger translated into a fully functional protein was examined by cotransfection assays. P1.hMR and pF31-luc, a mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase plasmid used as mineralocorticoid-sensitive reporter, were transiently transfected in RCSV3 rabbit renal cells as described previously (22Zennaro M.-C. Le Menuet D. Lombès M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity increased with the amount of P1.hMR plasmid transfected, as well as with increasing aldosterone concentrations (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the P1 promoter was transcriptionally active, driving expression of a functional and fully aldosterone-responsive recombinant hMR in this simple cellular model. P1.hMR transgenic animals were screened for the presence of the transgene by PCR using tail DNA extracted following standard techniques. Primers used were SC7 (5′-CGCGGGAGCCAACTTCAGGCTGC-3′) located on exon 1α and BR280 (5′-CCCACCGTCTTTCCATATCT-3′) located in hMR cDNA. These two primers are expected to generate a 1.2-kilobase pair PCR product. An internal control amplification was performed in the same tube with RAP1 (5′-AGGACTGGGTGGCTTCCAACTCCCAGACAC-3′) and RAP2 (5′-AGCTTCTCATTGCTGGCCAGGTTCAGG-3′) primers amplifying a 0.6-kilobase pair product of rapsin gene DNA sequences. 35 cycles (95 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 70 s) were used for amplification. The number of integrated transgene copies of each founder was determined by Southern blot analysis of 10 µg of genomic DNA digested by SalI using standard techniques (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a P1.hMR [α-32P]dCTP radiolabeled probe (Rediprime II random prime labeling system; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All experiments were performed on adult male transgenic mice (P1.hMR) obtained by P1.hMR intercrosses (line 33 and line 42) and on age- and sex-matched wild type animals obtained by breeding B6D2 animals in the same animal care facility. Animals were anesthetized with 0.5 ml of Avertin (Fluka, L'Isle d'Abeau Chesne, France) (150 µg/ml) injected intraperitoneally. Blood samples were collected from abdominal aorta with lithium-heparinized needle syringes. After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min, plasmas were recovered. Plasma creatinine, urea, and electrolyte concentrations were determined with a Monarch multiparametric autoanalyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Paris, France). Plasma aldosterone levels were determined by RIA (Aldoctk-2; Diasorin, Antony, France). Organs were removed and frozen immediately in dry ice for RNA extraction or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline solution for histological examination. Kidneys were immersed in alcoholic Bouin's solution. Fixed tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 7-µm thickness, and stained with Mayer's hemalun, eosin, and saffron. Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of wild type or transgenic mice. Samples were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. Ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) were performed as described previously (23Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Penfornis P. Walker F. Zennaro M.C. Lombès M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7878-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using generally 50 µg of total RNA. Protected fragments were electrophoresed on denaturing gels. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and dried. Radioactivity was counted overnight with an Instant-Imager (Packard, Meriden, CT), followed by autoradiography. Northern blots were performed with 15 µg of total RNA following standard techniques (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were then hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes synthesized by random priming (Rediprime II) from specific cDNA fragments. Serial hybridizations with different probes were performed. Signals were quantified and autoradiographed. All results expressed in arbitrary units are normalized to the GAPDH gene control signal. The probes were synthesized by reverse transcription of 5 µg of DNase-treated total RNA from wild type or line 33 transgenic young male hearts using the Atlas mouse cDNA array kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). The 500 cDNA-containing membranes were hybridized and washed as recommended by the manufacturer and exposed overnight on InstantImager and autoradiographed. Signals were marked by their referenced positions, quantified, and normalized by housekeeping gene spots. Only reproducible differences of at least 5-fold between wild type and transgenic animal values were taken into account. Some plasmids used to generate DNA or RNA probes were designed in the laboratory. Reverse transcriptions were performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technology, Inc.) using oligo-dT primers. After 30 cycles of PCR, samples were run on agarose gels, and a specific band was recovered, purified by a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and subcloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector (Promega). The insert was sequenced by Genome Express (Paris, France). The 260-bp atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) probe was generated by PCR using a 56 °C annealing temperature with forward primer ANF-FP (5′-GAGAGACGGCAGTGCTTCTAGGC-3′) and reverse primer ANF-RP (5′-CGTGACACACCACAAGGGCTTAGG-3′). A 650-bp amplicon of theEgr1 gene was also obtained by PCR with forward primer Egr1-FP (5′-TTTGCCTCCGTTCCACCTGC-3′) and reverse primer Egr1-RP (5′-TGCCAACTTGATCGTCTAGCGC-3′). The Egr1 plasmid linearized byAvaI was used to synthesize a 267-base riboprobe using T7 RNA polymerase, leading to a protected fragment of 207 bp in RPA. The cDNAs of α1 Na+/K+-ATPase (forward primer, 5′-ACGCCCTCACGCCCCCTCCAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CATTTCGAATCACGAGGGCTT-3′) and of αENaC (forward primer, 5′-CTAATGATGCTGGACCACACC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAAGCGTCTGTTCCGTGATGC-3′; 54 °C annealing) were also subcloned in pGEM-T-Easy. The sgk plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. A. Naray-Fejes-Toth (Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH). The hMR, mMR, and GAPDH plasmids were gifts from Dr. J. Arriza (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), Dr. G. Schutz (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany), and Dr. B. Escoubet (INSERM U426, Paris, France), respectively. For RPA, the hMR antisense riboprobe is 274 b long, generating a 218-b protected fragment. The mMR antisense riboprobe length is 452 b, hybridizing with 380 b of the target mRNA. The αENaC antisense riboprobe is 360 b long with a 301-b-long protected fragment. Finally, the 184-b-long GAPDH antisense riboprobe generates a 164-b protected fragment. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured by the tail-cuff plethysmography method in trained conscious mice placed in a warming restrainer (Marty Technologie, Phymep, Paris, France). Tail-cuff pressure detected by a pressure transducer (SP844; SensoNorasa, Oslo, Norway) and tail arterial pulsations detected by a piezoelectric pulse sensor were amplified by a signal amplifier Qazap 92204–02 (Bionic Instruments, Phymep, Paris, France). Signals were processed and displayed by means of a PowerLab/4SP program (ADInstruments). Arterial blood pressure was defined as the tail-cuff inflation pressure at which the waveform was extinguished. For all mice, measurements were repeated for 3 days, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Each day, approximately ten consecutive inflation cycles were performed, and final blood pressure was calculated by averaging successful readings. Heart rate, computerized on-line, was read during stable resting phases preceding inflation cycles. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 8- to 12-week-old wild type and transgenic males using an Acuson 128XP/10 cardiac ultrasound machine with an Acuson L10 transducer (6–11 MHz) (Mountain View, CA). Mice were slightly anesthetized by ventilation with 0.5–1% Isofurane (Forene®; Abbott) in O2. The heart was first imaged in the two-dimensional mode in the parasternal long-axis and/or parasternal short-axis views with mice in the supine position, to position the M-mode cursor perpendicular to the interventricular septum and the left ventricle (LV) posterior wall. Then, M-mode images were obtained at a 100-mm/s speed. Echocardiographic measurements were performed on-line from images captured on cine loops and by using the software of the ultrasound machine. Measurements were made from at least three beats of at least three separate acquisitions and were averaged by one observer blinded to prior results; interventricular septum thickness, posterior wall thickness, and LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters were measured by the use of the leading edge convention of the American Society of Echocardiography. LV shortening fraction was calculated as (LV end-diastolic diameter − LV end-systolic diameter/LV end-diastolic diameter) (25Sahn D.J. DeMaria A. Kisslo J. Weyman A. Circulation. 1978; 58: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (7143) Google Scholar). The intraobserver reproducibility assessed by the percentage of the standard deviation to the mean value ratio was 12 ± 1% (n = 31) for the LV posterior wall thickness and 4.5 ± 0.5% (n = 31) for LV end-diastolic diameter measurements. Male wild type and transgenic mice (25 to 28 g) were anesthetized with thiobutabarbital (inactin; 100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and ketamine (75 mg/kg, intramuscular), and their rectal temperature was maintained at 37 °C on a servo-controlled heated surgical table. Tracheostomy was performed, and a PE-50 catheter hand-drawn to the appropriate size was inserted into the right femoral artery for blood pressure measurements (Gould transducer) and blood sampling. The right external jugular vein was cannulated with a hand-drawn PE-50 catheter for continuous infusion (0.9 ml/h/100 g of body weight) of a solution containing 105 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, 4 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose. This solution also contained [methoxy-3H]inulin (priming dose of 12.5 µCi followed by 30 µCi/h). After a 45–60-min equilibration period, a timed urine collection was obtained through a bladder catheter under water-equilibrated paraffin oil. The urine volume was measured gravimetrically. Blood samples (∼10 µl) were taken from the femoral artery in heparinized glass capillaries before and after the clearance period. At the end of the experiment, a larger blood sample was obtained for blood gas measurements, and the kidneys were excised, decapsulated, blotted, and weighed. The radioactivity of [methoxy-3H]inulin in plasma and urine samples (2 µl) was measured by liquid scintillation counting (1209 rackbeta counter; LKB) for determination of the glomerular filtration rate. Comparisons between groups were performed by analysis of variance, Student's t tests, or non-parametric tests, as appropriate by using the software Instat, Version 2.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), or Statview (GraphPad Prism program). For tail-cuff blood pressure and heart rate measurements, grouping factors were taken into account by using multiway variance analysis. p values of 0.05 or less were considered significant. P1-hMR transgenic mice with a B6D2 genetic background were generated, and lines 33 and 42 were studied extensively. These animals were viable and fertile, and no overmorbidity was noted. Table I summarizes the major clinical and biological parameters of these animals compared with their wild type littermates. No major abnormality was detected except that kidney weights, as well as kidney to body weight ratios, were significantly increased in line 42 transgenic animals. This was in accordance with the surprising macroscopic observation of renal abnormalities in ∼25% of 6-month- to 1-year-old line 42 animals (Fig. 2A). In some cases, a renal atrophy occurred with a compensatory hypertrophy of the opposite kidney (Fig. 2B). Histologically, there was a pyelocalyceal dilatation with renal cortex atrophy (Fig. 2C). Systematic histological examination performed in the two transgenic lines revealed glomeruli with dilatation of the Bowman's spaces (Fig. 2D), whereas the renal tubules displayed either dilation (Fig.2E) or sometimes epithelial necrosis with vacuolization of some tubular cells (Fig. 2F). These histological alterations, not found in wild type animals (Fig. 2, G andH), were more pronounced in older animals and were compatible with morphological modifications observed during potassium depletion (26Toback F.G. Ordonez N.G. Bortz S.L. Spargo B.H. Lab. Invest. 1976; 34: 115-124PubMed Google Scholar).Table IClinical and biological parameters of 3- to 6-month-old male wild type and line 33 and 42 transgenic miceGroupTransgene copy numberClinical parametersBiological parametersMiceBWKWHWKW/BWHW/BWMiceNa+K+Cl−CreatinineGlucoseUreangmgmg%‰nmmmmmmµmmmmmWild type1629.3 ± 4.4458 ± 76161 ± 261.66 ± 0.245.53 ± 0.8010151 ± 64.55 ± 0.53117 ± 632.2 ± 7.412.4 ± 2.59.6 ± 1.6Line 3321429.2 ± 5.2474 ± 96181 ± 401.61 ± 0.176.23 ± 1.0612145 ± 64.81 ± 0.47112 ± 429.4 ± 3.211.6 ± 2.011.3 ± 1.8Line 42101227.5 ± 3.2550 ± 101*176 ± 301.99 ± 0.31**6.36 ± 0.939148 ± 84.59 ± 0.45116 ± 532.2 ± 7.211.8 ± 1.410.5 ± 2.0Values are means ± S.E. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 vs. wild type group.

To differentiate expression of hMR transgene from that of the endogenous mMR, the species specificity of hMR and mMR riboprobes designed for RNase protection assay protocol was assessed first. As shown in Fig.3A, the hMR riboprobe does not cross-hybridize with mMR mRNA, whereas the mMR probe does not hybridize with hMR transcripts isolated from a renal rabbit cell line stably transfected with hMR (27Massaad C. Houard N. Lombes M. Barouki R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As expected from our previous targeted oncogenesis studies using the same P1 proximal promoter (23Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Penfornis P. Walker F. Zennaro M.C. Lombès M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7878-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), transgene expression was detected in all MR-expressing tissues, even in liver, spleen, and salivary glands (not shown). Quantification and normalization by GAPDH signals showed a higher hMR expression in line 33 animals, with no correlation with the integrated transgene copy number as estimated by Southern blot (2 in line 33, 10 in line 42; data not shown). A mean relative transgene expression pattern was established from animals for each line (data not shown). The hMR expression in the testis was always higher than that detected in other organs for the two lines, consistent with previous in vivoP1 promoter analysis (23Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Penfornis P. Walker F. Zennaro M.C. Lombès M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7878-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In line 33, high transgene expression was also found in the lung, heart, kidney, and colon, whereas hMR mRNA levels were lower in the brain. Line 42 animals exhibited a high transgene expression in lung and kidney, moderate in heart and brain, and very low if not undetectable in colon. Examination of tubular function was performed by measuring renal clearances in young adult line 42 and wild type males. Results are reported in TableII. Under our experimental conditions, arterial blood pressure measured through intra-arterial catheter in anesthetized animals remained in the normal range and was identical in the two groups. Arterial pH (7.31 ± 0.02 versus7.28 ± 0.04) and plasma bicarbonate (19.4 ± 0.6versus 19.9 ± 0.9 mm) levels were not significantly different between wild type and TG mice. The glomerular filtration rate, as well as the urinary flow rate, both expressed as µl/min or µl/min/g of kidney weight, were also similar between transgenic and wild type animals (Table II). In contrast, a significant decrease in urinary potassium concentration was observed in transgenic mice leading to a 30% reduction in the urinary potassium excretion rate (398 ± 49 versus 592 ± 86 nmol/min/g in control; p < 0.04). The urinary chloride excretion rate, like that of potassium, was r"
https://openalex.org/W2002816845,"The Tax protein of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), an oncoprotein that transactivates viral and cellular genes, plays a key role in HTLV-1 replication and pathogenesis. We used cDNA microarrays to examine Tax-mediated transcriptional changes in the human Jurkat T-cell lines JPX-9 and JPX-M which express Tax and Tax-mutant protein, respectively, under the control of an inducible promoter. Approximately 300 of the over 2000 genes examined were differentially expressed in the presence of Tax. These genes were grouped according to their function and are discussed in the context of existing findings in the literature. There was strong agreement between our results and genes previously reported as being Tax-responsive. Genes that were differentially expressed in the presence of Tax included those related to apoptosis, the cell cycle and DNA repair, signaling factors, immune modulators, cytokines and growth factors, and adhesion molecules. Functionally, we provide evidence that one of these genes, the mixed-lineage kinase MLK-3, is involved in Tax-mediated NF-kappa-B signaling. Our current results provide additional insights into Tax-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2334321830,"The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and the Abl family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases have both been implicated in tissue morphogenesis. They regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in the developing nervous system and participate in signaling pathways involved in axon growth. Both Eph receptors and Abl are localized in the neuronal growth cone, suggesting that they play a role in axon pathfinding. Two-hybrid screens identified regions of Abl and Arg that bind to the EphB2 and EphA4 receptors, suggesting a novel signaling connection involving the two kinase families. The association of full-length Abl and Arg with EphB2 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and found to involve several distinct protein interactions. The SH2 domains of Abl and Arg bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs in the juxtamembrane region of EphB2. A second, phosphorylation-independent interaction with EphB2 involves non-conserved sequences in the C-terminal tails of Abl and Arg. A third interaction between Abl and EphB2 is probably mediated by an intermediary protein because it requires tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB2, but not the binding sites for the Abl SH2 domain. The connection between EphB2 and Abl/Arg appears to be reciprocal. Activated EphB2 causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Abl and Arg, and vice versa. Interestingly, treatment of COS cells and B35 neuronal-like cells with ephrin-B1 to activate endogenous EphB2 decreased the kinase activity of endogenous Abl. These data are consistent with the opposite effects that Eph receptors and Abl have on neurite ougrowth and suggest that Eph receptors and Abl family kinases have shared signaling activities."
https://openalex.org/W1996205594,"Mutations in the 5' UTR which cause increment/decrement of translation efficiency have been recently described as a novel molecular mechanism of disease. Alterations in the consensus sequence for the translation initiation may promote context-dependent leaky scanning of ribosomes and/or initiation from a downstream AUG codon. Initiation of translation from a downstream in-frame AUG codon in BRCA1 gene was recently identified in normal cells and possibly in breast cancer. Here we present further insight into BRCA1 translational pathophysiology investigating the role of the canonical structure of the initiation consensus sequence of BRCA1. We have analysed the effect of a somatic point mutation (117 G>C) in position -3 with respect to the AUG of the BRCA1 gene, identified in a highly aggressive sporadic breast cancer. We constructed chimeric genes encoding the luciferase reporter sequence downstream of the wild type or the mutated BRCA1 5'UTR. These transcripts were tested for their activity in in vitro and in vivo systems. In in vitro transcription/translation assays the estimated translation efficiency of the construct with the mutated BRCA1 5'UTR was 30-50% lower than that with the wild type BRCA1 5'UTR. The same chimeric genes were analysed for their expression in vivo by transient transfection in human cells. While the two constructs were equally transcribed, the plasmid carrying the mutated sequence produced 70% less luciferase activity compared to the wild type sequence. Finally, to obtain a direct evaluation on translational efficiency in vivo, we analysed mRNA translation on translationally active and non-active ribosomes separated from transfected cells. Mutant mRNA was partially localized in subpolysomal particles analytically confirming a polysome recruitment defect. Thus, characterization of BRCA1 5'UTR and translation efficiency seems to provide new insight into BRCA1 role in breast and ovarian cancer pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1976115046,"BAG-1 (also known as RAP46/HAP46) was originally identified as a 46 kDa protein that bound to and enhanced the anti-apoptotic properties of Bcl-2. BAG-1 exists as three major isoforms (designated p50, p46 and p36 or BAG-1L, BAG-1M and BAG-1S respectively) and one minor isoform (p29), which are translated from a common transcript. The differing amino terminus determines both the intracellular location and the repertoire of binding partners of the isoforms which play different roles in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, heat shock, apoptosis and transcription. Although in vitro data suggest that the four BAG-1 isoforms are translated by leaky scanning, the patterns of isoform expression in vivo, especially in transformed cells, do not support this hypothesis. We have performed in vivo analysis of the BAG-1 5' untranslated region and shown that translation initiation of the most highly expressed isoform (p36/BAG-1S) can occur by both internal ribosome entry and cap-dependent scanning. Following heat shock, when there is a downregulation of cap-dependent translation, the expression of the p36 isoform of BAG-1 is maintained by internal ribosome entry."

These can be pinched off by a dynamin collar, and proteins controlling receptor internalization can also mediate mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates internalization of its receptors via clathrin-coated vesicles. Mammalian GnRH receptors (GnRH-Rs) are unique in that they lack C-terminal tails and do not rapidly desensitize, whereas non-mammalian GnRH-R have C-terminal tails and, where investigated, do rapidly desensitize and internalize. Using recombinant adenovirus expressing human and Xenopus GnRH-Rs we have explored the relationship between receptor internalization and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in HeLa cells with regulated tetracycline-controlled expression of wild-type or a dominant negative mutant (K44A) of dynamin. These receptors were phospholipase C-coupled and had appropriate ligand affinity and specificity. K44A dynamin expression did not alter human GnRH-R internalization but dramatically reduced internalization of Xenopus GnRH-R (and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor). Blockade of clathrin-mediated internalization (sucrose) abolished internalization of all three receptors. Both GnRH-Rs also mediated phosphorylation of ERK 2 and for both receptors, this was inhibited by K44A dynamin. The same was true for EGF- and protein kinase C-mediated ERK 2 phosphorylation. ERK 2 phosphorylation was also inhibited by a protein kinase C inhibitor but not affected by an EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We conclude that a) desensitizing and non-desensitizing GnRH-Rs are targeted for clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated internalization by functionally distinct mechanisms, b) GnRH-R signaling to ERK 2 is dynamin-dependent and c) this does not reflect a dependence on dynamin-dependent GnRH-R internalization.

For many GPCRs this is mediated by G-protein receptor kinases, which phosphorylate the receptor and promote the binding of β-arrestin and a consequent reduction in coupling of the receptor to its heterotrimeric G-proteins (1Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). β-arrestin also serves as an adapter, targeting the desensitized receptor to clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) for internalization (2Goodman O.B.J.

Once formed, the CCV is “pinched” off from the plasma membrane by an oligomeric dynamin “collar”. This effect of dynamin is dependent upon its intrinsic GTPase and can be blocked by expression of GTPase-inactive (dominant negative) mutants such as K44A dynamin (3Viera A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The internalized receptors are then either recycled back to the surface membrane or targeted to lysosomes for degradation so that agonist-induced GPCR internalization can reinforce desensitization or underlie resensitization. Although this general scheme appears applicable to numerous GPCRs, there are important exceptions. For example, internalization of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and the angiotensin 1A receptor is independent of both β-arrestin and dynamin (4Vogler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M.

Thus β-arrestin can apparently recruit Src to agonist-occupied receptors, thereby facilitating Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation (12Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.

GnRH-Rs have a number of atypical structural characteristics (20McArdle C.A. Davidson J.S. Willars G.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), notably the unique absence of C-terminal tails in type I mammalian GnRH-Rs. In contrast, all cloned non-mammalian GnRH-Rs possess such tails and, since the serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated by GRKs are often found within the C-terminal tail, comparative studies have addressed the functional relevance of these structures. These have revealed that mammalian GnRH-Rs do not show rapid homologous desensitization (21Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Millar R.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Willars G.B. Heding A. Vrecl M. Sellar R. Blomenrohr M. Nahorski S.R. Eidne K.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, where investigated, non-mammalian GnRH-Rs show agonist-induced phosphorylation and β-arrestin translocation and undergo β-arrestin-dependent internalization (24Blomenrohr M. Heding A. Sellar R. Leurs R. Bogerd J. Eidne K.A. Willars G.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 12229-12237Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas mammalian GnRH-Rs do not (25Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A.

Using recombinant adenovirus expressing human and type I Xenopus GnRH-Rs (Ad hGnRH-R and Ad XGnRH-R) we have recently shown that these functional distinctions (desensitization and internalization) are retained when GnRH-Rs are expressed at physiological density and in gonadotrope lineage cells (26Hislop J.N. Madziva M.T. Everest H.M. Harding T. Uney J.B. Willars G.B. Millar R.P. Troskie B.E. Davidson J.S. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4564-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This supports the notion that GnRH-Rs have undergone a relatively recent period of accelerated molecular evolution that is functionally relevant and pertinent to the development of mammalian reproductive strategies (27Pawson A.J. Katz A. Sun Y.M. Lopes J. Illing N. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: R9-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have explored the dynamin dependence of GnRH-R internalization and MAP kinase signaling using recombinant adenovirus to express human and Xenopus GnRH-Rs in HeLa cells conditionally expressing wild-type or dominant negative (K44A) dynamin under tetracycline control (tet-OFF). Both receptors were positively coupled to PLC and MAP kinase (ERK 2 phosphorylation) and, as anticipated, the non-mammalian GnRH-Rs rapidly desensitized and internalized, whereas these processes were slower or absent for the mammalian GnRH-Rs. Both receptors were internalized via CCVs (as indicated by sucrose dependence) but internalization of the XGnRH-R was primarily dynamin-dependent, whereas that of the hGnRH-R was not. MAP kinase activation was dynamin-dependent for both receptors, was reduced by inhibition of internalization or of PKC activity, and was not inhibited by an EGF receptor, tyrophostin. Thus, desensitizing and non-desensitizing GnRH-Rs undergo functionally distinct forms of internalization and show dynamin-dependent signaling that does not reflect internalization of the GPCR or EGF receptor transactivation. GnRH and chicken GnRH II (cGnRH-II) were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories Europe Ltd. (Mersyside, United Kingdom) or from Sigma. Buserelin and125I-buserelin (2000 Ci/mmol) were provided by Prof. Sandow (Aventis Pharma GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). 125I-cGnRH-II (∼3400 Ci/mmol as determined by self-displacement) was prepared using chloramine T and purified by G25 Sephadex column chromatography.125I-EGF was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. AG1478 was purchased from Calbiochem. Culture media, sera, and plasticware were from Life Technologies, Inc. or Falcon (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). Lipofectin, LipofectAMINE, and plus reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc., and FuGENE 6 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 2-[3H]inositol (14–16 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham International (Little Chalfont, UK). Recombinant adenovirus expressing the human GnRH-R (Ad hGnRH-R), theXenopus type I GnRH-R (Ad XGnRH-R) and EGFP (Ad EGFP) were generated as previously described (26Hislop J.N. Madziva M.T. Everest H.M. Harding T. Uney J.B. Willars G.B. Millar R.P. Troskie B.E. Davidson J.S. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4564-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and CMV-EGFP was fromCLONTECH. All other reagents were from standard commercial suppliers. HeLa cells stably expressing either the wild-type (WT dynamin cells) or the dominant negative GTPase-deficient mutant dynamin (K44A dynamin cells) (kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmidt, Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) were cultured in serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with G418 (300 µg/ml), puromycin (100 ng/ml), and tetracycline (1 µg/ml) as described (3Viera A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). For experiments cells were harvested by trypsinization, plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% serum, and incubated for 2 days in flasks or culture plates as described in figure legends. Cells were infected on the second day, and where appropriate the tetracycline was removed. After 8 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, with or without tetracycline. [3H]IP accumulation was used as a measure of PLC activity as described (28Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using cells labeled by pre-incubation with [3H]inositol and stimulated in the presence of LiCl. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates in 1 ml of media, and 2 µCi 2-[3H]inositol (14–16 Ci/mmol) was added to each well for the final 16 h of incubation. After two washes with PSS (127 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% (w/v), bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), each well was stimulated for the period indicated in the figures with 200 µl of PSS containing 10 mm LiCl and the indicated concentration of buserelin, GnRH, or cGnRH-II. The stimulation was terminated by adding 1 ml of water at 95 °C. The cells were lysed by freezing and thawing and [3H]IP was separated from [3H]inositol using anion exchange chromatography in formate form Dowex-1 columns, and the amount of 3H eluted in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (28Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GnRH-R expression was assessed and competition curves were constructed using whole cell binding assays in which ∼50,000 cells were incubated in suspension for 30 min at 21 °C in 100 µl of PSS containing 1 mg/ml bacitracin with ∼10−10m radiolabel and 0 or 10−10 to 10−5m of the unlabeled competitor peptide (26Hislop J.N. Madziva M.T. Everest H.M. Harding T. Uney J.B. Willars G.B. Millar R.P. Troskie B.E. Davidson J.S. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4564-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Free and bound peptide were then separated by centrifugation through oil. For the human GnRH-R, the radiolabel was125I-buserelin and for Xenopus GnRH-R the radiolabel was 125I-cGnRH-II. Similar assays were performed to quantify cell surface EGF receptors. Approximately 50,000 cells were incubated in suspension for 3 h at 4 °C in 100 µl PSS containing 1 mg/ml bacitracin with ∼0.2 nm125I-EGF and 0 or 10−6m of unlabeled EGF. Free and bound peptides were then separated by centrifugation through oil. Internalization of EGF receptors was quantified in a modified whole cell binding assay in which ∼250,000 cells were grown in 6-well plates. Cells were washed in PSS and then incubated at 37 °C in 1 ml of PSS containing ∼10−7m EGF. After the required incubation period (2–45 min) the cells were rapidly rinsed in ice-cold PSS (two times) and then incubated for 5 min in ice-cold 150 mm NaCl,50 mm acetic acid (pH 3) before scraping, pelleting, and resuspending in PSS. Internalization of GnRH-R was quantified in a modified whole cell binding assay in which ∼50,000 cells (grown in 24-well plates) were washed in PSS and then incubated at 37 °C in 200 µl of PSS containing ∼10−10m radiolabel and 0 (total binding) or 10−6m (nonspecific binding) of buserelin or cGnRH-II. After the required incubation period (5–30 min) the cells were rapidly rinsed in ice-cold PSS (two times) and then incubated for 2 min either in ice-cold PSS or in ice-cold 150 mm NaCl,50 mm acetic acid (pH 3). The cells were then washed three more times in ice-cold PSS and solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.2m NaOH with 1% SDS. Radiolabel in the solubilized cells was determined by γ counting, and specific cell-associated radioactivity was determined by subtraction of nonspecific from the total. Total specific binding is defined as the specific binding in cells receiving no acid wash, whereas acid-resistant (internalized)-specific binding is defined as that seen in the acid washed cells. An internalization index was calculated by expressing acid-resistant-specific binding as a percentage of total cell-associated-specific binding. Fluid phase endocytosis was determined by measuring uptake of horseradish peroxidase as described (29Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured at 250,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and infected with Ad hGnRH-R or Ad XGnRH-R (m.o.i. 100) as above. They were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and 0 or 10−7m GnRH or cGnRH-II. Uptake was terminated by repeated washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to cell lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Horseradish peroxidase activity was then determined using 3,3-diaminobenzidine as a substrate followed by colorimetric measurement at 450 nm. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was measured by dynamic video imaging using MagiCal hardware and Tardis software with a Nikon Diaphot microscope with ×40 quartz oil immersion objective (30McArdle C.A. Willars G.B. Fowkes R.C. Nahorski S.R. Davidson J.S. Forrest-Owen W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23711-23717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in flat-bottomed 12-well plates and were washed and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with PSS containing 2 µm fura-2 acetoxmethyl ester (fura-2/AM). Immediately before imaging the coverslip was dipped into PSS, blotted, and mounted on a greased incubation chamber. The cells were kept immersed in media constantly. Media changes were carried out by pipetting 4 ml of solution into the chamber, while an aspiration tube removed excess liquid and maintained a constant volume of around 400 µl. The samples in the chamber were illuminated alternately at 340 and 380 nm, and the ratio of the light emitted at 510 nm was measured, averaging 16 video frames to minimize the pixel to pixel standard error. This ratio was proportional to the intracellular ionized Ca2+. For calibration, a dissociation constant of 225 nm for fura-2 and Ca2+ at 37 °C was used, and minimal and maximal fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm were determined in cells loaded with dye and made permeable to extracellular Ca2+ with 10 µm ionomycin in solutions containing either 10 mm Ca2+ or 10 mm EGTA. Activation of ERK 2 was measured by Western blotting according to standard techniques. Briefly HeLa cells were plated in 6-well plates at 250,000 cells/well, infected with either Ad XGnRH-R or Ad hGnRH-R at an m.o.i. of 50–100, and left to express for 24 h. Following treatment, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before being lysed on ice for 10 min in 400 µl of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 µm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml antipain, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin). Samples were then centrifuged (13,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to clear the supernatant before 40 µl of aliquots were boiled with 40 µl of sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gel), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 5% skimmed milk/Tris-buffered saline Tween. ERK 2 was detected using monoclonal anti-ERK 2 (Santa Cruz) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ERK 2 were distinguished by retardation of the latter in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both bands were scanned and quantified by densitometry (Quantity 1 Software, Bio-Rad), and the phosphorylated ERK 2 was expressed as a percentage of total ERK 2 (both bands). The figures show the mean ± S.E. of data pooled from “n ” independent experiments (raw data or data normalized as described in the figure legends). Data are typically reported in text as mean ± S.E., and statistical analysis was by analysis of variance and Student's t test, accepting p < 0.05 as statistically significant. EC50 values were estimated by non-linear regression using “Graphpad Prism” (Graphpad Prism, San Diego, CA). To explore the dynamin dependence of GnRH-R desensitization, internalization, and signaling, we sought to express human andXenopus GnRH-Rs in HeLa cells expressing wild-type or K44A dynamin under control of the tetracycline-response element and a tetracycline-controlled transactivator. However, transfection efficiencies were found to be extremely low in these cells when conventional strategies (CaPO4, Lipofectin, LipofectAMINE Plus, and FuGENE) were used. Using flow cytometry to assess protein expression after transfection with a CMV-EGFP plasmid we estimated that <20% of cells were transfected. In contrast transfection efficiencies approaching 100% were obtained using recombinant EGFP-expressing adenovirus (not shown). We therefore made use of previously generated recombinant adenovirus expressing human andXenopus laevis type I GnRH-Rs (Ad hGnRH-R and Ad XGnRH-R, respectively). Since these receptors have not (to our knowledge) been previously expressed in HeLa cells, it was necessary to first perform a basic pharmacological characterization. This was undertaken using WT dynamin cells maintained in medium with tetracycline (conditions not permissive for transgene expression). To determine the relationship between viral titer and receptor expression we constructed competition binding curves using 125I-buserelin and varied amounts of unlabeled buserelin. No specific binding was seen in untransfected cells, but infection with Ad hGnRH-R with increasing titer (from m.o.i. of 3–100) increased 125I-buserelin binding, and this was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled buserelin. Fitting this data to a single site competition model revealed no dependence of K d value on viral titer, so B max values were estimated by refitting the data with the K d fixed at the mean value of 2.4 nm (2.4 nm ± 0.3 nm, n = 3). This revealed receptor densities of 3000, 14,600, 25,500, and 46,500 sites/cell at m.o.i. values of 3, 10, 30, and 100, respectively (Fig. 1). Similar experiments with 125I-cGnRH-II and unlabeled cGnRH-II in cells infected with Ad XGnRH-R again revealed high affinity binding sites with no relationship between Ad titer and K d. The data was therefore fitted through the mean K dvalue of 3.1 nm (3.1 nm ± 0.9 nm, n = 3). This revealed receptor densities of 6600, 17,000, 49,000, and 215,000 sites/cell at m.o.i. values of 3, 10, 30, and 100, respectively (data not shown). To establish whether these binding sites were functional GnRH-Rs, GnRH-stimulated [3H]IP accumulation was measured in cells infected with Ad hGnRH-R at varied titer. No stimulation was seen in untransfected cells or in cells infected at low viral titer (m.o.i. of 3), but GnRH did cause a clear dose- and titer-dependent stimulation of [3H]IP accumulation at higher titers. At m.o.i. values of 3, 10, 30, and 100, 4.7% ± 2.0%, 3.8% ± 0.9%, 11.8% ± 3.3, and 31.7% ± 7.5%, respectively, of total [3H]inositol was found in the [3H]IP fraction after 30 min stimulation with a maximally effective concentration of GnRH (Fig. 1). A similar dose- and titer-dependent stimulation of [3H]IP accumulation was seen in HeLa cells infected with Ad XGnRH-R (not shown). When these cells were stimulated for 30 min with 10−6m cGnRH-II after infection at m.o.i. values of 3, 10, 30, and 100, cGnRH increased the proportion of [3H]inositol recovered in the [3H]IP fraction to 3.6% ± 0.2%, 5.9% ± 0.9%, 13.1% ± 4.1, and 32.3% ± 1.7%, respectively. Interestingly, the maximal observed [3H]IP responses were comparable (∼32%) for both receptors despite the fact that 4–5 times more XGnRH-R were expressed at the m.o.i. of 100. This distinction is similar to that observed with the same GnRH-R expressed in αT4 pituitary cells and may reflect differential desensitization during the course of the [3H]IP accumulation assay (26Hislop J.N. Madziva M.T. Everest H.M. Harding T. Uney J.B. Willars G.B. Millar R.P. Troskie B.E. Davidson J.S. McArdle C.A. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4564-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since activation of PLC mediates elevation of [Ca2+]i by GnRH in pituitary cells, we also assessed possible effects of GnRH on Ca2+ in Ad hGnRH-R-infected HeLa cells. As shown (Fig. 1), GnRH did not increase [Ca2+]i in control fura-2-loaded HeLa cells but caused a sustained and titer-dependent increase after infection at m.o.i. values of 3–100. Since these data were acquired by video imaging it was also possible to determine the proportion of cells responding to GnRH. This revealed that the vast majority of cells (>80%) responded to GnRH at relatively low titer (m.o.i. values of 10–30), and that increasing viral titer above an m.o.i. of 10 increased the amplitude of the responses without increasing the proportion of cells responding. These data (not shown) are very similar to those previously obtained when Ad GnRH-R were used to infect pituitary cells (26Hislop J.N. Madziva M.T. Everest H.M. Harding T. Uney J.B. Willars G.B.

https://openalex.org/W2007515225,"The various molecular forms of gastrin can act as promoters of proliferation and differentiation in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract. We report a novel stimulatory effect of glycine-extended gastrin17 only on cell/cell dissociation and cell migration in a non-tumorigenic mouse gastric epithelial cell line (IMGE-5). In contrast, both amidated and glycine-extended gastrin17 stimulated proliferation of IMGE-5 cells via distinct receptors. Glycine-extended gastrin17-induced dissociation preceded migration and was blocked by selective inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) but did not require mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Furthermore, glycine-extended gastrin17 induced a PI3-kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adherens junction protein β-catenin, partial dissociation of the complex between β-catenin and the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, and delocalization of β-catenin into the cytoplasm. Long lasting activation of MAP kinases by glycine-extended gastrin17 was specifically required for the migratory response, in contrast to the involvement of a rapid and transient MAP kinase activation in the proliferative response to both amidated and glycine-extended gastrin17. Therefore, the time course of MAP kinase activation appears to be a critical determinant of the biological effects mediated by this pathway. Together with the involvement of PI3-kinase in the dissociation of adherens junctions, long term activation of MAP kinases seems responsible for the selectivity of this novel effect of G17-Gly on the adhesion and migration of gastric epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2145424727,"The pro-apoptotic molecule BAD binds BCL-[X(L)] or BCL2 and inactivates their survival function. In addition to their anti-apoptotic function, BCL2 and BCL-[X(L)] also delay cell cycle entry from quiescence. We found that the BH3-only molecule BAD also exerted a cell cycle effect. BAD expression resulted in failure to cell cycle block in growth arrest conditions. In low serum and in confluence, fibroblasts constitutively or inducibly expressing BAD persisted in S phase, continued to incorporate BrdU, and exhibited sustained cyclin E/cdk2 activity. Mutation analysis indicated that the cell cycle effect of BAD was not dependent on its phosphorylation status or subcellular localization, but strictly co-segregated with BCL-[X(L)] binding. bclx(-/-) MEFs expressing BAD and bad(-/-) MEFs both arrested in G0/G1 in low serum similar to wild-type controls, suggesting that the ability to overcome the G0/G1 checkpoint resulted from the presence of BAD/BCL-x(L) heterodimers, rather than the absence of BCL-[X(L)] or BAD. These data provide evidence that in addition to regulating apoptosis, the BAD/BCL-[X(L)] heterodimer has a novel cell cycle function."

The nature of its P1 residue (nomenclature according to Schechter and Berger (10Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar)), Leu30, is in accordance with the literature and its inhibitory properties. Indeed, chymotrypsin inhibitors have bulky and aromatic residues such as Phe, Leu, or Met as their P1 residue whereas trypsins require basic amino acids (Lys or Arg). In PMP-D2, the corresponding residue is Arg29. However, PMP-D2 has no effect on porcine trypsin and is a weak inhibitor of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin (Ki 100 and 1,500 nm, respectively), whereas it can be converted to a potent bovine α-chymotrypsin inhibitor by a single mutation R29L at P1 (Ki 0.8 nm). In addition, a second point mutation at P′1 (K30M) converts PMP-D2 into a fairly potent human leukocyte elastase inhibitor (Ki 2 nm) (5Kellenberger C. Boudier C. Bermudez I. Bieth J.G. Luu B. Hietter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25514-25519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Very recently, we showed that PMP-D2 is a strong inhibitor of trypsins isolated from L. migratoria. 1C. Kellenberger, G. Ferrat, and H. Darbon, manuscript in preparation. The inhibitory properties of PMP-D2 are of great interest, because they highlight selectivity not observed yet for PMP-C. To provide the first description of the recognition mechanism in the grasshopper family, we solved the crystal structure of PMP-C in complex with bovine α-chymotrypsin. We also determined the structure of the R29L/K30M PMP-D2 variant (named PMP-D2v) bound to chymotrypsin, because the weak affinity of native PMP-D2 prevented any complex crystallization with available proteases. The peptides were synthesized on solid phase using Fmoc strategy and were refolded by air oxidation of the six cysteines as described previously (5Kellenberger C. Boudier C. Bermudez I. Bieth J.G. Luu B. Hietter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25514-25519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Bovine α-chymotrypsin was purchased from Sigma (product code C3142). The peptides, as well as the enzyme, were solubilized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and mixed together in a molar ratio of 1:3 (enzyme:inhibitor). The crystallization trials were performed after 1 h of incubation. Single crystals of PMP-C peptide complexed to bovine α-chymotrypsin were obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Protein drops were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate, 29% polyethylene glycol 400, and 100 mmCdCl2 at pH 5.0. The drops consisted of 2 ml of protein solution at 10 mg/ml mixed to an equal volume of the reservoir solution. Hexagonal bipyramids of about 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 mm3 in size developed after 10 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature to 2.1-Å resolution on a 300-mm Mar research imaging plate with l = 0.970 Å on beam line W32 at Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement Electromagnétique. The data were processed using the DENZO software package (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). PMP-C·α-chymotrypsin complex crystallized in the space group P65 with cell dimensions a = b = 92.9 Å, c = 165.8 Å. Specific volume calculations yielded three molecules per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 50%. A total number of 46359 unique reflections were indexed using the SCALEPACK package (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) program with an Rmerge on intensities of 7.9%, a data set multiplicity of 3.9, and a completeness of 98.2%, between 20.0 and 2.1 Å. Single crystals of PMP-D2v complexed to bovine α-chymotrypsin were obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Protein drops were equilibrated against the similar reservoir solution as for PMP-C. Crystals about 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm3 in size developed after 15 days. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature to 3.0-Å resolution on a 300-mm Mar research imaging plate with λ = 0.970 Å on beam line W32 in LURE. The data were processed using the DENZO software package. The PMP-D2v·α-chymotrypsin complex crystallized in the space group P6522 with cell dimensions a = b = 86.1 Å, c = 187.3 Å. Specific volume calculations yielded one molecule per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of ∼60%. A total number of 8699 unique reflections were indexed using the SCALEPACK package program with an Rfactor on intensities of 15.1%, a data set multiplicity of 7.3, and a completeness of 99.8%, between 15.0 and 3.0 Å. The structure of PMP-C·α-chymotrypsin complex was solved with the molecular replacement method using the AMoRe program (12Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). The α-chymotrypsin structure (Protein Data Bank code 1CHO) was used as the search model. The rotation function gave two solutions, leading to three positions in the translation function, two of them with the same orientation. Before fitting, the correlation coefficient and Rfactorwere 51.5 and 39.6%, respectively, which refined to 63.9 and 33.1%, respectively. 3-Fold averaging was then carried out in a region containing the α-chymotrypsin trimer, as well as the putative inhibitor binding region, using the DEMON/ANGEL package (13Vellieux F.M. Hunt J.F. Roy S. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 347-351Crossref Google Scholar). All non-chymotrypsin density peaks were assigned as waters, and X-PLOR refinement (14Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.843. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar) was carried out between 27 and 2.7 Å using strict non-crystallographic symmetry. Water molecules were progressively added during subsequent cycles of refinement until the three PMP-C molecules became visible. The model was then transferred to the high resolution data set collected at LURE, and the refinement was pursued, using cycles of ARP/X-PLOR between 10 and 2.1 Å, this time with weaker NCS restrains as determined byRfree trials. Once the PMP-C molecules were mostly built, the refinement protocol was ended with several cycles of refinement in TNT, using data between 20 and 2.1 Å. The final model has good geometry, with an Rfree of 22.8% for an Rfactor of 18.9%. The three PMP-C molecules are complete, respectively, between residues 2 and 35, 4 and 34, and 5 and 35. The Ramachandran plot shows that 86.9% of the non-glycine residues fall within the most favorable regions. The remaining 13.1% lies within the additionally allowed regions.

Open table in a new tab The molecular replacement method using the AMoRe program was also used to solve the structure of PMP-D2v·α-chymotrypsin complex with the same search model. The rotation function yielded one solution, and the translation function yielded a unique solution, with a correlation coefficient and an Rfactor of 63.0 and 36.8%, respectively, for data between 15 and 4 Å. After rigid body refinement, the correlation coefficient was 70% for anRfactor of 32.7%. A weak electron density appeared for the inhibitor that was sufficient to start the inhibitor structure building. After performing several cycles of slow cooling protocol starting at 2500 K and manual replacement and building, for the inhibitor, on the graphic display with the Turbo-Frodo program (15Roussel A. Cambillau C. Graphic S. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar), the Rfactor has decreased to 16.4% (Rfree 19.3%). Coordinates for the structures of PMP-C·α-chymotrypsin complex and PMP-D2v/α-chymotrypsin complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under file name 1GL1 and 1GL0, respectively. The crystals of the PMP-C·α-chymotrypsin complex belong to the space group P65 and diffract up to 2.1-Å resolution. After phase determination by molecular replacement and phase improvement by density modification, refinement yielded anRfactor and an Rfree of 18.9 and 22.8%, respectively (TableI). PMP-C folds into a brick-shaped structure of overall dimensions 30 × 15 × 10 Å3. It is formed of one β-sheet of three antiparallel β-strands (β1, residues 8–11; β2, residues 16–19; β3, residues 26–29) connected by two loops (λ1, residues 12–15; λ2, residues 20–25) and stabilized by three disulfide bridges, Cys4–Cys19, Cys17–Cys28, and Cys14–Cys33 (Fig.1, A and B). The asymmetric unit contains three copies of the complex displaying nearly identical conformations. Pairwise comparisons of the Cα atoms of the three proteases yield root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.)2 values of 0.184, 0.176, and 0.207 Å. Larger r.m.s.d. values are obtained for the three inhibitor molecules (0.350, 0.366, and 0.358 Å). This is because of a poor definition of the electron density map of the N termini of PMP-C molecules. However, as the Cα r.m.s.d. are in the range of the estimated coordinate errors, it can be considered that the three complexes are identical. The main chain of the α-chymotrypsin component can be traced from Cys1 to Gly12(activation peptide), from Ile16 to Tyr146, and from Asn150 to Asn245. The main chain of PMP-C shows no ordered electron density at both the amino (Glu1) and the carboxyl termini (Asn36) (Fig. 1A). The temperature factors of the α-chymotrypsins are in average of 27.3 Å2, whereas those of the inhibitors are higher, with an average value of 63.4 Å2. Nevertheless, the residues 14–18 and 25–33 in contact with chymotrypsin are better defined and display average Bfactor values of 49.4 and 32.1 Å2. Fig. 1B shows the overall fold of PMP-C colored according to the temperature factors. The molecular replacement method was also used to solve the structure of PMP-D2v·α-chymotrypsin complex. Crystals belong to the space group P6522 and diffract up to 3.0-Å resolution. The refinement yields an Rfactor of 16.4% and anRfree of 19.3%. The model of the complex accounts for 242 residues for the protease (1–12 and 16–245) and for 33 residues for the inhibitor. The N-terminal (Glu1) and C-terminal (Ala35) of the inhibitor residues are not modeled because of lack of electron density. The refined averageBfactor are 21.5 Å2 for all protease atoms and 67.8 Å2 for the inhibitor. PMP-D2v exhibits the same overall structure as PMP-C with one β-sheet composed of three antiparallel β-strands (β1, residues 8–11; β2, residues 16–19; and β3, residues 25–28) connected by two loops (λ1, residues 12–15; λ2, residues 20–24) and stabilized by three disulfide bridges (Cys4–Cys19, Cys17–Cys27, and Cys14–Cys32). PMP-C buries 875 Å2 of its solvent-accessible surface upon binding to the protease. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the interaction site of PMP-C is composed of two regions, the binding loop (residues 26–34, 596 Å2) and an internal segment (residues 15–18, 153 Å2). Leu30 (P1) binds to the S1 pocket of the protease, and its side chain conformation is located in the deepest energy minimum (angular values of χ1 = −57 °, χ2 = 173 °) and superimposes well with the P1 side chain of inhibitors such as ascaris inhibitor of chymotrypsin/elastase (χ1 = −71 °, χ2 = 164 °; see Ref.16Huang K. Strynadka N.C. Bernard V.D. Peanasky R.J. James M.N. Structure. 1994; 2: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and OMTKY3 (χ1 = −48 °, χ2 = 157 °; see Ref. 17Fujinaga M. Sielecki A.R. Read R.J. Ardelt W. Laskowski Jr., M. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 397-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The P3-P5 segment (residues 26–28) forms an antiparallel β-sheet with chymotrypsin residues 218–216. Ala32 (P′2) interacts with Phe41 through a hydrogen bond, and Pro34 (P′4) makes a stacking interaction with Phe39 side chain. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds are listed in Table II, top. The binding loop of PMP-C is maintained in a rigid conformation by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to an internal segment (residues 14–20), as shown in Table II, bottom. In particular, a network of four hydrogen bonds (denoted by * in Table II,bottom), involving Asn15 and Thr29side chains, highly stabilizes P′1 and P2 and maintains the local conformation of P1. Reviewing the grasshopper family inhibitors, we found out that Asn15 and Thr29 are the only conserved residues, apart from the six cysteines (Fig. 1C). Although unrelated to grasshopper inhibitors, Ecotin (18McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Gillmor S.A. Takeuchi T. Yang S.Q. Craik C.S. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) displays a segment (residues 47–56) similar to that of PMP-C (residues 11–20), which is also connected to the binding site by a disulfide bridge (Cys50–Cys87). However, the second disulfide bridge present in PMP-C (Cys17–Cys28) is missing, and the cysteines are replaced by His53 and Ser82, respectively. This local conformation is maintained by a similar hydrogen bond network, as described previously for PMP-C, where Asn51 and Thr83 side chains play the same role as Asn15 and Thr29 (Fig.3A).Table IIInter (top)- and intramolecular (bottom) hydrogen bonds at the reactive site in the complex PMP-C-chymotrypsinIntermolecular hydrogen bonds in the PMP-C/α-chymotrypsin binding siteAtom in α-chymotrypsinAtom in PMP-C at P5-P′3Distance (Å)Phe41 OAla32N3.0Gly193 NLeu30 O2.7Ser195 OGLeu30 N2.9Gly216NCys28 O3.0Gly216 OCys28N2.9Ser218 NAla26 O3.1Intramolecular hydrogen bonds that maintain the P5-P′4 segment of PMP-C in a rigid conformationAtom at P5-P′3 segmentAtom at residues 14 to 20Distance (Å)Ser25 OGly20N2.6Ala27 NArg18 O3.1Ala27 OArg18 N3.0Thr29NThr16 O3.2*Thr29 OG1Asn15OD12.8*Thr29 OG1Thr16 N3.2*Lys31 NAsn15 OD12.7*Lys31OAsn15 ND22.9 Open table in a new tab Figure 3A, close view of the hydrogen bond network between the binding loop and the internal segment for PMP-C (in atom-type color; see legend of Fig. 1A) and Ecotin (indark blue), with the four residues in PMP-C labeled.B, superimposition of the crystal structure (inyellow) and the 36 models from the NMR study (inblue) of PMP-C. The r.m.s.d. from superimposition are smaller than 1 Å for regions 3–11 and 16–28 and 1.8 and 2.4 Å for regions 12–15 and 29–35, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From P3 (Cys27) to P′2 (Gly31), the intermolecular interactions between PMP-D2v and α-chymotrypsin are are similar to those observed for PMP-C. The P1 residue of PMP-D2v (Leu29) is exactly in the same conformation as that of PMP-C. However, some differences are observed between the two inhibitors. The nature of the P′4 residue in PMP-D2v (Gln33 instead of Pro34) suppresses the stacking with Phe39. In addition, the hydrogen bond between Ser218 and Ala26 (P5) in PMP-C is not present in PMP-D2v. A water-accessible surface area of 946 Å2 is buried upon chymotrypsin binding to PMP-D2v (Fig. 2A). Beside the primary interaction site, composed of the binding loop (residues 25–33, 584 Å2) and the internal segment (residues 15–18, 108 Å2), PMP-D2v displays a secondary site (residues 20–24, 175 Å2). This region interacts with residues 172–175 of α-chymotrypsin through van der Waals contacts (Thr20–Trp172, Pro21–Gly173 and Thr174, Thr22–Gly173, Val24–Trp172). The structures of PMP-C and PMP-D2v were superimposed on each other (Fig. 2B), yielding an overall r.m.s.d. value of 0.7 Å for 17 residues (residues 8–17 and 27–33, according to PMP-C numbering). A large structural divergence, with deviations between Cα atoms higher than 5 Å, is observed for residues 4–7 and 18–27 (λ2 loop). Accordingly, PMP-C and PMP-D2v can be dissected into two structural subdomains as illustrated in Fig. 2B. On one hand, the so-called “subdomain I” is formed by residues 8–17 and 28–34, and these two regions are bound together by the disulfide bridge Cys14–Cys33 (numbering of PMP-C). The subdomains I of the two inhibitors carry the primary binding site and are therefore structurally similar. On the other hand, residues 4–7 and 18–27, which are linked together by the disulfide bridge Cys4–Cys19, constitute subdomains II. The structural divergences that characterize subdomains II may be caused by differences in λ2 loop, which is one residue shorter and possesses a Pro at position 21 in PMP-D2v. As a result, subdomain II of PMP-D2v is shifted closer to chymotrypsin and may be responsible of additional contacts (either favorable interaction or steric hindrance) and could therefore be considered as an element for discriminating between protease targets. PMP-C may be regarded as more permissive toward various enzymes, as also observed with S. gregariainhibitors (20Malik Z. Amir S. Pal G. Buzas Z. Varallyay E. Antal J. Szilagyi Z. Vekey K. Asboth B. Patthy A. Graf L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of bound PMP-C was compared with the free form (36 structures; Protein Data Bank code 1PMC), solved in solution by1H NMR (9Mer G. Hietter H. Kellenberger C. Renatus M. Luu B. Lefevre J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 158-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The β-sheets of the two structures superimpose well, with an r.m.s.d. smaller than 1 Å whereas two regions display larger deviations, λ1 loop (residues 12–15) and C terminus (residues 29–35), with r.m.s.d. values of 1.8 and 2.4 Å, respectively (see Fig. 3B). The NMR structures display an average r.m.s.d. of 0.33 (±0.14) Å for the backbone atoms of the well defined segments 3–11, 14–19, and 24–30 (calculation performed with 164 nuclear Overhauser effect-derived distances using the program X-PLOR) and below 1 Å for the regions 12–15 and 29–33. As the r.m.s.d. values from NMR study are smaller than the deviations resulting from NMR/x-ray structure superimposition, these latter may be considered as conformationally different in the regions 12–15 and 29–33. However, it should be pointed out that the conformation of region 29–33 was built from only four medium and long range nuclear Overhauser effects. Therefore, we believe that the scarcity of NMR data would rather account for more flexibility in this region. Our assumption is supported by the examination of PMP-D2. Although the superimposition of the free (20 structures) 3G. Mer, personal communication. and bound structures yields r.m.s.d. values similar to that of PMP-C (within 1 Å for the core and 1.3 and 2.1 Å for the loop λ1 and the C terminus, respectively), free PMP-D2v is globally less structurally defined than PMP-C, with NMR r.m.s.d. values in the range of 1–2 Å for loop λ1 and of 2–6 Å for C terminus region (residues 29–35). This demonstrates a clear tendency to flexibility in these regions. A scenario of events can therefore be put forward; Leu30(P1) penetrates deeply into the active site pocket S1 of the protease, followed by its neighbors Thr29 (P2) and residues 31–33, resulting in a rather rigid conformation of this stretch. The Cys14–Cys33 bridge, together with the hydrogen bond network involving Asn15 and Thr29, stabilizes residues 12–15. This cascade of events is supported by a detailed comparison of the main chain conformations of the P3-P′3 residues in bound and free PMP-C, in relation with the canonical values reported by Bode and Huber (1Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The dihedral angles of the binding loop in our study are in accordance with the canonical values whereas some given by the NMR study are not, in particular for the P1 and P′1 residues (Table III). We therefore infer that the disordered C terminus of free PMP-C achieves conformational stabilization upon chymotrypsin binding.Table IIIBackbone φ and ψ dihedral angles (°) from this study (first line), compared to the NMR study (9Mer G.

Open table in a new tab The values in bold are out of range. Such a hypothesis is supported by the example of Elafin, a potent elastase inhibitor. Its structure was studied in complexed (21Tsunemi M. Matsuura Y. Sakakibara S. Katsube Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11570-11576Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and free (22Francart C. Dauchez M. Alix A.J. Lippens G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) forms. The binding loop of the free inhibitor shows a high degree of flexibility, most of the φ and ψ angles being out of the range defined for a canonical conformation. In the crystal structure, the φ and ψ angles for P3 to P′3 residues fall in the defined range. We have determined the structures of two insect inhibitors in complex with bovine α-chymotrypsin. These inhibitors display a new fold, unrelated to that of other small serine protease inhibitors, and were recognized as the first members the grasshopper family (2Laskowski M. Qasim M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 324-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, PMP-C and PMP-D2 are the only insect serine protease inhibitors that were studied both in their free and bound forms. From crystal structure superimposition, it appears that they are composed of two subdomains. The first subdomain is structurally conserved and is responsible for the inhibition as it contains the primary interaction site. The binding loop (P5-P′4) is found in a canonical conformation and superimposes well with that of other inhibitors such as OMTKY3, Ecotin, and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (23Scheidig A.J. Hynes T.R. Pelletier L.A. Wells J.A. Kossiakoff A.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1806-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In locust peptides, the binding loop is maintained to an internal segment by a hydrogen bond network involving mainly the two conserved residues Asn15 and Thr29. This feature can be considered as a signature of the grasshopper family. The similarities reported in Ecotin strengthen this view, so we may consider that this “micro device” is contributing to the inhibitor mechanism. The second subdomain displays more variability in terms of sequence and structure. In PMP-D2v, it contains an additional interaction site with the protease that could be involved in the species selectivity. Indeed, PMP-D2 is not active toward porcine trypsin, whereas it is weakly and strongly active toward bovine and locust trypsins, respectively.1 Both x-ray and NMR structures of PMP-C show the binding loops in extended conformations. However, whereas the x-ray data account for a canonical conformation, the free inhibitor does not present the typical 310 helix conformation for the P1 residue. Thus we propose that the lock and key mechanism for serine protease inhibition (24Bode W. Huber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) is valid for locust inhibitors, where the flexible binding loop is seen as a “soft” preformed key that acquires its canonical conformation upon lock-enzyme binding. Until recently, there was a dearth of sequence and structure information about insect serine proteases, although a large number of insect inhibitors were characterized (25Eguchi M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 105: 449-456Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The only crystal structure of an insect proteolytic enzyme (ant chymotrypsin) was reported recently (26Botos I. Meyer E. Nguyen M. Swanson S.M. Koomen J.M. Russell D.H. Meyer E.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the context of the physiological targets of locust inhibitors, Lam et al. (27Lam W. Coast G.M. Rayne C.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 653-660Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) identified several forms of chymotrypsins and trypsins (28Lam W. Coast G.M. Rayne R.C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from the midgut of L. migratoria. Because we established the species selectivity of PMP-D2, further x-ray studies of locust protease·locust inhibitor complexes will be helpful in characterizing the peculiar structure of insect proteases and the structural requirements for inhibition. The preeminent feature of the recently sequenced insect genome ofDrosophila melanogaster was the high number of putative protease open reading frames (over 300 identified). Such potentially dangerous enzymes need to be handled carefully by insects along their development pathway, a task that might be devoted to the short peptides inhibitors described in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2320736068,"The p53 protein is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To ensure that cells under non-stressed conditions are able to grow, p53 sets up a negative feedback loop by inducing Mdm2. Mdm2 is able to both inhibit the transcriptional regulation by p53 and to degrade it, thus maintaining p53 inactive until it is required. The Mdm2 related protein, Hdmx, has also been shown to inhibit the transcriptional activation of p53 but is unable to degrade it. A few years ago, the p53 family member, p63 was identified. Like p53, p63 is able to induce p53 target genes and it was shown to be able to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In this study we report that, despite the similarities between p53 and p63, neither Hdmx nor Mdm2 are able to interact with p63, to repress p63-induced transcription or to affect its half-life."

To better understand the substrate affinity of these aspartic proteases, sequences were aligned with and/or three-dimensional, molecular models were constructed of the cathepsin D-like aspartic proteases of schistosomes and hookworms and of plasmepsins of Plasmodium falciparum andPlasmodium vivax, using the structure of human cathepsin D bound to the inhibitor pepstatin as the template.

Gwadz R.W. Hotez P.J. Knirsch C.A. Parasitic Diseases. 4th Ed. Apple Trees Productions, LLC, New York2000Google Scholar). Although phylogenetically unrelated, these parasites all share the same food source; they are obligate blood feeders, or hematophages. Hb from ingested or parasitized erythrocytes is their major source of exogenous amino acids for growth, development, and reproduction; the Hb, a ∼64-kDa tetrameric polypeptide, is comprehensively catabolized by parasite enzymes to free amino acids or small peptides. Intriguingly, all these parasites appear to employ cathepsin D-like aspartic proteases to make initial or early cleavages in the Hb substrate (2Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E.

The vertebrate endopeptidase, cathepsin D (EC 3.4.23.5), is a member of the aspartic protease category of hydrolases, which also includes renin, pepsin, chymosin, cathepsin E, HIV1 protease, and several other enzymes (5Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford1998: 801-805Google Scholar, 6Connor G.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford1998: 828-836Google Scholar). Cathepsin D is expressed in a diverse range of mammalian cells and tissues and is located predominantly in lysosomes (6Connor G.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford1998: 828-836Google Scholar). The molecule comprises two rather similar lobes, each incorporating a homologous Asp-Thr-Gly catalytic site motif, with the substrate binding groove located between these lobes. In aspartic proteases generally, the nucleophile that attacks the scissile bond of the substrate is an activated water molecule held in position by side chains of the two active-site aspartic acids (5Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford1998: 801-805Google Scholar). Well defined S4, S3, S2, S1, S1′, S2′, S3′, and S4′ subsite pockets for the amino acid side chains of the substrate (5Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Barrett A.J. Rawlings D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Oxford1998: 801-805Google Scholar) are additional hallmarks of these enzymes. A peptide analogue of microbial origin, pepstatin, is the definitive, general inhibitor of aspartic proteases (7Rich D.H. Bernatowicz M.S. Agarwal N.S. Kawai M. Salituro F.G. Schmidt P.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3165-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In general, human cathepsin D is specific for hydrophobic patches in proteins, with an ostensibly anomalous, additional preference for glutamate in the P2 position (8van Noort J.M. Alfons C.M. J.

An improved understanding of the substrate affinity of cathepsind-like proteases of blood-feeding parasites for Hb could facilitate the development of novel anti-parasite inhibitors. To this end, sequences or models of the cathepsin D-like aspartic proteases of schistosomes and hookworms and of plasmepsins of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax (PDB file 1QS8) were aligned with and/or three-dimensional, molecular models were constructed, using the structure of human cathepsin D bound to pepstatin (1LYB) (12Baldwin E.T.

Subsequently, the crystal structure of the peptidic inhibitor CH-66 complexed with mouse renin (1SMR) (13Dhanaraj V. Dealwis C.G. Frazao C. Badasso M. Sibanda B.L. Tickle I.J. Cooper J.B.

Nature. 1992; 357: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was used to build homology models of octapeptide substrates. The molecular models were then used to examine the similarities and differences among known substrate cleavage sites in mammalian Hb reported previously for the cathepsin D ofSchistosoma japonicum (4Brindley P.J. Kalinna B.H. Wong J.Y.M. Bogitsh B.J. King L.T Smyth D.L. Verity C.K. Abbenante G. Brinkworth R.I. Fairlie D.P. Smythe M.L. Milburn P.J. Bielefelt-Ohmann H. Zheng Y. McManus D.P. Mol. Biochem.

Commun. 1998; 246: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The models revealed that the difference in cleavage sites was due, in general, to a single amino acid alteration in the cleavage site (P4-P4′) that either enhances or diminishes the enzymatic activity. Molecular modeling of the mature forms of the target aspartic proteases was carried out on a Silicon Graphics work station using the Insight II software package from Molecular Simulations Inc. (San Diego, CA), as described previously for several papain-like, cysteine proteases (14Brinkworth R.I. Brindley P.J. Harrop S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The Insight II module, Homology, was used for the homology modeling. Homology operates by copying the backbone atoms and β-carbons from the template molecule to the model and adding the new side chains. Epitopes corresponding to α-helix or β-sheet in the template are assigned coordinates as structurally conserved regions, whereas other regions are assigned coordinates as designated loops. The Loop Search function was used to find suitable loops, from protein structures in the PDB data base, which have the correct number of residues and distance to bridge and in which the adjacent residues have the appropriate conformations.

In addition, the crystal structure of P. vivaxplasmepsin complexed with pepstatin (1QS8) was compared and contrasted with these models.

In the sequence alignments (shown below under “Results”; see Fig. 1), residues that have side chains participating in substrate binding pockets are indicated as the S5 to S4′ subsites, respectively.

Commun. 1996; 227: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were omitted, because they could not be modeled in this way. These proteases have three loops that differ from human cathepsin D, including the latter's cleaved hairpin loop, and the Loop Search function was used to assign possible coordinates for the loops of theSchistosoma cathepsin D proteases. The hookworm enzyme has an additional, unusual feature, two small loops, both of which are closed with disulfide bonds, Cys92-Cys97 and Cys210-Cys217. Although the function of the loops has not yet been determined, they do not appear to be structurally important for catalysis. A homology model was also built of human cathepsin D, based on itself, with the residues in the hairpin loop deleted and replaced by a single glycine. This was done so that docking with substrate peptides could be carried out similarly with all the other proteases. In each case, the model was minimized to a root mean square deviation of 0.000001, employing conjugate gradients using the Discover module of Insight II. Subsequently, the accuracy and validity of the models was tested with the Profiles 3D module of Insight II, which performs Eisenberg analysis (22Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2483) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mouse renin complexed with the peptidic inhibitor CH-66 (1SMR) (13Dhanaraj V. Dealwis C.G. Frazao C. Badasso M. Sibanda B.L. Tickle I.J. Cooper J.B. Driessen H.P.C. Newman M. Aguilar C. Wood S.P. Blundell T.L. Hobart P.M. Geoghegan K.F. Ammirati M.J. Danley D.E. O'Connor B.A. Hoover D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was used to build homology models of octapeptide substrates within the catalytic clefts of S. japonicum cathepsin D, human cathepsin D, and several other peptidases for which three-dimensional homology models had been constructed. CH-66 ist-butyl-CO-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu[CHOHCH2]Leu-Tyr-Tyr-Ser-NH2, and the complex of CH-66 within the active site groove of mouse renin is an informative example, with regard to the proteases and substrates targeted in this study, of an extended peptide (P5 to P4′) analogue bound to an archetypal aspartic protease. It was anticipated that this complex would indicate subsite binding pockets in human cathepsin D and homologous aspartic proteases. Loop Search was used to replace the P1 and P1′ isostere residues of the inhibitor with an extended dipeptide and to assign coordinates to the P1 and P1′ residues. The core and key substrate binding residues of mouse renin and human cathepsin D were superimposed using the α-carbons so that the peptidase and substrate models were in the same space coordinates to conserve the pattern of hydrogen bonding between the enzyme and the backbone peptide bonds of the substrate. For the mouse renin·CH-66 complex, the protease residues forming hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the inhibitor are Gly37, His79, Ser80, Gly81, Asp220, Gly222, Ser219, Ser222, and Thr200, whereas Asp35and Asp220 are the catalytic dyad of aspartic acids (numbering according to Fig. 1) (13Dhanaraj V. Dealwis C.G. Frazao C. Badasso M. Sibanda B.L. Tickle I.J. Cooper J.B. Driessen H.P.C. Newman M. Aguilar C. Wood S.P. Blundell T.L. Hobart P.M. Geoghegan K.F. Ammirati M.J. Danley D.E. O'Connor B.A. Hoover D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Notably, these are consistent with the hydrogen bonding between human renin and the inhibitor CP-85339 (13Dhanaraj V. Dealwis C.G. Frazao C. Badasso M. Sibanda B.L. Tickle I.J. Cooper J.B. Driessen H.P.C. Newman M. Aguilar C. Wood S.P. Blundell T.L. Hobart P.M. Geoghegan K.F. Ammirati M.J. Danley D.E. O'Connor B.A. Hoover D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The backbone atoms of human cathepsin D and mouse renin are not completely identical; differences in the conformations have been noted for the S3, S2′, and S3′ pockets (12Baldwin E.T. Bhat T.N. Gulnik S. Hosur M.V. Sowder R.C. Cachau H.R.F. Collins J. Silva A.M. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6796-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Dhanaraj V.

O'Connor B.A. Hoover D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These differences produce renin subsite pockets that are less open, giving rise to the narrow specificity of this enzyme. Renin also has a higher degree of secondary structure, with some longer stretches of α-helix and β-sheet. Nonetheless, the appropriate pair of enzyme and substrate was associated as an assembly and minimized with only atoms in the side chains remaining unfixed. In some cases, the correct rotamer for the side chain of the substrate residue had to be selected empirically to avoid major clashes with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate models were effectively docked with the peptidase models. Sequence alignments of the mature regions of the peptidases were prepared using Insight II software from Molecular Simulations Inc. and empirically refined by hand. Subsequently, to accommodate different colors, the alignment presented here was prepared using MacVector 6.5.3 software (Oxford Molecular) and edited manually to replicate the structural alignment generated with Insight II. Homology models were constructed of aspartic proteases complexed with the peptides KPIEF*FRL, FLSF*PTTK, LVTL*AAHL, and LDKF*LASV (where * represents the characterized or predicted scissile bond). FLSFPTTK, LVTLAAHL, and LDKFLASV are octapeptides found in α-chain of human Hb, as residues 33 to 40, 107 to 114, and 126 to 133, respectively. KPIEFFRL is a synthetic peptide known to be a high affinity substrate for human cathepsin D (23Beyer B.M. Dunn B.M. J. Biol.

The remaining sequences were aligned taking into account the positions of conserved Cys, Gly, and Pro residues, as well as aromatic and hydrophobic residues in structurally conserved regions.

Hydrolysis of Hb by S. japonicum cathepsin D involves a generally discrete set of cleavages for the α-chain, compared with cleavage sites for human cathepsin D, whereas these two enzymes share most of the same cleavage points for the β-chain (Fig. 2) (4Brindley P.J.

The orthologous sequences at these known cathepsin D cleavage sites for bovine, human, and canine Hb are also listed in Fig. 2, although this does not imply that those sites indicated for other substrate species will be cleavage sites for that particular enzyme in every case. This scheme does not reflect the relative importance of each cleavage site or their order. Further, some sites in the Hb α-chain are adjacent, including Leu105↓Leu106, Thr108↓Leu109, and Leu109↓Ala110; cleavage at any one of these would probably obviate cleavage at the vicinal sites. Perhaps the most striking of all these cathepsin D cleavage sites is FLSF↓PTTK (residues 33–40 of the human Hb α-chain), for schistosomal enzyme (4Brindley P.J. Kalinna B.H. Wong J.Y.M. Bogitsh B.J.

This is a high figure, indicating a high probability that the model is correct. The only site of possible misfolding is the loop 46–54, which is well clear of the substrate binding cleft.

The post-translational modifications of Bcl-2 are likely involved in the control of the apoptotic pathway. In the present study we have investigated the role of Bcl-2 in cellular response to oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) and cisplatin using a clone of human metastatic melanoma, which, in spite of Bcl-2 (over)expression, exhibited a moderate chemosensitivity. With both treatments melanoma cells died through an apoptotic process, associated with detachment of cells from the monolayer. In the floating apoptotic cells generated by either hydrogen peroxide or cisplatin, along with morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis, we detected a significant Bcl-2 cleavage, yielding the Bax-like fragment of 23 kDa. Preincubation of cells with the caspase-3/-7 inhibitor DEVD-CHO completely suppressed Bcl-2 cleavage, thus confirming that such a specific proteolysis requires activation of caspase-3/-7. The oxidant- and cisplatin-induced processing of Bcl-2 documented in the present study may represent a regulatory mechanism to circumvent the survival function of Bcl-2 upon apoptosis triggering and to enhance apoptotic response. Since the Bcl-2 cleavage should be regarded as a pro-apoptotic event, Bcl-2 expression is expected to increase susceptibility to apoptosis. Thus, such a pathway could be exploited to improve the efficacy of cytotoxic therapy of melanomas expressing Bcl-2."

These data provide robust support for the concept of an 8-chain (4-molecule) protofibril entity in IF. Further, their positions correspond to the axial displacements predicted for protofibrils in the different types of IF. Also, the data are consistent with intact IF containing four protofibrils. In addition, the positions of these novel cross-links suggest that there are multiple possible groupings of four molecular strands to form a protofibril, suggesting a promiscuous association of molecules to form a protofibril.

Over the years there has been much speculation about the manner in which the constituent molecules in these proteins pack together in three dimensions to generate the observed filamentous structures (1Squire J.M.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 285-291Google Scholar). The models proposed on the basis of x-ray diffraction patterns, electron micrographs, biochemical and other data have fallen into two general classes: those in which the largest structural unit is the individual molecule and those in which the molecules first aggregate to form a subfilamentous protofibrillar structure. In the former case the molecules pack in a regular or quasi-regular manner throughout the filament, and in the latter case the protofibrils in turn aggregate further to produce the intact filamentous structure. Although the concept of a protofibril is an attractive one and has received widespread acceptance in principle, there are, in fact, very few hard data that substantiate this idea. Attempts, for example, to observe protofibrils directly in muscle (12Luther P.K. Munro P.M.G. Squire J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 381-392Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), connective tissue (13Ruggeri A. Benazzo F. Reale E. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 68: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and IF (14Aebi U. Fowler W.E. Rew P. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) using transmission electron microscopy have not been convincing. The observed filamentous aggregates induced by chemical or physical means have not been reproduced easily, and neither have they had the appearance of specific aggregates. Low resolution x-ray fiber diffraction data obtained for fibrous proteins have been interpreted in terms of both classes of model (15Fraser R.D. B MacRae T.P. Rogers G.E. Keratins, Their Composition, Structure and Biosynthesis. Charles C Thomas, Springfield, IL1972Google Scholar), and it is probable that only through the acquisition and interpretation of much higher resolution data will we be able to resolve the issue in favor of one class of model over the other. Some indirect data, however, have provided support for the existence of protofibrils. For example, using electron microscopy, the diameters of fetal and neonatal collagen fibrils from transverse sections have been measured. In these tissues the fibril sizes are uniform, and this allows an accurate mean diameter to be determined. It has been shown that the values have a discontinuous distribution consistent with the quantization of fibril diameters (16Parry D.A.D. Craig A.S. Nature. 1979; 282: 213-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been argued that these data imply an underlying protofibril substructure. Likewise, scanning transmission electron microscopy studies on in vitro aggregates of various IF have provided evidence that assembly occurs in multiples of 8 chains (which has been defined as a protofibril) to produce IF in which there are 16, 24, 32, 40, or even more chains in section (17Steven A.C.

Each IF molecule contains a pair of chains that associate over their central, heptad-containing regions to generate a parallel, in-register, two-stranded coiled-coil. The rod itself comprises four coiled-coil segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) separated by three linker regions (L1, L12, L2). Although all IF chains are built the same way, subtle differences between them have allowed classification into several distinct types. In recent years cross-link data have been established for oligomeric assemblies of reduced and oxidized type Ia/IIa trichocyte keratin (27Wang H. Parry D.A.D. Jones L.N. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N.

These have documented four common modes of molecular registration assembly and have been designated A11, A22, A12, and ACN. The first three of these relate to antiparallel packing of two adjacent molecules that are half-staggered with their 1B segments largely overlapped (A11), half-staggered with their 2B segments largely overlapped (A22), and largely overlapped over their entire lengths (A12). The fourth mode, derived from the combination of the A11 and A22 modes, relates to parallel molecules in larger assemblies that have a head-to-tail overlap of about 8–10 residues. This occurs in all cases of reduced IF. In the case of oxidized trichocyte keratins of mature tissues such as hair, there is a 10-residue gap between similarly directed molecules (30Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because of realignment of the A11 mode during oxidation (27Wang H. Parry D.A.D. Jones L.N.

Genet. 1995; 22: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These four rules have allowed the construction of two-dimensional surface lattices for the packing of molecules in each of the IF types. However, the way in which the columns or assemblies of molecules fold in three dimensions into IF remains unresolved, although one widely speculated possibility is that four adjacent columns of molecules would define a protofibril (14Aebi U. Fowler W.E. Rew P. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Many of these insights have been obtained from cross-linking studies on intact IF or various subassemblies of them. On the other hand, detailed electron microscopic studies have likewise revealed several important kinetic steps by which IF of several types assemble in vitro(21Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 22Herrmann H. Aebi U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 11: 1416-1431Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Herrmann H. Aebi U.

Initially, a single protein chain assembles into a parallel in-register coiled-coil dimer molecule with another compatible chain. This is followed by the formation of a tetramer, or pair of molecules, aligned antiparallel and partly staggered in the A11 and/or A22 alignment modes. These two events presumably occur very rapidly in buffers of neutral pH and low ionic strength. On raising the ionic strength, these oligomerize very rapidly perhaps initially into 3- and 4-molecule species, and then into larger half- and full-width unit length filament (ulf) particles containing 8 or 16 molecules, respectively, or more (34Herrmann H. Haber M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35Herrmann H. Strelkov S.V. Feja B. Rogers K.R. Brettel M. Lustig A. Haner M. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Burkhard P. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 817-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The ulf are ∼70 nm long and 20 nm or more wide. Although the structure of ulf remains to be determined, it may consist of lateral arrays of molecules stacked side by side in alternating A11-A12-A22 alignments (36Steinert P.M. Curr. Problems Dermatol. 2001; 13: 193-198Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As for intact IF, the masses of ulf are polymorphic, implying that polymorphism is introduced at this level of IF assembly (22Herrmann H. Aebi U. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 11: 1416-1431Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Moreover, their masses quantize in units of 4 molecules, suggesting that if protofibrils exist, they originate at this level of assembly. The final stage of IF assembly in vitro is the end-to-end joining of ulf particles (34Herrmann H. Haber M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), presumably by docking into each other, thereby forming ACN interactions between the end of one molecule with the beginning of the next molecule in each axial row. This process occurs in a time frame of seconds to minutes. Also, the growing IF condense to a more uniform and narrower 10-nm diameter (34Herrmann H. Haber M. Brettel M. Ku N.O. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1403-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,35Herrmann H. Strelkov S.V. Feja B. Rogers K.R. Brettel M. Lustig A. Haner M. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Burkhard P. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 817-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus a protofibril might consist of a column of four rows of molecules. Likewise, the often postulated protofilament (14Aebi U. Fowler W.E. Rew P. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Herrmann H. Aebi U. Curr. Opin.

Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 279: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) might consist of a column of two rows of molecules, so that two protofilaments might constitute one protofibril. However, to date, no biochemical or microscopic data on unraveling IF have been obtained to support directly the existence of protofilaments or protofibrils in IF, or any other fibrous protein. This paper reports new data on the characterization of cross-links induced in reduced and oxidized trichocyte keratin, K5/K14 cytokeratin, and vimentin IF. We have now identified additional minor cross-links that have occurred between molecules four columns apart. The data afford direct evidence of the clustering of columns of molecules in groups of four and thus support the concept of a protofibrillar structure in IF. Mouse type Ia/IIa trichocyte chains were coassembled from bacterially expressed proteins (27Wang H. Parry D.A.D. Jones L.N. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These IF were also oxidized with the copper-phenanthroline reagent. Human type Ib/IIb K5/K14 cytokeratin IF were likewise coassembled from bacterially expressed proteins (37Wu K.C. Bryan J.M. Morasso M.I. Jang S.-J. Lee J.-H. Yang J.-M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3539-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For the keratins, the assembly buffer was 10 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 7.6) containing 5 mmreducing reagent tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). Finally, a human vimentin construct (kindly provided by Drs. H. Herrmann and R. D. Goldman) was used for bacterial expression. The purified type III vimentin was assembled in 2 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6) buffer containing 5 mm TCEP, 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.15 m NaCl. Samples of each of the above four IF (10–20 mg, at 40–60 µg/ml) were cross-linked with 0.4–0.5 mm disulfosuccinimdyl tartrate (DST), dried, and fragmented with CNBr and trypsin (27Wang H.

Peptides were resolved on a 150 × 2-mm C18 Nucleosil (120 Å pore size) HPLC column (Phenomenex, Torance, CA) using a 125-min extended acetonitrile gradient (see Fig. 1). Potential cross-linked peaks were identified by comparisons with uncross-linked proteins, recovered, and subjected to cleavage with 0.1 m sodium periodate. In this way, we recovered 20–30 cross-linked peptides from each IF sample, most of which were identical to those reported previously. However, an additional 6–15 reproducible and usually minor cross-linked peaks were identified and characterized further by sequencing. Seven of the cross-links of reduced trichocyte IF have been described previously (27Wang H. Parry D.A.D. Jones L.N. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previously, we have established methods for the identification and recovery of DST-induced cross-links in several types of IF (27Wang H. Parry D.A.D. Jones L.N. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol.

The procedures involve cross-linking through juxtaposed lysine residues of intact IF or subassemblies of them with the periodate-cleavable bifunctional cross-linking reagent DST (linker arm of 0.6 nm), and under mild conditions that allow IF assembly of the modified proteins. Subsequently, the cross-linked IF proteins were fragmented and the peptides resolved by HPLC. Comparisons of the peptide peaks before and after cross-linking revealed shifted peaks (0.02–0.3 mol/mol), which, after a reaction with periodate and sequencing, revealed two lysine residues that had been joined by the cross-linker. In this way, we have identified the four basic modes of alignments of neighboring rows of molecules common to all types of IF (A11, A22, A12, and ACN). In more recent studies on reduced type Ia/IIa trichocyte keratin IF, using a more efficient reducing reagent (TCEP) coupled with higher resolution HPLC programs, we recovered seven additional cross-links that could be explained only by linkages between columns of molecules four apart on a two-dimensional surface map (27Wang H. Parry D.A.D. Jones L.N. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1459-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These are listed in Table I. We then set out to examine whether such cross-links could also be identified in oxidized trichocyte IF as well as in type Ib/IIb cytokeratin and type III vimentin IF. Indeed, in each case, many quantitatively minor (0.02–0.001 mol/mol, the lowest level of resolution possible for subsequent protein sequencing analyses) shifted peptide peaks were recovered that had not been detected previously. Some new peaks were not reproducible between separate cross-linking experiments and did not contain cross-links and thus may represent protein chemical modifications of IF peptides which inevitably occur during the procedures. However, in each case, 11–14 minor peaks were reproducible in separate cross-linking experiments with different batches of proteins (Fig. 1). As these were cleavable with periodate, they were characterized further by sequencing.

L, link number. Open table in a new tab The new cross-link data all correspond to axial staggers between parallel molecules and relate directly to the predicted values of the axial projection (za) of the surface lattice dimension a (25Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 99-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The majority of the axial displacements correspond to about 80, 50, and 25 residues in a coiled-coil conformation for reduced trichocyte keratin and K5/K14 cytokeratin, oxidized trichocyte keratin, and the type III IF (25Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 99-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), respectively, and hence correspond to links between molecular “strands” (that is, assemblies or columns of head-to-tail overlapped molecules) that are four apart on the surface lattice. These observations are consistent with the concept of a structural unit with four molecular strands (8 chains) in cross-section. We term this unit the protofibril, to be consistent with many previous predictions and models. It is important to emphasize that the observed cross-link data for different IF types correspond to the particular value ofza predicted previously for that particular IF type. We have thus produced data for three unique IF systems thatindependently give rise to the same overall pattern of cross-links. This lends high credence to the structural significance of the results. Furthermore, for K5/K14 cytokeratin, oxidized trichocyte keratin, and vimentin we have also identified a number of cross-links that correspond to a parallel axial displacement that is either two times larger than za (∼160, 100, and 50 residues, respectively) or three times larger thanza (∼240, 150, and 75 residues, respectively) (Table I). We interpret this as arising from interactions between molecular strands that are 8 (two protofibrils) or 12 (three protofibrils) apart on the topological surface lattice. Once again, these data strongly imply the presence of a structural unit with four strands (8 chains) in cross-section. In addition to these observations, all available scanning transmission electron microscopy studies indicate that native IF contain 32 chains in cross-section (25Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 99-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Jones L.N. Simon M. Watts N.R. Booy F.P. Steven A.C. Parry D.A.D. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 68: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It follows from both sets of experimental data therefore that most native IF may contain four protofibrils in section. However, IF assembledin vitro are polymorphic, with masses/unit length consistent with 24–48 chains in section, which are usually multiples of 8 chains (17Steven A.C. Hainfeld J.S. Trus B.L.

Using these new cross-link data, we have further refined the parameters relating to the link lengths (where possible) and to the values of A11, A22, and A12 (Table II). These differ only in minor aspects from those data reported previously.Table IIRefined parameters defining the surface lattice structures of cytokeratins, reduced and oxidized trichocyte keratin, and type III IF typified by vimentinK1/5/10/14Reduced α-keratinOxidized α-keratinVimentinno linkers fixedL1, L12, and L2 fixedno linkers fixedza79.7478.1550.0023.89zb110.71112.18133.30139.53Repeat301.16302.51316.61302.95Overlap7.035.67−8.434.31A12−0.703.306.985.50A11−111.41−108.88−126.32−134.03A22189.75193.63190.28168.92L114.8414.8414.8411.47L1212.5712.5712.5711.99L24.774.774.777.79Δz(1BU, 1BD)−3.91−1.38−18.82−20.72Δz(2BU, 2BD)2.566.453.10−17.34Δz(1BU, 2D)−50.54−46.54−42.86−40.97 Open table in a new tab The numbers of interprotofibrillar cross-links observed are likely to correlate with the physical proximity of the protofibrils in the IF studied. Thus both one- and three-protofibril staggers would arise between protofibrils that were immediately adjacent to one another in a four protofibril-containing IF. The likelihood of finding cross-links corresponding to a two-protofibrillar stagger, however, would be expected to be somewhat lower because these protofibrils might be diagonally opposed and hence may not be as close spatially to one another. As regards the extent of protofibril overlap this would be smaller for those IF with large values of za(cytokeratin and reduced trichocyte keratin) than for those with small values of za (such as vimentin). The odds of observing an interprotofibril cross-link will be roughly proportional to the degree of overlap that exists between the protofibrils in question. Overall, we report here 30 cross-links for a one-protofibril stagger, 4 for a two-protofibril stagger, and 5 for a three-protofibril stagger (Table I). Qualitatively, these values are generally consistent with the factors listed above. It should also be pointed out that two of the common cross-links that denote links between adjacent antiparallel molecules in keratin IF (green arrows in Fig. 1D) have more than one structural solution (38Steinert P.M. North A.C. Parry D.A.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 19S-24SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar): they may link between parallel molecules one apart on the surface lattice. These are type II 1B-49 with type II 2B-23, and type I 1B-06 with type II 2B-63. These could represent intraprotofibril links. They may also be interpreted as links between two adjacent protofilaments, but the numbers of such cross-links are too small for a definitive assessment of this possibility. Our data summarized in Fig. 2 document that there are multiple possible choices for an association of rows of molecules to form protofibrils, especially in reduced keratin and vimentin IF. This arises from a consideration of the manner in which the cross-links can be interpreted structurally on a two-dimensional surface lattice drawing. Although all cross-links reported here arise between one column of head-to-tail overlapped molecules and a parallel one that is four columns (or a multiple) apart, closer inspection reveals another level of complexity. By taking any molecule on the two-dimensional surface lattice as a basis point, some of the new cross-links fit naturally to a parallel molecule four columns over, going left or right. About half, however, are not explained on this basis: it is necessary to move over left/right to an adjacent column (all links are displayed this way in Fig. 2) or go either up/down to the next molecule in a given column (see Fig.3B) to account for a linkage four columns over. In this case, at any point in the lattice all of the new cross-links can be resolved within a cluster of six laterally adjacent columns (Fig. 2). Considerations of how and at what level of IF hierarchy this arises are illustrated in Fig. 3. This is based on the realization that IF elongate by end-to-end joining of ulf entities. At the one ulf stage (Fig. 3A), the organization of four molecular strands into protofibrils is readily apparent from our new cross-linking data; the protofibrils would consist of strands 1–4 (shaded green) (denoted as protofibril a), 5–8 (b), 9–12 (c), and 13–16 (d). As an example, the K5 1A-31/K5 1B-61 cross-link (see item 1 of Table I) links rows 1 and 5 (blue lines in Fig. 3A), 5 and 9 (red), or 9 and 13 (pink). These respectively link protofibrils a to b, b toc, and c to d. However, at the two-ulf stage, there are multiple solutions for each cross-link datum (Fig.3B). Using the example above, the redcross-linkage joins rows 5 and 9 at one point, and rows 4 and 8 or rows 6 and 10 at other points, simply by moving over left or right to the next molecular strand or up and down to the next molecule on the two-dimensional lattice. This means that a protofibril could consist of rows 5–8 (shaded green, as above), or rows 3–6 (shadedyellow, denoted as protofibril a′), or rows 7–10 (yellow, b′). This level of potential complexity continues and extends as more ulf particles add to the elongating IF (not illustrated). Accordingly, there are multiple possible ways of gathering four elongated columns together to make a protofibril, and it seems likely that this grouping could change along the length of an IF. Hence, the association of molecules is potentially promiscuous. However, all of the available cross-links denoting a protofibril structure in oxidized trichocyte IF can be accounted for by the same set of four molecular strands (Fig. 2); that is, the grouping of four rows of molecules does not overlap so that promiscuity may not occur in this case. This may be because of extensive intraprotofibril disulfide bonding. Also, these considerations offer a simple explanation as to why no investigator has yet consistently observed an organized elongated pattern of protofibrils in unraveled IF: protofibrils may have limited axial coherence arising from the competing modes of molecular aggregation that are possible in vivo. The results presented here provide strong support for the protofibril concept in IF consisting of an 8-chain (4-molecule) entity. Because the α-helical chains in IF are right handed and the coiled-coil molecules are left handed, it is possible that the protofibrils (as regards their constituent molecular strands) will continue the alternation of hand and be right handed. Indeed, all of the images of unraveling IF reported to date display a right handed orientation (14Aebi U. Fowler W.E. Rew P. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Steinert P.M. Freedberg I.M. Goldsmith L.A. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Skin. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 113-147Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data indicate that protofibrils in reduced IF might retain their coherence for only a short distance axially, perhaps just for one or only a few molecules in length, because of the potentially promiscuous association of molecules."

Here, we have analyzed the mechanism governing Ca2+-induced secretion of von Willebrand factor stored in α-granules and 5-hydroxytryptamine in dense-core granules in permeabilized human platelets. Both secretions were dependent on ATP and cytosol. An essential factor for both granule secretions was purified from rat brain cytosol and identified to be protein kinase Cα (PKCα) by partial amino acid sequencing. Purified PKCα efficiently stimulated both secretions in the presence of cytosol, whereas PKCα alone did not support the secretion of either type of granules, suggesting that PKCα is not a sufficient factor. Finally, in human platelet cytosol fractionated by a gel filtration column, the stimulatory activity for dense-core granule secretion paralleled with the concentration of PKC, suggesting that PKC could also be such a stimulatory factor in platelet cytosol. Thus, we identified PKCα as an essential, but not sufficient, cytosolic factor for the Ca2+-induced secretions of both α- and dense-core granules in platelets.

Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and syntaxin 4 and SNAP 23 function in the α-granule secretion (11Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified small GTPase Rab4 as an essential regulator of α-granule secretion, but not of dense-core granule secretion, using the assay system used in this investigation (12Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to membrane-associated factors such as SNARE proteins and Rab small GTPases, cytosolic factors also play critical roles in intracellular membrane docking/fusion (13Avery J. Jahn R. Edwardson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For example, Rab5-regulated membrane docking/fusion of early endosomes in vitro is cytosol-dependent and the rate-limiting factor in cytosol was demonstrated to be a protein complex composed of a Rab5 effector, Rabaptin-5, and a Rab5 GDP/GTP exchange factor, Rabex-5 (14Horiuchi H.

The Ca2+-induced norepinephrine release from neuroendocrine cells also requires cytosolic factors, including the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (15Hay J.C. Martin T.F. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (16Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19637-19640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), a mammalian homologue of Caenorhabditis elegans unc31. However, cytosolic factors involved in the platelet secretion have not been identified. Protein kinase C (PKC) family members are important signaling molecules (19Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Conventional PKCs have regulatory Ca2+- and phorbol ester-binding domains (19Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The function of PKC as a signaling molecule has been analyzed mainly pharmacologically using small cell-permeable compounds of inhibitors and stimulators such as phorbol esters. Recently, Munc13-1, which contains a phorbol ester-binding domain, has been demonstrated to play an important role in membrane docking/fusion in exocytosis in synapses (21Betz A. Ashery U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Sudhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 22Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Nature. 1999; 400: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Specifically, we do not understand whether the effects of phorbol ester are mediated by Munc13 and/or PKC. Therefore, the interpretation of the earlier reports with experiments using phorbol ester has become complicated especially concerning vesicle transport. Furthermore, since PKC increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration through modulation of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane in neurons (23Swartz K.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 305-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), it remains a question whether PKC acts upstream and/or downstream of increase of Ca2+. In platelets, PKC inhibitors have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and granule release, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a phorbol ester, have been shown to stimulate both functions (25Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Sawamura M. Hoshijima M. Fujikura T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6701-6704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Siess W. Lapetina E.G. Biochem.

Therefore, PKC has been considered to be an important signaling molecule in platelet activation (7Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Hoffman R.S., S. Benz E.J. Furie B. Cohen H. Silberstein L.E. Hematology: Basic Principles and Practice. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingston, New York2000: 1741-1752Google Scholar). However, with reasons described above, further characterization of PKC function in platelet activation is required especially in the granule secretions. Here, we have demonstrated that the Ca2+-induced secretions of α- and dense-core granules in platelets are ATP- and cytosol-dependent and that PKCα is an essential, but not sufficient, cytosolic factor for both secretions. The standard assay method was essentially as described previously (12Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly obtained washed platelets (5 × 107platelets per assay, counted with Coulter counter) were incubated with [3H]5-HT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to allow uptake into dense-core granules. After washing the platelets, the platelet plasma membrane was permeabilized in Buffer A (50 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 78 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, the calculated free calcium ion concentration was ∼20 nm (28Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar)) containing 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.6 µg/ml SLO as described (12Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Approximately, more than 80% of the cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase was recovered in the media by the procedure, measured with lactate dehydrogenase-cytotoxic test kit (Wako Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Usually, the permeabilized platelets per assay contained ∼20,000 cpm of [3H]5-HT. Unless otherwise specified, the platelets were incubated in Buffer A containing 4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with an ATP regeneration system containing 8 mm creatine phosphate, 50 µg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 1 mm ATP, cytosol, and/or others at 4 °C for 60 min followed by further incubation at 30 °C for 5 min. Finally, the platelets were stimulated with 20 µm Ca2+(28Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar) by addition of CaCl2 at 30 °C for 1 min. Then, after removing the platelets by centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatant containing any secreted [3H]5-HT and vWF were measured for the presence of [3H]5-HT by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman) and of vWF by Western blot analysis after immunoprecipitation with anti-vWF antibody (Sigma) followed by quantification using densitometric detection and NIH Image software. Secretion levels of vWF and [3H]5-HT were expressed as percentages of the total vWF and [3H]5-HT, respectively, above those (3–8% of total vWF and 5–10% of total [3H]5-HT) released before the final incubation. Unless otherwise specified, they were expressed as mean ± S.E. of more than five independent experiments with similar results. For vWF secretion, representative Western blots were also shown in some figures. Fifty rats were anesthetized and sacrificed. The rat brains were homogenized in Buffer A using a Potter-type blender and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as rat brain cytosol. The cytosols of Jurkat cells and HeLa cells were prepared in a similar way. The cytosol of human platelets isolated from blood of healthy volunteers was prepared in a similar way except using sonication instead of a Potter-type blender. The purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C and column chromatography was performed using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The assay during the purification was carried out with rat brain cytosol at 0.5 mg of protein/ml, which supported 5–10% secretions over the controls (Fig. 7). In each purification procedure (TableI), the activity for both α- and dense-core granule secretions was recovered in a single peak which supported both α- and dense-core granule secretions. The rat brain cytosol was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The precipitate was dialyzed against Buffer A without KCl. The peak was recovered in a 35–55% precipitate. The fraction was loaded onto a Mono-Q HR 10/10 column equilibrated with Buffer A without KCl, and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl. The peak of the activity was recovered at around 100 mm KCl. The collected fractions were dialyzed with Buffer A (pH 6.5) without KCl and loaded onto a Mono-S HR 5/5 equilibrated with buffer A (pH 6.5) without KCl, and eluted with a linear gradient of KCl. The peak of the activity was recovered at KCl concentration around 150 mm. The collected peak fractions were then concentrated with Centricon 10 (Amicon) and separated by Superdex 200 gel filtration column in Buffer A. The peak of the activity was recovered between the protein markers (Bio-Rad) of 44 and 158 kDa. The collected peak fractions were added with KCl to adjust the KCl concentration at 2 m. Then the sample was loaded onto a hydrophobic-interaction column, Resource PHE, equilibrated with Buffer A containing 2 m KCl, and eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of KCl. The peak of the activity was recovered at a KCl concentration around 250 mm. For the characterization of PKCα, the samples purified by the last column Resource PHE were used as purified PKCα. By using this procedure, a protein band at 80 kDa was purified to homogeneity in a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and the intensity was paralleled with the secretion activity. The band was excised and analyzed for partial amino acid sequencing by Edman's method (29Edman P. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 8: 211-255PubMed Google Scholar) performed by Apro Science Co. (Tokushima, Japan). For the characterization of the human platelet cytosol, the cytosol was separated with the Superdex 200 gel filtration column in the same way as described above.Table IPurification of vesicle secretion activating factorStepFractionProteinSpecific activity1-aOne unit was defined as secretion of 1% [3H]5-HT from platelets per assay per min.Total activityPurificationRecoverymgunits/mgunits × 10−3-fold%1Cytosol14001351891.0100.02Ammonium sulfate 35–55%455156711.237.73Mono-Q511110578.330.24Mono-S106106.04.53.25Superdex 2002.028705.7213.06Resource PHE0.686205.1642.7Ca2+-induced [3H]5-HT secreting activity of all fractions was assayed under conditions in the presence of ATP and 0.5 mg of proteins/ml of rat brain cytosol.1-a One unit was defined as secretion of 1% [3H]5-HT from platelets per assay per min.

The cytosolic domain of junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated by PKC (30Ozaki H. Ishii K. Arai H. Horiuchi H. Kawamoto T. Suzuki H. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged partial cytosolic domain of JAM (JAM290) (20 nm) containing the PKC phosphorylation site (30Ozaki H. Ishii K. Arai H. Horiuchi H. Kawamoto T. Suzuki H. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was incubated for 1 min at 30 °C with 1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (300 cpm/pmol), 1 µm okadaic acid, and 20 µm Ca2+ in the presence or absence of permeabilized platelets, purified PKCα, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Then, the GST-JAM290 was collected with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The phosphorylation levels of the JAM290 were analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Anti-vWF rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, anti-PKCα rabbit polyclonal antibody used for Western blot analysis was from Santa Cruz, anti-PKCα mouse monoclonal antibody used for immunodepletion was from Transduction Laboratories, and a control mouse IgG from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, which were used as secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unless otherwise specified, all the chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except Gö6850 (bisindolylmaleimide 1) which was from Calbiochem Co. and streptolysin-O (SLO) from Dr. Bhakdi, Mainz University, Mainz, Germany. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford's method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) or densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained band of SDS-PAGE, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. We established an in vitro assay system using SLO-permeabilized platelets by monitoring secreted vWF stored in α-granules and [3H]5-HT in dense-core granules (12Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is well known that agonists drive the granule secretions by increasing intracellular calcium ion concentrations in platelets (32Knight D.E. Hallam T.J. Scrutton M.C. Nature. 1982; 296: 256-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since the calcium ion concentration inside the platelets would be the same as that of the outside following permeabilization, we used calcium chloride as a stimulus. Therefore, we analyzed the secretion mechanism triggered by increased Ca2+. In the assay, secretions of α- and dense-core granules appeared physiological, since the characterization of the secretions revealed similar time course and Ca2+sensitivity to those in intact platelets (12Shirakawa R. Yoshioka A. Horiuchi H. Nishioka H. Tabuchi A. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33844-33849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Without addition of ATP, Ca2+ did not induce α-granule secretion (vWF) or dense-core granule secretion ([3H]5-HT) (data not shown) (33Knight D.E. Scrutton M.C. Thromb. Res. 1980; 20: 437-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Haslam R.J. Davidson M.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 174: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), indicating that ATP is essential for both secretions. The permeabilized platelets were extensively depleted of cytosol since more than 80% of lactate dehydrogenase, a cytosolic protein, was recovered in the media following permeabilization (data not shown). Under this condition, Ca2+ did not induce α- (Fig.1A) or dense-core (Fig.1B) granule secretion without addition of exogenous cytosol, even in the presence of ATP. On the other hand, the Ca2+-induced secretions of both types of granules were efficiently reconstituted by addition of both ATP and rat brain cytosol (Fig. 1, A and B). The efficient secretions were also confirmed morphologically with electron microscopy, since most of the granules in the permeabilized platelets disappeared upon Ca2+ stimulation in the presence of ATP and cytosol (data not shown), as shown previously (35Sloan D.C. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results indicated that both ATP and cytosolic factor(s) are essential for the Ca2+-induced secretions in platelets. The cytosol dependence indicated the presence of essential cytosolic factor(s) for the secretions. Cytosols of human fibroblast cell line, HeLa cells, and human T-cell cell line, Jurkat cells, also supported the Ca2+-induced secretions of both granules (data not shown), suggesting that the essential cytosolic factor(s) are expressed ubiquitously among various species and tissues. The cytosol dependence prompted us to identify the essential factor(s) in the cytosol. The Ca2+-induced secretions of both vWF and [3H]5-HT were almost maximal in the presence of rat brain cytosol at 2–5 mg of protein/ml (Figs. 6 and 7). In order to maintain minimal secretory activity, the assays during the purification procedure were performed in the presence of rat brain cytosol at 0.5 mg of protein/ml, which supported ∼5–10% of both secretions induced by Ca2+ (Figs. 6 and 7). We first separated rat brain cytosol by Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Fig. 2A). We detected a potent peak of secretion supporting activity between markers 44 and 158 kDa (Bio-Rad) (Fig. 2A). Notably, the peaks for α- and dense-core granule secretions were almost completely overlapped, suggesting that the factor is common for both secretions. Then, we scaled up the purification procedure. The purification was performed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and sequential column chromatography with Mono-Q, Mono-S, Superdex 200, and Resource PHE columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” During each procedure (Table I), the most potent activity for either α- or dense-core granule secretion was recovered in a single peak. Then, the peaks of both α- and dense-core granule secretions were almost completely overlapped in each column chromatography (data not shown). In Superdex 200 gel filtration column chromatography, the peak fraction emerged at a position between 44 and 158 kDa (data not shown), similar to the results in experiments of the direct separation of the cytosol by Superdex 200 (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, a band with apparent molecular mass at ∼80 kDa was purified to homogeneity after the fifth step of Superdex 200 column chromatography (Table I). Furthermore, the active fractions were collected and fractionated by a hydrophobic interaction column, Resource PHE. The secretion-supporting activities for both granules again paralleled the 80-kDa band (data not shown). The molecular weight was consistent with the results in the Superdex 200 gel filtration column chromatography for direct separation of rat brain cytosol (Fig. 2A). Taken together, the 80-kDa protein was most likely the essential common factor for both secretions. The partial amino acid sequences of the purified 80-kDa protein excised from the SDS-PAGE gel after the Resource PHE column chromatography (Fig. 2B, lane 6) were determined by the Edman's method (29Edman P. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 8: 211-255PubMed Google Scholar). The determined sequence IARFF, LIPMDPNGL, and IRSTLNPQW completely corresponded to the sequences of rat PKCα 38–44, 182–191, and 214–222, respectively (36Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5199-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since all three sequences corresponded to parts of the rat PKCα sequence, the 80-kDa protein was determined to be PKCα which was a conventional type of PKC composed of 672 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 76.6 kDa (36Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5199-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Gö6850, a PKC inhibitor, concentration dependently inhibited the Ca2+-induced secretions of both types of granules in the permeabilized platelets (Fig.3, A and B). Gö6850 at 10 µm almost completely inhibited both secretions (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, when PKCα was immunodepleted from the purified samples with anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody-coated beads (Fig.4A), the immunodepleted samples lost the secretion stimulatory activity for both types of granules (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, PKCα was identified to be an essential factor in rat brain cytosol for the Ca2+-induced secretions of both α- and dense-core granules in platelets.Figure 4The purified PKC α sample immunodepleted with anti-PKCα antibody (A) lost the stimulatory activity of the Ca2+-induced secretion of α- (B) and dense-core (C) granules.A, the purified PKCα samples (lane 1) were immunodepleted with an anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody (lane 2) or a control mouse IgG (lane 3). Then, the samples were analyzed by Western blot with anti-PKCα polyclonal antibody.B and C, the permeabilized platelets were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in the presence of 0.5 mg of protein/ml rat brain cytosol and the ATP regeneration system with the purified PKCα (40 nm) (lane 2), the purified PKCα after immunodepletion as shown in A (lanes 3 and4) or without purified PKC (lane 1). The platelets were then stimulated with 20 µmCa2+ for 1 min at 30 °C and released vWF (B) and [3H]5-HT (C) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown were mean ± S.E. in five independent experiments. The inset immunoblot (B) is one of the typical results for measuring the released vWF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined whether the added PKCα was activated in the assay. The PKC activity in the assay was monitored by phosphorylation levels of GST-JAM290, which contained a PKC-dependent phosphorylation site (30Ozaki H. Ishii K. Arai H. Horiuchi H. Kawamoto T. Suzuki H. Kita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) of JAM, a cell-cell adhesion molecule (37Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar,38Ozaki H. Ishii K. Horiuchi H. Arai H. Kawamoto T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 553-557PubMed Google Scholar). GST-JAM290 was hardly phosphorylated by the permeabilized platelets alone without the purified PKCα (Fig.5, lane 3). On the other hand, the purified PKCα alone weakly phosphorylated GST-JAM290 (Fig. 5,lane 4). The phosphorylation level of GST-JAM290 was strongly enhanced in the presence of both purified PKCα and permeabilized platelets (Fig. 5, lane 5) to the similar level obtained in the experiments with the purified PKCα, permeabilized platelets, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a PKC activator (Fig. 5, lane 1). These results suggested that the exogenously added PKCα was indeed activated in the assay by Ca2+ and the permeabilized platelets. Since PKCα is activated by Ca2+ in the presence of activators such as phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol (19Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the permeabilized platelet membrane could substitute for the activators. In another set of experiments, 10 µm Gö6850 completely inhibited Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of GST-JAM290 in the presence of permeabilized platelets (data not shown). Since Gö6850 at 10 µm also inhibited platelet secretion as shown in Fig. 3, catalytic activity of PKC could be required for secretion. We characterized the purified PKCα in the Ca2+-induced secretions in permeabilized platelets. First, we examined the amount of PKC remaining after permeabilization by Western blot analysis. Since we detected very little PKC associated with the permeabilized platelets after the procedure (data not shown), most of the PKC in the platelets appeared to be lost by diffusion through holes in the plasma membrane. Second, we carefully determined the PKC concentration in rat brain cytosol by Western blot analysis using purified PKCα as a control. The PKC concentration in the ra"
https://openalex.org/W2036308386,"Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase RET have been identified as the aetiological factor for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A). MEN2A is a dominantly-inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, a tumour of the calcitonin-producing thyroid C-cells. There are three isoforms of RET: RET9, RET43 and RET51, and although in vitro evidence suggests they vary in cellular transformation activities, little is known about their function in tumorigenesis in vivo. To address this, we used RET51 cDNA to construct mice in which the most frequent MEN2A mutation, Cys-634-Arg, was expressed under the control of the human calcitonin promoter (CT-2A mice). These mice developed C-cell tumours resembling human MTC and follicular tumours resembling human papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) depending on the founder line examined. One founder line developed compound MTC/PTC at low frequency (8%) and pancreatic cystadenocarcinoma. CT-2A mice also displayed a developmental defect in thyroid follicular structure, in which much of the thyroid was occupied by large irregular cystic follicles thought to be derived from the ultimobranchial body, a developmental precursor of the thyroid gland. The CT-2A mice will provide a suitable model to further study the effects of the MEN 2A RET mutation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1483845992,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiaepheromone, α-factor (WHWLQLKPGQPMY), and Ste2p, its G protein-coupled receptor, were studied as a model for peptide ligand-receptor interaction. The affinities and activities of various synthetic position-10 α-factor analogs with Ste2p expressing mutations at residues Ser47 and Thr48 were investigated. All mutant receptors were expressed at a similar level in the cytoplasmic membrane, and their efficacies of signal transduction were similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Mutant receptors differed in binding affinity (Kd) and potency (EC50) for gene induction by α-factor. One mutant receptor (S47K,T48K) had dramatically reduced affinity and activity for [Lys10]- and [Orn10]α-factor, whereas the affinity forSaccharomyces kluyveri α-factor (WHWLSFSKGEPMY) was increased over 20-fold compared with that of wild-type receptor. In contrast, the affinity of [Lys10]- and [Orn10]α-factor was increased greatly in a S47E,T48E mutant receptor, whereas the binding of the S. kluyveriα-factor was abolished. The affinity of [Lys10]- and [Orn10]α-factor for the S47E,T48E receptor dropped 4–6-fold in the presence of 1 m NaCl, whereas the affinity of α-factor was not affected by this treatment. These results demonstrate that when bound to its receptor the 10th residue (Gln) of the S. cerevisiae α-factor is adjacent to Ser47 and Thr48 residues in the receptor and that the 10th residue of α-factors from two Saccharomycesspecies is responsible for the ligand selectivity to their cognate receptors. Based on these data, we have developed a two-dimensional model of α-factor binding to its receptor. The Saccharomyces cerevisiaepheromone, α-factor (WHWLQLKPGQPMY), and Ste2p, its G protein-coupled receptor, were studied as a model for peptide ligand-receptor interaction. The affinities and activities of various synthetic position-10 α-factor analogs with Ste2p expressing mutations at residues Ser47 and Thr48 were investigated. All mutant receptors were expressed at a similar level in the cytoplasmic membrane, and their efficacies of signal transduction were similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Mutant receptors differed in binding affinity (Kd) and potency (EC50) for gene induction by α-factor. One mutant receptor (S47K,T48K) had dramatically reduced affinity and activity for [Lys10]- and [Orn10]α-factor, whereas the affinity forSaccharomyces kluyveri α-factor (WHWLSFSKGEPMY) was increased over 20-fold compared with that of wild-type receptor. In contrast, the affinity of [Lys10]- and [Orn10]α-factor was increased greatly in a S47E,T48E mutant receptor, whereas the binding of the S. kluyveriα-factor was abolished. The affinity of [Lys10]- and [Orn10]α-factor for the S47E,T48E receptor dropped 4–6-fold in the presence of 1 m NaCl, whereas the affinity of α-factor was not affected by this treatment. These results demonstrate that when bound to its receptor the 10th residue (Gln) of the S. cerevisiae α-factor is adjacent to Ser47 and Thr48 residues in the receptor and that the 10th residue of α-factors from two Saccharomycesspecies is responsible for the ligand selectivity to their cognate receptors. Based on these data, we have developed a two-dimensional model of α-factor binding to its receptor. G protein-coupled receptor transmembrane domain high performance liquid chromatography [3H-Pro8,Nle12]α-factor trifluoroacetic acid wild type G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 comprise a broadly distributed class of transmembrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to extracellular signals such as light, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Upon activation, GPCRs interact with a cytoplasmic heterotrimeric G protein, leading to the exchange of GTP for bound GDP and dissociation into its subunits, which in turn activates diverse pathways mediated by molecules such as protein kinases, adenylate cyclase, phospholipases, and ion channels (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 167-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GPCRs contain a common structural pattern consisting of seven hydrophobic segments that are predicted to form transmembrane helices. A detailed knowledge of the structure of GPCRs will be required to understand the determinants of ligand binding and the mechanism by which binding leads to activation of the cytoplasmic G protein. Except for a recent crystallographic structure of rhodopsin (3Placzewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar), the difficulty of obtaining, purifying, solubilizing, and crystallizing integral membrane proteins has hindered the application of x-ray crystallography to all other GPCRs. The size of the GPCR membrane complex prevents application of high resolution NMR procedures to solve the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. However, insights into the structural basis underlying the biological function of the GPCRs have come from the analysis of mutant receptors, either site-directed or chimeric, where large stretches of residues are swapped for those of a related receptor. Mutant receptors have been used to examine several aspects of receptor functions including post-translational modifications, G protein coupling, and, of most relevance to us, ligand binding. The tridecapeptide α-factor pheromone (WHWLQLKPGQPMY) ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae induces conjugation in yeast by binding to Ste2p, its cognate GPCR, activating a G protein signal pathway that is highly conserved with mammalian signaling pathways (4Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This peptide has been studied extensively as a model for understanding the biochemistry of mammalian peptide hormones. 1H NMR studies on this peptide indicate that the Lys7-Gln10 residues assume a β-turn structure and that this conformational feature is an important factor in the bioactive state of the molecule (5Jelicks L.A. Naider F. Shenbagamurthi P. Becker J.M. Broido M.S. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 431-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Gounarides J.S. Broido M.S. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This structural feature has been supported by further studies of covalently constrained (7Yang W. McKinney A. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and peptidomimetic analogs (8Zhang Y.L. Marepalli H.R. Lu H.-F. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12465-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent systematic investigation of the importance of the side chain functionality of α-factor using l-Ala and d-Ala scanning of its primary sequence pinpointed residues or segments with dominant roles in forming the biologically active conformation of α-factor (residues 7–10), in receptor binding (residues 10–13), and in receptor activation and signal transduction (residues 1–4) (9Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L. Lu H.-F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Peptide Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The structure and function of the α-factor receptor (Ste2p) have been studied extensively. Analysis of constitutively active mutants indicated that residues in the sixth transmembrane domain (TM6) play a key role in receptor activation (10Konopka J.B. Margarit M. Dube P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6764-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Sommers C.M. Martin N.P. Akal-Strader A. Becker J.M. Naider F. Dumont M.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6898-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Studies of the intracellular domains of the receptor have demonstrated that the third intracellular loop is important for G protein activation (12Clark C.D. Palzkill T. Botstein D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8831-8841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies also indicated that the cytoplasmic C terminus is involved in down-regulation of receptors by endocytosis (13Schandel K.A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7245-7255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and desensitization of receptors by phosphorylation (14Chen Q. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the results of the functional studies described above, results from cysteine cross-linking experiments between TM5 and TM6 (15Dube P. DeCostanzo A. Konopka J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26492-26499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) defined the spatial proximity of these domains of the receptor, and a biophysical study of synthetic peptides corresponding to each TM of Ste2p (16Xie H. Ding F.-X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.-F Arshava B. Arevalo E Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) provided evidence for the heptahelical nature of this GPCR. Taken together the above studies indicated that, despite a lack of sequence similarity among the GPCR family members, there is a remarkable similarity in the overall structure and function of these receptors. Despite numerous studies concerning the structure and function of α-factor pheromone or its receptor, very few studies have focused on the identification of the ligand binding sites. Although no information has been published yet on determinants involved in ligand binding to the α-factor receptor, a few recent studies provided valuable information for identifying the α-factor binding sites. In an α-factor receptor containing a mutation in TM1 (F55V), [d-Ala10]α-factor was an agonist with a good binding affinity, whereas the affinities of α-factor and several antagonists (modified or truncated at the N terminus of α-factor) were decreased by 10–100-fold (17Abel M.G. Lee B.-K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because [d-Ala10]α-factor did not bind to the wild-type receptor (9Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L. Lu H.-F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Peptide Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that one aspect of the binding of α-factor to the receptor involved interactions of the C terminus of the pheromone (residues 10–13) with the extracellular part of TM1. Additional information for identifying α-factor binding sites has come from the study of chimeras of the S. cerevisiae andSaccharomyces kluyveri α-factor receptors. The α-factor receptors from these two related species exhibit 50% overall identity to each other (18Marsh L. Herskowitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The S. kluyveri α-factor pheromone (WHWLSFSKGEPMY) shows identity to the S. cerevisiaeα-factor at 8 of 13 residues (19Egel-Mitani M. Hansen M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Using chimeras of these two α-factor receptors, Sen et al. (20Sen M. Marsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sen M. Shah A. Marsh L. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) identified small extracellular regions that determined the specificity of ligand binding and/or receptor activation. Residues 47–49 (STV in S. cerevisiae and KKI in S. kluyveri α-factor receptor) at the junction between the N-terminal domain and TM1 were found to control binding specificity and were proposed to be a direct contact region with one or more of the five variant residues of the two α-factors (residues 5–8 and 10). In light of these chimera studies, a turn structure in residues 7–10 of α-factor, and potential interactions between the C terminus of α-factor and TM1, we hypothesized that the 10th residue of α-factor interacts with residues 47–48 of the receptor. To test this hypothesis, we constructed receptors with mutations in this region and tested the binding affinities and biological activities of these constructs with α-factor and its analogs in which the 10th residue was substituted by various functional groups. The yeast strain used in the study, LM102, has been described by Sen and Marsh (20Sen M. Marsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 968-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relevant genotype is MATa, bar1, leu2,ura3, FUS1-lacZ::URA3,ste2-dl (the α-factor receptor coding region deletion). LM102 was used as the recipient of the wild-type and site-directed mutant STE2, and used to measure pheromone-induced growth arrest (halo assay) and pheromone-induced gene expression (lacZ assay) and to determine pheromone binding. The strain carried the bar1 mutant allele inactivating the BAR1 protease that is responsible for degradation of α-factor. The wild-type STE2 gene with a native promoter was cloned into a yeast/bacterial shuttle vector, pGA314.WT (17Abel M.G. Lee B.-K. Naider F. Becker J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 12-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and was used as a template for the site-directed mutagenesis of the α-factor receptor gene. This plasmid carries the TRP1 gene as a selectable marker and is a low copy CEN-based plasmid. Single-stranded phagemid DNA of pGA314.WT was prepared by infecting Escherichia coli strain CJ236 (ung−,dut−) carrying pGA314.WT with the helper phage M13KO7 (22Vieira J. Messing J. Methods in Enzymology. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single-stranded phagemid DNA was constructed as described by Kunkel et al. (23Kunkel T.A. Sabatino R.D. Bambara R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The product of the mutagenesis reaction mixture was transformed intoE. coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.), and transformants were selected on ampicillin-containing plates. Plasmids were then isolated from transformants using the Wizard Miniprep kit (Promega). After sequence confirmation, constructs were transformed into yeast strain LM102 (ste2-deletion strain), and transformants were selected by their growth in the medium lacking tryptophane. All primers were purchased from Sigma/Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Sequences of the primers are: 5′-GCAAGGTTTAGTTAACAAGACTGTTACTCAGGCC for the S47K mutation; 5′-GCAAGGTTTAGTTAACAGTAAGGTTACTCAGGCC for the T48K mutation; 5′-GCAAGGTTTAGTTAACAAGAAGGTTACTCAGGCC for the S47K,T48K double mutation; and 5′-GCAACCTTTAGTTAACGAGGAGGTTACTCAGGCC for the S47E,T48E double mutation. DNA sequencing was carried out in the DNA sequencing facility located on the campus of the University of Tennessee. l-Norleucine, which is isosteric withl-methionine, was incorporated at position 12 to replacel-methionine in all the analogs. This replacement was shown previously to result in an analog with activity and binding affinity equal to that of native pheromone (24Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solid-phase syntheses of five analogs (Table I) were carried on an Applied Biosystems 433 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) starting withN-α-9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-Tyr(OtBu)-Wang resin (0.65 mmol/g resin, Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY). The synthesis of α-factor, [Asp10]α-factor, and [Glu10]α-factor were described previously (7Yang W. McKinney A. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 0.1-mmol FastMoc chemistry of Applied Biosystems was used for the peptide chain elongation with a 2-(H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexaflourophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole/diisopropylethylamine-catalyzed single coupling using 4 equivalents of protected amino acid and a 30-min coupling time followed by an Ac2O/N-hydroxybenzotriazole/diisopropylethylamine capping (10 min). The N-α-protected peptide resin was washed thoroughly with 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and dichloromethane and dried in vacuo for 2 h. The cleavage was carried out in a mixture of TFA, crystalline phenol, ethane-1,2-dithiol, thioanisole, and water at room temperature for 1.5 h. After the evaporation of trifluoroacetic acid under reduced pressure, the residue was precipitated and thoroughly washed with ethyl ether and extracted into 20% aqueous acetonitrile. The crude peptide was purified by reversed phase HPLC (Hewlett-Packard Series 1050) on a semipreparative Waters Bondapak C18 (19 × 300-mm) column. The cleavage product was applied to the column and eluted with a linear gradient of water and acetonitrile, both containing 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid from 0 to 55% acetonitrile. The fractions were collected and analyzed on an analytical Waters μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm). The fractions of more than 99% homogeneity were combined and lyophilized, and purity was judged with analytical HPLC using two different solvent systems and with high performance capillary electrophoresis (Hewlett-Packard 3D-CE model G1600A). A molar extinction coefficient of 13,500 at 280 nm was used for measuring peptide concentration throughout the study.Table IPhysico-chemical properties of position 10 analogsPeptideK(a)1-aK′ is defined as (Vp − Vf)/Vf, where Vp is the elution volume for the peptide, andVf is the break-through volume.

Open table in a new tab Synthetic [Nle12]α-factor was labeled by the reduction of dehydroproline containing α-factor by the TR3 hydrogenation procedure of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech as described previously (24Raths S.K. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unpurified labeled peptide (dissolved in ethanol/water 1:1) was dried in vacuo, redissolved in sterile water, and purified by HPLC using a Waters μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm) on a Beckman System Gold HPLC. The peptide solution was injected into the HPLC and eluted with a water/acetonitrile gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile. Fractions containing peptide eluting from the column similarly to unlabeled α-factor (elution at 32.3% CH3CN) were collected and counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter. All collected fractions were dried, resuspended in storage buffer (1 mm methionine, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid, and 20% ethanol), andcombined, and the concentration and specific activity of the purified labeled peptide were determined. Yeast nitrogen base medium (Difco) without amino acids (SD medium) supplemented with histidine (20 μg/ml), leucine (30 μg/ml), and methionine (20 μg/ml) was overlaid with 4 ml of cell suspension (2.5 × 105cells/ml of Nobel agar). Filter disks (sterile blanks from Difco), 8 mm in diameter, were impregnated with 10-μl portions of peptide solutions at various concentrations and placed onto the overlay. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24–36 h and then observed for clear zones (halos) around the disks. The data were expressed as the diameter of the halo including the diameter of the disc. All assays were carried out at least three times with no more than a 2-mm variation in halo size at a particular amount applied for each peptide. The data were plotted as halo size versus the amount of peptide and linearized by regression analysis. To compare the relative activities of different peptides with different receptors, the amount of peptide producing a halo size of a particular size was determined from the regression line. NaCl (1 m) was added to the medium and peptide solution to test the effect of high salt on the growth arrest assay. Halo size was measured after 48–60 h incubation because of the slow growth rate of the culture in the presence of 1m NaCl. S. cerevisiaeLM102 carries a FUS1-lacZ gene that is inducible by mating pheromone. Cells were grown overnight in SD medium at 30 °C to 5 × 106 cells/ml, washed by centrifugation, and grown for one doubling (hemocytometer count) at 30 °C. Induction was performed by adding 0.5 ml of peptide at various concentrations to 4.5 ml of concentrated cells (1 × 108 cells/ml). The mixtures were vortexed and placed at 30 °C with shaking for 2 h. After this time, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and each pellet was resuspended and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (expressed as Miller units) in triplicate by a modification (25Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) of a standard protocol (26Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). EC50 and Emax values were calculated with a 95% confidence interval using GraphPad Prism software (sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting, variable slope). Each experiment was carried out at least three times with the results similar in each assay. Saturation and competition binding assays were performed using tritiated α-factor. In general, cells were grown overnight at 30 °C and harvested at 1 × 107cells/ml by centrifugation at 5000 × g at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were washed two times in ice-cold YM-1 medium (9Abel M.G. Zhang Y.L. Lu H.-F. Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Peptide Res. 1998; 52: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and resuspended to 4 × 107 cells/ml. The competition binding assay was started by the addition of [3H]α-factor and various concentrations of nonlabeled α-factor analogs (140 μl) to a 560-μl cell suspension such that the final concentration of radioactive peptide was 6 × 10−9m (20 Ci/mmol). Analog concentrations were adjusted using UV absorption at 280 nm and the corresponding extinction coefficients. After a 30-min incubation, triplicate samples of 200 μl were filtered and washed over glass fiber filtermats using the Standard Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments, Sterling, VA) and placed in scintillation vials for counting. NaCl (1 m) was added to all the solutions and media to test the effect of high salt on the binding affinity of α-factor analogs. In saturation binding assays, various concentrations of radioactive α-factor were added to cell suspension. Specific binding was determined by subtracting counts associated with the LM102 (ste2 deletion) strain from counts bound to the strains harboring wild-type or mutant receptors. Each experiment was carried out at least three times with similar results. Nonspecific binding of labeled α-factor to filters in the absence of cells was less than 20 cpm. Data curves were fitted from at least eight triplicate data points with GraphPad Prism software (nonlinear regression, one site competition or saturation). TheKi values were calculated by using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (28Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12256) Google Scholar), where Ki = EC50/(1 + [ligand]/Kd). The goal of this study was to determine whether the side chain of the 10th residue of α-factor (Gln) binds to Ste2p via interactions with residues 47 and 48 of this GPCR. The approach used was to carry out parallel modifications by site-directed mutagenesis of Ser47 and Thr48 in the receptor and synthetic modification of Gln10 of the α-factor tridecapeptide. The sequences of the targeted region of the receptor and synthetic α-factor analogs are represented in Fig.1. Analogs of α-factor containing polar (Asn and Ser), cationic (Lys and Orn), and anionic (Asp and Glu) replacements of Gln10 were assembled using solid-phase procedures on a Wang resin. All peptides were purified by HPLC and were >99% homogeneous in two HPLC systems. The synthetic peptides had the expected amino acid ratios, the calculated mass within ±1 Da, and intact Trp residues as confirmed by ultraviolet spectroscopy (Table I). Using site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”) Ste2p mutant receptors containing either S47K (this mutant receptor is designated KT to denote the amino acids in the 47th and 48th positions), T48K receptor (designated SK), S47K,T48K receptor (designated KK), or S47E,T48E receptor (designated EE) in place of Ser47,Thr48 of the wild-type receptor were generated. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and no other substitutions in the receptor were uncovered. The [3H]α-factor binding properties of the wild-type and mutant receptors were analyzed by a saturation binding assay using whole cells. The Kd value for the EE receptor (6.5 ± 1.4) was equivalent to that of the wild-type receptor (Table II and Fig. 2). The affinity of [3H]α-factor was decreased ∼5-fold in the KK receptor and decreased about 3- and 2-fold in the KT and SK receptors, respectively. As judged by the Bmax values, all receptors were expressed at the cell surface in approximately equivalent numbers. These results suggest that mutation in this region of the receptor does not drastically alter the binding of α-factor to the receptors or the facility of the receptor to reach the membrane and assume a structure competent for ligand recognition.Table IIBinding parameters for wild-type and mutant α-factor receptors with [3H]α-factorReceptorKdBmaxnmBinding sites/cellWT(ST)6.8 ± 1.544,408 ± 3,360KK37.0 ± 4.237,503 ± 1,464EE6.5 ± 1.436,404 ± 2,564KT20.5 ± 3.350,825 ± 2,873SK15.7 ± 2.746,384 ± 2,013Saturation binding curves were determined using whole cells carrying wild-type or mutant receptors (Fig. 2).

Open table in a new tab Saturation binding curves were determined using whole cells carrying wild-type or mutant receptors (Fig. 2). Kd andBmax values, calculated using a one-site model, are presented as the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments. Each determination was performed in triplicate. The induction of growth arrest of S. cerevisiae LM102 by α-factor was measured using a halo assay on agar plates. The data were analyzed using linear regression analysis, and the relative amount of α-factor needed to cause a 10-mm halo was determined. This assay indicated that, compared with wild-type Ste2p, the EE mutant receptor was ∼30% more sensitive to α-factor (TableIII). The KK receptor was significantly less sensitive requiring more than twice as much pheromone to induce a 10-mm halo. Compared with wild-type Ste2p the KT and the SK receptors were only slightly reduced in sensitivity to pheromone. In a solution assay that measured gene induction by the signaling cascade, the concentration of α-factor required to cause 50% induction of theFUS-lacZ gene was nearly equal for the wild-type and EE receptor and was 4-, 2-, and 2-fold higher for the KK, KT and SK receptors, respectively (Table IV and Fig. 3). The KK, KT, SK, and EE receptors all triggered a maximum gene induction approximately equal to that of wild-type Ste2p. The bioassays indicate that all mutations result in receptors that signal (Emax) as efficiently as wild-type Ste2p and that the potency (EC50) of signaling by these receptors correlates well with pheromone binding.Table IIIRelative growth arrest activity of α-factor and α-factor analogs for wild-type and mutant receptorsAnalogs testedReceptorsWT(ST)KKKTSKEEα-factor100 ± 63-a0.22 μg of α-factor were required for"

https://openalex.org/W2040426504,"The Cbl proto-oncogene product is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of stimuli. Cbl and the Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase both bind to SH3 domains from the SH2/SH3 adaptor Nck, and are candidate effectors for Nck function. Numerous additional SH2- and SH3-domain-mediated interactions are also possible between Cbl, Abl, and Nck. We find that these three signaling proteins associate when overexpressed in mammalian cells and can regulate each other's activity. Co-expression of wt Cbl together with c-Abl, the activity of which is normally repressed in vivo, led to extensive Abl-dependent phosphorylation of Cbl. The major proline-rich region of Cbl was required for its phosphorylation by c-Abl, but not by a constitutively activated Abl mutant, suggesting Cbl activates c-Abl by engaging its SH3 domain. Efficient phosphorylation of Cbl and its stable association with Abl required the SH2 domain of Abl, suggesting that SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions prevent dissociation of active Abl from Cbl. We also show that overexpression of Nck could repress the phosphorylation of Cbl by Abl in vivo. Studies with Nck mutants suggested that the Nck SH2 domain is responsible for inhibiting the activity of Abl toward both Cbl and Nck itself, most likely by competing with the Abl SH2 for tyrosine-phosphorylated binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2026369900,"To gain better understanding of the molecular alterations responsible for the aggressive growth potential of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive breast cancers, we utilized an expression cloning strategy to seek gene products that mediate the EGF-independent growth of human breast cancer cells. A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed from the EGFR-positive SUM-149PT cell line, and transduced into growth factor-dependent human mammary epithelial (HME) cells. Recipient cells were functionally selected for their ability to proliferate in serum-free, EGF-free medium. Library cDNAs were recovered from EGF-independent colonies by PCR amplification or by biological rescue. Clone H55a#1 contained a library insert encoding amphiregulin. This EGFR ligand was able to confer EGF independence when transduced into HME cells. SUM-149PT and H55a#1 cells overexpressed amphiregulin transcripts, and secreted moderate EGF-like activity in conditioned media, indicating a possible autocrine loop. EGFR membrane levels and constitutive phosphorylation were consistent with this hypothesis, as well as the sensitivity of the cells to an ErbB-specific kinase inhibitor. Expression of the WT1 Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, a transcriptional activator of amphiregulin, did not parallel amphiregulin transcript levels, suggesting that another factor regulates amphiregulin in SUM-149PT. Our data confirm the importance of amphiregulin in the etiology of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1985435115,"The Drosophila segment polarity genefused encodes a putative protein-serine/threonine kinase, and plays a critical role in the signal transduction for Hedgehog (Hh)-dependent gene expression. We show that theDrosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cell line has the potential to transduce the Hh-triggered intracellular signals, leading to the activation of target gene expression, when a transcription factor, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), is provided exogenously. Using S2 cells transfected with the Ci-expressing plasmid and a patchedpromoter reporter construct, we demonstrate that the forced expression of Fused (Fu) stimulates Hh-triggered and Ci-dependent transcriptional activation. The N-terminal kinase domain of Fu is required for this activity, but the C-terminal domain is not. Two kinase-inactive Fu mutants fail to enhance the reporter activation, indicating that the kinase catalytic activity is essential for this function. Negative components of the Hh-signaling pathway, Costal-2 and Suppressor of Fused, strongly antagonize the Fu activity, irrespective of the presence or absence of the Fu C-terminal domain, suggesting an indirect mechanism for the inhibition of Fu by these proteins. Furthermore, mutational analyses of threonine 158 and serine 159, in the activation segment of the Fu protein kinase, indicate that threonine 158 is essential for Fu activity and that phosphorylation of this threonine residue may be involved in the activation of the kinase catalytic activity upon Hh stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1550469113,"5-HT3 receptors possess a number of highly conserved proline residues. We changed each of these to alanine, expressed the mutants as homomeric 5-HT3Areceptors in HEK293 cells, and analyzed them with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. Mutation of Pro56, Pro104, Pro123, and Pro170 resulted in ablation of radioligand binding, whereas mutation of Pro257 and Pro301 did not. Only the latter were expressed at the plasma membrane but were non-functional. Thus the former, which are in the N-terminal domain, may be involved in forming correct receptor structure, while those in the transmembrane region (Pro257 and Pro301) are necessary for the function of the protein. To explore the conformational preference (propensity) of these residues we examined the proportion ofcis-prolines and the influence of adjacent residues in known protein structures. 4.7% of prolines in the protein data base were in the cis conformation, and the distribution of amino acids adjacent to cis-prolines was not randomly distributed. Comparison of the proportion of each amino acid residue adjacent to acis-proline revealed that aromatic and bend-facilitating residues were favored while those with β-branched chains were not. Thus five residues (Gly, Pro, Tyr, Trp, Phe) and three residues (Pro, Tyr, Phe) were found more frequently than expected before and aftercis-prolines respectively, whereas five residues (Val, Ile, Leu, Asp, Thr) and two residues (Asp, Glu) were found less frequently. Of the 20 proline residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit only Pro170 has adjacent residues that are favorable. Mutating these to non-favorable residues resulted in ablation of ligand binding, whereas replacement with alternative favorable residues did not. We therefore propose that Pro170, which is part of the characteristic cys-loop found in this family of proteins, may be in the cis conformation. 5-HT3 receptors possess a number of highly conserved proline residues.

These receptors are pentamers and are usually constituted of 2–4 different subunits each with a large extracellular N-terminal region and four putative transmembrane domains (M1-M4). Two 5-HT3 receptor subunits, 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B, have been identified so far, and receptors can function as either homo-oligomeric 5-HT3Aor hetero-oligomeric 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunit complexes (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 2Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Evidence from early biochemical and mutagenesis studies on nACh receptors indicated that the extracellular N-terminal domain contains the ligand binding site, and this has been confirmed by the construction of a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal domain of the α7 neuronal nACh receptor subunit linked to the C-terminal portion of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit; the resulting chimera possessed nACh receptor pharmacological properties and 5-HT3 receptor channel properties (3Eisele J.-L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Recently the high resolution structure of a protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nACh receptor has been determined (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is less well understood but there is good evidence from a variety of studies that the second transmembrane domain, M2, lines the channel. To date, however, details of the complete structure of the receptor are lacking (5Corringer P.J. Le Novere N Changeux J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Examining LGIC receptor subunit sequences shows that there are a number of highly conserved proline residues. Recently the role of the conserved proline in the M1 domain of the 5-HT3A receptor has been examined (6Dang H. England P.M. Farivar S.S. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1114-1122PubMed Google Scholar) and was shown to be critical for the function of the protein; replacing it by any other amino acid resulted in a non-functional receptor. However, replacing it by a series of unnatural amino acids that possessed the restricted H bonding capabilities of proline restored function, indicating that it is this property that is critical. Currently however, the structural contribution and functional significance of the other conserved proline residues remain unknown. To examine their role we have changed each of the six conserved proline residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit (Fig.1) individually to alanine. The resulting mutants have been expressed in HEK293 cells and characterized with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. The data suggest that all of the conserved proline residues play an important role in the structure and/or function of the receptor. Proline is also interesting because this residue exists in proteins in the cis conformation, as compared with the more usual trans conformation, at much higher proportions than is found for other amino acids; this can significantly affect the structure of the protein. Cis peptides do occur for other amino acids (7Jabs A. Weiss M.S. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) but are rare. The cis form of proline probably has a very specific structural role in proteins:cis-proline is the second most conserved residue type, the first being half-cystine (8Sali A. Overington J.P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1582-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). It is not known which, if any, of the prolines in the LGIC family are in the cis conformation, but it does seem likely that both forms are present in the mature protein; a recent study shows that a peptidylprolyl isomerase is involved in posttranslational folding and/or assembly in 5-HT3 and α7 nACh receptors (9Helekar S.A. Char D. Neff S. Patrick J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Peptidylprolyl isomerases catalyze the rotation of the prolyl peptide bond between the cis and trans conformations, an isomerization that is known to be rate-limiting in the folding of a number of proteins. Previous studies (10MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 11Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol.

Biol. 1990; 214: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) have indicated that certain amino acid residues may be more favorable than others in stabilizing a cis-proline. We therefore decided to examine the proportion of residues adjacent tocis-prolines identified from the current protein data bank (PDB) (13Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar) to gauge the possibility that one or more of the conserved proline residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit may exist in the cis configuration. These data, combined with mutagenesis studies to convert the adjacent residues to favorable or non-favorable alternatives, suggest that Pro170 may be in the cis conformation. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured on 90-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium/F12 (1:1) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Mutant 5-HT3A receptor subunits were developed using the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Abingdon, U.K.) containing the complete coding sequence for the 5-HT3A(b)subunit from NIE-115 cells as previously described (14Hargreaves A.C Taylor C.W. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis reactions were performed using the Kunkel method (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For transfections HEK cells at 60–70% confluency (∼48 h postpassage) were transfected with wild type (WT) or mutant plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (16Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For radioligand binding studies cells were grown on 90 mm plates (Falcon) and harvested 3 days after transfection. For electrophysiology experiments cells were grown on 35-mm plates and recordings performed 1–4 days posttransfection. In immunofluorescence experiments cells were grown on 22-mm diameter glass coverslips in 35-mm plates and stained 3 days posttransfection. Transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature; all subsequent steps were carried out at 1–4 °C. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) containing the following proteinase inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 50 μg/ml bacitracin and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Harvested cells were washed in HEPES/proteinase inhibitors and frozen at −20 °C. After thawing, they were washed twice with HEPES buffer and resuspended, and 50 μg of cell membranes were incubated in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing 1 nm [3H]granisetron (81 Ci/mmol, DuPont) for single point binding or concentrations ranging from 0.05 nm to 2 nm for saturation studies; 1 μmd-tubocurarine was used to determine nonspecific binding. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration using a Brandel cell harvester onto GF/B filters presoaked for 3 h in 0.3% polyethylenimine followed by two rapid washes with 4 ml of ice-cold HEPES buffer. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6000sc). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin standards. Data were analyzed by iterative curve fitting (GraphPad, PRISM, San Diego, CA) according to the equation: B = (Bmax[L]n)/([L]n+ Kn), where B is bound radioligand,Bmax is maximum binding at equilibrium,K is the equilibrium dissociation constant, [L] is the free concentration of radioligand and n is the Hill coefficient. Transfected cells were washed with three changes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH7.4, 0.9% NaCl) and fixed using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB: 66 mm Na2HPO4, 38 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2). To label the N-terminal domain pAb120 antiserum (17Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used at 1:1000 dilution in TBS. Intracellular receptor expression was determined by inclusion of 0.3% Triton X-100 for membrane permeabilization. Primary antibody incubation was overnight at 4 °C. In some studies a commercially available antiserum, serotonin 5-HT3 receptor Ab1 (Oncogene Research Products) raised against the M3-M4 loop was also used. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer's instructions. Coverslips were mounted in vectashield mounting medium (Vector) and immunofluorescence was observed using a Nikon optiphot microscope. All cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. except fetal calf serum, which was from Sigma. [3H]Granisetron (81 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont (Stevenage). All other reagents were of the highest obtainable grade. This was performed largely as previously described (18Deane C.M. Allen F.H. Taylor R. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, a set of 1010 PDB chains with a resolution better than 2.5 Å (no NMR structures were included) and pair-wise identity less than 20% were extracted from the PDB. The ω, φ and ψ dihedral angles of all the residues in this set were calculated. Cis peptide bonds were identified as those where the ω dihedral fell between −20 and 20°. The number and type of amino acid following cis and trans residues were compared. Ramachandran propensity plots were generated for the cis residues themselves and their preceding and following residues. This process was repeated for the trans residues. Significance values for the fractional occurrence of residues before and after cis-prolines were calculated using χ2; P values of < 0.05 were taken to be statistically significant. Single point binding assays were carried out for each mutant transiently expressed in HEK293 cells but showed no specific binding. Simultaneous transfection of the WT 5-HT3A receptor subunit resulted in high levels of specific ligand binding. To determine whether the mutants were correctly oligomerized and expressed at the plasma membrane, their localization was studied using an antiserum specific for the N terminus of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit, pAb120. No labeling was observed in cells transfected with the Pro56 → Ala-containing mutant, whereas in cells transfected with mutants containing Pro104 → Ala, Pro123 → Ala, and Pro170 → Ala, labeling was observed only in permeabilized preparations (Fig. 2). Pro56is close to the region where the antisera was raised, which suggests that rather than not being expressed the mutant protein may have a local change in conformation that prevents antisera recognition. Examination of the Pro56 → Ala-containing mutant using a commercially available M3-M4 loop antiserum also resulted in no labeling; however, neither was labeling observed for WT receptors, suggesting that this antiserum was not suitable for immunofluorescence experiments. Specific binding of [3H]granisetron revealed Kd values of 0.27 ± 0.05 nm and 0.20 ± 0.07 nm(mean ± S.E., n = 3) for cells transfected with Pro257 → Ala- and Pro301 → Ala-containing mutants, respectively; these values are similar to those obtained from WT (Kd = 0.23 ± 0.04 nm,n = 4). Examination of the mutant receptor localization using pAb120 showed that they were both expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 2). However, the mutant receptors appeared to be non-functional; neither of them, when expressed in HEK293 cells and analyzed using whole cell patch clamp (as described in Ref. 19Sepulveda M.-I. Lummis S.C.R. Martin I.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), showed any response to 5-HT (≤1 mm). 550 cis peptide bonds were identified in the PBD using the conditions specified above, which was 0.033% of all residues examined. However, when considering only proline residues, the data revealed that 4.7% of proline residues were cis. The Ramachandran plots in Fig.3 show that the φψ dihedrals of the 486 residues prior to a cis-proline reside in the β region. Similarly the residues prior to the non-proline cis amino acids were also found in this region of the plot. The fractional occurrence of each residue before a cis-proline as compared with before a trans-proline is shown in Fig.4 using 9650 trans-proline residues. The data demonstrate that there are five residues (Gly, Pro, Tyr, Trp, and Phe) found more frequently than expected before acis-proline, with five residues being found less frequently (Val, Leu, Ile, Asp, and Thr). A similar plot for those residues located immediately following a cis-proline shows that there are only three residues whose occurrence is greater than expected (Pro, Tyr, and Phe) and two residues (Asp and Glu) whose occurrence is less. Low numbers precluded using this analysis for the non-proline cis residues; these data are shown in Fig.5.Figure 4Comparison of the proportion of residues located before or after a cis-proline. Data for cis residues was compared with that obtained fortrans-residues. 1 represents equivalent proportion of residues found before cis (BC) and before trans (BT) in graph A or equivalent proportion of residues found after cis (AC) and after trans (AT) in graph B. * significantly different to 1, χ2, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5The number of all non-Pro cis residues and the residues that precede and follow them. Residues were identified from the PDB as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pro170 was identified as being surrounded by residues that we observed to exist more frequently than expected adjacent to cis-prolines, and we therefore considered these as ‘favorable' residues. To further explore if these adjacent residues (Phe169 and Phe171) affected the expression of the receptor, we changed them to alternative favorable (Gly or Pro, respectively) or non-favorable (Ile or Asp, respectively) residues and transfected the resultant mutant receptor subunit DNA into HEK293 cells. Radioligand binding revealed that replacing the adjacent Phe with Gly (Phe169) or Pro (Phe171) resulted in radioligand binding, while changing them to Ile or Asp, respectively ablated such binding (Fig.6). Gly and Ile were chosen as suitable examples of residues found more or less frequently, respectively, before cis-prolines as they are significantly different in that they lack the aromatic ring of Phe, yet are residues that would not be expected to significantly change the characteristics of the protein. Unfortunately such residues were not available to substitute for Phe171. To identify the functional roles of conserved proline residues in the cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels, we substituted these residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit with alanine (Fig.1). The pharmacology, electrophysiology, and localization of the altered receptors were examined using the HEK293 cell expression system. The data we have presented suggests that the four proline residues in the N-terminal domain are critical for the correct receptor assembly and/or the structure of the ligand binding site, while those located in the transmembrane region are necessary for the correct function of the receptor. We also examined the propensity of the prolines to exist in the cis or trans conformation and these data suggest cis-prolines have a significantly higher probability of being preceded by glycine, proline, or an aromatic amino acid and be followed by proline, tyrosine, or phenylalanine. Changing the phenylalanine residues that are adjacent to Pro170 provided data that support our hypothesis that this proline may be in the cis conformation. The presence of four conserved proline residues in the N-terminal, ligand binding domain of LGICs (Fig. 7) suggests that even though different neurotransmitters activate the different proteins, the basic structure is similar, and our data confirm that all of these proline residues play an important role in the structure and/or assembly of the 5-HT3 receptor. Several of the residues that surround these conserved prolines are themselves conserved, especially those surrounding the proline located in the disulfide loop region (Pro170), which is characteristic of this protein family; indeed the name cys-loop is frequently used to distinguish it from other LGIC families. The least conserved proline is Pro104, which is not found in the 5-HT3Bsubunit. This residue is also not conserved in some non-agonist binding subunits in other members of the family, e.g. the nACh γ and δ subunits and the glycine receptor B subunit (20North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand- and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton1995Google Scholar), suggesting it may be of particular importance in the neurotransmitter-binding subunit. The immunological studies show that the Pro104 → Ala, Pro123 → Ala, and Pro170→ Ala mutants are expressed but no receptors reach the plasma membrane, suggesting that the subunits either cannot form their correct structures, cannot assemble successfully, or cannot reach the membrane. The fact that the mutant proteins are recognized by the antisera favors one of the latter two hypotheses, and indeed these are supported by previous studies on the nACh receptor where the proline in the cys-loop (equivalent to Pro170) was changed to glycine (21Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31479-31484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant receptors could either not assemble properly (if the mutation was in the β or γ subunits) or could not reach the membrane (if the mutation was in the α or δ subunits). The data we extracted from the PDB show that 4.7% of prolines are in the cis conformation. This value is similar to previously reported values of 5.7% (10MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) and 5.2% (11Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, given that there are 20 prolines in the 5-HT3Areceptor subunit, the probability is that ≤ 1 are in the cis conformation. The factors that determine whether a proline is in the cis or trans conformation are not yet fully understood but include both the three-dimensional fold of the protein (it has been shown that a residue can be forced into the cis conformation when acis-proline is replaced by another amino acid) and the characteristics of the neighboring amino acid residues (10MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 11Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol.

Our data reveal that aromatic residues are favored to precedecis-prolines, which is not observed for cis bonds in general (Fig. 4), but has been reported in previous work and may be because thecis-proline is stabilized by a C–H to π interaction (10MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 11Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol.

Glycine and proline were also found to precede cis-prolines in higher proportions than expected. Ascis-proline always causes a turn, an adjacent bend-facilitating residue is likely to be favored. The high occurrence of these residues preceding cis prolines has also been previously observed (10MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 11Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Conversely our PDB analysis showed that residues with β-branched chains (Val, Thr and Ile) are not favored before cis-prolines, as previously reported, and that may be because the steric bulk of the side chain hinders trans/cis isomerization (11Pal D. Chakrabarti P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). There have been fewer studies on the roles of amino acid residues immediately following cis-prolines and indeed both our and previous data suggests that these residues play a less important role than those that precede cis-prolines. Our data showed that two aromatic residues were favored, which may help stabilize thecis-proline as discussed above. Proline was also favored, presumably because it facilitates a bend as described above. Considering the results from our data and the number of prolines in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit, this protein is unlikely to contain more than one cis-proline, and interestingly only one of the proline residues is adjoined by favorable amino acids; Pro170 is surrounded by phenylalanines. Changing these adjoining residues to non-favorable residues results in ablation of radioligand binding, indicating that the receptors are not correctly formed and/or assembled, whereas changing them to alternative favorable residues does not. While this does not prove our hypothesis that Pro170 is in the cis conformation, it does provide some experimental support. Better evidence comes from examining the residues adjacent to the equivalent proline in other LGIC subunits, and indeed this proline is preceded by an aromatic residue for all known subunits of this family (Ref. 20North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand- and Voltage-Gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton1995Google Scholar, Fig. 7). Many of the residues following the proline are also aromatic, e.g. in the nACh receptor subunits the following residue is either Phe or Tyr. There are also good structural reasons for the proline located here to be cis: Pro170 is located in the center of the cys-loop, a 13-amino acid region held together by disulfide-bonded cysteines, which is characteristic of this family of proteins. As this 13-amino acid peptide must form a turn, this could be facilitated by acis-proline. The fact that glycine, which is a common amino acid in other turns, cannot substitute for proline in the nACh receptor (10MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) suggests this is a turn that perhaps can be formed only by acis-proline. The recently reported structure of the acetylcholine receptor-binding protein (AChBP), a protein highly homologous to the ligand binding domain of the nACh receptor, unfortunately is not conserved in this region (4Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Proline has been identified as an amino acid that allows the correct functioning of a number of transmembrane proteins involved in signaling, and there is increasing evidence that LGICs fall into this category (25Sansom M.S.P. Weinstein H. Trends Phamacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 445-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Apart from M2, however, which has been shown in a variety of studies to be predominantly α-helical, the secondary or tertiary structures of the transmembrane regions have not yet been determined (5Corringer P.J. Le Novere N Changeux J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Thus whether the conserved proline in M1, Pro257, is in the membrane or at an intracellular or extracellular location is not yet known. The critical role of this amino acid in the 5-HT3 receptor has been recently demonstrated in the study by Dang et al. (6Dang H. England P.M. Farivar S.S. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1114-1122PubMed Google Scholar), where its substitution by a variety of other residues resulted in expressed but non-functional receptors, similar to our findings with the Pro357 → Ala mutant. These authors also replaced this proline with unnatural amino acids with the same limited H bonding capacity of proline, which yielded mutant receptors that did function. In addition they demonstrated that in combination with a second mutation, Val13 → Ser, the M1 Pro to Gly substitution resulted in constitutively open channels, supporting the proposal that the M1 proline plays a critical role in allowing the conformational changes necessary for channel gating. The M2-M3 domain, which is thought to be an extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 2 and 3, has also been shown in experiments on nACh (26Grosman C. Salamone F.N. Sine S.M. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Rovira J.C. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Sala F. Sala S.

Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1209-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) receptors to play a role in channel gating. Indeed some authors, e.g. Lynch et al. (29Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), believe that the M2-M3 loop forms the crucial link between agonist binding and channel opening. This region appears to be flexible, and recent experiments on muscle nACh receptors suggest that movement of this loop in response to agonist binding initially occurs in α subunits and subsequently in others (26Grosman C. Salamone F.N. Sine S.M. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus Pro301 may be a critical component that allows agonist-stimulated movement of this loop resulting in channel opening, and its replacement even by alanine may prevent the flexibility of this region that is critical for its function. Combining the findings from mutations and the PDB analysis we can conclude that all of the proline residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunits examined in this study play a important role in the correct structure and/or function of the receptor and postulate that one of these, Pro170, is in the cis conformation. The high level of conservation of these prolines with other members of the cys-loop family demonstrates that tertiary folding of the receptors is highly conserved, thus further exemplifying the high degree of structural and functional homology between the receptors in the cys-loop LGIC family."

https://openalex.org/W2327590178,"Adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for the expression and activation of the cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, and for G1 phase progression of non-transformed cells. However, in non-adherent cells no molecular mechanism has yet been proposed for the cell adhesion-dependent up-regulation of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI), and the associated inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2. We now show that in epithelial cells the expression of c-Myc is tightly regulated by cell-substrate adhesion. When deprived of adhesion, two independently derived mammary epithelial cell lines, 184A1N4 and MCF-10A, rapidly decrease their level of c-Myc mRNA and protein. This decrease in levels of c-Myc correlates with G1 phase arrest, as indicated by hypophosphorylation of pRb and inhibition of the activity of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex. In 184A1N4 cells, cell-substrate adhesion is required for the suppression of p27, and induction of cyclin E, E2F-1, but not cyclins D1 and D3. Enforced expression of c-Myc in non-adherent 184A1N4 and MCF-10A cells reverses the adhesion-dependent inhibition of cell cycle progression. Restoration of c-Myc in non-adherent cells induces the expression of E2F-1, and hyperphosphorylation of pRb in response to EGF treatment. In addition, expression of c-Myc results in the anchorage-independent activation of the CDK2 complex, the associated upregulation of cyclin E, and the destabilization and degradation of p27 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our study thus suggests that c-Myc is the link between cell adhesion and the regulation of p27 and cyclin E-CDK2. Furthermore, we describe a role for c-Myc in adhesion-mediated regulation of E2F-1."
https://openalex.org/W2046508793,"The phosphatase Cdc25A was shown to be a target of the transcription factor c-Myc. Myc-induced apoptosis appeared dependent on Cdc25A expression and Cdc25A over-expression could substitute for Myc-triggered apoptosis. These findings suggested that an important downstream component of Myc-mediated apoptosis was identified. However and in contrast, we recently reported that during TNFalpha-induced apoptosis, which required c-Myc function, Cdc25A was down-regulated in a human carcinoma cell line. We now provide evidence that Cdc25A rendered the non-transformed rat embryonic cell line 423 refractory to apoptosis, which was induced by serum deprivation and in absence of detectable c-myc levels. The survival promoting activity of cdc25A was abolished upon infection of cells with a full-length cdc25A antisense construct. To identify the signaling proteins mediating the survival function of the phosphatase, cdc25A- and akt- over-expressing pooled clones were exposed to selected chemicals, which inhibit or activate key proteins in signaling pathways. Inhibition of apoptosis by SU4984, NF023 and Rapamycin placed Cdc25A and Akt function downstream of FGF.R, PDGF.R, and compensated G-protein- and PP2A- activity. Interestingly, upon treatment with LY-294002, cdc25A- and akt- over-expressing clones exhibited similar apoptotic patterns as control cells, which indicates that neither Akt- nor Cdc25A-mediated survival functions are dependent on PI.3 kinase activity in rat 423 cells. In cdc25A-overexpressing cells increased levels of serine 473 phosphorylated Akt were found, which co-precipitated with Cdc25A and Raf1. Since activation of proteins requires dephosphorylation of particular residues in addition to site-specific phosphorylation, the anti-apoptotic effect of Cdc25A might derive from its participation in a multimeric protein complex with phosphoAkt and Raf1, two prominent components of survival pathways."

GBP consists of 25 amino acid residues containing a core region that shows a striking similarity to the C-terminal β-loop domain of EGF and disordered N and C termini. The present study demonstrates that, although GBP lacks the N-terminal half-portion of EGF molecule, at least five amino acids of the disordered N-terminal six-amino acid region are indispensable for affecting the cell growth activity of GBP.

This developmental disturbance allows the wasps to complete their larval growth and to emerge while the host is still in the larval stage, otherwise the wasp larvae would be trapped inside the sclerotized pupal cuticles (1Hayakawa Y. J. Insect Physiol. 1995; 41: 1-6Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Growth-blocking peptide (GBP)1 was originally identified in the larval hemolymph of the armyworm, Pseudaletia separata, whose development is halted in the last larval stage from parasitization by the parasitic wasp, Cotesia kariyai(2Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10813-10816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hayakawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7982-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have since determined that GBP is a host gene product, and that titers of this peptide are increased by external stresses such as parasitization and chilling (4Hayakawa Y. Noguchi H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Yamanaka A. Izumi S. Tomino S.

Biol. 1995; 25: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Larval weight gain is reduced and metamorphosis is also delayed when larvae were injected with high concentrations of GBP relative to sham-injected larvae. Low concentrations of GBP stimulate larval growth. Thus, it is clear that GBP titers are closely related to larval growth rates of insects (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently we found that GBP can act as a cell growth factor controlling the proliferation of a number of cell types. Bioassay data showed that several nm GBP stimulate DNA synthesis in insect Sf9 cells and human keratinocyte cells, while several μm GBP do not stimulate cell proliferation at all (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since GBP homologs have been found in other Lepidoptera as a multifunctional peptide, they are now thought to be categorized as an insect cytokine family (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys.

Peptides. 1999; 20: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Structural studies indicate that GBP shares a striking similarity with the C-terminal loop subdomain of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (13Aizawa T. Fujitani N. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Ohkubo T. Kawano K. Hikichi K. Nitta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1887-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar tertiary structures of two related peptides, plasmatocyte spreading peptide (PSP) and paralytic peptide (PP), in the same family have been also resolved recently (14Volkman B.F. Anderson M.E.

Peptide R. 1999; 54: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). EGF is a single-chain polypeptide of 53 amino acid residues with three disulfide bonds that define three looped regions from residues 1–20, 14–31, and 32–53 (16Savage C.R. Inagami T. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7612-7621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenesis data collected thus far have revealed that EGF interactions with its receptor (EGFR) require the involvement of regions in both the N- and C-terminal domains of EGF (17Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 6367-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Even though GBP adopts an EGF-like fold similar to that found in the C-terminal subdomain of EGF, GBP totally lacks the N-terminal homologous domains of EGF molecule since it consists of a mere 25 amino acids. However, the cell growth assay using human keratinocytes showed that GBP has a mitogenic activity comparable with that of EGF. Further, GBP showed a more potent mitogenic activity against insect Sf9 cells than that found for EGF (7Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The purpose of this work was to identify the GBP receptors in both cell types. The results reveal that GBP directly binds the EGFR in human keratinocytes while it binds a completely different type of the receptor with a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa in insect Sf9 cells. GBP and [biotin-Lys26]GBP were synthesized by the solid phase method (18Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6699) Google Scholar) usingtert-butyloxycarbony amino acids with an Applied Biosystem Model 430A peptide synthesizer. Deletion of GBP from the N terminus was performed by incubating synthetic GBP in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 units of aminopeptidase I (Takara) at 90 °C for 45 min. The deleted products were separated by a reversed phase C8 column (YMC, 4.6 × 250 mm, pore size: 300 Å). Human EGF was purchased from Seikagaku (Japan). [3H]thymidine, 125I-EGF and Na125I were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal anti-EGFR and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Synthesized GBP was radioiodinated using the chloramine-T method (19Hunter M.W. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 100,000–150,000 cpm/ng protein. Human foreskin keratinocytes were purchased from Morinaga and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.8% bovine pituitary extract (Morinaga) and 0.8 pmol/ml EGF (complete medium A) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. DNA synthesis was assayed as follows. After cultivating the cells in DMEM without any growth factor for 2 days, either GBP or EGF was added to the medium along with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine. After incubation for 2 days, cells were washed three times with 0.15 m NaCl, lysed with 200 μl of 0.3 n NaOH, and then counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, LSC-5100) (20Shing Y. Davidson S. Klagsbrun M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Insect Sf9 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained in TNM-FH medium (Grace's insect medium, pH 6.1, containing 0.33% lactoalbumine hydrolysate and 0.33% yeastolate) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Filtron Pty. Ltd.) at 25 °C. After cultivating the cells in TNM-FH without the serum for 2 days, either EGF or GBP was added to the medium along with [3H]thymidine. Thymidine incorporation was measured by the same procedures as described above. Competitive binding assays with125I-labeled human EGF and GBP were performed using either human foreskin keratinocyte or insect Sf9 cells essentially according to the procedure of Sarah et al. (21Sarah M.P. Lynn W. Stephan G.C. Donna E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30392-30397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The cells were diluted to 5 × 104 cells/ml and 500 μl of the suspension was put into each well of 24-well plates. The plate was incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 18 h. The adherent cells were then washed twice with 500 μl of PBS (8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2) and preincubated with 500 μl of PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA at 22 °C. After the preincubation for 30 min, the supernatant was replaced with 250 μl of PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 (to inhibit EGF receptor internalization) and various concentrations of growth factors. Two hundred fifty μl of 125I-EGF (20 ng/ml, 3.7 mBq/μg) or125I-GBP in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 were added to each well and incubated at 22 °C for 5 h. After removing the supernatant, the cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The plate was left for drying up, after which the cells were lysed with 200 μl of 0.3 nNaOH and then counted using the liquid scintillation counter. Binding data were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard (22Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17801) Google Scholar). Human foreskin keratinocytes and insect Sf9 cells were diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml and then cultured in each cell culture flask containing 5 ml serum-free medium. Human foreskin keratinocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under 5% CO2, and Sf9 cells were incubated at 25 °C for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with 5 nm of GBP or EGF at 25 °C for 5 min (23Vliet A.V.D. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Eiserich J.P. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31860-31866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After the treatment with the growth factors, cells were rinsed with ice cold PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4 and were incubated with a lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 nm ocadic acid, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmp-amidinophenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.5) for 15 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was incubated with an anti-EGFR antibody for 2 h at 4 °C then mixed with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and left for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads that bound the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer. Protein samples of cell lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE by incubating with 80 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, containing 1% SDS and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol in boiling water for 5 min and developed by the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli V.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Protein bands on SDS-PAGE gel were electrically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter essentially according to Burnette (25Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5912) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and then probed with primary antibody (monoclonal antibody against EGFR or phosphotyrosine (PY-20)), and detection was performed using the Vectastain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories). Human foreskin keratinocytes were plated into 96-well plates at an initial density of 1 × 104cells/well in 250 μl of DMEM medium, essentially according to the procedure of Sato et. al. (26Sato J.D. Le A.D. Kawamoto T. Meth. Enzymol. 1987; 146: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Five μg of anti-EGFR antibody were added into each well and then incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. Following the preincubation, either GBP or EGF (5 nm) was added to the medium along with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine. After incubating for 40 h, cells were washed three times with 0.15 m NaCl and lysed with 200 μl of 0.3 n NaOH, and then thymidine incorporation was counted using the liquid scintillation counter. Human foreskin keratinocytes were cultured in a culture flask, allowed to grow for 2 days in complete medium A at 37 °C under 5% CO2, and then serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM under the same condition. Cells were incubated with [biotin-Lys26]GBP (5 pmol/ml) at 25 °C for 5 min. The cells were washed extensively with 0.15 m NaCl and again incubated for 30 min with the UV cross-linker NHS-ASA (Pierce). For UV treatment, [biotin-Lys26]GBP and cells were irradiated with 100 mJ/cm2 short wavelength UV. Cells were then lysed in 300 μl of the lysis buffer. The lysate was clarified by 14,000 × g. The supernatant was then solubilized in SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer, separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Avidin-Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) fixed [biotin-Lys26]GBP (50 nmol/5 ml) as ligand was packed in a column and washed with 10-bed volumes of the lysis buffer. The Sf9 cell lysate was applied to the column. After washing the column with 5-bed volumes of the lysis buffer and PBS, the membrane protein with a molecular mass of 60 kDa was eluted with 1 μm GBP in PBS. GBP consists of three regions: the core region, which shares a high degree of similarity to the EGF C-terminal subdomain, and N- and C-terminal disordered regions. Because GBP lacks the N-terminal domain of EGF molecule, it was important to determine whether the N-terminal disordered six-amino acid chain of GBP contributes to its ability to promote cell growth activity. To check this possibility, derivatives of GBP lacking various numbers of amino acid residues from the N-terminal-six residues were prepared and tested for their abilities to stimulate DNA synthesis in human foreskin keratinocyte cells. The deletion of the N-terminal glutamic acid did not cause any significant decrease in cell growth activity, but further deletion of more than two residues lead to a drastic reduction in the activity (Fig.1), indicating that the N-terminal region, at least five of the six amino acid residues, are essential for exhibiting the mitogenic activity of GBP in the cultured cells through binding and activation of the receptor. Since it has been reported that the N-terminal subdomain of EGF is indispensable for organizing the structure for binding EGFR, it was interesting to examine whether or not GBP directly binds to the EGFR in keratinocyte cells. To characterize the GBP binding sites in human keratinocyte cells, competitive receptor binding experiments were carried out with125I-labeled EGF. GBP was able to block the binding of125I-EGF to EGFR, although the concentration difference between EGF and GBP required for competitive binding of125I-EGF to EGFR at the half-maximal competition level was about five orders of magnitude (Fig.2A). Comparison of the relative binding affinities of EGF and GBP against 125I-GBP showed that GBP (IC50 = 0.31 nm) was as strong as EGF (IC50 = 0.47 nm) in its ability to compete with 125I-GBP for binding to human keratinocyte cell membrane fractions (Fig. 2B). Scatchard plot analyses showed a single class of high affinity binding site for GBP. The dissociation constant for GBP (Kd = 0.12 nm, Fig. 2b) was not very much different from that of EGF (Kd = 0.03 nm, Fig.2a). Similar experiments with insect Sf9 cell membrane fractions showed that Sf9 cells contain a single class of binding site having a high affinity for GBP but a low affinity for EGF (Fig. 2,C and D). The Kd values for EGF and GBP calculated by Scatchard analysis were 0.64 nm(Fig. 2c) and 0.25 nm (Fig. 2d), respectively, which are comparable with that for EGFR in keratinocyte cells. Further competitive binding experiments were carried out with125I-GBP and the N-terminal deletion GBP analogs. As shown in Fig. 3, the deletion of the N-terminal glutamic acid did not change its ability to compete with125I-GBP for binding to EGFR in human keratinocytes, but further deletion of the N-terminal residue(s) lost their abilities as the competitor. These results are consistent with those in the mitogenic activity assays (Fig. 1). All the results of the receptor binding assays including Figs. 2 and 3 were interpreted as suggesting that GBP binds EGFR in human keratinocytes but binds a different receptor, GBP, in insect Sf9 cells. To explore further the interaction between GBP and EGFR in human keratinocytes, the ability of GBP to stimulate mitogenesis was tested in the presence of anti-EGFR antibody. Neither GBP nor EGF stimulated DNA synthesis in the keratinocytes when this antibody was present in the culture medium (Fig. 4). This indicates that GBP exerts its cell growth activity through binding with EGFR. Further, binding of GBP with keratinocyte EGFR was directly demonstrated by the use of biotin-labeled GBP as shown in Fig.5. To prepare the biotinylated GBP without losing the mitogenic activity, we synthesized a 26-amino acid GBP containing a C-terminal biotinylated Lys26. This [biotin-Lys26]GBP retained the cell growth promoting activity equivalent to the level of that found with intact GBP, while [biotin-Lys20]GBP lost the cell growth activity (Fig.5A). SDS-PAGE of keratinocyte membrane proteins, followed by visualization by streptavidin, showed that the bioactive [biotin-Lys26]GBP directly bound to EGFR (170 kDa), but the inactive [biotin-Lys20]GBP did not (Fig.5B).Figure 5Mitogenic activities (A) and binding (B) of biotinylated GBP. A,mitogenic activity was measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into human foreskin keratinocytes during incubation with GBP, [biotin-Lys20]GBP, or [biotin-Lys26]GBP for 2 days. Data are given as means + S.D. for five separate measurements. B, the keratinocyte membrane preparation was incubated with each factor at 4 °C for 15 h in the presence and absence of unlabeled EGF. The receptor-ligand complex was cross-linked withN-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The right membrane was stained with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and the left one was probed with anti-EGFR antibody.

Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). To investigate the basis for the mitogenic activity of GBP, we examined its ability to stimulate auto-phosphorylation of EGFR in keratinocyte cells and the GBP receptor in Sf9 cells. Equal amounts of protein extracts from keratinocytes and Sf9 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody. Then phosphorylation was detected by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. When keratinocytes and Sf9 cells were stimulated by either EGF or GBP before the membrane preparation and the immunoprecipitation, GBP induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kDa EGFR in keratinocyte cells, as did EGF. Both peptides also induced the phosphorylation of the 58-kDa protein (p58) in Sf9 cells (Fig.6). GBP showed a dose-dependent capacity to phosphorylate the proteins, 170 kDa in keratinocyte cells and 58 kDa in Sf9 cells; 0.1–10 nm GBP strongly phosphorylated the protein, whereas 100 nm GBP phosphorylated them to a much lesser extent (Fig.7).Figure 7Dose-dependent effects of GBP on EGFR (A) and GBPR (B). A, human keratinocyte cells were incubated with 0–100 nm GBP for 5 min. B, insect Sf9 cells were incubated with 0–100 nm GBP for 5 min. Following this, Western blotting was performed according to the procedures outlined in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Final experiments were designed to test whether p58 possesses a GBP binding domain. The membrane fraction prepared from Sf9 cells pretreated with GBP was loaded onto an affinity column using biotinylated GBP as ligand. After washing the column well with PBS, 1 μm GBP in PBS eluted one major protein with a molecular mass of 60 kDa (p60), which is apparently bigger than p58. The affinity-purified p60 was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.8, p60 did not cross-react with the phosphotyrosine antibody, indicating that p60 might be the GBP-binding subunit lacking tyrosine residue(s) to be phosphorylated. Based on these results, it is reasonable to propose that GBP receptor exists as a heterodimeric complex consisting of the p60 subunit with the GBP binding site and the p58 subunit with tyrosine residue(s) to be phosphorylated after binding of GBP. EGF is a single chain polypeptide of about 50 residues with three disulfide bonds. These disulfide bonds define three looped regions of which the N-terminal two-loop domains are indispensable to the mitogenic capacities of the molecules (17Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1986; 83: 6367-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although NMR analyses revealed that the tertiary structure of GBP shares a striking similarity to the C-terminal loop region of EGF, it is apparent that GBP lacks the N-terminal loop region seen in EGF (13Aizawa T. Fujitani N. Hayakawa Y. Ohnishi A. Ohkubo T. Kawano K. Hikichi K. Nitta K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1887-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Instead of such a loop structure, GBP possesses a disordered N-terminal region consisting of six amino acid residues. It was interesting to examine whether this short N-terminal of GBP contributes to its mitogenic capabilities. The N-terminal Glu-deleted peptide has a mitogenic activity equivalent to that of the intact GBP, but a deletion of more than two amino acid residues from the N-terminal causes a drastic decrease of the biological activity (see Fig. 1). These results were interpreted as suggesting that the N-terminal region of GBP, at least five amino acid residues of a total six residues, is indispensable to its mitogenic activity. Losing the biological activity of GBP by the deletion of its N-terminal residues could be due to a greatly diminished affinity for its receptor in keratinocytes. This interpretation is partly supported by the receptor binding assays; GBP showed the ability to compete with 125I-EGF in the competitive binding experiment (see Fig. 3), although the concentration of GBP required for the inhibition of 125I-EGF binding to EGFR is much more than that of EGF itself. In keratinocyte cells,125I-GBP specifically bound to a certain receptor. This receptor is likely to be EGFR since the binding of 125I-GBP was completely blocked by EGF. Further, neutralization of EGFR by anti-EGFR antibody blocked the stimulation of mitogenesis of keratinocyte cells by GBP (see Fig. 4). The conclusive evidence was provided by labeling EGFR with biotin-GBP; 170-kDa EGFR was labeled with biotin-GBP in the absence of EGF but was not in the presence of EGF (see Fig. 5). Based on a series of such results, it is reasonable to conclude that GBP could exert the proliferative effect on human keratinocyte cells through direct binding of the EGFR. EGFR signaling is initiated by ligand binding, receptor dimerization, and auto-phosphorylation to create phosphotyrosine residues (27Heldin C. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). It was noteworthy to check whether auto-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of EGFR occurred following incubation of keratinocyte cells with GBP. As with EGF, GBP induced the phosphorylation of the 170-kDa EGFR in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 6 and 7). The tyrosine-phosphorylation of EGFR was induced by GBP as well as EGF at concentrations ranging up to 10 nm, but phosphorylation was drastically reduced by concentrations greater than 10 nm. The transient desensitization of EGFR with the high concentration of EGF has been reported (28Willey H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of EGFR has been attributed to serine and/or threonine residue phosphorylations by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II) (29Feinmesser R.L. Wicks S.J. Taverner C.J. Chantry A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16168-16173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In view of the receptor signaling pattern, GBP stimulates EGFR in keratinocyte cells just as EGF does. Similar experiments with Sf9 cells using anti-EGFR and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies showed that a 58-kDa protein (p58) sharing the similar antigenicity with the extracellular domain of EGFR is selectively phosphorylated upon GBP-induced stimulation. At present, we do not know whether or not p58 itself possesses a tyrosine kinase activity that catalyzes auto-phosphorylation under the influence of GBP similar to the activation of EGFR by EGF. However, by analogy with the EGF signal transduction, it is likely that p58 will be found to be auto-phosphorylated at tyrosine residue(s) by GBP, and that the tyrosine-phosphorylation triggers off a series of intracellular signaling events. If this were true, it would mean that GBP and EGF share a close functional homology. However, it seems that GBP does not bind directly to p58 but binds to another membrane protein with a molecular mass of 60 kDa (p60), which does not have a cross-reactivity against the anti-EGFR antibody. Binding between GBP and p60 was demonstrated using a biotinylated GBP ligand affinity chromatography (see Fig. 8) and direct labeling with biotinylated GBP or 125I-GBP (data not presented). Further, similar cross-linking experiments using 125I-EGF demonstrated direct binding between EGF and a Sf9 membrane protein with a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (data not presented). Given a plausible functional linkage between p58 and p60, it is reasonable to propose that GBP receptor is composed of a dimeric complex, p60 with the GBP biding site and p58 with the tyrosine residues, to be phosphorylated after binding of GBP. It is therefore apparent that the structure of GBP receptors in insect Sf9 cells is completely different from EGFR even though the cell growth promoting activity and the structure of GBP share significant similarities with EGF. Several peptides structurally related to GBP have been identified in some lepidopteran insects. These are: paralytic peptide (PP), plasmatocyte spreading peptide (PSP), and cardioactive peptide. It has been demonstrated that GBP and PSP cause rapid paralysis in P. separata armyworm larvae (30Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), GBP and PP stimulate plasmatocyte spreading and aggregation (30Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Wang Y. Jiang H. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and PSP retards larval growth of the armyworm (30Strand M.R. Hayakawa Y. Clark K.D J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Further, PSP stimulates the proliferation of Sf9 cells as GBP does. 2A. Ohnishi and Y. Hayakawa, unpublished results.Based on these results, it is reasonable to propose that all these peptides should be categorized in the same family of insect cytokines. Since there has been no report on the receptors of insect cytokines or cell growth factors, the characterizations of the GBP receptor in Sf9 cells will undoubtedly contribute to our understanding of the roles played by the GBP signaling pathway in insects. Further, GBP and GBP receptor could be useful models to explore the detailed interaction between EGF and EGFR because GBP itself and GBP receptor binding domain are less than half-sizes of EGF and EGFR, respectively."

These membrane-bound growth factor precursors raise the possibility that juxtacrine mechanisms may also exist for the HRGs and may play an important role in interacting with their respective receptors.

In this study, results are presented showing that membrane-bound heregulin can be detected on the surface of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and that this form of the molecule can establish contact with HER-2/neu-expressing cells. These interactions can be specifically blocked by soluble 7-kDa rHRG, full-length rHRG, or anti-HER-2 antibodies. Plasma membranes isolated from HRG-producing MDA-MB-231 cells are capable of activating p185HER-2/neu in both HER-2/neu-non-overexpressing and HER-2/neu-overexpressing human breast cell lines. These data demonstrate that transmembrane heregulin produced by human breast cancer cells is a functional ligand and suggest that it may be capable of activating receptors in neighboring cells via a juxtacrine mechanism.

Specific staining for both p185HER-2/neu and HRG was performed using the anti- p185HER-2/neu polyclonal antibody R60 (32Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar) or two anti-HRG antibodies (sheep polyclonal 17753-76A and hamster monoclonal 3B4, Genentech), respectively. Final color for HRG detection was developed with an alkaline phosphatase detection system following the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain ABC-AP, Vector). Fluorescein avidin DCS (Vector) was applied for detection of p185HER-2/neu by immunofluorescence. Observation of cell staining and pictures were done in a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Treatments, as described in the legend for Fig. 7, were performed by pre-incubation of the cells 15 min at 37 °C as indicated. Cells were plated onto chamber slides (LabTek, NalgeNunc) using 1% FBS supplemented RPMI medium and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. After that time period the medium was removed and the slides rinsed twice with PBS. The cells were fixed in cold acetone and a double immunohistochemistry procedure performed using the Vector AB system. The same antibodies described in the immunofluorescence section were used for detection of HER-2 receptor and membrane-bound heregulin. The alkaline phosphatase (pink substrate) and peroxidase (brown) systems were used for color development as directed by the manufacturer (Vector). Cell observation and photomicrography were done with an Olympus BH2 microscope. Plasma membranes were isolated using standard cell fractionation techniques as described (35Urbina J.A. Vivas J. Ramos H. Larralde G. Aguilar Z. Avilan L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, 106 to 108 cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures using a 1× solution of Versene (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing protease inhibitors as follows: 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm bestatin, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 20 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm EDTA. Cells were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (10 nm Tris, pH 7.4, plus 250 mmsucrose and a mixture of protease inhibitors as above), and then washed twice using the same procedure. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A in a 1:10 w/v ratio and homogenized (Dounce homogenizer) until a 80–90% cell rupture was observed under the inverted microscope (Diaphot, Nikon). Centrifugation of the cell homogenate (H) at 1,000 × g for 10 min yielded the pellet (P1). The resultant supernatant (S1) from this centrifugation was then spun at 15,000 × g for 50 min to obtain the pellet (P2) and supernatant (S2). Microsomes (M) were pelleted by spinning S2 at 105,000 × g for 1 h; the supernatant of this last centrifugation consists of cell cytoplasm (Cyt). Plasma membranes (PM) were purified from the microsomal fraction using a self-generating density gradient made of 17% Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25 ml of buffer A. For this, the microsomal fraction was resuspended in Percoll and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 50 min. A tube containing density marker beads was run in parallel to monitor density banding. The PM fraction was collected at a typical density of 1.04–1.045 mg/ml. Membranes were further purified by loading the PM fraction on top of a 50% sucrose step cushion. After centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 1 h, plasma membranes were collected at the interphase and resuspended in 12 ml of water for a further centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min. Purified PM were then obtained as a thin layer on top of the Percoll pellet and resuspended in 0.2–0.4 ml of water for their storage at −80 °C. All the steps were performed at 4 °C under sterile conditions. Marker enzymes were used for assessment of PM purity and possible cross-contamination. The activity of the next set of enzymes was quantitated: (a) Na+,K+-ATPase as a PM marker (36Scharschmidt B.F. Keeffe E.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 646: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), (b) succinate-cytochrome c reductase as a marker for the inner mitochondrial membrane (37Meier P.J. Boyer J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), (c) glucose-6-phosphatase to detect possible endoplasmic reticulum contamination (37Meier P.J. Boyer J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Lin P.H. Selinfreund R. Wharton W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and (d) acid phosphatase for lysosomes (38Lin P.H. Selinfreund R. Wharton W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The total protein concentration in each fraction was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) as indicated by the manufacturer. Specific activities were calculated as micromoles of product/min × mg of protein. MCF-7 cells (1.0 × 105) were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for 4 days (to ∼90% confluence) in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were serum-starved for 1.5 h prior to stimulation with either recombinant heregulin or MDA-MB-231 plasma membranes. A p185HER-2/neu phosphorylation dose-response curve was generated by treating the cells with the indicated concentrations of rHRG-β1-(177–244) for 8 min at room temperature. Cells were also treated in parallel with dilutions of the MDA-MB-231 PM suspension. All sample dilutions were made in medium containing 0.1% BSA. Following stimulation, the supernatants were removed and phosphorylation was stopped by adding 100 μl of SDS sample buffer to each well. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Transduction Laboratories) and a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specific p185 phosphorylation was quantitated by densitometry. Data were analyzed using a non-linear least squares regression algorithm (39Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 RV/H2 samples (20 μg/lane) obtained from the cell fractionation procedure were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and run in a 8% Tris-glycine gel (Novex). The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). A Western blot of the gel was probed using the anti-HRG-α C-20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following incubation with the secondary antibody, consisting of a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Calbiochem), the blot was visualized with a chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blocking of the activation of HER-2/neu tyrosine kinase activity by transmembrane-HRG in the plasma membrane of MDA-MB-231 cells was examined by Western blot analysis. HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cell lines SK-BR-3, MCF-7 RV/H2, and MCF-7 parentals were cultured in six-well plates using 1× RPMI medium (10% FBS). Subconfluent cultures were serum-starved for 2 h before treatment as indicated in Fig. 5. The anti-receptor antibodies were added to the cells before treatment with either form of the ligand. Pre-incubation with the antibodies was allowed for 30 min at room temperature prior to treatment. Anti-HRG antibodies were pre-incubated with the ligand or PM solutions. After incubation at room temperature with either form of HRG for approximately 8 min, cells were washed once with a 20 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.5, buffer, followed by two washes with cold PBS, after which 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation buffer) were immediately added. Cell lysis was allowed for 10 min on ice, and cells were scraped from the wells using a rubber policeman. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and kept at −80 °C. Lysates (200 mg of total protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either 3 μl of the anti-p185HER-2/neu polyclonal antibody R60 (32Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J. Stuart S.G. Udove J. Ullrich A. Press M.F. Science. 1989; 244: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (6289) Google Scholar) or 5 mg of the anti-p185HER-2/neu monoclonal antibody 3E8 (Genentech). Immunoprecipitation was achieved by addition of 30 μl of a Protein A-AffiGel conjugate (Bio-Rad), followed by incubation for another 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were pelleted by brief centrifugation, washed extensively with lysis buffer, and processed for electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. MCF-7 cells were seeded (1.0 × 105) in each well of a 24-well plate and grown to ∼80% confluence in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were washed briefly with ice-cold medium containing 0.1% BSA and placed on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 0–4 °C. A competitive displacement curve for HRG binding was generated by incubating the MCF-7 cells with 50 × 103 cpm 125I-labeled rHRG-β1-(177–244) (specific activity 213 mCi/pmol), in the presence of the indicated concentrations of unlabeled rHRG-β1-(177–244). Binding was also performed on samples containing 0.36 and 0.90 mg/ml MDA-MB-231 PM suspension or 0.087 and 0.17 mg/ml MCF-7H2 PM suspension. After incubating for about 16 h, the cells were washed extensively with ice-cold medium containing 0.1% BSA. Cell-associated counts were then removed with 0.1 n NaOH, 1.0% SDS at room temperature. Binding data was analyzed using a non-linear regression algorithm (39Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). The effect of membrane-bound heregulin on DNA synthesis was evaluated on a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. In brief, 5 × 103 cells were plated in multiscreen HATF 96-well plates (Millipore) using RPMI medium containing 1% FBS. After 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, cells were treated as indicated and reincubated for 2 more days under the same conditions, after which received a 2-μCi pulse of [3H]thymidine in 20 μl of culture medium. Thymidine incorporation was stopped after 4 h of incubation by filtration and washing of the wells twice with PBS. DNA was precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the [3H]thymidine incorporated by the cells was measured in a scintillation counter. Heregulin precursors on the plasma membranes of the HRG-producing cell line MDA-MB-231 were identified using immunocytochemical techniques (Fig. 1). When MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with either polyclonal (Fig. 1) or monoclonal (data not shown) anti-HRG antibodies, intense membrane-associated staining on the surface was observed (Fig. 1,bottom right panel). The HRG-positive staining (red fluorescence) surrounded the nuclei (counterstained in blue), always associated with plasma membranes, and possibly also with the cytoplasm (Fig. 1,bottom right). MCF-7 RV/H2 cells, which do not produce heregulin (34Aguilar Z. Akita R.W. Finn R.S. Ramos B.L. Pegram M.D. Kabbinavar F.F. Pietras R.J. Pisacane P. Sliwkowski M.X. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6050-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), were processed in parallel and demonstrated no membrane-related HRG staining, despite their high levels of HER-2 expression. The results obtained by performing immunocytochemistry with the anti-HRG antibodies on both the MDA-MB-231 cells, and the MCF-7 RV/H2 cells confirmed previous analyses by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Taqman) as well as Northern blot of HRG expression in these two cell lines (8Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L.

An anti-p185HER-2/neu antibody was used to assess the patterns and intensities of HER-2/neu receptor expression on these same two cell lines (Fig. 1, upper panels). Strong plasma membrane fluorescence was seen in the MCF-7 cells, transfected to overexpress HER-2/neu, indicating positive staining for the receptor (upper left panel). Conversely, there was little or no fluorescence on the plasma membranes of the single-copy, low HER-2/neu-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (upper right panel). Given their significantly different relative expression levels of HRG and HER-2, these two cell lines were used to conduct further biochemical and biologic analyses related to HER-2 activation by membrane-associated HRG. In order to characterize the membrane-bound HRG precursors, PM fractions of the two cell lines were prepared. Purified plasma membrane fractions from both MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 RV/H2 cells were obtained using conventional biochemical techniques (35Urbina J.A. Vivas J. Ramos H. Larralde G. Aguilar Z. Avilan L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 30: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and assessed by examination with a transmission electron microscope (data not shown). Possible cross-contamination of PM fractions with membrane vesicles from intracellular organelles was further investigated by measuring the activity of classical marker enzymes for lysosomes (acid phosphatase) (38Lin P.H. Selinfreund R. Wharton W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), mitochondria (succinate-cytochrome c reductase) (37Meier P.J. Boyer J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 534-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and cytoplasm (glucose-6-phosphatase) (38Lin P.H. Selinfreund R. Wharton W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The PM fraction shows enrichment on the specific activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase (36Scharschmidt B.F. Keeffe E.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 646: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), a marker associated with plasma membrane, with no evidence of significant cross-contamination (Table I).Table IRelative specific activity of fractions from MDA-MB-231 cellsAcid phosphataseSuccinate-cytochrome creductaseGlucose-6-phosphataseNa+/K+ ATPaseHomogenate1111P1021.20P22.7492.80Cytoplasm00310PM001.34.3Activity of several marker enzymes in subcellular fractions of MDA-MB-231 cells is shown.

Elucidating the inter- and intramolecular interactions of this protein is critical to understanding its cellular function and mechanism of action. Toward this end, we have used both biochemical and genetic techniques to probe potential oligomerization interactions of P-gp. Differentially epitope-tagged P-gp molecules did not co-immunoprecipitate when co-expressed in HEK293 cells or when co-translated in vitro, demonstrating that P-gp is monomeric in both the presence and absence of detergents. The two cytoplasmic domains of P-gp did not interact with each other in vivo when co-expressed as gene fusions in yeast. In contrast, the homologous domains of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which reside on separate polypeptides and must form a heterodimeric transporter (TAP1/TAP2), did interact in this system, suggesting a role for these domains in TAP dimerization.

P-glycoprotein cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator multidrug resistance nucleotide-binding domain phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction transporter associated with antigen presentation polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ATP-binding cassette The product of the human MDR1 gene, P-glycoprotein (P-gp),1 is an integral membrane protein that can confer multidrug resistance on cells and tumors (reviewed in Ref. 1Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). P-gp is an ATP-dependent efflux pump that transports an extraordinary range of hydrophobic substrates out of the cell and has also been implicated in the regulation of a heterologous cell swelling-activated chloride channel (reviewed in Ref. 2Bond T.D. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 333-340Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). P-gp is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters and has the characteristic architecture of this protein family: two large cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The first cytoplasmic domain includes a linker region that can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Phosphorylation of the linker has little or no effect on drug transport (3Goodfellow H.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Biochemical and biophysical techniques have previously been employed to investigate the oligomeric structure of P-gp, with ambiguous results. Freeze-fracture electron micrographs of membranes containing overexpressed P-gp showed aggregates in the plasma membrane corresponding to an oligomeric state (6Arsenault A.L. Ling V. Kartner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 938: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Radiation inactivation (7Boscoboinik D. Debanne M.T. Stafford A.R. Jung C.Y. Gupta R.S. Epand R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1027: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) yielded an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa for P-gp, corresponding to approximately a dimer, and chemical cross-linking indicated a small proportion of a 340-kDa form (8Naito M. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity centrifugation through sucrose gradients also indicated an oligomeric state (9Poruchynsky M.S. Ling V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4163-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), although this depended upon the detergent used and could not distinguish whether P-gp might be interacting with heterologous proteins rather than sedimenting as an oligomer. In brain capillaries and renal brush border membranes, radiation inactivation and mobility of Triton X-solubilized protein on native gels also suggested a possible dimer (10Jette L. Potier M. Beliveau R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13929-13937Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, a molecular complementation approach suggested that the functional unit of P-gp is a monomer (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Single-particle electron microscopy of purified reconstituted P-gp also showed a size for the functional protein particle most consistent with a monomeric form (12Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and labeling with lectin-gold particles indicated a single site of glycosylation on each P-gp particle, consistent with a monomer (12Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). As the strategies used to date are subject to a number of caveats or may reflect the fortuitous interaction of the target with other proteins and aggregation due to overexpression, we have used a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques to assess the oligomeric state of P-glycoprotein, as well as potential intramolecular interactions between the cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains of the protein. Restriction digests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and other manipulations of DNA were performed according to standard protocols. DNA was introduced into Escherichia coli SureTM cells (Stratagene) by electroporation. Transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis (Qiagen). Double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced by the automated dye-terminator method (ABI PRISMTM 377 DNA Sequencer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HEK293 cells (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cell Culture Facility, Clare Hall, UK) were maintained in monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Myc (EEQKLISEEDL) and FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope tags were added to the C terminus of P-gp by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the human MDR1 gene. A PstI-SalI fragment of MDR1 encoding the C terminus of the protein was cloned into the pAlter vector and mutagenesis performed according to the Altered Sites procedure (Promega). The mutagenic oligonucleotide was designed to replace the stop codon of MDR1 with the epitope tag followed by an in-frame stop codon and a novel AatII restriction site to facilitate identification of the tagged MDR1 genes. Sequencing of the mutant plasmids confirmed the presence of the tags and demonstrated that no other mutations had been introduced. The mutated 480-base pair PstI-SalI fragment was then used to replace the corresponding fragment of the wild type MDR1sequence in plasmid pMDR7 (13Valverde M.A. Diaz M. Sepulveda F.V. Gill D.R. Hyde S.C. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 830-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) to regenerate the full-length P-gp coding sequence with the appropriate epitope tags (pMDR7.M and pMDR7.F, respectively). The pMDR7 plasmid has a T7 promoter for in vitro expression. For in vivo studies, the taggedMDR1 fragments were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter, generating pcMDR.M (myc tagged) and pcMDR.F (FLAG-tagged). Plasmids were verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. For in vitro studies, proteins encoded by the pMDR7.M and pMDR7.F plasmids were expressed using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h in the presence of [35S]methionine. Labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207460) Google Scholar) and detected by autoradiography. Dynabeads cross-linked with the anti-myc or anti-FLAG antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations. The beads were first coated with either themyc or FLAG antibodies (1.5 μg/107 beads) by cross-linking using 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate in 0.2m triethanolamine at pH 9 for 45 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed in triethanolamine for 2 h, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stored at 4 °C. For in vitro immunoprecipitation, Myc and FLAG-tagged P-gps were co-expressed and 35S-labeled in the complete transcription-translation system. Dynabeads cross-linked with themyc antibody were added to the labeled protein and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous slow rotation. The Dynabeads were then harvested magnetically and washed extensively with PBS before eluting bound proteins in 50 μl of 1% SDS. The eluate was diluted to 500 μl with PBS. For the second immunoprecipitation, Dynabeads cross-linked with the FLAG antibody were added to the eluate and immunoprecipitation performed as described above. After harvesting and washing, bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For in vivo immunoprecipitations, epitope-tagged proteins encoded by plasmids pcMDR.M and pcMDR.F were expressed in HEK293 cells. Plasmid DNA (5 μg) was complexed with 20 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 2 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 10 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to cells grown to ∼80% confluence in 35-mm wells and incubated for 5 h. Cells were returned to Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium for a further 48-h incubation and then lysed in solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing, as appropriate, between 0.5 and 4% detergent (either Nonidet P-40, dodecyl maltoside, or Triton X-100). Lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to sediment insoluble material. The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous slow rotation with 150 μl of Dynabeads cross-linked with the anti-myc antibody. Dynabeads were harvested magnetically and washed in solubilization buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG or anti-myc antibody. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels of radiolabeled proteins were fixed in 25% isopropanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min, incubated in AmplifyTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried, and exposed for 1–24 h. Unlabeled proteins were detected by immunoblotting, performed as described previously (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44931) Google Scholar) using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were M2 anti-FLAG (IBI Kodak) and 9E10 anti-myc (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Hybridoma Unit). The PCR was used to amplify, from plasmid DNA, sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domains of wild type P-gp and the P-gp-8E mutant in which phosphorylatable serine and threonine residues are replaced by glutamates (5Hardy S.P. Goodfellow H.R. Valverde M.A. Gill D.R. Sepulveda V. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). As controls, the cytoplasmic domains of related ABC transporter proteins, TAP1, TAP2, and CFTR (Table I), were also amplified. PCR primers were designed to add restriction endonuclease recognition sequences for EcoRI and XhoI to facilitate directional cloning. The PCR products were cloned into the yeast two-hybrid vectors pEG202 and pJG4–5 to generate in-frame gene fusions with the LexA DNA binding domain and the “acid blob” transcriptional activation domain, respectively (16Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Gene fusions were verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.Table IProtein domains used in the yeast two-hybrid studiesProteinDomainDesignationResiduesP-glycoproteinCytoplasmic domain 1 (NBD1 and linker)P1347–709P-glycoproteinCytoplasmic domain 2P2994–1280CFTRCytoplasmic domain 1 (NBD1 and R domain)C1351–859CFTRCytoplasmic domain 2C21151–1480TAP1Cytoplasmic domainT1480–748TAP2Cytoplasmic domainT2471–686The amino acid residues defining each domain used to construct fusion proteins for the yeast two-hybrid analysis are indicated.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (LEU2::pLexAop1-LEU2) containing pSH18–34, a 20-μm plasmid carrying a galactose-inducible lacZ gene (LexAop-Gal1-lacZ), was used as a reporter strain (17Golemis E.

Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation was assessed by plate assay (19Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9238-9242Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were tested for nuclear localization and DNA binding by repression assay (17Golemis E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smithe J.A.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce short epitope tags (mycand FLAG) to the C terminus of P-gp. Cytotoxicity tests for ability to confer drug resistance demonstrated that addition of these tags did not affect the function of P-gp (data not shown). [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled myc- and FLAG-tagged P-gps were co-expressed in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte system and sequentially immunoprecipitated with antibody cross-linked Dynabeads. Sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-myc and anti-FLAG antibodies (myc/FLAG) gave no recovery of P-gp-FLAG in the final immunoprecipitate (Fig.1). In contrast, P-gp was recovered in the second precipitation of positive control reactions in which anti-myc antibody was used in both precipitation steps (myc/myc). This suggests that the two differentially tagged populations of P-gp do not associate with each other and that P-gp is monomeric in the absence of detergent. To ascertain whether P-gp is also a monomer in vivo, Myc- and FLAG-tagged P-gps were co-expressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection. Epitope-tagged P-gps were recovered in immunoprecipitates from cell lysates prepared in the presence of varied concentrations of several different detergents: dodecyl-β-maltoside, Nonidet P-40, or Triton X-100 (Fig. 2). In controls, when the anti-myc antibody was used for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (myc/myc), P-gp was recovered with each detergent at all the concentrations used, demonstrating the efficacy of the procedure. No P-gp was detected on immunoblots with the anti-FLAG antibody following immunoprecipitation with the anti-myc antibody under any conditions (myc/FLAG). Experiments carried out in reverse using the anti-FLAG antibody for immunoprecipitation and anti-mycantibody for immunoblotting yielded similar results (data not shown). The inability to co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged P-gp with themyc-tagged P-gp in these experiments indicated that the two forms of P-gp did not associate, suggesting that P-gp in the membranes is a monomer. To determine whether P-gp oligomerizes in the absence of detergents and to assess the possibility of very weak or transient interactions, we tested the soluble domains of P-gp in the yeast two-hybrid system. The large cytoplasmic domains of P-gp were expressed as fusion proteins (Table I) as were the cytoplasmic domains of two other ABC transporters, CFTR and TAP, which served as controls. Fusion proteins were expressed singly in yeast and tested for expression, nuclear localization, and DNA binding activity (for binding domain fusions) to exclude autoactivation of reporter genes, as described previously (17Golemis E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smithe J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were then co-expressed in pairwise combinations and tested for interaction by assaying β-galactosidase and leucine reporters. All fusions were shown to be capable of positive interaction with other fusion proteins in related studies (data not shown). No combination of wild-type P-glycoprotein cytoplasmic domains produced a detectable interaction with either reporter gene (TableII). Interestingly, the P-gp-8E mutant, derived from a form of P-gp generated by site-directed mutagenesis to study the effects of phosphorylation of the linker region, interacted weakly with the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of P-gp in the more sensitive leucine assay. These results suggest that direct interaction between the cytoplasmic domains does not normally occur, but may be induced upon phosphorylation of the linker.Table IIYeast two-hybrid analysis of interaction of P-gp cytoplasmic domainsDNA-binding fusionActivation fusionNoneP1P2lacZLEU2lacZLEU2lacZLEU2None−−−−−−P1−−−−−−P2−−−−−−P1E−−−−−+Reporter gene activities were determined by plate assay (lacZ, blue color on plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactopyranoside; LEU2, growth on minimal medium plates lacking leucine).

Positive interactions were dependent on galactose induction of expression of the activation domain fusion. Relative activities were scored qualitatively from no detectable activity (−), to high activity (+++). Control experiments with the cytoplasmic domains of CFTR were likewise negative (data not shown). In contrast, the cytoplasmic domains of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) did interact in this system (Table III). This observation is also consistent with a recent study showing interaction of TAP1 and TAP2 cytoplasmic domains by co-immunoprecipitation (20Lapinski P.E. Miller G.G. Tampe R. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6831-6840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, unlike the homologous domains in P-gp and CFTR, the TAP cytoplasmic domains reside on separate polypeptides that must dimerize to form a complete ABC transporter. Furthermore, the TAP transporter does not include a regulatory domain homologous to either the P-gp linker or the CFTR R domain.Table IIIYeast two-hybrid analysis of interaction of TAP1 and TAP2DNA-binding fusionActivation domain fusionNoneT2lacZLEU2lacZLEU2None−−−−T1−−++++++Reporter gene activities (lacZ, LEU2) were determined by plate assay (lacZ, blue color on plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactopyranoside; LEU2, growth on minimal medium plates lacking leucine).

Efforts to examine the oligomerization of P-gp have been hampered by the technical difficulties of studying protein-protein interactions of integral membrane proteins. The detergents used to solubilize membrane proteins may give rise to protein aggregates or disrupt normal associations. For these reasons, we chose to conduct oligomerization experiments both in the presence and absence of a variety of detergents. Expression of tagged P-gps in vitro in the absence of microsomal membranes obviates the need for detergent solubilization. To complement this approach, we investigated P-gp oligomerization in vivo, using a number of detergents in an attempt to control for detergent-specific effects. Detergents with differing properties in terms of head groups, hydrocarbon chain length, and critical micellar concentration were used for solubilization. Concentrations of 0.5–4% were used for each detergent, enabling efficient solubilization of P-gp and a wide enough range of concentrations to examine possible artifactual aggregation of the protein. We consistently isolated P-gp as a monomer in vitroand in vivo under all conditions tested. In vivo two-hybrid analysis allowed us to test for possible weak dimerization interactions between cytoplasmic domains on individual molecules as well as intramolecular interactions between the two cytoplasmic domains of a single molecule. The latter type of interaction could have both structural and mechanistic implications. Although the yeast two-hybrid system provides an extremely sensitive assay for interaction, allowing detection of weak and/or transient protein-protein interactions, we were unable to detect interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of P-gp or of CFTR. These results suggest that dimerization does not occur via direct interaction of the cytoplasmic domains of these ABC transporters. In contrast, interaction was observed between TAP1 and TAP2, which represent discrete subunits that upon heterodimerization constitute the four-domain structure present in a single monomer of P-gp or CFTR. While a monomer is apparently sufficient for P-gp activity (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27488-27492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), TAP activity requires both the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits, each consisting of one membrane domain and one cytoplasmic domain (NBD). The interaction of TAP cytoplasmic domains suggests that these regions may be directly involved in TAP1/TAP2 dimerization. The absence of cytoplasmic domain interaction for P-gp is consistent with the low resolution structure of P-gp (12Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10685-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in which two distinct lobes, predicted to be the two cytoplasmic domains, are observed. However, intramolecular interactions between cytoplasmic domains of P-gp may occur under certain conditions, as implied by the weak interaction that we observe when a pseudo-phosphorylated form of cytoplasmic domain 1 is used in interaction assays. A recent study (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) suggests that, at least during part of the reaction cycle, the two nucleotide-binding domains of P-gp are in close proximity to one another, as they could be chemically cross-linked. Interestingly, the cross-linking only occurred at 37 °C and was inhibited by ATP, suggesting a role for structural flexibility and substrate-induced conformational change. Our data suggest a model in which four-domain ABC transporters, such as P-gp and CFTR, are normally monomeric, whereas two-domain ABC transporters, such as TAP, may dimerize through direct protein-protein interaction to form a paradigmatic, four-domain ABC protein. However, the data do not rule out the possibility that four-domain transporters may oligomerize through indirect interaction. A recent paper by Wang and colleagues (23Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) identifies a protein, CAP70, which interacts with CFTR, facilitating oligomerization and modulating CFTR channel activity. This interaction requires both ATP and phosphorylation of the R domain and yields a more active channel configuration. Likewise, P-gp may be regulated by oligomerization in response to effectors or via specific binding proteins. Such interactions may account for at least some of the cases in which apparent P-gp oligomers have been observed. The two-hybrid interaction reagents were the generous gift of Lauren Ha and Roger Brent."
