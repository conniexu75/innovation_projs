https://openalex.org/W2063091092,"Calibration of the geological time scale is achieved by independent radioisotopic and astronomical dating, but these techniques yield discrepancies of ∼1.0% or more, limiting our ability to reconstruct Earth history. To overcome this fundamental setback, we compared astronomical and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages of tephras in marine deposits in Morocco to calibrate the age of Fish Canyon sanidine, the most widely used standard in 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology. This calibration results in a more precise older age of 28.201 ± 0.046 million years ago (Ma) and reduces the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method's absolute uncertainty from ∼2.5 to 0.25%. In addition, this calibration provides tight constraints for the astronomical tuning of pre-Neogene successions, resulting in a mutually consistent age of ∼65.95 Ma for the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2060221489,"The safe and effective delivery of RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics remains an important challenge for clinical development. The diversity of current delivery materials remains limited, in part because of their slow, multi-step syntheses. Here we describe a new class of lipid-like delivery molecules, termed lipidoids, as delivery agents for RNAi therapeutics. Chemical methods were developed to allow the rapid synthesis of a large library of over 1,200 structurally diverse lipidoids. From this library, we identified lipidoids that facilitate high levels of specific silencing of endogenous gene transcripts when formulated with either double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) or single-stranded antisense 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe) oligoribonucleotides targeting microRNA (miRNA). The safety and efficacy of lipidoids were evaluated in three animal models: mice, rats and nonhuman primates. The studies reported here suggest that these materials may have broad utility for both local and systemic delivery of RNA therapeutics."

In angiosperms, comparisons of gene arrangements are complicated by recurring polyploidy and extensive genome rearrangement. New genome sequences and improved analytical approaches are clarifying angiosperm evolution and revealing patterns of differential gene loss after genome duplication and differential gene retention associated with evolution of some morphological complexity. Because of variability in DNA substitution rates among taxa and genes, deviation from collinearity might be a more reliable phylogenetic character."
https://openalex.org/W2108698786,"Human cancers often carry many somatically acquired genomic rearrangements, some of which may be implicated in cancer development. However, conventional strategies for characterizing rearrangements are laborious and low-throughput and have low sensitivity or poor resolution. We used massively parallel sequencing to generate sequence reads from both ends of short DNA fragments derived from the genomes of two individuals with lung cancer. By investigating read pairs that did not align correctly with respect to each other on the reference human genome, we characterized 306 germline structural variants and 103 somatic rearrangements to the base-pair level of resolution. The patterns of germline and somatic rearrangement were markedly different. Many somatic rearrangements were from amplicons, although rearrangements outside these regions, notably including tandem duplications, were also observed. Some somatic rearrangements led to abnormal transcripts, including two from internal tandem duplications and two fusion transcripts created by interchromosomal rearrangements. Germline variants were predominantly mediated by retrotransposition, often involving AluY and LINE elements. The results demonstrate the feasibility of systematic, genome-wide characterization of rearrangements in complex human cancer genomes, raising the prospect of a new harvest of genes associated with cancer using this strategy."
https://openalex.org/W1996071650,"Polyploidy, a change whereby the entire chromosome set is multiplied, arises through mitotic or meiotic misdivisions and frequently involves unreduced gametes and interspecific hybridization. The success of newly formed angiosperm polyploids is partly attributable to their highly plastic genome structure, as manifested by tolerance to changing chromosome numbers (aneuploidy and polyploidy), genome size, (retro)transposable element mobility, insertions, deletions, and epigenome restructuring. The ability to withstand large-scale changes, frequently within one or a few generations, is associated with a restructuring of the transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome and can result in an altered phenotype and ecology. Thus, polyploid-induced changes can generate individuals that are able to exploit new niches or to outcompete progenitor species. This process has been a major driving force behind the divergence of the angiosperms and their biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2080927554,"Viruses employ many different strategies to enter host cells. Vaccinia virus, a prototype poxvirus, enters cells in a pH-dependent fashion. Live cell imaging showed that fluorescent virus particles associated with and moved along filopodia to the cell body, where they were internalized after inducing the extrusion of large transient membrane blebs. p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) was activated by the virus, and the endocytic process had the general characteristics of macropinocytosis. The induction of blebs, the endocytic event, and infection were all critically dependent on the presence of exposed phosphatidylserine in the viral membrane, which suggests that vaccinia virus uses apoptotic mimicry to enter cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039064403,"Little is known about the way developmental cues affect how cells interpret their environment. We characterized the transcriptional response to high salinity of different cell layers and developmental stages of the Arabidopsis root and found that transcriptional responses are highly constrained by developmental parameters. These transcriptional changes lead to the differential regulation of specific biological functions in subsets of cell layers, several of which correspond to observable physiological changes. We showed that known stress pathways primarily control semiubiquitous responses and used mutants that disrupt epidermal patterning to reveal cell-layer–specific and inter–cell-layer effects. By performing a similar analysis using iron deprivation, we identified common cell-type–specific stress responses and revealed the crucial role the environment plays in defining the transcriptional outcome of cell-fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W1984402172,"Recently, certain lots of heparin have been associated with an acute, rapid onset of serious side effects indicative of an allergic-type reaction. To identify potential causes for this sudden rise in side effects, we examined lots of heparin that correlated with adverse events using orthogonal high-resolution analytical techniques. Through detailed structural analysis, the contaminant was found to contain a disaccharide repeat unit of glucuronic acid linked beta1-->3 to a beta-N-acetylgalactosamine. The disaccharide unit has an unusual sulfation pattern and is sulfated at the 2-O and 3-O positions of the glucuronic acid as well as at the 4-O and 6-O positions of the galactosamine. Given the nature of this contaminant, traditional screening tests cannot differentiate between affected and unaffected lots. Our analysis suggests effective screening methods that can be used to determine whether or not heparin lots contain the contaminant reported here."
https://openalex.org/W2086758397,"We have assembled a proteome map for Arabidopsis thaliana from high-density, organ-specific proteome catalogs that we generated for different organs, developmental stages, and undifferentiated cultured cells. We matched 86,456 unique peptides to 13,029 proteins and provide expression evidence for 57 gene models that are not represented in the TAIR7 protein database. Analysis of the proteome identified organ-specific biomarkers and allowed us to compile an organ-specific set of proteotypic peptides for 4105 proteins to facilitate targeted quantitative proteomics surveys. Quantitative information for the identified proteins was used to establish correlations between transcript and protein accumulation in different plant organs. The Arabidopsis proteome map provides information about genome activity and proteome assembly and is available as a resource for plant systems biology."

https://openalex.org/W2066951766,"Suppression of immune responses by regulatory T cells (Tregs) is thought to limit late stages of pathogen-specific immunity as a means of minimizing associated tissue damage. We examined a role for Tregs during mucosal herpes simplex virus infection in mice, and observed an accelerated fatal infection with increased viral loads in the mucosa and central nervous system after ablation of Tregs. Although augmented interferon production was detected in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) in Treg-deprived mice, it was profoundly reduced at the infection site. This was associated with a delay in the arrival of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and T cells to the site of infection and a sharp increase in proinflammatory chemokine levels in the dLNs. Our results suggest that Tregs facilitate early protective responses to local viral infection by allowing a timely entry of immune cells into infected tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2077492907,"The cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), converts naive T cells into regulatory T cells that prevent autoimmunity. However, in the presence of interleukin (IL)-6, TGF-β1 has also been found to promote differentiation into IL-17-producing helper T (Th17) cells that are deeply involved in autoimmunity and inflammation. However, it has not been clarified how TGF-β1 and IL-6 determine such a distinct fate. Here we found that a master regulator for Th17, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), was rapidly induced by TGF-β1 regardless of the presence of IL-6. IL-6 reduced Foxp3 expression, and overexpression of Foxp3 in a T cell line resulted in a strong reduction of IL-17A expression. We have characterized the IL-17A promoter and found that RORγt binding is sufficient for activation of the minimum promoter in the HEK 293T cells. RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activation was suppressed by forced expression of Foxp3. Foxp3 directly interacted with RORγt through exon 2 region of Foxp3. The exon 2 region and forkhead (FKH) domain of Foxp3 were necessary for the suppression of RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activation. We propose that induction of Foxp3 is the mechanism for the suppression of Th17 and polarization into inducible Treg.

Upon stimulation by antigens, Th cells undergo distinct developmental pathways, attaining specialized properties and effector functions. CD4+ T cells are traditionally thought to differentiate into Th1 and Th2 cell subsets (1Mosmann T.R. Coffman R.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 145-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (6863) Google Scholar). Recently, a third subset of the polarized T cell subset Th17, characterized by the production of IL-17A, was identified and found to play an important role in autoimmune diseases, elimination of extracellular bacteria, and cancer (2Kikly K.

Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2007; 26: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Th17 differentiation of naive T cells is initiated by IL-6 and TGF-β1 (6Mangan P.R. Harrington L.E. O'Quinn D.B. Helms W.S. Bullard D.C. Elson C.O. Hatton R.D. Wahl S.M. Schoeb T.R. Weaver C.T. Nature. 2006; 441: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar, 7Bettelli E.

In addition, IL-23 as well as IL-21 are thought to be a key cytokine for the maturation and/or maintenance of Th17 cells (9McKenzie B.S. Kastelein R.A. Cua D.J. Trends. Immunol. 2006; 27: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 10Nurieva R. Yang X.O. Martinez G. Zhang Y. Panopoulos A.D. Ma L. Schluns K. Tian Q. Watowich S.S.

Nature. 2007; 448: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β1 is a suppressor of Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and drives the conversion of naive T cells to Foxp3-positive Th cells with a regulatory phenotype, so-called inducible regulatory T cells (iTreg) (12Chen W. Jin W. Hardegen N. Lei K.J. Li L. Marinos N. McGrady G. Wahl S.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the presence or absence of proinflammatory cytokines might lead to opposing immune consequences induced by TGF-β1. RORγt has been shown to direct Th17 cell differentiation by inducing the IL-23 receptor (13Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R. Cell. 2006; 126: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). However, it has not been clarified whether RORγt is directly involved in IL-17A transcription. RORγt could be a STAT3 target since Th17 was not induced in STAT3-deficient T cells (14Yang X.O. Panopoulos A.D. Nurieva R. Chang S.H. Wang D. Watowich S.S. Dong C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9358-9363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). STAT3 binding to the RORγt promoter may enhance its expression. However, it has been reported that RORγt can be induced in CD4+ T cells in response to TGF-β1 (15Zhou L. Ivanov I.I. Spolski R. Min R. Shenderov K. Egawa T. Levy D.E. Leonard W.J. Littman D.R. Nat. Immun. 2007; 8: 967-974Crossref Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Despite the existence of RORγt, naive T cells activated by TGF-β1 alone differentiate into iTreg but not Th17. The mechanism in which Th17 development is suppressed by TGF-β1 alone has not been clarified. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs are crucial for the maintenance of immunological tolerance (16Schwartz R.H. Nat. Immun. 2005; 6: 327-330Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Hori S. Nomura T. Sakaguchi S. Science. 2003; 299: 1057-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Treg produced in the thymus (naturally occurring Treg) constitutes 3–6% of CD4+ T cells (18Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3983-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that Foxp3 is induced in CD4+Foxp3– T cells after stimulation with TGF-β1 (19Zheng S.G. Wang J.H. Gray J.D. Soucier H. Horwitz D.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 20Fu S. Zhang N. Yopp A.C. Chen D. Mao M. Chen D. Zhang H. Ding Y. Bromberg J.S. Am. J. Transplant. 2004; 4: 1614-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Foxp3 functions as a transcriptional repressor for various transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NF-κB, and Runx1 (21Bettelli E. Dastrange M. Oukka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5138-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 22Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D.

Tsukada T. Sakaguchi S. Nature. 2007; 446: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), which could be a part of the mechanisms for Foxp3-medaited suppression of immune responses. In this study, using promoter analysis, we found that RORγt potently up-regulates IL-17A reporter activity without any other factors such as NFAT. We identified the two conserved ROR-responsive elements (ROREs) on the IL-17A promoter, which are essential for RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activation. Interestingly, we found that IL-6 is not necessary for the induction of RORγt; TGF-β1 alone can up-regulate RORγtin primary naive T cells as well as the EL4 T cell line. IL-6 rather suppressed Foxp3 expression in TGF-β1-treated naive T cells. Thus, we hypothesized that Foxp3 negatively regulates IL-17A transcription. We found that overexpression of Foxp3 reduced IL-17A expression in the EL4 cells and inhibited RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity in the HEK 293T cells. This suppression was partly dependent on the physical interaction between RORγt and Foxp3. Our study provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of Th17 development by Foxp3. Mice—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Six- to twelve-week-old mice were used as experimental animals. All experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Kyusyu University. Plasmid Constructions—PCR was done to generate the IL-17A promoter plasmid by using mouse genomic DNA as a template. In the case of IL-17A promoter, an ∼6-kb fragment corresponding to nucleotides from –6021 to +37 relative to the determined transcriptional staring site of IL-17A gene was subcloned into pGV-basic 2 vector (TOYOINKI). Series of deletion mutants were generated by restriction enzyme digestion (–1812, –613, –301) or by PCR (–239, –153, –115, –94). The deletion mutants, –1812, –613, and –301, were constructed by the use of the restriction sites Bpu1102I, SpeI, and PstI, respectively. The point mutations (TGCAAT or GTTGTA) in a putative RORE-1 (TGACCT) and RORE-2 (GTGTCA) were introduced by PCR. The point mutants were generated by using –239 plasmid as a template. The mouse RORγt cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and was subcloned into pCMVT7 vector for T7 tag. The Foxp3 mutants were subcloned into pCMV14 vector (Sigma) for FLAG tag. A constitutively activated TGF-β receptor I (CA-TβRI) was provided from Dr. Joan Massagué and described previously (24Takaki H. Minoda Y. Koga K. Takaesu G. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 871-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transfection into HEK 293T cells and EL4 cells and luciferase assay were described previously (15Zhou L. Ivanov I.I.

Naive T Cell Preparation and Differentiation—CD4+CD25– T cells were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes by negative selection using magnetic beads (Milteny Biotech) (typically >95% purity). For Th17 differentiation, 1 × 106 CD4+CD25– T cells were cultured with 1 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 antibody (Ab) (clone 145-2C11) and 0.5 μg/ml soluble anti-CD28 Ab (eBioscience) in the presence of 0.2 ng/ml recombinant murine IL-2 (Peprotech) and 10 μg/ml anti-interferon-γ Ab, 10 μg/ml anti-IL-4 Ab in the presence of 2 ng/ml recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) and 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (R&D Systems). IL-6 was omitted for iTreg differentiation condition. Cell surface marker and intracellular cytokine staining were performed as described (25Matsumura Y. Kobayashi T. Ichiyama K. Yoshida R. Hashimoto M. Takimoto T. Tanaka K. Chinen T. Shichita T. Wyss-Coray T. Sato K. Yoshimura A. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cell sorting was performed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter Aria (BD Biosciences) as described (26Kinjyo I. Inoue H. Hamano S. Fukuyama S. Yoshimura T. Koga K. Takaki H. Himeno K. Takaesu G. Kobayashi T. Yoshimura A. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1021-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—The cells were lysed in RNAiso (Takara) for RNA preparation. RT-PCR was performed with a standard procedure. The expression level of GAPDH was first evaluated as an internal control. The primer sequences were as follows: GAPDH, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′ and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′; TGF-β1, 5′-TAA TGG TGG ACC GCA ACA ACG C-3′ and 5′-GAC GGA ATA CAG GGC TTT CG-3′; Foxp3, 5′-CAC CCA GGA AAG ACA GCA ACC-3′ and 5′-GCA AGA GCT CTT GTC CAT TGA-3′; RORγt, 5′-ACC TCC ACT GCC AGC TGT GTG CTG TC-3′ and 5′-TCA TTT CTG CAC TTC TGC ATG TAG ACT GTC CC-3′; IL-17A, 5′-CAG CAG CGA TCA TCC CTC AAA G-3′ and 5′-CAG GAC CAG GAT CTC TTG CTG-3′. Real-time PCR was performed on cDNA samples using the SYBR Green system (Applied Biosystems). The relative quantitation value is expressed as 2–ΔCt, where ΔCt is the difference between the mean Ct value of triplicates of the sample and of the endogenous GAPDH control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed using ChIP-IT express (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal rabbit anti-T7 tag Ab (Medical & Biological Laboratories) or polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for acetylated histone H4 Ab (catalog number 06-866, Upstate Biotechnology) and protein G magnetic beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The DNA-histone complexes were incubated for 15 min at 94 °C for reverse cross-linking and then treated with protease K. Purified DNA fragments were subjected to PCR. The PCR addressed for the IL-17A promoter region –52 to –246 and was performed using the following primers: 5′-GCA GCT CTG CTC AGC TTC TA-3′ and 5′-GGG CTT TTC TCC TTC TGT GG-3′. The PCR products were visualized using an ethidium bromide gel. Statistical Analyses—The Student's paired two-tailed t test was used. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. All error bars shown in the figures in this article are S.D. RORγt and Foxp3 Are Simultaneously Induced by TGF-β1in Naive T Cells—As reported previously, Foxp3 was induced in naive T cells in response to TGF-β1 (iTreg condition), whereas IL-17A was induced and Foxp3 was reduced in response to TGF-β1 plus IL-6 (Th17 condition) (Fig. 1A). However, the molecular basis in which IL-17A production is regulated has not been clarified. It has been proposed that TGF-β1 plus IL-6 induces RORγt, which in turn induces IL-17A transcription. However, several reports raised the possibility that TGF-β1 alone also induces the expression of both Foxp3 and RORγtin TCR-activated CD4+ T cells (15Zhou L. Ivanov I.I. Spolski R. Min R. Shenderov K. Egawa T. Levy D.E. Leonard W.J. Littman D.R. Nat. Immun. 2007; 8: 967-974Crossref Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Therefore, both Foxp3 and RORγt are expressed simultaneously in a single cell in the early phase of CD4+ T cell differentiation. To analyze the relationship between Foxp3 and RORγt expression and IL-17A transcription, we investigated the time-dependent expression patterns under the iTreg or Th17 condition using RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). In agreement with previous studies (15Zhou L. Ivanov I.I. Spolski R. Min R. Shenderov K. Egawa T. Levy D.E. Leonard W.J. Littman D.R. Nat. Immun. 2007; 8: 967-974Crossref Scopus (1685) Google Scholar), we found that TGF-β1 simultaneously induced the expression of RORγt and Foxp3 in CD4+CD25– T cells (Fig. 1B). IL-17A mRNA was induced under both Th17 and iTreg conditions; however, the Th17 condition induced much higher levels of IL-17A than the iTreg condition. Importantly, RORγt mRNA was induced within 24 h of stimulation regardless of the presence or absence of IL-6. Foxp3 mRNA was detected 24 h after stimulation and reached a plateau at 48 h. IL-6 reduced the expression levels of Foxp3 at 48–72 h. This is probably a direct effect of IL-6 on the Foxp3 promoter because IL-6 suppressed TGF-β1-mediated Foxp3 promoter activity in primary T cells (data not shown). These data suggest that IL-17A levels were not simply determined by RORγt levels. Since Foxp3 and IL-17A expression seem to show opposing kinetics, we investigated the possibility that Foxp3 negatively regulates RORγt-mediated IL-17A expression. RORγt Up-regulates the IL-17A Transcription—To identify the regulatory mechanism of IL-17A transcription, we developed a simple reporter system with the use of the HEK 293T cell line. First, we cloned an ∼6-kb DNA fragment upstream of the ATG initiation codon of the IL-17A gene using the mouse genomic data base. Next, this IL-17A promoter region was subcloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (termed mIL17p(–6021)-Luc) (Fig. 2A). This IL-17A promoter was activated by an anti-CD3 Ab in the EL4 cells (Fig. 2A). EL4 is a tumor cell line but maintains many T-cell properties and expresses RORγt constitutively (Fig. 3A). Then, IL-17A promoter activity was examined with or without an RORγt expression vector in the HEK 293T cells in which RORγt was not expressed. In the presence of RORγt, the promoter activity was significantly increased (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 3Foxp3 suppresses the RORγt-induced IL-17A expression. A, the expression of various mRNAs in EL4 cell line was determined by RT-PCR. Cells were cultured with or without anti-CD3 Ab for 24 h. B and C, HEK 293T cells were transfected with IL-17A promoter and RORγt (B) or Smad-binding element (SBE) promoter and CA-TβRI (C) along with the indicated amount of Foxp3 cDNA.

Relative intensity was evaluated by normalizing with input intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To define the RORγt binding sites within the IL-17A promoter, we generated a series of truncation mutants at the 5′ end of the promoter (Fig. 2B). These constructs were assayed for promoter activity in the HEK 293T cells co-transfected with or without RORγt. The truncations deleting the 5′ to –153-bp did not markedly affect on the RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity. However, a further 38-bp deletion (mIL17p(–115)-Luc) significantly reduced IL-17A promoter activity, and an additional 21-bp deletion (–mIL17p(–94)-Luc) almost completely abrogated the RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the region from –153 to –94 contains ROREs. RORE has been shown to consist of the consensus core motif AGGTCA preceded by a 5-bp A/T-rich sequence (27Jetten A.M. Kurebayashi S. Ueda E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 205-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, there are two potential ROREs (termed RORE-1 and RORE-2) within this region. These two ROREs and surrounding regions are highly conserved between rodent and human (Fig. 2C), suggesting an important, evolutionarily conserved function of this region. RORγt Directly Binds to RORE1/2 of the IL-17A Promoter—To confirm the importance of these two ROREs, we introduced mutations into these two sites. As expected, mutations in one of the two ROREs severely impaired the RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity, and mutations in both ROREs completely abrogated the RORγt-mediated promoter activity (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that these two ROREs are essential for RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity. To verify that RORγt actually binds to the ROREs within the IL-17A promoter, we examined the binding of RORγt to this region by ChIP analysis. HEK 293T cells were transfected with RORγt cDNA, and then nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-RORγt Ab. DNA co-precipitated with RORγt was amplified by PCR with primers containing the region –153 to –94. As shown in Fig. 2E, RORγt was shown to bind to the IL-17A promoter area. In addition, histone H4 molecules were more highly acetylated in the presence of RORγt than in the absence of RORγt. Taken together, these data indicate that RORγt up-regulates the IL-17A expression by directly binding to the IL-17A promoter region containing RORE-1/2. Forced Expression of Foxp3 Suppresses the IL-17A Expression in EL4 Cells—To investigate the effect of Foxp3 on IL-17A expression, we then examined the levels of IL-17A in EL4 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, EL4 cells constitutively expressed RORγt, and IL-17A mRNA was induced by anti-CD3 Ab stimulation. Stable expression of Foxp3 consistently reduced the expression levels of IL-17A. Neither expression of RORγt nor expression of TGF-β1 was affected by Foxp3 overexpression. Thus, these data indicate that Foxp3 specifically inhibits IL-17A mRNA expression. To define the suppressive mechanism of IL-17A expression by Foxp3, we investigated whether Foxp3 expression affects the RORγt-mediated IL-17A transcription in the HEK 293T cells. As expected, Foxp3 strongly suppressed RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). However, Foxp3 did not affect CA-TβRI-mediated Smad transcriptional activity assayed with a Smad-binding element reporter (SBE) (Fig. 3C). Similarly, leukemia inhibitory factorinduced STAT3 transcriptional activity was not affected by Foxp3 (data not shown). Then, we examined whether Foxp3 interferes with the association of RORγt with RORE-1/2 in the IL-17A promoter. Intriguingly, ChIP assay revealed that Foxp3 expression reduced RORγt binding as well as acetylation of histone H4 in the IL-17A promoter RORE-1/2 region (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that Foxp3 can specifically inhibit RORγt-mediated IL-17A transcription by reducing RORγt binding to the IL-17A promoter. Foxp3 Suppresses RORγt Function by Physical Interaction—It has been shown that Foxp3 specifically represses the NFAT/activating protein-1 (AP-1)-driven transcription and forms a cooperative complex with NFAT on DNA (22Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A. Cell. 2006; 126: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). However, we could not observe any direct binding of Foxp3 to the IL-17A promoter (data not shown). Since Foxp3 inhibited the minimum IL-17A promoter (–153-Luc) (data not shown), which does not contain any Foxp3 binding elements, we hypothesized that Foxp3 inhibits the RORγt function by direct physical interaction with RORγt. To test this hypothesis, we carried out immunoprecipitation and reporter assays using a series of Foxp3 deletion mutants (Fig. 4A). We detected strong interaction between wild-type Foxp3 and RORγt. The FOXP3 protein encodes several functional domains, including a C2H2 zinc finger (ZnF), a leucine zipper (Zip), and a winged-helix/forkhead (FKH) domain. It has been shown that the N-terminal 188 amino acids and FKH domain are essential for the suppression activity of Foxp3. The Zip motif has been shown to be necessary for homodimerization (28Lopes J.E. Torgerson T.R. Schubert L.A. Anover S.D. Ocheltree E.L. Ochs H.D. Ziegler S.F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); however, the role of ZnF has not been clarified. Interestingly, an N-terminal region corresponding to the exon 2 region of Foxp3 (Δ2) was necessary for interaction with RORγt. However, the other regions, namely the ZnF, Zip, and FKH domains, were unnecessary (Fig. 4A). A reporter assay revealed that the exon 2 region as well as the FKH domain was necessary for the suppression of RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activation (Fig. 4B). This was confirmed in endogenous IL-17A induction in EL4 cells. EL4 cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) Foxp3 or mutants cDNAs linked to internal ribosomal entry site-enhanced green fluorescent protein. After sorting the green fluorescent protein-positive cells, IL-17A expression was measured by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4C, transient overexpression of WT Foxp3, but not Δ2 or ΔFKH, inhibited induction of IL-17A transcription (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these observations suggest that Foxp3 interacts with RORγt in the exon 2 region and that the FKH domain plays a critical role in the suppression of RORγt-mediated IL-17A transcription. IL-17A is a signature cytokine of Th17, a new subset of helper T cells. It has been demonstrated that forced expression of RORγt is sufficient for the expression of IL-17A (Th17 differentiation) in T cells (13Ivanov I.I. McKenzie B.S. Zhou L. Tadokoro C.E. Lepelley A. Lafaille J.J. Cua D.J. Littman D.R. Cell. 2006; 126: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3988) Google Scholar). Recently, RORα has also been shown to induce IL-17A in T cells (29Yang X.O. Pappu B.P. Nurieva R. Akimzhanov A. Kang H.S. Chung Y. Ma L. Shah B. Panopoulos A.D. Schluns K.S. Watowich S.S. Tian Q. Jetten A.M. Dong C. Immunity. 2008; 28: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the activation of the IL-17A promoter by RORγt and its regulation by cytokines have not been clarified. This is the first report on characterization of the IL-17A promoter in vitro. IL-6 was necessary for the induction of IL-17A expression (Fig. 1A). It has been thought that IL-6 is necessary because it induces RORγt in collaboration with TGF-β1. However, we and others found that RORγt is induced by TGF-β1 alone. We noticed that reduced expression of Foxp3 was inversely correlated with IL-17A expression, whereas RORγt levels were not directly correlated with IL-17A expression. Therefore, we suspected that RORγt is essential for the induction of IL-17A, whereas Foxp3 may negatively regulate IL-17A expression in iTregs. This was confirmed by overexpression of Foxp3 in EL4 cells in which RORγt is constitutively expressed (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we showed that Foxp3 overexpression suppressed RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activity (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we propose that one of the functions of IL-6 on Th17 induction is the suppression of Foxp3 expression. So how does IL-6 suppress Foxp3 induction? We have reported that TGF-β can activate 10.2-kb Foxp3 promoter in EL4 cells and that IL-4/STAT6 inhibits this promoter activation (30Takaki H. Ichiyama K. Koga K. Chinen T. Takaesu G. Sugiyama Y. Kato S. Yoshimura A. Kobayashi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We showed that STAT6 directly bound to the Foxp3 promoter and suppressed the Foxp3 promoter activation. However, unfortunately, we could not see any effects of IL-6 or activated STAT3 on the Foxp3 promoter activation in EL4 cells as well as primary T cells. In addition, IL-6 as well as STAT3C (active form of STAT3) overexpression did not inhibit TGF-β-mediated Smad transcriptional activity. Therefore, unlike STAT6, we still could not understand how STAT3 suppresses TGF-β-mediated Foxp3 induction. There is a possibility that the STAT3 binding site was not included in our 10.2-kb promoter. Alternatively, epigenetic alternations on the promoter region may be induced by STAT3. We also could not rule out the possibility that genes induced by STAT3 are involved in STAT3 repression. Further study is necessary for clarifying the mechanism of Foxp3 repression by IL-6. Although the molecular mechanism for the suppression of Foxp3 by IL-6/STAT3 remains to be clarified, we propose a novel mechanism for the regulation of IL-17A expression by IL-6. IL-6 suppresses Foxp3 expression, and thus, RORγt is able to activate the IL-17A promoter. In this study, we established a simple reporter system that facilitates analysis of the regulatory mechanism of IL-17A transcription in the HEK 293T cells. This is the first demonstration that RORγt functions as a direct transcriptional activator of IL-17A. Since HEK 293T cells can be used for high throughput screening, this system may be useful for identifying genes that modify IL-17A promoter activity. Using these systems, we demonstrated that Foxp3 suppressed RORγt-mediated IL-17A promoter activation by a physical interaction. Recent reports have shown that Foxp3 interacted with NFAT and suppressed the effector functions of Th cells by inhibiting the activity of NFAT (22Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A. Cell. 2006; 126: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Foxp3 has also been shown to inhibit NF-κB transcriptional activity (21Bettelli E. Dastrange M. Oukka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5138-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may be present for the suppression of RORγt by Foxp3. Interestingly, the interaction between Foxp3 and NFAT is reported to be dependent on the FKH domain (22Wu Y. Borde M. Heissmeyer V. Feuerer M. Lapan A.D. Stroud J.C. Bates D.L. Guo L. Han A. Ziegler S.F. Mathis D. Benoist C. Chen L. Rao A. Cell. 2006; 126: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar), whereas we found that association between Foxp3 and RORγt was dependent on the exon 2 region. However, the FKH domain was still required for the suppression of RORγt activity. Thus, Foxp3 inhibits RORγt by direct binding through the exon 2 region and inhibits transcriptional activity of RORγt through the FKH domain. It has been reported that the FKH domain is essential for nuclear localization and repressor functions as well as DNA binding ability of Foxp3 (28Lopes J.E. Torgerson T.R. Schubert L.A. Anover S.D. Ocheltree E.L. Ochs H.D. Ziegler S.F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31Schubert L.A. Jeffery E. Zhang Y. Ramsdell F. Ziegler S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37672-37679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In addition, a large cohort study revealed that mutations in patients with immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome were clustered primarily within the FKH domain and the leucine zipper but were also present within the N-terminal portion of the protein. Lopes et al. (28Lopes J.E. Torgerson T.R. Schubert L.A. Anover S.D. Ocheltree E.L. Ochs H.D. Ziegler S.F. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) identified a novel function of the N-terminal region, which is required for FOXP3-mediated repression of transcription as well as repressor function. The N-terminal region may be important for interaction with transcription factors including RORγt. In contrast, we found that deletion of the zinc finger and leucine zipper motifs did not severely impair suppression of IL-17A transcription. Therefore, the mechanism of the transcriptional repressor function of Foxp3 may vary according to the transcription factors that interact with Foxp3. In conclusion, we propose a novel mechanism for regulation of IL-17A expression by TGF-β1 and IL-6. TGF-β1 is important for the induction of RORγt, whereas IL-6 is necessary to suppress expression of the transcriptional repressor Foxp3. Foxp3 also may also regulate Th1 and Th2 through a similar mechanism. We thank Dr. M. Kubo for providing the EL4 cell line. We also thank T. Yoshioka and M. Ohtsu for technical assistance and Y.

Inhibitor design has usually focused on active-site binding, neglecting the subcellular localization of active enzyme. We have addressed this issue by synthesizing a membrane-anchored version of a β-secretase transition-state inhibitor by linking it to a sterol moiety. Thus, we targeted the inhibitor to active β-secretase found in endosomes and also reduced the dimensionality of the inhibitor, increasing its local membrane concentration. This inhibitor reduced enzyme activity much more efficiently than did the free inhibitor in cultured cells and in vivo. In addition to effectively targeting β-secretase, this strategy could also be used in designing potent drugs against other membrane protein targets."

The continuous injection of sulfur into the stratosphere has been suggested as a “geoengineering” scheme to counteract global warming. We use an empirical relationship between ozone depletion and chlorine activation to estimate how this approach might influence polar ozone. An injection of sulfur large enough to compensate for surface warming caused by the doubling of atmospheric CO 2 would strongly increase the extent of Arctic ozone depletion during the present century for cold winters and would cause a considerable delay, between 30 and 70 years, in the expected recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate receptor utilization by BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7 in primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC), a physiologically relevant cell type that probably mediates the in vivo effects of BMPs. RNA interference-mediated gene knockdown revealed that osteoinductive BMP activities in hMSC are elicited through the type I receptors ACVR1A and BMPR1A and the type II receptors ACVR2A and BMPR2. BMPR1B and ACVR2B were expressed at low levels and were not found to play a significant role in signaling by any of the BMPs evaluated in this study. Type II receptor utilization differed significantly between BMP-2/4 and BMP-6/7. A greater reliance on BMPR2 was observed for BMP-2/4 relative to BMP-6/7, whereas ACVR2A was more critical to signaling by BMP-6/7 than BMP-2/4. Significant differences were also observed for the type I receptors. Although BMP-2/4 used predominantly BMPR1A for signaling, ACVR1A was the preferred type I receptor for BMP-6/7. Signaling by both BMP-2/4 and BMP-6/7 was mediated by homodimers of ACVR1A or BMPR1A. A portion of BMP-2/4 signaling also required concurrent BMPR1A and ACVR1A expression, suggesting that BMP-2/4 signal in part through ACVR1A/BMPR1A heterodimers. The capacity of ACVR1A and BMPR1A to form homodimers and heterodimers was confirmed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analyses. These results suggest different mechanisms for BMP-2/4- and BMP-6/7-induced osteoblastic differentiation in primary hMSC."

https://openalex.org/W2052427120,"Accumulation of senile plaques composed of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), and Abeta is generated through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase. Although oxidative stress has been implicated in the AD pathogenesis by inducing Abeta production, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that the pro-oxidant H(2)O(2) promotes Abeta production through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent activation of gamma-secretase. Treatment with H(2)O(2) induced significant increase in the levels of intracellular and secreted Abeta in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Although gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP or C99 was enhanced upon H(2)O(2) treatment, expression of APP or its alpha/beta-secretase-mediated cleavage was not affected. Silencing of the stress-activated JNK by small interfering RNA or the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced H(2)O(2)-induced gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP. JNK activity was augmented in human brain tissues from AD patients and active JNK located surrounding the senile plaques in the brain of AD model mouse.

CHIP functions as an important link between the molecular chaperone system and the protein degradation system.

Construct Generation—The two constructs utilized in the present study were GN-αSyn and αSynGC (previously referred to as GN-link-αSyn and αSynGC) (19Outeiro T.F. Putcha P. Tetzlaff J.E. Spoelgen R. Koker M. Carvalho F. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). αSyn bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) constructs were generated by PCR, cloned into pcDNA3.1, and verified by DNA sequencing as described previously (19Outeiro T.F. Putcha P. Tetzlaff J.E. Spoelgen R. Koker M. Carvalho F. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For CHIP expression, pcDNA3-CHIP, pcDNA3-CHIPΔU (residues 196–303 deleted), and pcDNA3-CHIPΔTPR (residues 32–144 deleted) constructs were utilized and were kind gifts from Dr. Cam Patterson, University of North Carolina School of Medicine (20Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Human H4 neuroglioma cells (HTB-148; ATCC) were maintained in OPTIMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C, 5%CO2. H4 cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection and grown to 80–90% confluency. Cells were transfected with an equimolar ratio of DNA constructs using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-transfection of pcDNA3.1+ vector was used as a control. GN-αSyn/αSynGC Fluorescence Complementation Assay—For optimal fluorophore maturation, transiently transfected cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C (21Hu C.D. Kerppola T.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) after an initial 4-h incubation at 37 °C. 24 h after transfection cells were either observed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope or harvested for cell lysate preparation. Live Cell Imaging—Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslipped 35-mm dishes (MatTek Cultureware, Ashland, MA) and transfected the following day. Cells were imaged 24 h post-transfection on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope system. Cells were observed at ×63 for quantification of pixel intensity. For each experimental group the average fluorescence intensity from 50 cells, across three independent experiments, was measured using Adobe Photoshop® software. Adobe Photoshop® translated the average GFP fluorescence to average pixel intensity. Therefore, the average pixel intensity was recorded for each cell. Data were normalized to empty vector (pcDNA3.1+) controls. Fluorescent-activated Cell Sorting—Cells were plated and transfected in 10-cm dishes. 24 h post transfection, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and the pellet reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting suspension was filtered with cell strainer caps into polypropylene tubes (both from BD Biosciences). Fluorescence was measured on a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. Toxicity Assay—24 h post-transfection levels of toxicity were measured utilizing the ToxiLight™ non-destructive cytotoxicity assay kit (Cambrex, Rockland, ME). This assay quantitatively measures the release of adenylate kinase from damaged cells into the culture medium and was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Detergent Solubility Fractionation and Gel Electrophoresis—After 24 h, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping in cold lysis buffer with or without detergent for SDS-PAGE and native gels, respectively, (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 175 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitor mixture), and sheared once through a 28-gauge needle followed by sonication for 10 s (total cell lysates). Fractionation was performed by adding Triton X-100 (Tx) to total cell lysates (final concentration of 1%) and incubating for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was designated as the Tx-soluble fraction, and the pellet was redissolved in 2% SDS-containing lysis buffer and sonicated for 10 s (Tx-insoluble fraction). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay. 15–40 μgof protein of each cell lysate was loaded onto a 10–20% Tris/glycine gel (Invitrogen) or a Native PAGE Novex 4–16% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) for Western blot analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed with SDS-containing running and sample loading buffer (Invitrogen), whereas native electrophoresis was performed using detergent-free running and sample buffers (Invitrogen). Proteins resolved on the gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 2 h prior to the addition of primary antibody, anti-synuclein (610787, 1:1000; BD Biosciences), or anti-GFP (ab6556, 1:3000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at room temperature for 2 h or 4 °C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:2000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, processed, and quantified. The results were visualized with ECL (GE Healthcare) or SuperSignal Femto (Pierce) chemiluminescent reagents. Denatured blots were probed with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ab9485, 1:3000; Abcam) and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) as a loading control. A nonspecific protein band at ∼150–200 kDa across all samples in the series (Coomassie Blue staining of the gel) served as a loading control for the native blots. ImageJ and ImageQuant were used to quantify optical densities of total, soluble, and insoluble blots and native blots, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, H4 cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3% CHAPS, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation using protein G-agarose and rat anti-Myc antibody (JAC6; Serotec, Oxford, UK) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysate buffer three times and loaded onto 10–20% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked in 5% milk in TBS containing 0.05% TBS-T for 2 h prior to the addition of primary antibody, anti-Hsp70 (SPA-812, 1:10000; StressGen, Ann Arbor, MI), or anti-GFP (ab6556, 1:3000; Abcam) at room temperature for 2 h or 4 °C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, processed, and quantified. The results were visualized with ECL (GE Healthcare). CHIP Reduces αSyn Oligomerization—We have previously shown that CHIP modifies and prevents α-Syn inclusion formation by interacting (either directly or indirectly) with αSyn (22Shin Y. Klucken J. Patterson C. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23727-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To further investigate the specific αSyn species that is targeted by CHIP, we employed a novel BiFC assay that we have previously demonstrated to be a specific and effective method by which to visualize and monitor αSyn oligomerization in vitro (19Outeiro T.F. Putcha P. Tetzlaff J.E. Spoelgen R. Koker M. Carvalho F. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). BiFC involves the reconstitution of non-fluorescent fragments of GFP when fused to proteins of interest. Upon protein-protein interaction the two fragments are able to come together and reconstitute the fluorophore. We investigated the ability of CHIP to reduce αSyn oligomerization by transfecting H4 human neuroglioma cells with the αSyn BiFC constructs αSynGC and GN-αSyn in the presence or absence of CHIP (Fig. 1) and found that CHIP dramatically reduced αSyn oligomerization as measured by intensity of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B). As a control, we confirmed that CHIP had no effect on fluorescence intensity of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Fig. 2, A and B). To confirm that CHIP's prevention of αSyn oligomerization is specific to αSyn, and not EGFP, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments and determined that CHIP did not co-immunoprecipitates with EGFP alone (data not shown).FIGURE 2CHIP and CHIPΔU decrease αSynGC/GN-αSyn pixel intensity (PI).

D, CHIP and the domain mutant CHIPΔU decrease αSynGC/GN-αSyn PI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the effect of CHIP on αSyn oligomerization is specific, we overexpressed domain mutant constructs of CHIP (CHIPΔU and CHIPΔTPR) with αSynGC and GN-αSyn (Fig. 2C) and determined that CHIPΔU, but not CHIPΔTPR, was able to significantly reduce the fluorescence produced by αSyn oligomer formation (Fig. 2D). Because the TPR domain of CHIP is essential for Hsp70 interactions, these data suggest that the CHIP-mediated reduction in αSyn oligomer formation occurs in an Hsp70-associated manner. To quantify the CHIP domain mutant effects, we co-transfected H4 human neuroglioma cells with αSynGC, GN-αSyn, and either empty vector, CHIP, CHIPΔU, or CHIPΔTPR and measured GFP fluorescence intensity with fluorescent-activated cell sorting. In agreement with our observations of GFP pixel intensity (Fig. 2), fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis demonstrated that CHIP and CHIPΔU mediate a reduction in αSyn oligomerization (Fig. 3, A and B). As a control, we verified that CHIP had no effect on αSyn-EGFP fluorescence, confirming that CHIP reduces αSyn oligomer formation in a TPR domain-dependent manner. CHIP Reduces αSyn Oligomer-induced Toxicity—We have shown previously that overexpression of the BiFC pairs αSynGC and GN-αSyn results in increased αSyn oligomerization formation and cytotoxicity (19Outeiro T.F. Putcha P. Tetzlaff J.E. Spoelgen R. Koker M. Carvalho F. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To determine whether CHIP can rescue cytotoxicity conferred by oligomeric αSyn, H4 cells were cotransfected with αSynGC, GN-αSyn, and αSynGC and GN-αSyn together, in the presence or absence of CHIP or its domain mutants (CHIPΔU and CHIPΔTPR), and toxicity was monitored. As expected, CHIP and CHIPΔU rescued toxicity conferred by αSynGC and GN-αSyn coexpression (Fig. 4). By contrast, CHIP had no effect on αSyn toxicity induced by overexpression of individual αSyn constructs, i.e. αSynGC expressed alone (Fig. 4). These data suggest that CHIP preferentially reduces cytotoxicity conferred by a stabilized αSyn oligomeric species and not that of the less toxic, transient αSyn constructs. This experiment also confirmed that the TPR domain is critical for the toxicity-rescuing effects of CHIP because CHIPΔTPR was unable to rescue toxicity. These data are in agreement with CHIP preventing the formation of αSyn oligomers (Figs. 2 and 3). CHIP Preferentially Degrades αSyn Oligomeric Species—To determine the mechanism of CHIP-mediated effects on αSyn, we examined the expression levels of αSyn in the presence or absence of CHIP under two conditions in which oligomeric species are to determine the mechanism of CHIP-mediated effects on αSyn, we examined the expression levels of αSyn in the presence or absence of CHIP under two conditions in which oligomeric species are, 1) less stabilized: αSynGC or GN-αSyn expressed individually or, 2) more stabilized: αSynGC and GN-αSyn expressed together. Total cell lysate and Tx-soluble and Tx-insoluble lysates were prepared. Interestingly, in the total cell lysate fraction, CHIP had only a modest effect on αSyn levels when αSynGC and GN-αSyn were expressed individually (Fig. 5A). However, when the αSyn BiFC proteins were coexpressed, CHIP significantly reduced the protein levels (Fig. 5A). Previous studies have demonstrated that CHIP can shuttle proteins such as mutant tau, huntingtin, and ataxin to different soluble and insoluble cellular compartments (15Petrucelli L. Dickson D. Kehoe K. Taylor J. Snyder H. Grover A. De Lucia M. McGowan E. Lewis J. Prihar G. Kim J. Dillmann W.H. Browne S.E. Hall A. Voellmy R. Tsuboi Y. Dawson T.M. Wolozin B. Hardy J. Hutton M. Hum. Mol.

We found that CHIP had little or no effect on levels of αSyn in the soluble or insoluble fraction when αSynGC and GN-αSyn were expressed individually (Fig. 5, B and C). However, when coexpressed, CHIP degrades αSyn in both the soluble and insoluble fractions (Figs. 5, B and C). CHIP Reduces High Molecular Weight αSyn Oligomeric Species—The co-expression of αSynGC and GN-αSyn results in high molecular weight (HMW) oligomeric species when examined by native Western blot. To determine whether CHIP could degrade HMW αSyn oligomers we co-transfected H4 cells with αSynGC and GN-αSyn with an empty vector (pcDNA), CHIP, CHIPΔU, or CHIPΔTPR. Interestingly, CHIP efficiently degrades the HMW αSyn population. Furthermore, consistent with our previous data, the TPR domain, but not the U-box domain, is critical for this oligomeric degradation because CHIPΔTPR is ineffective (Fig. 6, A and B). CHIP, but Not CHIPΔTPR, Coimmunoprecipitates with Hsp70—CHIP and Hsp70 form a complex between the amino-terminal TPR domain of CHIP and the carboxyl-terminal EEVD motif of Hsp70. Our data indicate that the TPR domain of CHIP is critical for the CHIP-mediated reduction of αSyn oligomers and associated toxicity. To determine whether the association of Hsp70 with CHIP, αSynGC, and GN-αSyn is critical, we co-transfected H4 cells with Hsp70, αSynGC, GN-αSyn, and CHIP or CHIPΔTPR. Both CHIP and CHIPΔTPR coimmunoprecipitate with GN-αSyn and αSynGC; however, only full-length CHIP, and not CHIPΔTPR, coimmunoprecipitates with Hsp70 (Fig. 7). These data imply that Hsp70 is required for the CHIP-mediated reduction of αSyn oligomers and their associated toxicity. CHIP has been shown to mediate the degradation of misfolded proteins associated with Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia, and PD (22Shin Y. Klucken J. Patterson C.

In PD, current thinking identifies αSyn oligomeric species as one of the primary mediators of toxicity (3Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current study we hypothesized that CHIP preferentially targets αSyn oligomers for degradation. The stabilization of αSyn in an oligomeric conformation using the novel BiFC assay leads to an increase in cytotoxicity, which can be rescued by CHIP in an Hsp70-dependent manner. By contrast, CHIP did not rescue the cytotoxicity associated with the more transient αSyn interactions, which suggests that CHIP targets a specific αSyn conformation for degradation. Moreover, CHIP degrades αSyn species in both Tx-100-soluble and Tx-100-insoluble fractions and significantly reduces the formation of HMW αSyn oligomers. These data are consistent with our previous study where overexpression of Hsp70 prevented αSyn oligomerization (19Outeiro T.F. Putcha P. Tetzlaff J.E. Spoelgen R. Koker M. Carvalho F. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We adapted a BiFC assay (28Kumar P. Ambasta R.K. Veereshwarayya V. Rosen K.M. Kosik K.S. Band H. Mestril R. Patterson C. Querfurth H.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 848-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to stabilize and detect the formation of αSyn oligomers (19Outeiro T.F. Putcha P. Tetzlaff J.E. Spoelgen R. Koker M. Carvalho F. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Here we show that CHIP targets an αSyn oligomeric species for degradation. This activity is associated with cytoprotection, consistent with the idea that oligomeric species are toxic moieties (3Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 29Ding T.T. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10209-10217Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The degradative preference of CHIP for the more toxic protein species is also evident in other models of neurodegeneration. For example, CHIP preferentially degrades the more toxic Aβ42, but not the less toxic soluble APP, holoprotein (28Kumar P. Ambasta R.K. Veereshwarayya V. Rosen K.M. Kosik K.S. Band H. Mestril R. Patterson C. Querfurth H.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 848-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CHIP also preferentially inhibits toxicity induced by the more toxic four repeat tau compared with the less toxic three repeat tau (23Hatakeyama S. Matsumoto M. Kamura T. Murayama M. Chui D.H. Planel E. Takahashi R. Nakayama K.I. Takashima A. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, the degradative preference of CHIP for a more toxic αSyn species versus a less toxic αSyn species is consistent with other models of neurodegeneration. The ability of CHIP to affect aggregate formation and degrade disease-causing proteins is well documented as is its modulatory effects on these proteins within soluble and insoluble protein fractions (15Petrucelli L.

This CHIP-mediated decrease in aggregation leads to a decrease in huntingtin protein from the insoluble fraction. Our data, which also show a CHIP-mediated decrease in αSyn from the insoluble fraction, agree with this finding (24Miller V.M. Nelson R.F. Gouvion C.M. Williams A. Rodriguez-Lebron E. Harper S.Q.

To our knowledge, these are the first experiments to investigate the effects of CHIP on oligomer formation in neurodegenerative disease. αSyn-induced toxicity is largely attributed to the formation of αSyn oligomers (3Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7871-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 4Sharon R. Bar-Joseph I. Frosch M.P. Walsh D.M. Hamilton J.A. Selkoe D.J.

J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and therefore, therapeutically, it will be important to reduce their formation and accumulation. Utilizing the BiFC assay to model αSyn oligomer formation, we determined that CHIP reduces the amount of higher order αSyn oligomers. This result has important implications for CHIP and chaperone proteins as a potential therapeutic for αSyn-associated toxicity and also for other models of neurodegeneration where oligomer formation is a contributing causative agent. The mechanism of CHIP-induced protein degradation is not completely understood. It is known that CHIP interacts with Hsp70 via the amino-terminal TPR domain and the EEVD motif of Hsp70. However, it has been postulated that CHIP exhibits intrinsic molecular chaperone activities and can associate with misfolded proteins in an Hsp70-independent manner (30Rosser M.F. Washburn E. Muchowski P.J. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22267-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our data support this hypothesis in that CHIPΔTPR can associate with GN-αSyn and αSynGC in the absence of Hsp70. In further support of this hypothesis, our laboratory has shown that CHIPΔTPR can also associate with misfolded αSyn in the absence of Hsp70 (22Shin Y. Klucken J. Patterson C. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J.

However, while CHIP associates with different αSyn species in an Hsp70-independent manner, we have previously shown that degradation of different αSyn species by CHIP can occur with or without Hsp70 (22Shin Y. Klucken J. Patterson C. Hyman B.T. McLean P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23727-23734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the present study, CHIP degraded αSyn oligomers and reduced toxicity in an Hsp70-dependent manner. These data suggest that CHIP has the ability to process different species of αSyn via different mechanisms. Further experimentation will be required to elucidate the specific degradation mechanisms involved in the CHIP-mediated degradation of oligomeric αSyn. In summary, we have shown that CHIP has the ability to preferentially promote degradation of αSyn oligomeric species from both the soluble and insoluble cellular compartments. We postulate that HMW forms of αSyn are toxic and that the CHIP-mediated reduction in αSyn-induced toxicity is produced by the ability of CHIP to preferentially degrade these toxic αSyn species. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of CHIP-induced toxicity will elucidate more effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease."

How these signals are encoded is poorly understood. We developed transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator G-CaMP2 and analyzed population responses of vomeronasal neurons to urine from individual animals. A substantial portion of cells was activated by either male or female urine, but only a small population of cells responded exclusively to gender-specific cues shared across strains and individuals. Female cues activated more cells and were subject to more complex hormonal regulations than male cues. In contrast to gender, strain and individual information was encoded by the combinatorial activation of neurons such that urine from different individuals activated distinctive cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2060119578,"The asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids on the plasma membrane is critical for maintaining cell integrity and physiology and for regulating intracellular signaling and important cellular events such as clearance of apoptotic cells. How phospholipid asymmetry is established and maintained is not fully understood. We report that the Caenorhabditis elegans P-type adenosine triphosphatase homolog, TAT-1, is critical for maintaining cell surface asymmetry of phosphatidylserine (PS). In animals deficient in tat-1 , PS is abnormally exposed on the cell surface, and normally living cells are randomly lost through a mechanism dependent on PSR-1, a PS-recognizing phagocyte receptor, and CED-1, which contributes to recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells. Thus, tat-1 appears to function in preventing appearance of PS in the outer leaflet of plasma membrane, and ectopic exposure of PS on the cell surface may result in removal of living cells by neighboring phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2159560542,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common noninfectious liver disease in clinical practice, and there is an increasing need for new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this liver disease. Here, we examined the effect of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and the agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor beta isoform (TRbeta), GC-1, on fatty liver and steatohepatitis induced in rodents by a choline-methionine deficient (CMD) diet. Male Fischer 344 rats fed a CMD diet for 1 wk developed a marked fatty liver and mild hepatitis. Concurrent administration of T3 resulted in a complete prevention of the fatty change associated with increased fatty acid mitochondrial and peroxisomal beta-oxidation. To investigate whether T3 could also reverse fully established fatty liver, rats were fed a CMD diet for 10 wk and then cofed T3 for 1 wk. Coadministration of T3 resulted in a complete regression of liver steatosis associated with a decrease of lipid peroxidation, cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and activation of phospho-STAT3 and phospho-SAPK/JNK. Finally, additional experiments showed that GC-1, which has no significant side effects on heart rate, prevented and reverted CMD-induced fat accumulation, and ameliorated steatohepatitis. These results indicate that TR agonists have the potential to inhibit or reverse hepatic steatosis induced by a nutritional model."
https://openalex.org/W2081242345,"Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, has useful medicinal properties but also undesirable side effects. The brain receptor for THC, CB1, is also activated by the endogenous cannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG). Augmentation of endocannabinoid signaling by blockade of their metabolism may offer a more selective pharmacological approach compared with CB1 agonists. Consistent with this premise, inhibitors of the anandamide-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) produce analgesic and anxiolytic effects without cognitive defects. In contrast, we show that dual blockade of the endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and FAAH by selected organophosphorus agents leads to greater than ten-fold elevations in brain levels of both 2-AG and anandamide and to robust CB1-dependent behavioral effects that mirror those observed with CB1 agonists. Arachidonic acid levels are decreased by the organophosphorus agents in amounts equivalent to elevations in 2-AG, which indicates that endocannabinoid and eicosanoid signaling pathways may be coordinately regulated in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2035895258,"During the past two decades, O-GlcNAc modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins has been intensively studied. Nevertheless, the function of this post-translational modification remains unclear. It has been recently speculated that O-GlcNAc could act as a protective signal against proteasomal degradation, both by modifying target substrates and/or by inhibiting the proteasome itself. In this work, we have investigated the putative relation between O-GlcNAc and the ubiquitin pathway. First, we showed that the level of both modifications increased rapidly after thermal stress but, unlike ubiquitinated proteins, O-GlcNAc-modified proteins failed to be stabilized by inhibiting proteasome function. Increasing O-GlcNAc levels, using glucosamine or PUGNAc, enhanced ubiquitination. Inversely, when O-GlcNAc levels were reduced, using forskolin or glucose deprivation, ubiquitination decreased. Targeted-RNA interference of O-GlcNAc transferase also reduced ubiquitination and moreover halved cell thermotolerance. Finally, we demonstrated that the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 was O-GlcNAc modified and that its glycosylation and its interaction with Hsp70 varied according to the conditions of cell culture. Altogether, these results show that O-GlcNAc and ubiquitin are not strictly antagonistic post-translational modifications, but rather that the former might regulate the latter, and also suggest that E1 could be one of the common links between the two pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2083372622,"The hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF)-1α and -2α mediate responses to hypoxia, such as tumor neovascularization. To determine the function of HIF-2α in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), we examined vascular formation in HIF-2α knockdown (kd/kd) mice transplanted with tumors. We observed that both the tumor size and the number of large vessels growing within transplanted melanomas were significantly reduced in kd/kd recipients compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, we observed a similar extent of vascular formation within fibrosarcomas transplanted from either kd/kd or WT mice into WT recipients. Thus, HIF-2α expression in host animal ECs, but not in the tumor cells, is crucial for tumor neovascularization. HIF-2α may function through ephrin A1 as the expression of ephrin A1 and related genes was markedly reduced in kd/kd ECs, and HIF-2α specifically bound a hypoxia-response element sequence in the ephrin A1 promoter. Treatment of WT ECs with an ephrin A1 inhibitor (ephrin A1-Fc) also impaired neovascularization. We conclude that in ECs, HIF-2α plays an essential role in vascular remodeling during tumor vascularization through activation of at least ephrin A1.

Angiogenesis is a multistep physiologic process involving the growth of new sprouts from pre-existing vessels during development and growth. In addition, angiogenesis can be activated under pathological conditions such as wound healing and tumor formation (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells (ECs) 3The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; HIF, hypoxia-inducible transcription factor; WT, wild type; B[a]P, benzo[a]pyrene; WT, wild type; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; BM, bone marrow; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Ang, angiopoietin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; Arnt, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; HRE, hypoxia-response element; Eph A4, and Eph receptor A4. line blood vessels and play essential roles in the formation of new blood vessels. During neovascularization, the first ECs translocate from their stable location by breaking through the basement membrane and migrating toward angiogenic stimuli, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins (Angs). Subsequently, after reaching their destination, these cells proliferate to provide sufficient additional cells for vessel formation. The growth of tumors in vivo is completely dependent on vascularization (2Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Most tumors grow so rapidly that they outstrip their existing blood supply, generate hypoxic conditions in surrounding normal tissues, and induce neovascularization. Inhibition of tumor neovascularization is considered a promising strategy for anticancer therapy. However, targeting tumor neovascularization in vivo is difficult. Numerous pro- and anti-angiogenic factors contribute to tumor neovascularization (3Semenza G.L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S62-S67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Therefore, characterizing the precise roles of individual molecules in this process is a critical first step toward developing anticancer therapies targeting neovascularization. The hypoxic response is triggered by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), a family of transcription factors activated by local hypoxic environments (4Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). Activated HIFs accumulate in the nucleus and heterodimerize with HIF-1β, also known as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt). These complexes bind to cis-acting hypoxia-response elements (HREs) present in the promoter sequences of hypoxia-responsive genes. More than 40 genes have been identified as targets of HIF-1α. These genes contribute to a diverse array of cellular processes, including cell survival, glycolysis, erythropoiesis, and vasculogenesis/angiogenesis (4Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is ubiquitously expressed and may function as a key player in the transcriptional response to hypoxia. In contrast, HIF-2α, another member of the HIF family, is only expressed by ECs (5Flamme I. Fröhlich T. von Reutern M. Kappel A. Damert A. Risau W. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), kidney fibroblasts (6Wiesener M.S. Jürgensen J.S. Rosenberger C. Scholze C.K. Hörstrup J.H. Warnecke C. Mandriota S. Bechmann I.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The role of HIF-2α in neovascularization is not well understood (9Fadele A.O. Whitelaw M.L. Peet D.J. Mol. Int. 2004; 2: 229-243Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previously, we generated mice containing a “knockdown” allele of the HIF-2α gene (10Morita M. Ohneda O. Yamashita T. Takahashi S. Suzuki N. Nakajima O. Kawauchi S. Ema M. Shibahara S. Udono T. Tomita K. Tamai M. Sogawa K. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1134-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutant mice (kd/kd) display a 20–80% reduction in HIF-2α expression depending on the tissue but are born at expected Mendelian frequencies and are fertile. Neovascularization was markedly reduced in the retinas of kd/kd mice in response to local hypoxia. Intriguingly, hypoxic induction of erythropoietin, a known target of HIFs, was prominently lost in the retinas of kd/kd mice, whereas other angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, were induced normally. Therefore, one of the roles of HIF-2α in retinal vascular formation under hypoxic conditions is to activate expression of erythropoietin. Here, we examined the role of HIF-2α during tumor neovascularization in mature animals. A variety of HIF target genes that promote angiogenesis are activated in tumors during neovascularization. Recent studies have suggested that HIF-1α and HIF-2α regulate distinct target genes in ECs, tumor cells, and embryonic stem cells (11Covello K.L. Kehlar J. Yu H. Gordan J.D. Arsham A.M. Hu C.J.

In immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts, only HIF-1α is activated in response to hypoxia, whereas endogenous HIF-2α remains transcriptionally inactive even under hypoxic conditions (17Park S.K. Dadak A.M. Hasse V.H. Fontana L. Giaccia A.J. Jhonson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4959-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Current models propose that HIF-1α and HIF-2α play different roles in cellular physiology and during tumor neovascularization. As both HIF-1α and HIF-2α are widely expressed in the cell types that mediate neovascularization, such as ECs, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, discriminating the roles of these two related proteins within normal and tumor tissue is difficult. We addressed this problem by examining kd/kd mice that express reduced levels of HIF-2α, and we identified a specific role and mechanism of action for HIF-2α in ECs during tumor neovascularization. HIF-2α increases the expression of ephrin A1, a regulator of the formation of tubular structure, and is essential for vascular tube formation but not EC proliferation. Ephrin A1 was originally isolated as a secreted protein present in conditioned media from cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (18Holzman L.B. Marks R.M. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5830-5838Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and induces EC migration, capillary assembly in vitro, and corneal angiogenesis in vivo (19Daniel T.O. Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Jhon P.L. Robert B. Abrahamson D.R. Kidney Int. 1996; 57: S73-S81Google Scholar, 20Pandey A. Shao H. Marks R.M. Polverini P.J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1995; 268: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Here, we clearly demonstrate that HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α, directly regulates the expression of ephrin A1 and promotes vascular tube formation. Tumorigenesis—B16F10 melanoma and 3LLC lung carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). For transplantation studies, cells were harvested with 1 mm EDTA/PBS and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Two hundred microliters of the cell suspension were injected into each WT or kd/kd mouse subcutaneously. Benzo[a]pyrene (B([a]P) (200 μl at 10 mg/ml) dissolved in corn oil (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) was injected subcutaneously into WT or kd/kd mice on the 1st and 8th day of the experiment (21Simizu Y. Nakatsuru Y. Ichinose M. Takahashi Y. Kume H. Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The resulting WT or kd/kd primary fibrosarcomas (20 mm3) induced by B[a]P were subcutaneously implanted into KSN nu/nu mice (SLC). Immunohistochemical Staining—Tumors from host mice were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then embedded in polyester wax and sectioned for immunohistochemical staining. Sections were incubated overnight with anti-CD31 (PharMingen), anti-HIF-2α, or anti-HIF-1α antibodies at 4 °C (10Morita M. Ohneda O. Yamashita T. Takahashi S. Suzuki N. Nakajima O. Kawauchi S. Ema M.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1134-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), washed twice with PBS-MT (which contains 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C, and incubated with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (BIOSOURCE) for 1 h at room temperature and washed. Bound antibodies were detected by adding a color reaction buffer (250 μg/ml of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine with or without 0.05% NiCl2) or by utilizing 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) to the samples. Sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red (Vector Laboratories) or hematoxylin solutions. Diffusion Chamber Assay—The diffusion chamber contained a chamber ring and a 0.45-μm pore membrane (Millipore). Cultured B16F10 melanoma cells or 3LLC cells resuspended in PBS (5 × 107 cells/ml) were added to the diffusion chamber. The chamber was then subcutaneously embedded into anesthetized mice. After 7 days, we examined newly formed vessels on the membrane of the diffusion chamber macroscopically. Images of the neovascularized area were obtained using NIH image. Microarray Analysis and Real Time PCR—Forty eight hour post-implantation, total RNAs were prepared from newly formed vessels on the surface of the diffusion chamber using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA samples were analyzed by microarray analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies). cDNAs were synthesized by RT-PCR from 1 μg of total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The reaction mixtures for quantitative RT-PCR were prepared using POWER SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed by a 7700 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed as triplicate, and the data were calculated by ΔΔCt method. Primers used for PCRs were as follows: ephrin B2 forward, 5′-TCTGTGTGGAAGTACTGTTGGGGACTTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGTACCAGCTTCTAGCTCTGGACGTCTT-3′; HIF-2α forward, 5′-CAGCTCAGAGCTGAGGAAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTGTAGACTCACTTGCC-3′; HIF-1α forward, 5′-CAAGATCTCGGCGAACGAAAGAGTCTGA-3′, and reverse; 5′-GAAGCACCTTCCACGTTGCTGACTTGAT-3′, ephrin A1 forward, 5′-TGCAGTCTGGCCGCTGCTGACCGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAATTTCACAGACAGCTTCTCCGG-3′; VEGF forward, 5′-CTTTACTGCTGTACCTTCACCATGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AACAAGGCTCACAAGTGATTTTCTGG-3; ephrin B1 forward, 5′-TTGGAGACAAGCTGGACATCATCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTTGGCCGGCTGGTAGTCAACTGC-3′; Eph A4 forward, 5′-CCAGATCTGTTCAGGGAGAGCTTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTCATCAGCTGCGATGGTGTCGATC-3′; platelet-derived growth factor-α forward, 5′-CCTCTTTGTCACAGTGCTGGAAGTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCTCATGGAGTTGAGTGCATGCTGG-3′; Flk-1 forward, 5′-AGGACCAAGGCGACTATGTTTGCTCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACGGTCCGTACGAGAATGACAAGAAGG-3′; Flt-1 forward, 5′-TCTTGCTCACCATGGTCAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTCATGTGCACAAGTTTGGG-3′; CD31 forward, 5′-AGCATCATGGTCAACATAACAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGCTGATGCCTATGGCATG-3′; and β-actin forward, 5′-ATGGATGACGATATCGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGT-3′. Plasmids—Full-length mouse HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and Arnt cDNAs were inserted into a pEF-BOS vector driven by the human elongation factor-1α promoter. A 2.2-kb fragment of the ephrin A1 promoter was synthesized by using PCR and inserted into a pGL3 promoter vector (Promega). The HRE sequence in this fragment of the ephrin A1 promoter was mutated with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of primer sets used for mutagenesis were as follows: primers for ephrin A1 -2.2-kb promoter, 5′-GCGACGCGT(MluI)AGTGCCCAGGTTTCAGCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTAGATCT(BglII)CTCCCATAGCTGTGTGTGTGCTC-3′ (reverse); primers for the mutation of HRE, 5′-AGGAGGTGGGCGGATCCTCCCTAGGCTGAGCGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCGCTCAGCCTAGGGAGGATCCGCCCACCTCCT-3′ (reverse). A full-length mouse ephrin A1 cassette was ligated with internal ribosomal entry site-tdRED1, and they were inserted into mouse stem cell virus vector for retroviral transfection (Clontech). After the infection, vector alone- or ephrin A1-transfectd kd/kd ECs were purified by using FACSVantage (BD Biosciences). The expression of ephrin A1 in ECs was examined by Western blot analysis. Cell Culture and Tube Formation Assay—BM samples were harvested from the femurs of WT and kd/kd mice by flushing with PBS. Isolated cells were stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD31 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (PharMingen). The fraction of CD31-positive and CD45-negative was collected by flow cytometry with a FACSVantage (BD Biosciences). Cells were cultured on collagen type I-coated dishes (BD Biosciences) in HAVA medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 10-5 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and penicillin/streptomycin) in the presence of endothelial cell growth supplement (BD Biosciences) as described previously (22Ohneda O. Fennie C. Zheng Z. Donahue C. La H. Villacorta R. Cairns B. Lasky L.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 908-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After reaching 50% confluency, ECs were infected with polyoma middle T antigen retrovirus/Neor (22Ohneda O. Fennie C. Zheng Z. Donahue C. La H. Villacorta R. Cairns B. Lasky L.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 908-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then maintained in HAVA medium without supplementation. ECs were transfected with the pEF1-HIF-2α cDNA with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After a 2-day incubation, cultures were incubated with 100 μm CoCl2 for 6 h. Cells were subsequently harvested with a rubber scraper, and the extracted total RNA was then isolated for RT-PCR analysis. Analysis of capillary formation in Matrigel preparations (BD Biosciences) was performed as described (23Ohneda O. Ohneda K. Arai F. Lee J. Miyamoto T. Fukushima Y. Dowdenko D. Lasky L.A. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 98: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 μl of Matrigel (number 354234) was applied to a 4-well plate (Nalge Nunc) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After trypsinization, 5 × 104 EC or HIF-2α-transfected EC were suspended in 400 μl of HAVA medium in the presence or absence of 200 ng/well of ephrin A1-Fc or CD28-Fc (used for control) (R & D Systems) and plated onto the Matrigel. After 12 h, we examined tube formation in each well under a microscope and quantified the number of capillary tubes in a random field from each of three wells. Growth Curve—The WT and kd/kd BM-derived ECs (2 × 104) were plated in 35-mm dishes. The following day, cells were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic (5% O2) conditions for 8 days. Cell aliquots were harvested at 24-h intervals, and cell numbers were counted following trypan blue dye exclusion staining with a hemocytometer. Data represent results from triplicate dishes of ECs and are presented as the means ± S.D. Luciferase Reporter Assay—We transfected 293T cells in 12-well plates with pGL3 ephrin A1 -2.2 kb of luciferase (10 ng) or pGL3 ephrin A1 -2.2 kb of mut-Luc (10 ng) as a reporter gene using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Reporter assays were performed following co-transfection of 293T cells with the total amount of 200 ng of DNA containing pEF1-Arnt (10 ng) adjusted by adding empty vector (pEF-BOS). The pEF1-Renilla-Luc plasmid (1 ng) was co-transfected as an internal control. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—For each assay, 5 × 106 WT and kd/kd ECs cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, then washed with PBS containing 1 μm protease inhibitor mixture (PIC) (Roche Applied Science), harvested, and treated with hypotonic solution (5 mm HEPES, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 μm PIC). Subsequently, samples were centrifuged (5 min at 14,000 × g) to collect nuclei. Nuclei were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1 μm PIC). After fragmentation of DNA by sonication, immunoprecipitation reactions were performed using a rotating mixer at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of anti-HIF-1α antibody (Novus Biologicals) or anti-HIF-2α antibody (10Morita M. Ohneda O. Yamashita T. Takahashi S. Suzuki N. Nakajima O. Kawauchi S. Ema M. Shibahara S. Udono T. Tomita K. Tamai M. Sogawa K. Yamamoto M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1134-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Normal rabbit IgG was employed as a negative control to verify the specificity of the reaction. Following incubation with the antibody, reaction mixtures were incubated with pre-blocked protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) (4 °C, 1 h), and precipitated complexes were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 × g). These complexes were washed three times with washing buffer (0.25 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)) and eluted from the protein A-agarose beads with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). DNA-protein complexes were separated from the agarose beads by centrifugation (4 °C at 3000 × g) and denatured (65 °C, 4 h). DNA fragments were then extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Subsequently, the recovered DNA sequences were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA) and used as template for detection of the ephrin A1 HRE sequence by the PCR with Taq polymerase (Takara). The following primers were used for the PCR analysis: forward, 5′-GCTCTGCGTCCAGTCAGTGCCCAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCAAACTTGTGGCTGCTGTGAAAC-3′. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested and homogenized with whole cell extract buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 7 m urea, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm PIC) at 4 °C. Twenty micrograms of whole cell extracts in each well were electrophoretically separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk, 1% FBS in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibody (anti-ephrin A1 antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected with a chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore). Membranes were also probed with an anti-actin antibody (1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to control for protein loading. Statistical Analysis—Statistical evaluations of data were conducted using the Student's t test for comparison analysis. Data are presented as means ± S.D. Impaired Development of Tumor Vessels in HIF-2α kd/kd Mice—To investigate the function of HIF-2α in tumor growth and vessel formation, we first analyzed the in vivo growth of B16F10 melanomas following subcutaneous implantation into HIF-2α knockdown mice (kd/kd) (24Murayama T. Tepper O.M. Silver M. Ma H. Losordo D.W. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Kalka C. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Fourteen days after implantation, tumors were harvested and weighed. Tumors harvested from kd/kd mice were significantly smaller than those isolated from the wild-type (WT) hosts (Fig. 1A;WT, 3.01 ± 1.12 g, versus kd/kd, 1.56 ± 0.99 g, n = 6, p = 0.038). To examine neovascular development in the tumors, we measured vessel diameters after staining with anti-CD31 antibodies (Fig. 1B). Vessels were categorized into three groups as follows: diameters less than 10 μm, diameters between 10 and 100 μm, and diameters greater than 100 μm (Fig. 1J). Fine vessels (those less than 10 μm in diameter) were more frequent in kd/kd mice than in WT mice (Fig. 1C; WT, 0.4 ± 0.5, versus kd/kd, 9.6 ± 2.7, n = 4, p = 0.0005), whereas intermediate vessels (10–100 μm) were markedly reduced in kd/kd animals in comparison with WTs (WT, 9.2 ± 2.5, versus kd/kd, 4.2 ± 2.1, n = 4, p = 0.02). In contrast to WT mice, vessels over 100 μm in diameter were not detected in tumors from kd/kd hosts. Given that newly formed vessels originated from the recipient mice (WT or kd/kd), we conclude that the formation of vessels in tumors larger than 10 μm in diameter is impaired in kd/kd mice. We next examined the effect of HIF-2α on tumor neovascularization. We generated primary tumors in kd/kd and WT mice by subcutaneous injection of B[a]P. At 15 weeks after the injection of B[a]P, tumors were harvested and analyzed. Tumors derived from kd/kd mice were significantly smaller than those from WT mice (Fig. 1D; WT, 3.35 ± 1.23 g, versus kd/kd, 0.53 ± 0.31 g, n = 3, p = 0.018). Subsequently, we counted and categorized the vessels in these primary tumors (Fig. 1, E and F). Formation of vessels smaller than 10 μmin diameter was increased in kd/kd mice compared with WT mice (WT, 9.85 ± 3.18, versus kd/kd, 18.4 ± 3.01, p = 0.027). In contrast, formation of vessels larger than 10 μm in diameter was significantly reduced in kd/kd mice relative to WT mice (between 10 and 100 μm, WT, 39.6 ± 8.14, versus kd/kd, 18.9 ± 3.96, p = 0.017; larger than 100 μm, WT,: 3.06 ± 1.29, versus kd/kd, 0.33 ± 0.34, p = 0.024). The kd/kd- and WT-derived fibrosarcomas were also subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. Tumors were weighed 14 days after implantation (Fig. 1G). The tumors from mice of either HIF-2α genotype grew similarly in nude mice (WT, 2.17 ± 0.92 g, kd/kd, 2.27 ± 0.87 g, n = 4, p = 0.89). Consistent with the apparent tumor growth, vessels developed well in both kd/kd- and WT-derived fibrosarcomas as determined by the distribution of vessel diameters (Fig. 1, H and I). We interpret from these results that HIF-2α expression in ECs, but not tumor cells, of host animals determines the rate of tumor growth by affecting tumor vessel growth and development. Distinct Expression Patterns of HIF-2α and HIF-1α in Tumor Vasculature—We examined the expression of HIF-α in B[a]P-induced tumors obtained from WT and kd/kd mice (Fig. 2). To analyze the tissue structure and the location of endothelial cells, hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 2, A and E) and anti-CD31 antibody staining (Fig. 2, B and F) were also performed. HIF-1α staining was observed in cells surrounding the vessels but was barely detectable in ECs of the tumor vessels in both WT and kd/kd hosts (Fig. B, C, F, and G). In contrast, HIF-2α was primarily detected in ECs of the vessels in WT, whereas the expression of HIF-2α was markedly reduced in kd/kd (Fig. 2, B, F, D, and H). We conclude that the reduced HIF-2α expression in ECs impairs the formation of vessels within tumors. Vessel Formation in kd/kd and WT Mice Induced by Tumor Cells—We investigated the role of HIF-2α in tumor neovascularization with a diffusion chamber assay that permits direct macroscopic observation of newly formed vessels on the surface of a filter membrane of chambers containing tumor cells. Two distinct tumor cell types, B16F10 melanoma cells (Fig. 3B) and 3LLC lung carcinoma cells (Fig. 3C), and control PBS (Fig. 3A) were placed in diffusion chambers for analysis of tumor neovascularization. These chambers were then embedded subcutaneously onto the backs of WT or kd/kd mice. Membranes of the chambers were examined 7 days after implantation for newly formed vessels. On the membrane surfaces of the chambers implanted in WT mice, growing vessels were irregularly shaped, distorted, and dilated with a characteristic tumor vasculature (Fig. 3, B, panels a and c, and C, panels a and c). Bleeding was frequently observed, indicating that the vessels were leaky. These results were similar for chambers containing either B16F10 or 3LLC cells. In contrast, vessels developed poorly on the membranes of chambers embedded into kd/kd mice (Fig. 3, B, panels b and d, and C, panels b and d). Vessel formation in kd/kd mice was only half as extensive as that observed on membranes embedded in WT mice (data not shown). The size of the largest vessels differed strikingly between WT and kd/kd mice. Thus, the expression of HIF-2α in the host animal is critical for vessel formation in tumors, whereas its expression by the tumor cells themselves is dispensable. These findings support an important role for HIF-2α expression in host ECs in tumor neovascularization. Target Molecules for HIF-2α in Tumor Neovascularization—We investigated the target genes regulated by HIF-2α in ECs responsible for tumor neovascularization by microarray analysis. RNAs were isolated from newly developed tissues, including vessels isolated from the membranes of diffusion chambers 48 h after implantation. Comparison of gene expression profiles from samples prepared from WT and kd/kd mice (Table 1) revealed that the expression levels of ephrins B2, A1, and B1 and Eph receptor A4 (Eph A4) were significantly decreased in kd/kd mice (p < 0.01) relative to WT mice. The expression levels of known vasculogenic factors, including Ang1, Ang2, VEGF, and VEGFR-2 (Flk-1), did not differ significantly between genotypes. We confirmed these differences in expression level by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results of the microarray screening, the expression levels of Eph A4 and ephrin A1 and B2 were reduced in vessels derived from kd/kd mice. Because it has been reported that erythropoietin affects vascularization (25Anagnostou A. Lee E.S. Kessimian N. Levinson R. Steiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5978-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and is a target molecule for HIF-2α, we also examined the erythropoietin expression. There was no significant difference of erythropoietin expression between WT- and kd/kd-derived samples (data not shown"

We investigated SLN protein expression in nebulin-free and wild-type skeletal muscle, as well as expression of other Ca(2+)-handling proteins. Ca(2+) uptake capacity was determined in isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and in intact myofibers by measuring Ca(2+) transients. Muscle contractile performance was determined in skinned muscle activated with exogenous Ca(2+), as well as in electrically stimulated intact muscle. We found profound up-regulation of SLN protein in nebulin-free skeletal muscle, whereas expression of other Ca(2+)-handling proteins was not (calsequestrin and phospholamban) or was minimally (SERCA) affected. Speed of Ca(2+) uptake was >3-fold decreased in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles isolated from nebulin-free muscle as well as in nebulin-free intact myofibers. Ca(2+)-activated stress in skinned muscle and stress produced by intact nebulin-free muscle were reduced to a similar extent compared with wild type. Half-relaxation time was significantly longer in nebulin-free compared with wild-type muscle. Thus, the present study demonstrates for the first time that nebulin might also be involved in physiological Ca(2+) handling of the SR-myofibrillar system."
https://openalex.org/W2003521566,"Angiosperms are a relatively recent evolutionary innovation, but their genome sizes have diversified remarkably since their origin, at a rate beyond that of most other taxa. Genome size is often correlated with plant growth and ecology, and extremely large genomes may be limited both ecologically and evolutionarily. Yet the relationship between genome size and natural selection remains poorly understood. The manifold cellular and physiological effects of large genomes may be a function of selection on the major components that contribute to genome size, such as transposable elements and gene duplication. To understand the nature of selection on these genomic components, both population-genetic and comparative approaches are needed."

https://openalex.org/W2078482767,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact directly with heterotrimeric G proteins to transduce physiological signals. Early studies of this interaction concluded that GPCRs (R) and G proteins (G) collide with each other randomly after receptor activation and that R-G complexes are transient. More recent studies have suggested that inactive R and G are preassembled (precoupled) as stable R-G complexes. Here we examine the stability of complexes formed between cyan fluorescent protein-labeled alpha(2A)-adrenoreceptors (C-alpha2ARs) and G proteins in cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Labeled G proteins diffused in the plasma membrane with equal mobility in the absence and presence of immobile C-alpha2ARs. Immobile C-alpha2ARs activated labeled G proteins, demonstrating functional coupling without stable physical association. In contrast, a stable R-G interaction was detected when G proteins were deprived of nucleotides and C-alpha2ARs were active, as predicted by the ternary complex model. Overexpression of regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) accelerated the onset of effector activation but did not detectably alter the interaction between C-alpha2ARs and G proteins. We conclude that at most a small fraction of C-alpha2ARs and G proteins exist as R-G complexes at any moment."
https://openalex.org/W2168305884,"Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte recruitment. Leukocytes and, in particular, macrophages play an important role in the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), an integral component of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Previously, we showed a role for VAP-1 in ocular inflammation. Here, we investigate the expression of VAP-1 in the choroid and its role in CNV development. VAP-1 was expressed in the choroid, exclusively in the vessels, and colocalized in the vessels of the CNV lesions. VAP-1 blockade with a novel and specific inhibitor significantly decreased CNV size, fluorescent angiographic leakage, and the accumulation of macrophages in the CNV lesions. Furthermore, VAP-1 blockade significantly reduced the expression of inflammation-associated molecules such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) -1, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) -1. This work provides evidence for an important role of VAP-1 in the recruitment of macrophages to CNV lesions, establishing a novel link between VAP-1 and angiogenesis. Inhibition of VAP-1 may become a new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1980144454,"To identify new components of the protein quality control and degradation pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we performed a growth-based genome-wide screen of about 5000 viable deletion mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As substrates we used two misfolded ER membrane proteins, CTL* and Sec61-2L, chimeric derivatives of the classical ER degradation substrates CPY* and Sec61-2. Both substrates contain a cytosolic Leu2 protein fusion, and stabilization of these substrates in ER-associated degradation-deficient strains enables a restored growth of the transformed LEU2-deficient deletion mutants. We identified the strain deleted for the ubiquitin chain elongating ligase Hul5 among the mutant strains with a strong growth phenotype. Here we show that Hul5 is necessary for the degradation of two misfolded ER membrane substrates. Although the degradation of their N-terminal parts is Hul5-independent, the breakdown of their C-terminal fragments requires the ubiquitin chain elongating ligase activity of Hul5. In the absence of Hul5, a truncated form of CTL*myc remains to a large extent embedded in the ER membrane. Hul5 activity promotes the interaction of this truncated CTL*myc with the AAA-ATPase Cdc48, which is known to pull proteins out of the ER membrane. This study unravels the stepwise elimination of the ER membrane-localized CTL*myc substrate. First, N-terminal, lumenal CPY* is transferred to the cytoplasm and degraded by the proteasome. Subsequently, the remaining C-terminal membrane-anchored part requires Hul5 for its effective extraction out of the endoplasmic reticulum and proteasomal degradation.

Ubiquitin-proteasome-triggered protein degradation is an essential process in all eukaryotic cells. Functions of this process include regulation of signal transduction, cell cycle control, and metabolic regulation of protein turnover (1Wolf D.H. Hilt W. Biochim. Biophys.

As a side effect of this huge amount of folding events in the ER, the cell is faced with folding mistakes and failures. Misfolded proteins can disturb cellular functions. Therefore, they have to be eliminated prior to delivery to the site of action. The soluble and membrane-bound misfolded ER proteins are recognized in the ER lumen, retrotranslocated into the cytosol where they are polyubiquitinated, and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (5Kostova Z.

Degradation of most proteins requires their recognition via a polyubiquitin chain. Catalysts of the polyubiquitination process are E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) transfers ubiquitin to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), which in many cases, in cooperation with ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3), assemble a ubiquitin chain on the substrate protein (9Varshavsky A.

A core component of the recognition and ubiquitination process of proteins harboring a misfolded domain in the ER lumen is the Hrd-ligase protein complex.

In this study, we performed genome-wide screens using a yeast gene deletion library to identify new mutants with defects in ER protein quality control and degradation (ERQD). The screens are based on the stabilization of two misfolded ERAD membrane substrates, CTL* and Sec61-2L, both carrying a cytosolic 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (Leu2 protein). Such stabilization can be observed by a restored growth of the transformed leucine auxotrophic strains of a yeast deletion library (22Buschhorn B. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H.

Here we report on the discovery of Hul5 as a component of the ERAD process. Hul5 is a HECT domain containing ubiquitin-protein ligase known to interact with the proteasome via its Rpn2 subunit and is involved in ubiquitin chain elongation (E4 activity) of proteasomal substrates (31Crosas B. Hanna J. Kirkpatrick D.S. Zhang D.P. Tone Y. Hathaway N.A. Buecker C. Leggett D.S. Schmidt M. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Finley D. Cell. 2006; 127: 1401-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the ability of Hul5 to extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains is necessary for complete degradation of the misfolded ER membrane protein CTL*myc. Interestingly, degradation of CTL*myc occurs stepwise and stops at a defined part of the substrate in the absence of Hul5. The remaining fragment consists of a truncated ER lumenal part of CPY*, a transmembrane region, and the cytoplasmic Leu2myc moiety. Furthermore, this fragment is no longer associated with the Der3-Hrd1 ligase complex. In addition, the absence of Hul5 affects the interaction of Cdc48 with CTL*myc.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSK7 (pRS316-PGAL4-prc1-1-PDR5 (bp 4332–4532)-LEU2-MYC13) was obtained by homologous recombination in S. cerevisiae and encodes CTL*myc. The oligonucleotides CTL*Longtine_fwd (5′CCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGTCGAGAATTCGAGCTGCTCGTTTAAAC) and CTL*Longtine_rev (5′CCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGGGTACCGGGCCCCCCCTCGAGGTCGAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC) were used to amplify a fragment using pFA-13Myc-kanMX6 (37Longtine M.S.

The resulting 2.3-kb PCR fragment and SalI-linearized pRS316-PGAL4-prc1-1-PDR5 (bp 4332–4532)-LEU2 were transformed in a W303 yeast strain. The recombined plasmid was isolated by plasmid rescue. The plasmid pSK9 (pRS316-PGAL4-Sec61-2-LEU2-MYC13) encodes for Sec61-22L and was created in a similar strategy as described for pSK7. The oligonucleotides CTL*_Longtine_fwd and Sec61-22_Longtine_rev (5′GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC) were used to amplify a 2.3-kb fragment, which was transformed in yeast with SalI-linearized pRS316-PGAL4-Sec61-2LEU2. The plasmids pSK10 (pRS314-PHUL5-HUL5) and pSK11 (pRS314-PHUL5-HUL5C878A) are based on the plasmids pJH84 and pJH85 (31Crosas B. Hanna J. Kirkpatrick D.S. Zhang D.P. Tone Y. Hathaway N.A. Buecker C.

A PCR fragment encoding for the TRP2 sequence was generated by PCR using pRS314 as template (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

The resulting 0.7-kb PCR fragment replaced the LYS2 coding sequence of pJH84 and pJH85, respectively, in a homologous recombination event in yeast. Antibodies—Precipitations of CTL* and CTL*myc in pulse-chase analyses were done using polyclonal anti-CPY antibodies (Rockland). Specific mouse antibodies generated against c-Myc epitopes (clone 9E10; Sigma) were used in immunoprecipitation experiments to isolate Sec61-2Lmyc and CTL*myc, respectively. For immunodetection, monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (clone 16B12, Covance), monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibodies (clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal anti-phosphoglycerate kinase antibodies (clone 22C5, Molecular Probes) generated in mouse were purchased. For the detection of Der3/Hrd1, specific polyclonal antibodies were used (41Bordallo J. Plemper R.K. Finger A. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Anti-Cdc48 antibodies were provided by T. Sommer. Pulse-Chase and Cycloheximide Chase Analyses—Pulse-chase experiments to analyze the degradation of CTL* and CTL*myc proteins were performed as described in Taxis et al. (42Taxis C. Vogel F. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1806-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Medicherla et al. (27Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Curves represent data of up to five independent experiments, and the error bars indicate the respective mean ± S.E. For inhibition of the proteasome MG132 (Calbiochem) up to a concentration of 100 μm was added to labeling media and chase media every 20 min. The pulse-chase analysis of Sec61-22L is described in Buschhorn et al. (22Buschhorn B. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The procedure to perform cycloheximide decay experiments is described in Medicherla et al. (27Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Standard methods were used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (36Ausubel F.M. Kingston R.E. Seidman F.G. Struhl K. Moore D.D. Brent R. Smith F.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing & Wiley Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation and Membrane Extraction Experiments—100 A600 units of yeast cells were harvested in the logarithmic growth phase, washed with water and 10 mm sodium azide. Spheroblasts were obtained at 30 °C using 0.3 mg/ml zymolyase, 2.7 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol, 1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm sodium azide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and “complete” inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Spheroblasts were opened in 3 ml of lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) by the use of a douncer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g to obtain the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS), including intact organelles, microsomes, and cytosolic proteins. For the subcellular fractionation, the PNS was centrifuged for 30 min at 50,000 × g to achieve a pellet fraction, including intact organelles and microsomes, and a supernatant, including cytosolic proteins. To examine the membrane association of CTL*myc, the PNS was separated, and either lysis buffer, 1 m potassium acetate, 2.5 m urea, 0.1 m sodium carbonate, 1% Triton X-100, or 1% SDS was added to the aliquots. The 1% SDS sample was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, whereas the other samples were incubated on ice. The samples were separated into a membrane (pellet) and a soluble protein fraction (supernatant) by centrifugation for 30 min at 50,000 × g. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection (36Ausubel F.M. Kingston R.E. Seidman F.G. Struhl K. Moore D.D. Brent R. Smith F.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing & Wiley Interscience, New York1992Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Immunoprecipitation experiments to isolate membrane-embedded CTL*myc and truncCTL*myc were performed as described in Biederer et al. (43Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and Neuber et al. (44Neuber O. Jarosch E. Volkwein C. Walter J. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) except for the following treatments. The membrane fractions of 150 A600 units of cells expressing CTL*myc were prepared before and after 3.5 h of cycloheximide treatment (150 μg of cycloheximide/A600 unit of cells), respectively. After solubilization of the membrane proteins for 1 h in 1% digitonin, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a TLA110.1 Beckman rotor. Each of the resulting supernatants was incubated overnight with 6 μl of anti-Myc antibodies (mouse clone 9E10; Sigma) and 7 mg of 10% bovine serum albumin blocked protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaAc, 10% glycerol). During the washing steps the concentration of digitonin was lowered to 0.5%. For elution of the proteins 50 μl of urea loading buffer (8 m urea, 200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% (w/v) SDS, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the samples were shaken for 15 min at 37 °C. 25 μl of each sample was subjected to immunoblot analysis. To gain deeper insight into the components of ERQD (39Schäfer A. Wolf D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a genome-wide screen was performed using the EUROSCARF yeast library consisting of about 5000 diploid S. cerevisiae strains with a leucine auxotrophy. In each mutant a single nonessential gene is deleted (22Buschhorn B. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Medicherla B.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Use of this genomic library for our screen is possible, because cells defective in ERQD can tolerate defects in this process and survive as long as the unfolded protein response is not impaired (45Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 46Friedländer R. Jarosch E. Urban J. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To screen for new mutants that influence the ERQD process, we used two ERAD substrates with different misfolded domains. The first substrate, CTL*, includes a fusion of a mutated ER lumenal carboxypeptidase yscY (CPY*), the last transmembrane domain of Pdr5, and cytosolic 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (Leu2) (27Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The second substrate, Sec61-2L, is based on the nonglycosylated ERAD substrate Sec61-2, including 10 transmembrane domains (43Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 47Sommer T. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) fused at its C terminus to cytosolic Leu2 (Fig. 1A). In cells intact for ERQD, the degradation of Sec61-2L is induced at a restrictive temperature of 33 °C. Cells with an active ERQD are able to degrade the Leu2 fusion proteins and are leucine auxotrophs (Fig. 1, B and C, left panel). In contrast, strains defective in ERQD like Δder3 mutants stabilize the misfolded, Leu2 containing substrates and therefore complement the Leu2 deficiency (22Buschhorn B. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39Schäfer A. Wolf D.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which can be easily observed by restored growth (Fig. 1, B and C, left panel). We analyzed the growth phenotype of about 5000 individual deletion mutants of the EUROSCARF yeast library expressing either Sec61-2L or CTL*. Besides previously found ERQD components discovered in screens performed with CTL* (22Buschhorn B. Kostova Z. Medicherla B. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Medicherla B. Kostova Z. Schaefer A. Wolf D.H. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 692-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we identified in addition the mutant strain deleted for the encoding sequence of Hul5. When expressing either CTL* or Sec61-2L, Δhul5 cells showed growth on medium lacking leucine (Fig. 1, B and C). Hul5 Is Required for Degradation of Specific Protein Fragments—Remarkably, when testing the degradation of CTL* in pulse-chase analysis by the use of specific anti-CPY antibodies, the fusion protein disappeared in Δhul5 mutant cells with similar kinetics as in wild type cells (Fig. 1D). Similarly, a mutated Sec61-2HA protein was degraded with wild type kinetics in the Δhul5 mutant strain (Fig. 1E). These results were in contrast to the positive growth behavior of Δhul5 mutant cells expressing either the fusion proteins CTL* or Sec61-2L, which implied substrate stabilization (Fig. 1, B and C). The fusion proteins contain two parts, misfolded CPY* or Sec61-2 and properly folded, active Leu2. The possibility existed that in Δhul5 mutant cells the misfolded CPY* and Sec61-2 moieties were degraded, whereas the part that includes the properly folded, active Leu2 protein was spared from degradation. To test this possibility, we added a C-terminal Myc tag to CTL* and Sec61-2L to detect the Leu2 moiety. When analyzing the degradation of the tagged substrates CTL*myc and Sec61-2Lmyc by cycloheximide chase and pulse-chase experiments using anti-Myc antibodies, a stepwise degradation of both substrates was observed (Fig. 2, A–C). Interestingly, in the HUL5 deletion mutant degradation of both substrates was incomplete, and truncated forms (truncCTL*myc, truncSec61-2Lmyc) of about 92 kDa accumulated. These truncated forms are observed as intermediates even in wild type cells, where they are finally degraded (Fig. 2, A and B). The molecular mass of the Leu2myc protein is about 74 kDa (Fig. 2C), and the transmembrane region of CTL*myc consists of 68 amino acids in length correlating to a mass of about 7–10 kDa. Most likely, the truncated versions of both proteins of about 92 kDa still contain a portion of either misfolded protein domains, CPY* linked to the transmembrane domain, or Sec61-2. When analyzing the stability of truncCTL*myc in a Δhul5 strain using pulse-chase analysis, we observed no further degradation. The fragment was"

We used B-lymphoid cell lines producing cyclin D1 to investigate the role of this protein in B-cell lymphomas and leukaemias. Constitutive low levels of cyclin D1 had no effect per se on cell proliferation, but conferred resistance to various apoptotic stimuli in B cells. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, was reduced and mitochondrial permeabilization and phosphatidylserine exposure following cytokine withdrawal were delayed in cyclin D1-producing cells. Proteomic analysis showed that the presence of cyclin D1 led to intracellular accumulation of various molecular chaperones. The chaperone, heat shock protein (Hsp)70, bound to both Bax and the mitochondrial apoptosis inducing factor following cytokine withdrawal, and impeded inhibitors of kappaB (IkappaB)-mediated inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB anti-apoptotic signalling. Impairment of Hsp70 activity--using a pharmacological Hsp inhibitor or transfecting cells with an Hsp70-blocking antibody--restored the cellular response to mitochondrial apoptosis triggering. Thus, constitutive de-novo cyclin D1 production in B cells delays commitment to apoptosis by inducing Hsp70 chaperoning activity on pre- and post-mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors."

Inhibition of IGF signaling is relevant in human disease, and several drugs in development target the IGF receptor. However, inhibition of PAPP-A activity may be a valuable alternative. We have generated monoclonal phage-derived single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies which selectively inhibit the cleavage of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A, relevant under conditions where cleavage of IGFBP-4 represents the final step in the delivery of IGF to the IGF receptor. None of the antibodies inhibited the homologous proteinase PAPP-A2, which allowed mapping of antibody binding by means of chimeras between PAPP-A and PAPP-A2 to the C-terminal Lin12-Notch repeat module, separated from the proteolytic domain by almost 1000 amino acids. Hence, the antibodies define a substrate binding exosite that can be targeted for the selective inhibition of PAPP-A proteolytic activity against IGFBP-4. In addition, we show that the Lin12-Notch repeat module reversibly binds a calcium ion and that bound calcium is required for antibody binding, providing a strategy for the further development of selective inhibitory compounds. To our knowledge these data represent the first example of differential inhibition of cleavage of natural proteinase substrates by exosite targeting. Generally, exosite inhibitors are less likely to affect the activity of related proteolytic enzymes withsimilar active site environments. In the case of PAPP-A, selective inhibition of IGFBP-4 cleavage by interference with exosite binding is a further advantage, as the activity against other known or unknown PAPP-A substrates, whose cleavage may not depend on binding to the same exosite, is not targeted.

However, specific inhibition of growth promoting proteolytic activity may represent a valuable alternative, in particular because unintended interference with other signaling pathways, e.g. insulin signaling, is avoided by such approach. In the present study we have generated monoclonal scFv antibodies which bind to LNR3 of PAPP-A and efficiently inhibit proteolysis of IGFBP-4 but not -5. Thus, LNR3 represents a substrate binding exosite (34Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Overall C.M. Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Our data represents to our knowledge the first example of differential inhibition of cleavage of natural proteinase substrates by exosite targeting.

Cells were plated onto 6-cm tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected 18 h later by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (42Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of plasmid DNA prepared by QIAprep Spin kit (Qiagen). After 48 h, the culture media were harvested and cleared by centrifugation. Cells transfected with cDNA encoding murine PAPP-A(1129-1545), human PAPPA-(1133-1547), and human PAPP-A(E483Q) were further cultured in serum-free medium to facilitate purification. Generation of Chicken Polyclonal Antibodies—Murine PAPP-A(1129-1545) was purified from serum-free medium by nickel affinity chromatography using Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (1 ml) (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 1 m NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, and bound protein was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA. Pooled fractions were further purified by heparin affinity chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap Heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. The column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 250 mm NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with PBS containing 1 m NaCl. Three chickens (Isa Brown) were immunized by intramuscular injections in the breast muscle using 15 μg of purified protein for each round. Complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) was used in the first round of injections, and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) was used for successive rounds (43Gassmann M. Thommes P. Weiser T. Hubscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Eggs were collected daily and kept at 4 °C. Titers were evaluated at regular intervals by purification of IgY from yolk (43Gassmann M. Thommes P. Weiser T. Hubscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) followed by a direct ELISA, in which murine PAPP-A(1129-1545) was coated onto plastic. Detection was done using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-chicken-IgY (Sigma), and preparations of IgY with the highest titers were used for further experiments. Measurement of Proteolytic Activity—Proteolytic activity of PAPP-A against IGFBP-4 and -5 was analyzed as previously described in detail (44Gyrup C. Oxvig C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, purified substrates quantified by amino acid analysis were labeled with 125I (Amersham Biosciences). Cleavage reactions were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, in the absence (IGFBP-5) or presence (IGFBP-4) of a 10-fold molar excess of IGF-II (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). In some reactions purified antibodies were added as specified. After incubation at 37 °C, reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA (10 mm) and stored at -20 °C. Cleavage products were separated by 10-20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The degree of cleavage was determined by quantification of band intensities using a Typhoon imaging system (GE Healthcare), and background levels (mock signals) were subtracted. Proteolytic activity of PAPP-A2 against IGFBP-5 in the absence of IGF was analyzed similarly, as previously detailed (23Overgaard M.T. Boldt H.B. Laursen L.S. Sottrup-Jensen L. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21849-21853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Analysis of peptidolytic activity against a 26-residue synthetic peptide derived from IGFBP-4 was carried out as previously described (45Gyrup C. Christiansen M. Oxvig C. Clin. Chem. 2007; 53: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Residues on the N-terminal and C-terminal side of the cleavage site were modified with o-aminobenzoic acid and substituted with 3-nitrotyrosine, respectively. The reaction buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.01% Tween 20. Light at 310 nm was used for excitation, and emission was detected at 420 nm. Quantitative analyses were carried out with Prism 5.0 (Graphpad software) using the equation for competitive inhibition. In the case of partial inhibition, sigmoidal dose-response curves were fitted to the data. Screening of Semi-synthetic Phage Libraries—Human PAPPA-(1133-1547) was immobilized (1 h at 37 °C) to 3.5-ml Immunotubes (Nunc Maxisorp), which were coated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal PAPP-A antibodies (46Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (5 μg/ml) contained in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.8, and blocked with 3% skimmed milk powder in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS). We used a combination of two semi-synthetic phage libraries (Tomlinson I + J) (47de Wildt R.M. Mundy C.R. Gorick B.D. Tomlinson I.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and capture of phages (1012 from each library) was carried out for 2 h at room temperature while rotating gently. After capture the tubes were rinsed 10 times in TBS containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), further washed at 4 °C with 200 ml of TBST for 1 h using a peristaltic pump, and finally rinsed 5 times with TBS. Elution of phages was carried out for 10 min at room temperature using 0.5 ml of DPPC-treated trypsin (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) diluted in TBS. Escherichia coli (TG1) infected (30 min at 37 °C) with the eluted phages were plated on TYE (10 g peptone, 5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl, and 16 g agar per liter) plates supplemented with 1% glucose and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Colonies were transferred to 96-well culture plates with 2×TY (16 g peptone, 10 g yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl per liter) medium containing 1% glucose and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated (overnight at 37 °C). A replicate of each plate was incubated for 3 h, and KM13 helper phages (48Kristensen P. Winter G. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) were added (109 to each well). After incubation for 1 h, the medium was changed to 2×TY containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), the plates were incubated for 20 h at 30 °C, and phage-containing supernatants were then analyzed by ELISA for binding to human PAPP-A(E483Q), immobilized in 96-well plates with polyclonal PAPP-A antibodies. The plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), washing was done with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 (GE Healthcare). Phagemid DNA (pIT2) from selected clones was prepared and sequenced. To also obtain phage antibodies which bind the region of PAPP-A N-terminal to CCP1, a similar screening was carried out using full-length human PAPP-A. Clone PAC5 was obtained and used as a control antibody in the scFv format. Clone PAC33, with specificity irrelevant to PAPP-A, was also used as a control antibody. Expression and Purification of scFv Antibodies and Analysis of Inhibitory Potential—E. coli HB2151 (nonsuppressor of amber stop codon) was infected with selected phages for the production of monoclonal scFv antibodies. Cultures of 1 liter were induced for 4-16 h with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and expressed proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography on Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (5 ml) (GE Healthcare) after sonication. Washing was carried out with 20 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. For elution, the concentration of imidazole was increased to 300 mm. Eluted protein was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8. A Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) or a protein L column (Pierce) was used for further purification. The purified protein was dialyzed into the relevant buffers before functional analysis. Analysis of binding to PAPP-A, immobilized as described above, was carried out in 96-well plates using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-His-tag antibody (Sigma) for detection. Preparations of purified antibodies were quantified by amino acid analysis, and the effects of antibodies on PAPP-A activity were analyzed by the addition of controlled amounts to cleavage reactions. PAC33 was used as a negative control. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on a BIAcore T100 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using series S CM5 sensor chips and coupling reagents supplied by the manufacturer. Affinity-purified PAPP-A(E483Q), 10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, was immobilized (at a level of 500 resonance units) to the activated chip at 25 °C. Remaining activated groups were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine. Purified antibodies (0.35-11 nm) diluted in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, were injected over the sensor chip for 2 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min at 37 °C. Recorded signals were defined as the difference between the signal of a ligand-coupled and an unliganded channel. Sensorgrams were plotted after subtraction of the recorded signal determined by the injection of an irrelevant antibody. For the analysis of calcium ion dependence, some experiments were carried out using 175 nm PAC1 in the absence or presence of 10 mm EDTA. Data were analyzed using the BIAcore T100 evaluation software Version 1.1. Determination of Antibody Specificity and Mapping of Antibody Binding—Mapping of antibody binding was carried out by ELISA using PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 chimeric proteins and mutated variants of PAPP-A. The proteins were immobilized with polyclonal PAPP-A antibodies (46Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and binding of phage antibodies was analyzed as detailed above. Inhibition of Proteolysis by Polyclonal Antibodies Raised against a C-terminal Fragment of PAPP-A—The only known physiological inhibitor of PAPP-A proteolytic activity is the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), which inactivates PAPP-A by the formation of a covalent disulfide-based 2:2 complex, denoted PAPP-A/proMBP (49Glerup S.

Accordingly, we have isolated an anti-LMO2 single chain Fv antibody fragment to determine if intracellular interference with LMO2-protein complexes can avert LMO2-dependent functions in normal and cancer settings. The anti-LMO2 single chain Fv, obtained using Intracellular Antibody Capture (IAC) technology, is specific for LMO2 among the LIM-only protein family and binds LMO2 through the third and fourth LIM fingers. Using vector-mediated expression of anti-LMO2 scFv, we show inhibition of Lmo2-dependent erythropoiesis but not endothelial development. We also demonstrate inhibition of Lmo2-dependent leukaemia in a mouse T-cell tumourigenesis transplantation assay with retroviral-mediated expression of anti-LMO2 scFv. Our studies establish that interference with the LMO2 multiprotein complex inhibits both normal and tumourigenic roles. The antibody fragment is a tool for dissecting LMO2 function in haematopoiesis and leukaemia and is a lead for development of therapeutics against LMO2-dependent T-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2094664700,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a crucial role in both cellular and whole body energy homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol activates AMPKα1-containing complexes in the human SH-SY5Y cell line via a mechanism specific for the AMPK upstream kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β. Activation of AMPK inhibits mRNA expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides Agouti-related peptide and melanin-concentrating hormone but surprisingly has no effect on neuropeptide Y mRNA, a neuropeptide previously shown to be regulated by AMPK. Rather than restoring mRNA levels to baseline, pharmacological inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β or AMPK greatly increases Agouti-related peptide and melanin-concentrating hormone mRNA expression. These data support a hypothesis that modulating basal AMPK activity in the hypothalamus is essential for maintaining tight regulation of pathways contributing to food intake.

Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). At a cellular level, AMPK is activated in response to diverse physiological and pathological stimuli that cause ATP depletion. Subsequently, AMPK acts to maintain the AMP:ATP ratio through inhibition of pathways that catabolize ATP and promotion of ATP-generating pathways (2Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). AMPK is a heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase, comprising a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. There are two α, two β, and three γ isoforms, and all 12 αβγ combinations have been identified in vivo. Activation of AMPK requires the action of upstream kinases that phosphorylate threonine residue 172 within the T-loop activation domain of the α subunit (2Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Three AMPK kinases have been identified to date. LKB1 is a tumor suppressor kinase linked to the rare hereditary cancer predisposition, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (3Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G. Warren W. Aminoff M. Hoglund P. Jarvinen H. Kristo P. Pelin K. Ridanpaa M. Salovaara R. Toro T. Bodmer W. Olschwang S. Olsen A.S. Stratton M.R. de la Chapelle A. Aaltonen L.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). In complex with regulatory proteins STE20-related adaptor (STRADα) and MO25, LKB1 phosphorylates and activates AMPK (4Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R.

In addition, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) has also been identified as an AMPK kinase (6Hurley R.L. Anderson K.A. Franzone J.M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Witters L.A. J. Biol.

Finally, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) was very recently implicated in the regulation of AMPK activity in cells and in the heart, although its regulation remains unknown (9Xie M. Zhang D. Dyck J.R. Li Y. Zhang H. Morishima M. Mann D.L. Taffet G.E. Baldini A. Khoury D.S. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AMPK is expressed ubiquitously, and recent findings have stimulated interest in roles for neuronal AMPK (11Ramamurthy S. Ronnett G.V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 574: 85-93Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although prolonged pharmacological activation of AMPK in neuroblastoma cells is reported to induce apoptosis (12Garcia-Gil M. Pesi R. Perna S. Allegrini S. Giannecchini M. Camici M. Tozzi M.G. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), increasing evidence points toward a role for AMPK in neuroprotection. AMPK is activated in response to excitotoxic stimuli in hippocampal neurons, and inhibiting AMPK potentiates neurode-generation (13Culmsee C. Monnig J. Kemp B.E. Mattson M.P. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). More recently, AMPK was shown to interact with and phosphorylate the metabotropic GABAB receptor, enhancing the activation of G-protein inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs). This mechanism was potentiated by increased intracellular AMP such as might occur during pathological stimuli such as hypoxia or ischemia and ultimately acts to suppress neuronal excitation, preventing cellular damage (14Kuramoto N. Wilkins M.E. Fairfax B.P. Revilla-Sanchez R. Terunuma M. Tamaki K. Iemata M. Warren N. Couve A. Calver A. Horvath Z. Freeman K. Carling D. Huang L. Gonzales C. Cooper E. Smart T.G. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. Neuron. 2007; 53: 233-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the hypothalamus, AMPK is localized to the arcuate nucleus where it responds to circulating hormones, playing a role in coordinating the regulation of appetite and satiety (15Andersson U.

On exposure to circulating anorexigenic signals such as leptin, glucose, or insulin, AMPK activity is inhibited, and conversely, orexigenic signals, such as ghrelin or fasting, promote AMPK activity (15Andersson U.

Adenoviral injection of constitutively active AMPK into the ventromedial hypothalamus causes increased food intake and body weight, and the reverse occurs on injection of dominant negative AMPK (15Andersson U.

In SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and primary rat acinar cells, AMPK is activated by carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist (19King T.D. Song L. Jope R.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10910-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In SH-SY5Y cells, the predominant muscarinic receptor has been pharmacologically determined as the M3 subtype (21Lambert D.G. Ghataorre A.S. Nahorski S.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 165: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similarly to AMPK, M3 pathways have also been implicated in the regulation of food intake. Knock-out mice lacking the M3 receptor have reduced food intake and are lean (22Yamada M. Miyakawa T. Duttaroy A. Yamanaka A. Moriguchi T. Makita R. Ogawa M. Chou C.J. Xia B. Crawley J.N. Felder C.C. Deng C.X. Wess J. Nature. 2001; 410: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that there is an M3 receptor-dependent pathway downstream of primary appetite-regulating receptors in the hypothalamus. Here we show that in SH-SY5Y cells, exposure to carbachol causes activation of AMPK α1-containing complexes without perturbing the AMP:ATP ratio. We provide evidence that although both LKB1 and CaMKKβ are present and functional in these cells, it is CaMKKβ that mediates the action of carbachol on AMPK. Finally, we show that carbachol and other direct activators or inhibitors of AMPK can significantly modulate the mRNA expression of neuropeptides involved in appetite regulation. Materials—AMARA peptide substrate, anti-CaMKKβ, and anti-AMPK pan-β polyclonal antibodies were produced in-house (23Woods A. Cheung P.C. Smith F.C. Davison M.D. Scott J. Beri R.K. Carling D. J. Biol.

Anti-LKB1 rabbit polyclonal serum antibodies were raised against bacterially expressed full-length mouse LKB1 and characterized in-house. Phospho-AMPK (pThr-172), AMPKα1, AMPKα2, and phospho-acetyl CoA carboxylase rabbit monoclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling (New England Biolabs, Herts, UK). IRDye infrared dye secondary antibodies were purchased from LI-COR (Cambridge, UK). The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line was from the European Cell Culture Collection (ECACC) (Salisbury, UK). Nucleofection reagents were from AMAXA (Cologne, Germany). Recombinant bacterially expressed AMPK (α1β1γ1) was purified as described previously (24Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 30: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

TRIzol, tissue culture medium, and supplements were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). STO-609 was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). U73122, Compound C and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) were obtained from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). AMPK activator A-769662 was purchased from the University of Dundee (Dundee, UK). Quantitect SYBR green one-step RT-PCR kit, Quantitect primer assay kits (for human 18 S, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), neuropeptide Y (NPY), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), and Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) sequences), and RNeasy kit were purchased from Qiagen (West Sussex, UK). Preparation of SH-SY5Y Cell Lysates and RNA—SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in a 1:1 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum according to ECACC guidelines. For differentiation, cells were transferred into media containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm retinoic acid for 4–6 days. Cells were treated with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide (15 min), pilocarpine (10 μm, 30 min), or carbachol (for times and concentrations indicated in Fig. 1). When required, cells were pretreated with STO609 (10 μg/ml media) or Compound C (10 μm) for 1 h or atropine (10 μm) for 30 min before AMPK activation by carbachol. Direct AMPK activation was achieved by treatment with A-769662 (200 μm, 1 h) or AICAR (2 mm, 30min). For preparation of whole cell lysates, cells were rinsed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline before lysis in ice-cold HEPES Buffer A containing Triton (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 157 μg/ml benzamidine, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Insoluble material was removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was used for subsequent analysis. For preparation of total RNA, SH-SY5Y cells were harvested in TRIzol (1 ml/1 × 106 cells), and total RNA was extracted in chloroform as per manufacturer's instructions. The resulting RNA was purified using an RNeasy column (Qiagen), and the manufacturer's protocol was followed. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of LKB1 and CaMKKβ—Synthetic RNA duplexes were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells using the AMAXA nucleofection kit V in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Sequences are as described previously (8Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M. Carling D.

Western Blot Analysis—Total SH-SY5Y protein lysates (30–50 μg) were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to LI-COR-compatible polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary antibodies were detected using LI-COR IRDye infrared dye secondary antibodies and visualized using an Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biotechnology). Analyses of Intracellular Nucleotide Levels—SH-SY5Y cells (1–2 × 106) were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by the addition of 5% perchloric acid. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 1 min), and nucleotides were analyzed as described previously (26Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. J. Biol.

Imaging of Intracellular Calcium—SH-SY5Y cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and induced to differentiate, after 24 h from plating, by the addition of 10 μm retinoic acid. Cells were loaded with the membrane-permeant calcium indicator fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-4-AM, Invitrogen) by incubation in a loading solution of 2.5 μm fluo-4-AM in isotonic physiological saline solution supplemented with 0.02% Pluronic F127 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were incubated for at least 10 min in physiological saline solution at room temperature to allow for de-esterification. PSS contains 130 mm NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Coverslips were mounted on a Bioptecs FCS2 imaging perfusion chamber (Bioptecs Inc.) and perfused with PPS. Experiments were conducted at room temperature. Images were acquired using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview confocal live cell imager (LCI) fitted on a Zeiss AxioVert 200 inverted microscope through a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Fluo-4 was excited with a 488-nm laser line of an argon ion laser, and the emitted fluorescence was collected with a 500LP emission filter. Images were collected every 2 s. The average fluorescent signal (F) from a representative area within the cell was analyzed along the time and normalized to the maximal dye fluorescence (Fmax), rendering the ratio F/Fmax. Fmax was measured at the end of the experiment following elevation of intracellular calcium by exposure of the cells to the calcium ionophore ionomycin (10 μm) in high Ca2+ and high K+ solution (30 mm CaCl2, 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). AMPK Assays—LKB1, CaMKKβ, and AMPK were immunoprecipitated from SH-SY5Y cell lysates (50 μg). LKB1 and CaMKKβ reactivation assays were performed for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of bacterially expressed recombinant AMPK (5Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G.

Analysis of mRNA by Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA (10 ng) purified from treated or untreated SH-SY5Y cells was subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR using a Qiagen SYBR green Quantitect protocol and prevalidated Quantitect primer pairs as per the manufacturer's instructions. Data were normalized to 18 S control. Single products were verified by melting curve analysis. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation from three or more independent experiments. Statistical significance was established by Student's t test. Data were considered significant at p < 0.05. Carbachol Activates AMPKα1 in SH-SY5Y Cells—Carbachol has been reported to increase AMPK activity (19King T.D. Song L. Jope R.S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 1637-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10910-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism for activation remains unknown. To dissect the pathway, we investigated AMPK activation by carbachol in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with varying concentrations of carbachol for between 5 and 30 min, and endogenous AMPK was immunoprecipitated. AMPK activity was increased in a dose-(Fig. 1a) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1b) with 4-fold activation after a 5-min exposure to 10 μm carbachol, subsiding to 2-fold at 30 min. Carbachol did not activate AMPK in primary cardiomyocytes or hepatocytes (data not shown), suggesting that the effect may be relatively specific for neuronal cells. In response to increased AMPK activity, phosphorylation of a known AMPK substrate, acetyl CoA carboxylase, was also increased in a time frame correlating with AMPK activation (Fig. 1c). Western blot analysis of SH-SY5Y cell lysates shows that both catalytic α1 and catalytic α2 subunit isoforms of AMPK are present, although α2 is expressed to a much lesser extent (data not shown). To determine which isoform mediates the response to carbachol, subunit-specific sequential depletion of AMPK was performed by three rounds of immunoprecipitation from the same lysates. The predominant AMPK activity in SH-SY5Y cells was provided by α1-containing complexes (Fig. 1d), and there was a 3-fold increase in AMPKα1 activity after carbachol treatment. Levels of α2 AMPK activity were only slightly above those observed for preimmune controls, and the -fold increase for α2-containing complexes was 1.5-fold. As activation by carbachol results in a 3–5-fold increase in AMPK activity, this suggests that carbachol mediates its downstream effects through AMPKα1-containing complexes. AMPK Activation by Carbachol Is Independent of Cellular AMP:ATP—The AMPK pathway is activated by cellular stress manifesting as perturbations in the AMP:ATP ratio or by alterations in intracellular Ca2+. The action of carbachol on muscarinic receptors increases intracellular calcium via G-protein-coupled activation of phospholipase C (28Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; : 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). However, carbachol is reported to deplete cellular ATP concentrations in primary acinar cells by 15–20% through sodium pump stimulation (20Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10910-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine which mechanism is required to activate AMPK in SH-SY5Y cells, intracellular nucleotide concentrations were measured in response to carbachol exposure. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with either hydrogen peroxide to activate AMPK by depletion of ATP or carbachol. Increased AMPK activity was confirmed in response to both treatments (Table 1) and intracellular nucleotides levels assayed by ion exchange chromatography. As expected, AMP: ATP and ADP:ATP ratios were substantially increased after hydrogen peroxide treatment, but there was no change in intracellular nucleotide levels after carbachol treatment (Table 1), suggesting that alterations in the AMP:ATP ratio do not mediate the carbachol-induced AMPK activation.TABLE 1Intracellular nucleotide ratios after treatment with carbachol or hydrogen peroxide (n = 3 ± S.D.)TreatmentAMPK activityAMP:ATPADP:ATPnmol/min/IPControl0.0069 ± 0.00140.021 ± 0.00070.046 ± 0.006Carbachol (10 μm)0.0209 ± 0.00010.021 ± 0.00060.049 ± 0.003Hydrogen peroxide (500 μm)0.0352 ± 0.00030.235 ± 0.00590.243 ± 0.049 Open table in a new tab Carbachol Activation of AMPK Requires Muscarinic Receptors, Phospholipase C Activation, and Increases in Intracellular Ca2+—As well as muscarinic receptors, SH-SY5Y cells also express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (29Gould J. Reeve H.L. Vaughan P.F. Peers C. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 145: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which can be activated by carbachol. To rule out a contribution from nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the muscarinic receptor-specific agonist, pilocarpine, and antagonist, atropine. In response to 10 μm pilocarpine, AMPK activity increased 2-fold, whereas pretreatment with 10 μm atropine for 30 min completely prevented carbachol-induced AMPK activation (Fig. 2a). These data suggest that carbachol activates AMPK through a muscarinic, and not nicotinic, receptor-mediated pathway. SH-SY5Y cells predominantly express Gq protein-coupled M3 muscarinic receptors that, upon activation, initiate a downstream cascade that involves the stimulation of PLCβ and generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (28Ashkenazi A. Peralta E.G. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; : 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that AMPK can be activated via this pathway, we treated SH-SY5Y cells with the PLC activator m-3M3FBS, which resulted in a substantial increase in AMPK activity. Pretreatment with a low concentration of U73122 (1 μm), an inhibitor of PLC, diminished the carbachol activation of AMPK by over 50% (Fig. 2b). Finally, to determine whether carbachol activation of the muscarinic receptor results in an increase in intracellular calcium in SH-SY5Y cells, we performed live cell imaging on cells loaded with the membrane-permeable fluorescent calcium indicator, fluo-4-AM. Upon application of 10 μm carbachol, SH-SY5Y cells showed a transient elevation of intracellular calcium (Fig. 2c, left panel). The rise in intracellular calcium was prevented by pretreatment with 10 μm atropine for 15 min prior to exposure to carbachol in presence of atropine (Fig. 2c, right panel). These data suggest that in SH-SY5Y cells, AMPK is activated by carbachol via the classical pathway, which requires the Gq-coupled muscarinic M3 receptor, PLC activity, and increased intracellular Ca2+. CaMKKβ Mediates Carbachol Activation of AMPK—As intracellular calcium concentrations increase substantially in SH-SY5Y cells after exposure to carbachol, CaMKKβ is therefore a likely candidate through which carbachol exerts its effects on AMPK. To determine its involvement, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with carbachol for 5 min with or without a pretreatment of STO609, a pharmacological inhibitor of CaMKKα and -β (30Tokumitsu H. Inuzuka H. Ishikawa Y. Ikeda M. Saji I. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK by carbachol was prevented by STO609 (Fig. 3a), suggesting a role for CaMKK. AMPK is also regulated by LKB1 phosphorylation, which is not reported to be sensitive to calcium flux. We determined that LKB1 is functionally active in SH-SY5Y cells by treatment with AICAR, a pharmacological activator of AMPK, which, when metabolized, yields the AMP mimetic ZMP. We observed a small but significant 2-fold increase in AMPK activity, suggesting that a functional LKB1-mediated pathway exists in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3b) as CaMKKβ is not activated in response to AICAR treatment (6Hurley R.L.

As SH-SY5Y cells possess both upstream kinase pathways, they were transfected with siRNA against CaMKKβ and LKB1 to determine specifically which is involved in carbachol-mediated AMPK activity. Despite a number of attempts using different antibodies, we were not able to measure knockdown of endogenous LKB1 and CaMKKβ by Western blotting due to lack of sensitivity. However, using more sensitive activity assays, we determined that the activity of both kinases was reduced by at least 50% after siRNA treatment as measured by their ability to phosphorylate recombinant AMPK in vitro (Fig. 3c). This degree of knockdown is consistent with previous published studies using these siRNAs (8Woods A. Dickerson K. Heath R. Hong S.P. Momcilovic M. Johnstone S.R. Carlson M. Carling D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 21-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar, 25Stahmann N. Woods A. Carling D. Heller R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5933-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have found that SH-SY5Y cells have a low transfection efficiency, routinely less than 50% (31Mookherjee P. Quintanilla R. Roh M.S. Zmijewska A.A. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 102: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Haapasalo A. Saarelainen T. Moshnyakov M. Arumae U. Kiema T.R. Saarma M. Wong G. Castren E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which may also contribute to the incomplete knockdown of protein expression. RNA inhibition of each upstream kinase reduced endogenous basal AMPK activity by almost 50% (Fig. 3d). However, inhibiting LKB1 activity did not diminish AMPK activation by carbachol (4.4-fold; Fig. 3d). In contrast, carbachol activation of AMPK was reduced from 3.5-fold in control cells to 1.8-fold in cells in which expression of CaMKKβ was down-regulated (Fig. 3d). Therefore CaMKKβ, not LKB1, is required for activation of AMPK by carbachol. AMPK Activation Inhibits Neuropeptide mRNA Expression—Both AMPK and carbachol-activated muscarinic receptor pathways are implicated in the regulation of food intake. We therefore determined whether carbachol and other modulators of AMPK activity altered mRNA expression of neuropeptides that regulate appetite and energy balance. We began by characterizing the SH-SY5Y system with respect to known direct and indirect activators of AMPK. Treatment with 10 μm carbachol produced robust AMPK activation (Fig. 4a), and RNA was prepared from cells treated at the same time. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using primers against NPY, MCH, AgRP, and POMC. We were unable to detect POMC mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells, although NPY, AgRP, and MCH mRNA were readily amplified (an average of 21, 25, and 27 cycles of PCR, respectively). In contrast with previously reported data (18Lee K. Li B. Xi X. Suh Y. Martin R.J. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we detected no significant change in NPY mRNA in response to AMPK activation (Fig. 4b). Surprisingly, we found a substantial decrease in AgRP and MCH mRNA expression 4–6 h after carbachol exposure (Fig. 4b). To confirm that AMPK itself"
https://openalex.org/W2010232975,"The mechanism underlying the important role of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) in the apoptotic effect of etoposide in glioma cells is incompletely understood. Here, we examined the role of PKCdelta in the activation of Erk1/2 by etoposide. We found that etoposide induced persistent activation of Erk1/2 and nuclear translocation of phospho-Erk1/2. MEK1 inhibitors decreased the apoptotic effect of etoposide, whereas inhibitors of p38 and JNK did not. The activation of Erk1/2 by etoposide was downstream of PKCdelta since the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was inhibited by a PKCdelta-KD mutant and PKCdelta small interfering RNA. We recently reported that phosphorylation of PKCdelta on tyrosines 64 and 187 was essential for the apoptotic effect of etoposide. Using PKCdeltatyrosine mutants, we found that the phosphorylation of PKCdeltaon these tyrosine residues, but not on tyrosine 155, was also essential for the activation of Erk1/2 by etoposide. In contrast, nuclear translocation of PKCdelta was independent of its tyrosine phosphorylation and not necessary for the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Etoposide induced down-regulation of kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), which correlated with persistent phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCdelta. Moreover, silencing of MKP-1 increased the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and the apoptotic effect of etoposide. Etoposide induced polyubiquitylation and degradation of MKP-1 that was dependent on PKCdelta and on its tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate that distinct phosphorylation of PKCdeltaon tyrosines 64 and 187 specifically activates the Erk1/2 pathway by the down-regulation of MKP-1, resulting in the persistent phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and cell apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2017534942,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) in which the reactive center loop (RCL) spontaneously inserts into a central beta-sheet, beta-sheet A, resulting in inactive inhibitor. Available x-ray crystallographic studies of PAI-1 in an active conformation relied on the use of stabilizing mutations. Recently it has become evident that these structural models do not adequately explain the behavior of wild-type PAI-1 (wtPAI-1) in solution. To probe the structure of native wtPAI-1, we used three conformationally sensitive ligands: the physiologic cofactor, vitronectin; a monoclonal antibody, 33B8, that binds preferentially to RCL-inserted forms of PAI-1; and RCL-mimicking peptides that insert into beta-sheet A. From patterns of interaction with wtPAI-1 and the stable mutant, 14-1B, we propose a model of the native conformation of wtPAI-1 in which the bottom of the central sheet is closed, whereas the top of the beta-sheet A is open to allow partial insertion of the RCL. Because the incorporation of RCL-mimicking peptides into wtPAI-1 is accelerated by vitronectin, we further propose that vitronectin alters the conformation of the RCL to allow increased accessibility to beta-sheet A, yielding a structural hypothesis that is contradictory to the current structural model of PAI-1 in solution and its interaction with vitronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2073034983,"AMACO (VWA2 protein) is an extracellular matrix protein of unknown function associated with certain basement membranes in skin, lung, and kidney. AMACO is a member of the von Willebrand factor A-like (VWA) domain containing protein superfamily and in addition to three VWA domains it also contains two epidermal growth factor-like domains. One of these contains the rare, overlapping consensus sequences for both O-glucosylation and O-fucosylation. In earlier studies of other proteins the attachment of either core glucose and fucose moieties or of the respective elongated glycans starting with these monosaccharides has been described.

It has been reported that the lack of O-fucosylation can markedly decrease secretion of proteins. However, the secretion of AMACO is not significantly affected when the glycosylation sites are mutated. The number of extracellular matrix proteins carrying the overlapping consensus sequence is very limited and it could be that these modifications have a new, yet unknown function.

AMACO consists of an N-terminal VWA-like domain, which is followed by a cysteine-rich region that has no obvious similarity to any other known domain. Toward the C terminus, an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain, two additional VWA-like domains, and a second EGF-like domain follow (Fig. 1A). Electron microscopy and nonreducing SDS-PAGE show both monomers and higher aggregates, indicating a partial cross-linking of native AMACO via unpaired cysteines. AMACO is specifically expressed in skin, lung, and kidney. The protein is deposited in the extracellular matrix and appears to be associated with certain basement membranes that underlie epithelial cells. The function of AMACO still remains unclear. However, the localization may indicate that AMACO is either a structural component of some basement membranes or part of the anchoring structures formed on a scaffold of, e.g. collagen VII or fibrillin. Recently, in a microarray AMACO was identified as a candidate marker of colon neoplasia and found to be induced by an average of 78-fold in stage II, III, and IV colon cancers, as well as in colon adenomas and colon cancer cell lines. Epitope-tagged AMACO was detectable in the blood of mice bearing transfected human cancer xenografts indicating a potential role as a diagnostic serum marker of early stage colon cancer. Therefore, AMACO was alternatively named CCSP-2, colon cancer secreted protein-2 (2Xin B. Platzer P. Fink S.P. Reese L. Nosrati A. Willson J.K. Wilson K. Markowitz S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, polymorphisms in the AMACO gene were shown to be associated with dominant protection against type 1A diabetes, although a functional relevance for this linkage is unknown (3Eller E.

O-Linked glucose and O-linked fucose are rare post-translational modifications where the sugars are directly attached to protein through an O-glycosidic linkage. These modifications are of high functional relevance for early stages of development and for vital physiological functions of certain proteins (4Peter-Katalinic J.

Some of the O-fucose moieties are elongated by the action of members of the Fringe family of β1,3-N-acetylglucosamine transferases.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), O-glucosylation and O-fucosylation together occur only on EGF domains. The proposed consensus sequences on EGF-like domains are C1XSXPC2 for the O-glucosylation and C2XXGG(S/T)C3 for the O-fucosylation, where C1, C2, and C3 are the first, second, and third conserved cysteines of the EGF-like repeat (13Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both modifications can be located in close proximity to each other on a single EGF domain (4Peter-Katalinic J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 405: 139-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the presence of both glycan types on a single EGF domain has been shown only for factor VII and δ-like protein 1 and here the substitution was with monomeric glucose and fucose (14Bjoern S.

AMACO contains an overlapping consensus sequence for both modifications on its first EGF domain. We show for the first time that both fully elongated O-glucosylated and O-fucosylated glycan chains can occur on the same EGF domain and also that extracellular matrix proteins can be so modified. Expression and Purification of Recombinant AMACO Fragments—AMACO fragments (P1–P3) were generated by PCR on full-length cDNA clones with the following primers: P1 forward, 5′-GCT AGC CCC GAC CAT CTC TCT TCA G-3′; P1 reverse, 5′-GGA TCC GTC TGG ATC AGC AGT GGT G-3′; P2 forward, 5′-GCT AGC CAC CAC TGC TGA TCC AGA C-3′; P2 reverse, 5′-GGA TCC TGG CTG GCT GCA TAG CCT C-3′; P3 forward, 5′-GCT AGC CCA GCC ACG GCC AGG CTG-3′; and P3 reverse, 5′-GGA TCC CTT GGC GGA GGA CAG GGC-3′. Full-length AMACO was generated using the primers P1 forward and P3 reverse. All forward primers introduced a 5′ terminal NheI and the reverse primers introduced a 3′ terminal BamHI restriction site. The amplified PCR products for the AMACO fragments were cloned in a modified pCEP-Pu vector (16Maertens B. Hopkins D. Franzke C.W. Keene D.R. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Greenspan D.S. Koch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10647-10659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), containing an N-terminal BM-40 signal peptide and a C-terminal His8 tag. The amplified PCR products for the full-length AMACO were cloned in a modified pCEP-Pu vector (17Gara S.K. Grumati P. Urciuolo A. Bonaldo P. Kobbe B. Koch M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol.

The recombinant plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293/Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen cells (Invitrogen) using FuGENE 6 (Roche). Transfected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluence. Secretion of recombinant proteins into the cell culture medium was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with specific antisera directed against full-length AMACO and by peptide mass fingerprinting. AMACO fragments were purified from serum-free cell culture supernatants using TALON metal affinity columns (Clontech) following the supplier's protocol. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Single mutants were generated by exchanging the respective acceptor sites for alanine (S300A:Δglc, T308A:Δfuc) using the following primers: Δglc forward, 5′-CCC CTG TGA CGC CCA GCC CTG CC-3′; Δglc reverse, 5′-GGC AGG GCT GGG CGT CAC AGG GG-3′; Δfuc forward, 5′-CTG CCA AAA TGG AGG CGC ATG CAT TCC AGA AGG TG-3′; Δfuc reverse, 5′-CAC CTT CTG GAA TGC ATGCGC CTC CAT TTT GGC AG-3′. The double mutant S300A,T308A (Δglc,Δfuc) was generated by sequentially using the same primers as for the single mutants. Mutant constructs were initially screened for the newly generated restriction site (marked in italic in primer sequence: Δglc BsaHI, Δfuc NsiI) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Full-length mutant constructs were generated by digesting AMACO-P2 constructs with SacI and AgeI and ligating to full-length constructs. Peptide N-Glycosidase F Release of N-Linked Oligosaccharides and Glycan Detection—N-Glycans were released by enzymatic cleavage with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The protein (1.5 μg) was denatured in 15 μl of 1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 95 °C. After dilution digestion was performed in 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline at 37 °C for 16–18 h using 1 unit of PNGase F. The proteins were precipitated using 5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C, washed with cold acetone, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Glycosylated proteins were detected on nitrocellulose membranes with the DIG Glycan Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's protocol. LC-MS/MS Analysis of Tryptic Peptides—Proteins were precipitated with 3 volumes of ice-cold acetone for 1 h at –20 °C, washed once with prechilled acetone, and left to dry at room temperature. Dried pellets were resuspended in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol and proteins were denatured and reduced by incubation at 60 °C for 45 min. To S-alkylate reduced cysteine residues, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 25 mm and the samples kept for 30 min in the dark. The samples were diluted 1:4 with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) added to a final concentration of 12.5 ng/μl, followed by incubation at 37 °C overnight. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Liquid chromatography (LC)-MS data were acquired on a Q-TOF II quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with a Z spray source. Samples were introduced by an Ultimate Nano-LC system (LC Packings) equipped with the Famos autosampler and the Switchos column switching module. The column setup comprised a 0.3 × 5-mm trapping column and a 0.075 × 150-mm analytical column, both packed with 3 μm Atlantis dC18 (Waters). Samples were diluted 1:10 in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A total of 10 μl was injected onto the trapping column and desalted for 1 min with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The 10 port valve switched the trap column into the analytical flow path, and the peptides were eluted onto the analytical column by using a gradient of 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 35 min and a column flow rate of approximately 200 nl/min, resulting from a 1:1,000 split of the 200 μl/min flow delivered by the pump. The electrospray ionization (ESI) interface comprised a 20-μm inner diameter × 90-μm outer diameter tapered spray emitter (Carbotec) linked to the high performance liquid chromatograph flow path using a7-μl dead volume stainless mounted onto the PicoTip holder assembly (New Objective). Stable nanospray was established by the application of 1.7 to 2.4 kV to the stainless steel union. The data-dependent acquisition of MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra was controlled by the Masslynx software. Survey scans of 1 s covered the range from m/z 400 to 1,400. Doubly and triply charged ions rising above the threshold of 15 counts per second were selected for MS/MS experiments. In MS/MS mode the mass range from m/z 40 to 1,400 was scanned in 1 s, and 5 scans were added up for each experiment. Micromass-formated peaklists were generated from the raw data by using the Proteinlynx software module. Reductive β-Elimination and Permethylation of Glycan Alditols—For structural studies the glycans were liberated by reductive β-elimination according to a protocol applicable to microscale samples (18Schulz B.L. Packer N.H. Karlsson N.G. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 6088-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The O-glycoprotein (10–30 μg) was dried in a 0.5-ml Eppendorf vial and treated with freshly prepared 0.5 m NaBH4 in 50 mm NaOH (20 μl) overnight at 50 °C. After destruction of excess borohydride with glacial acetic acid the sample was desalted with a 50-μl aliquot of Dowex 50WX8(H+). To remove boric acid 100-μl aliquots of 1% acetic acid in methanol were added to the dry sample (×5) and evaporated under nitrogen at 40 °C. To the dry sample 50 μl of dispersed NaOH in dimethyl sulfoxide was added under argon and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. Finally, a 25-μl aliquot of methyl iodide was pipetted to the frozen reaction mixture followed by incubation for a further 30 min at room temperature. After neutralization with dilute acetic acid the methylated glycans were extracted with chloroform/water. The chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen and glycans were solubilized in methanol. Analysis of O-Glycans by Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Reflex IV instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The methylated glycan samples (approximately 500 pmol/μl) contained in methanol were applied to the stainless steel target by mixing a 0.5-μl aliquot with 1.0 μl of matrix (saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1:2). Analyses were performed by positive ion detection in the reflectron mode as described previously (19Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Muller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ESI mass spectrometry data were acquired on a Q-TOF II quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Waters, Eschborn, Germany) equipped with a Z spray source. ESI (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode using previously described conditions (19Engelmann K. Kinlough C.L. Muller S. Razawi H. Baldus S.E. Hughey R.P. Hanisch F.G. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1111-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Collision energies varied in accordance with the type of molecular ion (M + Na, 50–75 V; M + H, 15–30 V). Linkage Analysis of Permethylated Oligosacchaides by GC-MS—Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared by hydrolysis of permethylated glycans with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (Fluka) for 2 h at 121°C followed by reduction with 10 mg/ml of sodium borodeuteride (Sigma) in 2 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, and acetylation with acetic anhydride (Fluka) at 100 °C for 1 h (20Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydrate Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). The partially methylated alditol acetates were extracted with chloroform/water, dried, and analyzed as a dichloromethane solution by GC-MS on a Fison MD800 (Thermo Electron, Dreieich, Germany) using a 15-m RTX5-SILMS column from Restek (Bad Homburg, Germany) and a temperature gradient from 60 to 100 °C (40 °C/min) followed by 100–280 °C (10 °C/min). Analysis of AMACO Secretion—293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin to about 60% confluence. The medium was changed shortly before transfection. 1 μg of full-length AMACO or AMACO-P2 constructs in the pCEP-Pu vector (17Gara S.K. Grumati P. Urciuolo A. Bonaldo P. Kobbe B. Koch M. Paulsson M.

Shortly, 3 μl of FuGENE 6 was mixed with 97 μl of medium, incubated for 5 min, and added dropwise to 1 μg of DNA. After 15 min of incubation, the solution was slowly added to a single well of a 6-well plate (growth area 9.6 cm2). The supernatant was harvested after 3 to 4 days. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized by scraping in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and homogenized by sonication. Supernatant and cell layer fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE at a ratio of 3:1 (for AMACO fragments) or 3:2.5 (for full-length AMACO), to achieve comparable signal intensities. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was incubated with a specific antibody directed against AMACO-P2 followed by an antibody against rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen). The signals were detected with an Odyssey scanner (Li-Cor). AMACO is N- and O-Glycosylated—AMACO has a tendency to form very large protein aggregates (1Sengle G. Kobbe B. Morgelin M. Paulsson M. Wagener R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50240-50249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and as a consequence the pure monomer cannot be obtained in large amounts. Therefore, murine AMACO was recombinantly expressed in three parts. AMACO-P1 comprises the first VWA domain, AMACO-P2 the cysteine-rich, the first EGF and the second VWA domain, and AMACO-P3 the third VWA, the second EGF, and the unique C-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). cDNAs encoding the respective sequences of mouse AMACO were cloned into the pCEP-Pu vector utilizing the BM40 secretion signal sequence and a C-terminal His8 tag (16Maertens B. Hopkins D. Franzke C.W. Keene D.R. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Greenspan D.S. Koch M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10647-10659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 EBNA cells and maintained in an episomal form. The recombinant AMACO proteins were secreted into the cell culture medium and subsequently purified by affinity chromatography on a Talon column. The purified proteins appeared in nonreducing SDS-PAGE as single bands that have moderately higher apparent molecular masses than the predicted 24.6, 33.6, and 30.9 kDa (Fig. 1B), indicating glycosylation of all AMACO fragments. Glycan staining of the fragments immobilized on nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE confirmed that all fragments are indeed glycosylated. PNGase F digestion caused a shift in the apparent molecular mass of AMACO-P1 of ∼3–5 kDa. A similar shift was not observed for AMACO-P2 or AMACO-P3 (Fig. 1B), indicating that only the N-terminal fragment P1 is N-glycosylated. After PNGase F digestion, AMACO-P1 was still positive in the glycan detection reaction, indicating additional O-glycosylation on AMACO-P1. As murine AMACO contains two predicted N-glycosylation sites, in AMACO-P1 at Asn146 and in AMACO-P3 at Asn730, only the one at Asn146 but not the one at Asn730 seems to be used in 293 EBNA cells. To further support this finding, we analyzed proteolytic fragments of AMACO-P3 by LC-MS/MS analysis. We could identify the unglycosylated proteolytic fragment containing the predicted N-glycosylation site Asn730 (results not shown), indicating that this site is either not or only rarely used in 293 EBNA cells. Thus, AMACO-P3 and AMACO-P2 are exclusively O-glycosylated. AMACO Contains Rare Consensus Sequences for O-Glycosylation—A bioinformatics search for potential O-glycosylation sites in AMACO led to the detection of two overlapping, highly conserved consensus sequences (13Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These were C1XSXPC2 for O-glucosylation and C2XXGG(S/T)C3 for O-fucosylation, where C1, C2, and C3 are the first, second, and third conserved cysteines of the EGF1 domain of fragment AMACO-P2 (Fig. 2). In AMACO, the consensus sequences are strongly conserved between species. Only one amino acid in the O-fucosylation site of the green blowfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) is altered, resulting in the sequence C2XXSG(S/T)C3 (Fig. 2). The Consensus Sequences on EGF1 Are Glycosylated—As O-fucosylation has been shown to be of functional importance, at least in Notch (21Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we studied the glycosylation of the AMACO-P2 fragment in detail using LC ESI-MS and MS/MS. After digestion with trypsin the resulting peptides were separated by liquid chromatography on a C18 column and the fractions directly analyzed by ESI-MS. The deconvoluted spectrum of one fraction showed three major peaks at 2775.5, 2921.0, and 3083.1 m/z (Fig. 3). MS/MS analysis (results not shown) revealed that all three peaks result from a single tryptic peptide 292TICPGPCDSQPCQNGGTCIPEGVDR316, bearing different post-translational modifications. This peptide originates from the region of the EGF domain that contains the potential O-glucosylation and O-fucosylation acceptor sites (in bold). The calculated mass of the carbamidomethylated, non-glycosylated tryptic peptide is 2775.5 m/z. The glycans that have been described for O-glucosylated and O-fucosylated EGF domains could account for the higher mass peaks of the spectrum. The 2921.0 m/z peak (+146 m/z) could represent the peptide carrying a deoxyhexose, probably fucose, and the 3083.1 m/z peak (+162 m/z) the peptide carrying a hexose, probably glucose. Other, higher mass peaks have additional mass increments of 2 × 132, 162, 203, and 291 m/z indicating the presence of additional pentoses (xylose), hexoses (galactose), HexNAc (N-acetylglucosamine), and NeuAc, respectively. All mass increments are consistent with the monosaccharides known to occur on EGF domains (13Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and are indicated in the spectra (Fig. 3). Interestingly, forms that contain only glucosylation could not be detected (Fig. 3). To further confirm the assumed glycosylation pattern AMACO-P2 mutants were generated, in which the glucose acceptor site Ser300 (Δglc), the fucose acceptor site Thr308 (Δfuc) or both acceptor sites (Δglc, Δfuc) were mutated to alanine residues (Fig. 4). All mutations led to the expected loss of the characteristic peaks for the respective glycosylated forms. LC-ESI-MS spectra of the double mutant (Δglc,Δfuc) showed only one peak at 2728.8 m/z (Fig. 4), which corresponds to the carbamidomethylated, non-glycosylated peptide. The mutant lacking the O-fucose acceptor site (Δfuc) displayed a major peak at 2745.7 m/z, matching the mass of the carbamidomethylated, non-glycosylated peptide. Two additional prominent peaks at 2907.9 and 3171.0 m/z (Fig. 4) are likely to represent the glucosylated and the fully xylosylated forms, whereas mass increments indicating fucosylation were not detected. The spectrum of the mutant lacking the O-glucose acceptor site (Δglc) showed the peak of the carbamidomethylated, non-glycosylated peptide at 2759.0 m/z and a major peak at 2905.0 m/z, which is likely to be the fucosylated form. The peak at 3270.0 m/z corresponds to the mass of the peptide bearing fucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose. Peaks, which would indicate glucosylation were not observed (Fig. 4). AMACO-P2 Is O-Fucosylated and O-Glucosylated—Attempts were made to determine the structure of the sugar chains on AMACO-P2. As the mutant AMACO-P2 fragments each lack a specific glycan chain, we analyzed the differences in the pattern of the cleaved-off glycans. Reductive β-elimination was performed on all AMACO-P2 proteins and the released glycan alditols were methylated using methyliodide. The permethylated glycans were subsequently analyzed by MALDI-MS (Fig. 5, supplemental Fig. S1, and Table 1). All constructs revealed a similar set of molecular ions in addition to those derived from the specific O-fucosylation and O-glucosylation indicating further mucin-type O-glycosylation. This fits with the observation that the double mutant Δglc,Δfuc was still positive in the glycan detection reaction (Fig. 1B). However, a unique 1069 m/z molecular ion, corresponding to NeuAc, dHex, Hex, and HexNAc, was detected only in wild type and Δglc. This would be consistent with the expected fucose containing glycan NeuAc-O-Gal-O-GlcNAc-O-Fuc and the structure was therefore further analyzed. ESI-MS/MS fragmentation (Fig. 6A) revealed the sequence NeuAc-O-Hex-O-HexNAc-O-deoxyhexitol by a series of characteristic ions. In particular, the B3 ion indicates the absence of dHex in the non-reducing trisaccharide and the Y1 and Y3 ions unequivocally localize the deoxyhexitol to the reducing terminus of the oligosaccharide (Fig. 6A). A characteristic molecular ion representing the glucose-containing oligosaccharides from Δfuc was found at 609 m/z. Further analysis by ESI-MS/MS fragmentation (Fig. 6B) revealed the trisaccharide structure Pen-O-Pen-O-hexitol, which would be consistent with the published glucose-based structure Xyl-O-Xyl-O-Glc. The Y1, Y2 and C1, C2 ions confirm the suggested structure.TABLE 1MALDI-MS of methylated glycan alditols derived from AMACO-P2 constructsM+NaProposed composition of glycan alditolDetected in AMACO constructsWTΔglcΔfucΔglc/fucm/z609Pen2 Hex+-+-779Hex HexNAc2(+)(+)+(+)895NeuAc Hex HexNAc++++983Hex2 HexNAc2+-+(+)1024Hex HexNAc3++++1069NeuAc dHex Hex HexNAc++--1140NeuAc Hex HexNAc2+(+)++1198dHex Hex HexNAc3++++1256NeuAc2 Hex HexNAc++++1344NeuAc Hex2 HexNAc2++++1385NeuAc Hex HexNAc3++++1559NeuAc dHex Hex HexNAc3++++1705NeuAc2 Hex2 HexNAc2++++ Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6MS/MS spectrum and proposed fragmentation of methylated alditols with an [M + Na] ion of m/z 1069, released from AMACO-P2 Δglc (A) and m/z 609, released from AMACO-P2 Δfuc (B).
