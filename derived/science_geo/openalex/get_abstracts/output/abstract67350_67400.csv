https://openalex.org/W2032350393,"A polypeptide, which has potent and diverse biological action—including systemic vasodilation, hypotension, increased cardiac output, respiratory stimulation, and hyperglycemia—was isolated from the small intestine of the hog. The peptide has 28 amino acid residues and is chemically distinct from the kinins, ""substance P,"" glucagon, and secretin."
https://openalex.org/W2022076256,"Height and weight at menarche were found for each subject in three longitudinal growth studies. Early and late maturing girls have menarche at the same mean weight, but late maturers are taller at menarche. Two other major events of adolescence, initiation of the weight growth spurt and maximum rate of weight gain, also occur at an invariant mean weight. The hypothesis is proposed that a critical body weight may trigger each of these adolescent events. Such an interaction would explain the secular trend to an earlier menarche."
https://openalex.org/W2011807027,"Three synthetic inhibitors of proteases (tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone, tosyl phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and tosyl arginine methyl ester) inhibit the tumorigenesis initiated in mouse skin by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and promoted by croton oil or its active principle, phorbol ester. These protease inhibitors, when applied directly to mouse skin, inhibit some of the irritant effects of the tumor promoter and are not toxic."
https://openalex.org/W2028530638,"In addition to its well-established inhibitory effect on uric acid synthesis, allopurinol appears to alter substantially pyrimidine metabolism, as evidenced by a striking increase in the urinary excretion of orotidine and orotic acid. Allopurinol ribonucleotide and xanthosine 5′-monophosphate are potent inhibitors of human erythrocyte orotidylic decarboxylase and provide a possible mechanism for this effect."
https://openalex.org/W1987096743,"Conditioned behavior declines in frequency when reinforcement is discontinued. In two experiments this extinction process was facilitated when competing behavior was reinforced as the original response was extinguished. When reinforcement for competing behavior was withdrawn, however, rats resumed their original behavior and there were no overall savings in total responses to extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1589426533,"The spectral changes caused by the addition of hydrogen peroxide and halide salts to chloroperoxidase have been investigated and discussed in relation to the halogenation activity of the enzyme. Chloroperoxidase forms a compound with hydrogen peroxide that is spectrally similar to horseradish peroxidase Compound I. The initial peroxide compound can decompose directly back to the native enzyme in a catalatic reaction or react with ethanol to form acetaldehyde. There is no evidence for the participation of a secondary intermediate in these reactions. The initial peroxide compound also reacts with classical peroxidase donors, such as ascorbate, guaiacol, and pyrogallol. A secondary intermediate is formed in this reaction. Thus, chloroperoxidase exhibits characteristics of both peroxidase and catalase. Chloroperoxidase can catalyze the peroxidative chlorination, bromination, and iodination of appropriate donors. At low pH, the addition of halides causes definite spectral changes in the Soret region of the native enzyme. The spectral changes show the same pH dependence as the halogenation activity. Above the pH optimum of the enzyme, the velocity of the chlorination reaction is approximately proportional to the product of the chloride and hydrogen ion concentrations. A model for the halogenation reactions has been proposed in which halide ions compete with a carboxyl group for a location near the heme group. At low pH, protonation of the carboxyl group permits halide ion to supply the negative charge preferred at this location. The close proximity of the halide to the heme enables it to act as a donor for the peroxide compound. The low pH requirement for the binding of halide is responsible for the low pH optimum of the halogenation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1992578822,"Direct analyses of solid phase formed by deoxygenating solutions of sickle-cell hemoglobin (Hb S) in the presence of certain other hemoglobin species show that hemoglobins A and C can participate in the filamentous fine structure characteristic of the sickling phenomenon. In contrast, fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) is nearly completely excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2275367379,The perfect contraceptive population is a model in which couples can avoid having more children than they wish and can have children only with determined spacing. In the U.S. from 1960 to 1965 4.7 million births 20% of total births were unwanted and would AVE been prevented with perfect contraception. About 2 million of the unwanted births occurred among the poor and near-poor; 1/2 of these being Negro poor and near-poor. For the same years 2/5 of wanted births would have occurred later if their timing had been controlled. The elimination of unwanted births would cause a reduced growth rate in the U.S. barring an increase in the average number of children desired. Even if cohort replacement were achieved a zero growth rate for the nation would be achieved only after more than 60 years.
https://openalex.org/W2005621289,"Forty-five minutes after intraperitoneal injection of a single dose (100 milligrams per kilogram) of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, the concentration of S-adenosylmethionine in rat brain was lowered by 76 percent. As little as 10 milligrams of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine per kilogram decreased content of S-adenosylmethionine in the adrenal medulla by 51 percent, whereas 100 milligrams per kilogram did not significantly depress concentration of S-adenosylmethionine in the liver in this time interval. Concentration of S-adenosylmethionine in the brain varied diurnally; L-dihydroxyphenylalanine lowered this concentration whether administered at the daily peak or at the nadir."
https://openalex.org/W2005855598,"If the Bermuda land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis, loses numerous walking legs or both chelipeds, it undergoes almost immediate preparations for molting with attendant limb regeneration. Injections of the arthropod-molting hormone, ecdysterone, have no effect in either intact animals or those missing legs."
https://openalex.org/W1996709606,"Microscopic and submicroscopic studies on regenerating gastric mucosa neonatally grafted in the subcutaneous tissue of littermate mice have revealed that immature mucous cells are totipotent; ultimately they transform into mature mucous, parietal, argyrophil, and chief cells in the gastric glands."
https://openalex.org/W2042452607,"Two separable stages in the process of chromosome pairing have been demonstrated. The first results in a close spatial relationship of homologs, and the second results in synapsis and formation of chiasmata. Colchicine reduces chiasma formation in conventional bivalents but not in an isochromosome. Thus, colchicine affects only the first stage of pairing."
https://openalex.org/W1979357533,Cyanide-inhibited electron exchange between ferri- and ferrocytochrome c molecules has been observed by nuclear magnetic resonance. Irradiation of a partially reduced protein solution at resonance frequencies arising from protons of the oxidized state results in a decrease in the absorption due to the corresponding protons of the reduced state. The experiment quantitates the hyperfine shifts observed in this system and can be used to identify hitherto unassignable resonances. Analysis of the shifts suggests that an aromatic side chain ring lies near the edge of the heme ring.
https://openalex.org/W2011483986,"Habituation and dishabituation have been observed in a semi-intact Aplysia preparation in which the central nervous system is removed. The amplitude of withdrawal responses in the gill decreases in proportion to the rate of water drops applied (one drop per 0.5 minute to one drop per 2.5 minutes at 15°C). The effects of habituation last for at least 2 hours. A dishabituated response is elicited by stopping the water drops or electrically stimulating the preparation. Furthermore, the gill contains nerve cell bodies, and habituation and dishabituation appear to be properties of these peripheral neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2040256779,"In a survey of 860 unselected human placental extracts, three variants of mitochondrial glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase were found, all of which were common enough to be considered polymorphisms. Family studies showed that this enzyme is under the control of nuclear rather than mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2092270202,"An electrical response which reproduces the waveform and frequency of the sound stimulus can be recorded from the central neural pathway for audition. Controversy has existed for some years over whether this frequency-following response (FFR) is neural or an artifact such as remote pickup of the cochlear microphonic or cross talk in the recording system. Two experiments resolve this issue by demonstrating that the frequency-following response depends upon functionally intact neural pathways. The frequency-following response, as well as auditory evoked potentials, is abolished by section of the eighth nerve; it is reversibly abolished by cooling of the cochlear nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1995828026,"Continuously rewarded rats show a decrease in running speed on a runway recently traversed by other rats undergoing experimental extinction. This ""pseudo-extinction"" effect is caused by discriminable odors emitted by extinction subjects. These odors could be confounding variables in studies using forms of aversive stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2055713338,Oral administration of large amounts of glutamic acid to adult humans and animals in a formula diet appeared to cause no clinical pathological changes. The only biochemically demonstrable effect was a decrease in serum cholesterol and associated beta lipoproteins.
https://openalex.org/W2031448684,"Charge-mosaic membranes were used for dialytic separations of potassium chloride from low-molecular-weight nonelectrolytes and neutral amino acids. The permeability ratio (potassium chloride to uncharged species) ranged from about 6 in the case of methanol to about 86 in that of mannitol. A theoretical model predicts that optimum rates of dialysis should be achieved by dialyzing against salt concentrations other than zero; this prediction was confirmed by experiment. These observations suggest potential applications of mosaics in laboratory separations, industrial processing, and hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2024495937,"Photolysis of mixtures of certain alkyl halides and aromatic amines produces dehalogenation of the halide. These reactions involve a photoinduced charge transfer from the amine to the halide. Photolysis of tritolylamine and carbon tetrachloride produces tritolylaminium chloride. Photolysis of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and diethylaniline at 3100 angstroms yields 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD), p,p'-dichlorobenzophenone (DDCO), and hydrogen chloride. Photolysis of DDT does not occur unless an inducer which has a low ionization potential, such as diethylaniline, is present. The DDT-diethylaniline mixture is stable in the dark, and the induced photolysis is not affected by triplet quenchers."
https://openalex.org/W2034939512,Extension of day length by artificial light in selected field plots in the fall prevented 76 percent of European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner)] larvae and 70 percent of codling moth [Laspeyresia pomonella (L.)] larvae from entering diapause. Nondiapausing insects cannot survive rigorous winter conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1992544132,"Fixation with picric acid or formaldehyde retains incorporated [3H]acetate which is lost after fixation with ethanol and acetic acid. Unlike [3H]uridine, [3H]acetate is diffusely incorporated into polytene chromosomes, and not preferentially into existing or newly induced puffs. It is suggested that puff formation does not include an acetylation of histones."
https://openalex.org/W2002761266,"The brain temperature of trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) was altered by perfusion of the gills with warm or cool water. Neuronal activity was recorded with microelectrodes. Twelve neurons responded to an increase in temperature with increased activity, and five neurons responded to a decrease in temperature with an increase in activity."

https://openalex.org/W2139977202,Negative pions are useful for radiation therapy of localized carcinoma because of their large end-of-range energy deposition upon capture in nuclei and the potentially accurate spatial localization of the radiation dose. Accurate determination of the depth of penetration of the pion beam in vivo can be accomplished by counting the back-to-back annihilation gamma rays resulting from positron activity induced by the stopped pions.
https://openalex.org/W1573535627,"Abstract The chemical synthesis and properties of l-carnitine esters of β-ketopalmitic acid, β-hydroxypalmitic acid, and trans-α, β-unsaturated palmitic acid are described. Isolated rat liver mitochondria oxidize the carnitine esters of these acids more efficiently than the free acids as judged by acetoacetate production and oxygen uptake. Rat liver mitochondrial extracts catalyze the conversion of palmitoyl carnitine and β-ketopalmitoyl carnitine to the CoA esters with equal efficiency. The rates of the reaction with the carnitine esters of β-hydroxypalmitic acid and trans-α,β-unsaturated palmitic acid were about 70% and 20% that obtained with palmitoyl-l-carnitine. It is shown that β-ketopalmitic acid is rapidly decarboxylated to yield pentadecanone by a nonspecific nonenzymatic reaction with several proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2028620147,"Male hybrids between the Santa Marta and Mesitas strains of Drosophila paulistorum are sterile. The sterility can be partially alleviated by treatment of the Santa Marta mothers with the antimycoplasmal antibiotics tylosin tartrate and tetracycline hydrochloride. The proportions of hybrid males in which there are mature motile spermatozoa are higher in the progenies of drug-treated mothers than in the controls. Electron microscopy reveals mycoplasma-like bodies in the untreated controls, but not in the sons of the treated females. The mycoplasma-like symbionts appear to be implicated in the production of the sterility in the hybrid males."

https://openalex.org/W2085056013,The phototropic response and distribution of photopigment in the sporangiophore of Phycomyces was investigated with a microillumination pattern. The data support the hypothesis that phototropism results from greater stimulation of growth in regions of more intense illumination and indicate that the photoreceptor extends to the outer wall of the sporangiophore.
