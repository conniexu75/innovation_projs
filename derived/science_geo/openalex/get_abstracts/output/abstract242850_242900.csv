We investigated whether IKKβ is involved in chemically induced liver cancer, a model not involving overt inflammation. Surprisingly, mice lacking IKKβ only in hepatocytes (IkkβΔhep mice) exhibited a marked increase in hepatocarcinogenesis caused by diethylnitrosamine (DEN). This correlated with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increased JNK activation, and hepatocyte death, giving rise to augmented compensatory proliferation of surviving hepatocytes. Brief oral administration of an antioxidant around the time of DEN exposure blocked prolonged JNK activation and compensatory proliferation and prevented excessive DEN-induced carcinogenesis in IkkβΔhep mice. Decreased hepatocarcinogenesis was also found in mice lacking IKKβ in both hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived Kupffer cells. These mice exhibited reduced hepatocyte regeneration and diminished induction of hepatomitogens, which were unaltered in IkkβΔhep mice. IKKβ, therefore, orchestrates inflammatory crosstalk between hepatocytes and hematopoietic-derived cells that promotes chemical hepatocarcinogenesis."

The degradation of Mcl-1 can be blocked by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting a role for the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 is ubiquinated at five lysines. Biochemical fractionation of cell extracts allowed us to identify a 482 kDa HECT-domain-containing ubiquitin ligase named Mule (Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3) that is both required and sufficient for the polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. Mule also contains a region similar to the Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3) domain that allows Mule to specifically interact with Mcl-1. Elimination of Mule expression by RNA interference stabilizes Mcl-1 protein, resulting in an attenuation of the apoptosis induced by DNA-damage agents. Thus, Mule is a unique BH3-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase apical to Bcl-2 family proteins during DNA damage-induced apoptosis.

Apoptosis is a form of cell death orchestrated by chains of biochemical reactions. Cells undergoing apoptosis show characteristic morphological features such as condensation of cytoplasmic and nuclear contents, blebbing of plasma membranes, fragmentation of nuclei, and ultimately breakdown into membrane bound apoptotic bodies that are rapidly phagocytized (Kerr et al., 1972Kerr J.F.

Mitochondria play an important role in regulating apoptosis induced by intracellular damaging signals such as DNA damage in mammalian cells (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: Critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3835) Google Scholar). Apoptotic stimuli exert their effects on mitochondria to cause the release of proapoptotic factors like cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo. These factors either directly activate caspases, a group of intracellular cysteine proteases that execute apoptosis by cleaving their substrates or releasing caspase inhibition imposed by the inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs; Du et al., 2000Du C.

Mitochondrial response to apoptotic stimuli is regulated by the pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins (Gross et al., 1999Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Breaking the mitochondrial barrier.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 protect mitochondrial integrity, while the proapoptotic members of the family promote the release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria. The fate of a cell under apoptotic stimulation is determined by the balance between the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. Therefore, studying the regulation of such balance will be critically important for our understanding of apoptosis regulation. Among the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family proteins, Mcl-1 is unique in that it is an early-response gene that can be rapidly induced and turned over (Kozopas et al., 1993Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. MCL1, a gene expressed in programmed myeloid cell differentiation, has sequence similarity to BCL2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This property enables Mcl-1 to function at an early step in a signaling cascade, consisting of Bcl-2 family proteins, and provides an acute protective function against apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, adenoviral infection, growth factors’ withdrawal, and treatment of cytotoxic agents (Cuconati et al., 2003Cuconati A.

In the current report, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 is polyubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro. Using HeLa cell extracts as a source, we established a cell-free assay for Mcl-1 ubiquitination. Biochemical fractionation of HeLa cell extracts allowed us to identify and purify a 482 kDa E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated the polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. This protein turned out to be a novel homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus (HECT)-domain-containing ubiquitin ligase. We named this protein Mule, for Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3. Proteins targeted for proteasome degradation are usually modified by a polyubiquitin chain (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). To test whether Mcl-1 is ubiquitinated, we treated HeLa cells expressing Flag-Mcl-1 with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 to block the proteasome activity and performed immunoprecipitation analysis for Flag-Mcl-1 to test for the accumulation of higher-molecular-weight forms of Mcl-1 that could be ubiquitin modified. As shown in Figure 1A , higher-molecular-weight protein bands recognized by anti-Mcl-1 antibody were indeed accumulated upon MG132 treatment (Figure 1A, lanes 3 and 4). To rule out a possibility that these higher-molecular-weight bands were from Mcl-1-associated protein rather than Mcl-1 itself, the protein mixture was first heated in the presence of 1% SDS and 5 mM DTT to disassociate protein-protein interactions before being subjected to immunoprecipitation. The disassociation was measured by the absence of Bim, a known Mcl-1-associated protein in the immunoprecipitates (Figure 1A, lanes 3–6, lower panel). The heat treatment removed Bim from Mcl-1 immunoprecipitate, but the higher shift of Mcl-1 bands remained (Figure 1A, lanes 5 and 6). This result suggested that polyubiquitination of Mcl-1 might occur. The immunoprecipitates were also probed by an anti-ubiquitin antibody to verify that these higher-molecular-weight bands were indeed caused by polyubiquitin conjugation of Mcl-1. As shown in Figure 1B, the higher-molecular bands that were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag antibody were also recognized by the anti-ubiquitin antibody, indicating that the shift of Mcl-1 protein bands were caused by polyubiquitin conjugation (Figure 1B, lane 4). We then established an in vitro ubiquitination assay for Mcl-1. The system consists of an ATP regenerating system, GST-ubiquitin or methylated ubiquitin (ubiquitin was reductively methylated to prevent polyubiquitination chain formation as described by Carrano et al., 1999Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. SKP2 is required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar), ubiquitin aldehyde to block the deubiquitin enzymes, radio-labeled recombinant human Mcl-1 protein generated by in vitro translation, and an S100 fraction from HeLa cells. As shown in Figures 1C and 1D, both GST-ubiquitin and methylated ubiquitin were readily conjugated to the radio-labeled Mcl-1. Furthermore, each component was indispensable for this ubiquitin ligating activity (data not shown). This in vitro ubiquitination assay with methylated ubiquitin provided us a tool to map the Mcl-1 ubiquitination sites. In principle, methylated ubiquitin cannot be polymerized; therefore, each shifted band with the addition of 7 kDa molecular mass is caused by ubiquitination on a single site. If ubiquitin is present, excess amounts of methylated ubiquitin can block polyubiquitin chain formation, resulting in the formation of short polyubiquitin chains. Since Mcl-1 was synthesized in vitro in reticulocyte lysates and an S100 was utilized as a source for ubiquitin ligase activity, polyubiquitin chains derived from ubiquitin present in the reticulocyte lysates or the S100 were terminated by methylated ubiquitin, producing short polyubiquitin chains (mono-, di-, and triubiquitin; Figure 1D). We used this assay in combination with site-specific mutagenesis to examine which lysine residue(s) is required for Mcl-1 ubiquitination, and the data are shown in Figure 1E. Mcl-1 contains total of 13 lysine residues and could be ubiquitinated to multiple major upshifted bands with an ∼7 kDa interval with methylated ubiquitin in the HeLa S100 (Figure 1E, lane 1). None of these ubiquitinated bands was formed when all the lysine residues in Mcl-1 were mutated to arginines (Figure 1E, lane 2). When the first three lysine residues (5, 40, and 136) were mutated, the majority of Mcl-1 ubiquitination was eliminated, and only one major band remained (Figure 1E, lane 3). Among these three lysines, if lysine 136 was intact, a strong short polyubiquitin chain was formed, indicating that lysine 136 was one major ubiquitin target site (Figure 1E, lane 4). The short polyubiquitin chain ligated to lysine 136 disappeared when lysine 136 was mutated (Figure 1E, lanes 5 and 6), and another short polyubiquitin chain appeared (Figure 1E, lanes 5 and 6). This chain could be ligated to either lysine 5 or 40, since ablation of both sites blocked its formation (Figure 1E, lane 3), but not when either one of them was mutated (Figure 1E, lanes 5 and 6). To search for additional sites beyond first three lysines, we combined mutations at the first three lysines with five lysine resides in the middle of Mcl-1, and this change completely abolished Mcl-1 ubiquitination (Figure 1E, lane 7). In contrast, combining the aforementioned mutations with mutations in the last five lysine residues showed the same ubiquitination pattern as the first three lysine mutant alone, indicating that they did not contribute to Mcl-1 ubiquitination (Figure 1E, lane 8). Among the five lysine residues in the middle of Mcl-1, mutations at lysine 194 and 197 in combination with the first three lysine mutants abolished ubiquitination, while the mutations at the lysine residues 208 and 234 did not have much effect (Figure 1E, lanes 9–11). Therefore, five lysine residues (5, 40, 136, 194, and 197) in Mcl-1 protein are involved in ubiquitin conjugation (Figure 1F). Consequently, mutations in these five lysine residues lead to prolongation of Mcl-1 half-life (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Among these five lysine residues, lysines 136, 194, and 197 are conserved among human, mouse, and rat (data not shown). To isolate the enzyme that carries out Mcl-1 ubiquitination, we fractionated HeLa cell S100 extracts and reconstituted the Mcl-1 ubiquitination reaction using different column fractions. We found that the Mcl-1 generated by in vitro translation gave high background in this assay. Therefore, we switched to the purified bacterially expressed recombinant Flag-tagged Mcl-1 protein as a substrate. This modification dramatically increased the specificity and sensitivity of the assay since the Mcl-1 ubiquitin conjugates now could be detected by anti-Flag antibody without interference from reticulocyte lysates. The recombinant Mcl-1 could be efficiently ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase present in the HeLa cell extracts (Figure 2A , lane 3). Ubiquitin-protein ligation requires the sequential action of three enzymes. The C-terminal Gly residue of ubiquitin is activated in an ATP-requiring step by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1. Activated ubiquitin is next transferred to an active-site Cys residue of a ubiquitin-carrier protein, E2. Finally, the ubiquitin is linked to the substrate by a ubiquitin-protein ligase, or E3 enzyme (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). Specificity of ubiquitin-protein ligation and subsequent degradation of target proteins appears to be determined through selective interaction between specific E3s and protein substrates (Varshavsky, 2000Varshavsky A. Recent studies of the ubiquitin system and the N-end rule pathway.Harvey Lect. 2000; 96: 93-116PubMed Google Scholar). To study how many factors are involved in Mcl-1 ubiquitination, we first fractionated HeLa S100 through an ion exchange Q column into four fractions: Flow-through (QFT), proteins bound to the column and eluted at 150 mM NaCl (Q15), 300 mM NaCl (Q30), and 1 M NaCl (Q100), respectively. Three fractions, QFT, Q30, and Q100 were necessary and sufficient to catalyze the Mcl-1 ubiquitination in this reaction (Figure 2A, lanes 4–8). Using a similar ion exchange column, it was reported that majority of E2 activity is present in the QFT, while the E1 resides in the Q30 fraction (Hershko et al., 1983Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. Components of ubiquitin-protein ligase system. Resolution, affinity purification, and role in protein breakdown.J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore substituted Q30 activity with the purified human E1 enzyme and the QFT fraction with several purified recombinant human E2s. We found that the recombinant human E1 could indeed substitute for the Q30 fraction, and one of the E2 enzymes, UbcH7, could substitute the QFT fraction (data not shown). However, E1 and UbcH7 were not sufficient for the Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase activity (Figure 2B, lane 2). Addition of the Q100 fraction, rather than QFT or Q30, to the reaction containing E1 and UbcH7, restored Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase activity, indicating that the Q100 fraction contained an E3 enzyme for Mcl-1 ubiquitination (Figure 2B, lanes 4–6). We referred to this Mcl-1 ubiquitin E3 ligase activity present in the Q100 fraction as Mule for Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3. Using Mcl-1 ubiquitination as an assay, we purified the Mule activity from the Q100 to apparent homogeneity through a six step procedure (Figure 3A ; see the Experimental Procedures for details). The last step of purification, a Mono Q column chromatographic step, is shown in Figures 3B and 3C. Mule activity was eluted from the Mono Q column at roughly 400 mM NaCl (Figure 3C, fractions 10 and 11). The same protein fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Colloidal blue staining. A protein band with a molecular mass much larger than the highest molecular weight standard used (207 kDa) correlated with the Mcl-1 ligase activity (Figure 3B). To obtain the sequence identity of this Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase activity, the protein was excised from the gel and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by mass spectral analysis. The mass fingerprinting of the digested peptides was initially mapped to a previously reported protein Ureb1, a 310 amino acid HECT-domain-containing protein (Gu et al., 1994Gu J. Ren K. Dubner R. Iadarola M.J. Cloning of a DNA binding protein that is a tyrosine kinase substrate and recognizes an upstream initiator-like sequence in the promoter of the preprodynorphin gene.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). But it was quite apparent that Ureb1 did not represent Mule in its entity because of the size difference. We subsequently performed several rounds of BLAST searching using the NCBI genebank and TIGR human gene index (http://www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/tgi/T_index.cgi?species=human) in combination with a Genome Scan using the human genomic sequence (http://genes.mit.edu/genomescan.html) to assemble the full-length Mule sequence (see the Experimental Procedures). The finally assembled Mule sequence based on these resources is 4374 amino acid residues long (Figures 4A and S2). Furthermore, the peptides we identified with mass spectrometry technology using the purified endogenous Mule were matched throughout the newly assembled full-length Mule, including the new N terminus (Figure S2). The 4374 amino acid Mule contains multiple recognizable domains (Figure 4A). The COOH-terminal 350 amino acid residues were well conserved among the HECT ubiquitin ligase domains (Figure 4B). Mule also contains a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and a WWE domain in the middle of the protein (Aravind, 2001Aravind L. The WWE domain: a common interaction module in protein ubiquitination and ADP ribosylation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, Hofmann and Bucher, 1996Hofmann K. Bucher P. The UBA domain: a sequence motif present in multiple enzyme classes of the ubiquitination pathway.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In between the WWE and the HECT domains, there is a well-conserved BH3 domain that is shared by all the Bcl-2 family of proteins (Figure 4C), and none of the sequence matching with BH1, BH2, and BH4 domains was found in Mule. At the N terminus of Mule, there are two unclassified domains: DUF, for domain of unknown function. From the structure analysis, these two domains resemble ARM (Armadillo)-like repeats; therefore we named them as ARLD1 (ARM repeat-like domain 1) and ARLD2 (Figure 4A). Mule is highly conserved in mammals. The amino acid sequence among human and mouse share more than 90% identity throughout the entire protein, and all the domains are well conserved (Figure S3). After cloning of the putative full-length Mule, we generated and purified recombinant Mule protein using a baculovirus-based expression system (Figure 5A ). In the presence of E1, Ubch7 (E2), and an ATP-regenerating system, the purified recombinant Mule was able to stimulate Mcl-1 ubiquitination with methylated or GST-tagged ubiquitin, but not with a ubiquitin-like protein SUMO (Figure 5B). We used methylated ubiquitin for further biochemical analysis because it gave clearer signal. Mule ubiquitinated Mcl-1 in a dose-dependent manner, and the ubiquitination activity relied on the presence of E1 and E2 (Figure 5C). To further confirm that the HECT domain was required for E3 activity, the active-site Cys residue that was deduced from conservation among various HECT domain E3s (Figure 4B) was mutated to an Ala by site-specific mutagenesis. The mutant Mule was purified through the same procedure as wild-type Mule. In contrast to wild-type Mule, the point mutant lost E3 activity for Mcl-1 (Figure 5D, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, the Cys mutant Mule showed no dominant-negative effect over wild-type Mule on Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase activity (Figure 5D, lanes 4–9). The members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins containing only the BH3 domain use this domain to interact with other family members. If Mule also uses its BH3 domain to interact with Mcl-1, a peptide containing this domain should compete for Mule-Mcl-1 interaction, therefore blocking Mcl-1 ubiquitination in the reconstituted system. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a 26 amino acid Mule BH3-containing peptide and a mutant peptide in which four hydrophobic residues required for protein-protein interaction were switched with glutamates (4E). As shown in Figure 5E, the Mule BH3 peptide can efficiently block Mcl-1 ubiquitination at 4 μM (Figure 5E, lane 4), while the Mule BH3-4E mutant has no obvious effect even at 20 μM (Figure 5E, lane 9). To further confirm that Mule can promote Mcl-1 polyubiquitination, we used wild-type ubiquitin to perform an Mcl-1 in vitro ubiquitination assay. Mule stimulates Mcl-1 polyubiquitination in the presence of E1 and E2 (Figure 5F, lanes 3–7 and 9). Mutation of the active cystine site abrogates ubiquitin ligase activity (Figure 5F, lane 8). Addition of BH3 peptide rather that 4E mutant blocked Mcl-1 polyubiquitination (Figure 5F, lanes 10–13). We generated a monoclonal antibody against the bacterially expressed Mule (amino acids 2219–2396) and performed Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments with this antibody. This antibody specifically recognizes the 482 kDa band in human cell extracts (data not shown). The specificity of this antibody was confirmed by either antigen competition or small RNA interference (data not shown and Figure 7). Mule was unstable upon high-temperature treatment displaying significant breakdown products when boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (data not shown). Having an antibody that recognizes the endogenous protein allowed us to specifically deplete Mule from the HeLa extracts. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B , depletion of Mule with this anti-Mule monoclonal antibody dramatically compromised Mcl-1 ubiquitination in the extracts, indicating that Mule is the major E3 for Mcl-1 in HeLa cell extracts (Figures 6A and 6B, lane 2). In contrast, the same depletion experiment performed with another monoclonal antibody against β-tubulin did not deplete Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase activity (Figures 6A and 6B, lane 1). We next tested whether Mule interacts with Mcl-1 in vivo. Cell extracts from Flag-Mcl-1-expressing cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against Flag or Mule. As shown in Figure 6C, the antibody against Flag precipitated Flag-Mcl-1 in Flag-Mcl-1-expressing cells, but not in the control cells (Figure 6C, lower panel, lanes 1 and 2). The Flag antibody also precipitated Mule, and the amount of coprecipitated Mcl-1 and Mule increased upon MG132 treatment (Figure 6C, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that Mcl-1 interacts with Mule in vivo. To examine whether the BH3 domain of Mule is sufficient for interaction with Mcl-1, we used a biotin-labeled version of the 26 amino acid Mule BH3 peptide and the 4E mutant to pull down proteins from cell extracts. As shown in Figure 6D, Mule BH3 domain specifically pulled down Mcl-1, but not Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax in HeLa S100 (Figure 6D, lane 3), while no interaction between Mule BH3-4E mutant with Mcl-1 was detected (Figure 6D, lane 4). In contrast, the BH3 peptide from another proapoptotic BH3-only containing protein Bim was able to pull down all four proteins as reported before (Figure 6D, lane 5; Harada et al., 2004Harada H.

To confirm that Mule was responsible for Mcl-1 degradation in vivo, we eliminated Mule expression by an RNA interference approach. Transient expression of each of four different siRNAs against Mule was able to eliminate the majority of Mule; however, two or three days after transfection, residual Mule still could be detected, likely due to its long half-life or limitations of transfection efficiency (data not shown). Long-lived proteins are always difficult to be manipulated by a transient siRNA strategy. We therefore established a stable cell line that only expressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Mule upon addition of tetracycline. Cell growth was not dramatically affected by tetracycline addition (data not shown). This inducible shRNA approach provides superior knockdown efficiency and broadened the time window to evaluate the cellular effect on Mule depletion. To incr"

The Complex II structure provides a bona fide model for study of the mitochondrial respiratory system and human mitochondrial diseases related to mutations in this complex. Mitochondria are cellular organelles of prokaryotic origin that are found in almost all eukaryotic cells. The mitochondrial respiratory system, consisting of five membrane protein complexes (I to V), produces most of the energy in eukaryotic cells (Saraste, 1999Saraste M.

However, no breakthroughs have been made on the structures of complexes I and II. Mitochondrial Complex II, also known as mitochondrial succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (mitochondrial SQR) (EC 1.3.5.1), is a key membrane complex in the Krebs cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the mitochondrial matrix as succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate oxidation is coupled to reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol at the mitochondrial inner membrane as one part of the respiration electron transfer chain (Figure 1). Electrons are transferred from succinate to ubiquinone through the buried prosthetic groups flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD); the [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], and [3Fe-4S] clusters; and heme, which form an integral part of the complex (Hagerhall, 1997Hagerhall C. Succinate: quinone oxidoreductases. Variations on a conserved theme.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase normally consists of a soluble catalytic heterodimer and an integral membrane region. The soluble catalytic heterodimer is made up of subunit A with a covalently bound FAD cofactor and subunit B containing three iron-sulfur clusters: [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], and [3Fe-4S] (Hagerhall, 1997Hagerhall C. Succinate: quinone oxidoreductases. Variations on a conserved theme.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The integral membrane region anchoring the complex to the inner membrane contains one or two hydrophobic peptides with or without heme groups. Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductases can be classified into five types (A–E) according to the number of their hydrophobic subunits and heme groups (Lemos et al., 2002Lemos R.S. Fernandes A.S. Pereira M.M. Gomes C.M. Teixeira M. Quinol:fumarate oxidoreductases and succinate:quinone oxidoreductases: phylogenetic relationships, metal centres and membrane attachment.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial SQRs belong to type C and contain one heme molecule and two transmembrane proteins: the large cytochrome b binding protein (CybL or subunit C) and the small cytochrome b binding protein (CybS or subunit D) (Lemos et al., 2002Lemos R.S. Fernandes A.S. Pereira M.M. Gomes C.M. Teixeira M. Quinol:fumarate oxidoreductases and succinate:quinone oxidoreductases: phylogenetic relationships, metal centres and membrane attachment.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To date, only the structures of prokaryotic succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (one for type B, one for type D, and one for type C), which share a similar enzymatic function with mitochondrial SQR (Complex II), have been reported (Iverson et al., 1999Iverson T.M.

Today, important questions remain on the mechanism of ubiquinone reduction by Complex II and the process for ubiquinone transition between Complex II and Complex III. Probing the location and number of ubiquinone reaction sites in mitochondrial Complex II is therefore essential to address the above questions. In the absence of a reliable three-dimensional structure of mitochondrial SQR (Complex II), researchers often used prokaryotic SQR and quinone:fumarate reductase (QFR) structures (Iverson et al., 1999Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C.

Architecture of succinate dehydrogenase and reactive oxygen species generation.Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) as models to investigate the ubiquinone binding sites. However, questions still remain for two reasons. First, the sequence homology of the integral membrane anchors between mitochondrial SQR (Complex II) and prokaryotic SQR is less than 20% (Figures 2A and 2B ), indicating that the hydrophobic domains undergo unique evolutionary pressure imposed by different functions. Secondly, ubiquinone analog inhibitors such as 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) and carboxanilide (carboxin), which are vital for studying mitochondrial Complex II quinone-reduction activity and its Q pool, only weakly inhibit their bacterial counterparts (Maklashina and Cecchini, 1999Maklashina E. Cecchini G.

This observation strongly suggests that mitochondrial Complex II has ubiquinone binding pockets (conformations and/or positions) different from those of its prokaryotic counterparts. Inactivation of mitochondrial Complex II either by premature termination or by mutation has manifested a range of diseases such as familial pheochromocytoma, familial head-and-neck paraganglioma, and Leigh syndrome (Ackrell, 2002Ackrell B.A. Cytopathies involving mitochondrial complex II.Mol.

Inborn errors of complex II—unusual human mitochondrial diseases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These diseases often demonstrate neurological disorders and are mainly related with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Rustin and Rotig, 2002Rustin P. Rotig A. Inborn errors of complex II—unusual human mitochondrial diseases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To date, attempts to integrate a wealth of data about these diseases have been hampered by the lack of a mitochondrial Complex II structure. Therefore, detailed structural information on mitochondrial Complex II is essential for functional, mechanistic, and clinical studies. Here, we report the first crystal structure of mitochondrial Complex II from porcine heart at 2.4 Å resolution and its complex structure with the inhibitors 3-nitropropionate (NPA) and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) at 3.5 Å resolution. The mitochondrial Complex II (124 kDa) was purified from porcine heart and crystallized in an orthorhombic crystal form (space group P212121) with one complex per asymmetric unit. The structure contains four proteins: FAD binding protein or flavoprotein (Fp, 68 kDa, 622 amino acids), iron-sulfur protein (Ip, 29 kDa, 252 amino acids), and two membrane-anchor proteins (CybL, 15 kDa, 140 amino acids and CybS, 11 kDa, 103 amino acids) with a total of six transmembrane helices (Figure 3A ).

Open table in a new tab The overall structure is shaped like the letter “q,” with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic multipass transmembrane-anchor tail. The structure has a total surface area of 40,496 Å2. As shown in Figure 3A, the hydrophilic head is 70 Å wide and 80 Å high, while the hydrophobic anchor tail has a width of ∼45 Å and a height of ∼45 Å. Approximately 40 Å of the anchor tail spans the transmembrane region, and five charged residues (Asp, Glu, and Lys) as well as two polar residues (Asn and Ser) are distributed around the bottom of the tail. We have assigned this complex as a transmembrane protein, i.e., the tail protrudes and is exposed into the intermembrane space. The molecular packing in the crystal is partially mediated by interactions between neighboring transmembrane regions (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The packed transmembrane anchors form a thick membrane-like plane oriented at ∼20° to the crystallographic c axis. The neighboring molecules orient in opposite directions with respect to the plane of the membrane domain, suggesting that the physiological form of the mitochondrial SQR is most likely to be a monomer, unlike that for E. coli, which is believed to be a trimer (Yankovskaya et al., 2003Yankovskaya V.

Architecture of succinate dehydrogenase and reactive oxygen species generation.Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic head of Complex II is comprised of subunit A, Fp, and subunit B, Ip. The N-terminal nine residues of Fp and the N-terminal eight and C-terminal five residues of Ip were missing from the electron density map. Fp has a Rossmann-type fold with four subdomains (Iverson et al., 1999Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C.

The FAD binding domain can be divided into three parts: (1) an N-terminal β barrel subdomain (A10–A61 and A154–A273), (2) a floating subdomain (A62–A153) with two helices and seven small β strands, and (3) a subdomain (A361–A445) embedded between the above two domains. The core for FAD binding is composed of a ten-stranded, β sheet-like β barrel with three parallel helices on one side and one helix-like loop on the other (Figure 3B). Ip, shaped like a butterfly, contains one N-terminal domain (B9–B114) with a main five-stranded β sheet and one small helix and one C-terminal α-helical domain (B115–B247) with six helices linked by loops (Figure 3B). The N-terminal domain contains a loop for [2Fe-2S] ligation, and the C-terminal domain is responsible for binding the [4Fe-4S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters. From the top view, the entire hydrophobic domain, containing two peptides, resembles a flower, with the heme group as its pistil and the transmembrane helices as leaves (Figure 3B). In this structure, CybL was traced for 138 residues with the N-terminal two residues missing, and CybS was traced for 102 residues with the N-terminal residue missing. CybL has five helices (Figure 2, Figure 3): helix 1L (C7–C21), helix 2L (C36–C66), helix 3L (C70–C80), helix 4L (C84–C114), and helix 5L (C119–C142); CybS has four helices (Figure 2, Figure 3): helix 1S (D36–D62), helix 2S (D66–D92), helix 3S (D95–D123), and helix 4S (D126–D136). Both have a matrix-side N terminus and an intermembrane-space-side C terminus (Figures 3A and 3B). The N-terminal part of CybL forms a hydrophilic helix (helix 1L) that interacts with Ip. Transmembrane helices 2L and 4L of CybL and helices 1S and 2S of CybS are bound together and surrounded by helix 5L and helix 3S. The antiparallel helix 3L and helix 4S are arranged together near the intermembrane surface, making a closed structure below the four bundled helices (Figures 3A and 3B). These two antiparallel helices (3L and 4S) have a charged side emerging out of the membrane into the intermembrane space. The angle (∼50°) between helices 2L and 4L is large enough to endow an obvious sunken hydrophobic cavity below the heme group (Figure 3A). Four parallel aromatic residues, Tyr-C100, Phe-C96, Phe-C92, and Tyr-C88, are located at one side of helix 4L and form an ordered array from the matrix membrane side to the intermembrane side (see Supplemental Data). The center-to-center distances among these aromatic groups are all less than 7 Å. These groups should provide strong stacking interactions with each other and are beneficial for stability of the helix structure. These novel structural characteristics should be related to the function of Complex II and are suggested for future investigation. The interactions between the four protein subunits of mitochondrial SQR are crucial for its formation, function, and stability. The contact-access surface area between Fp and Ip is about 2540 Å2 in total, including 11.5% of the Fp surface area and 19.7% of the Ip surface area. The contact-access surface area between Ip and the transmembrane anchor is about 2320 Å2, or 18% of the Ip surface area and 14.8% of the surface area of the transmembrane anchor. While there is no direct interaction between Fp and the hydrophobic membrane anchor, 40% of the total surface area of Ip contributes to the interaction with Fp and the membrane anchor, indicating that the overall structural stability of the complex is conferred by the Ip protein. The contact surfaces between the four subunits are dominated by hydrophobic interactions. Compared with the solvent-accessible surface in general, the contact surface possesses significantly lower thermal factors (Figure 3C), which is in good agreement with the strong binding of those subunits. In addition, one novel helix-loop motif (C6−C34, helix 1L) at the N terminus of CybL protrudes into the matrix side, where it interacts with Ip via a surface contact area of 900 Å2 and contributes about 40% of the contact area between Ip and the transmembrane anchor. The only linkage between helix 1L and the main body of the hydrophobic membrane anchor is mediated by a flexible loop (C22–C35). These unique properties of helix 1L suggest that it is important for the stability of Complex II and may play a crucial role in recognition between Ip and the transmembrane anchor when this complex is being assembled. The five prosthetic groups (FAD, [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], [3Fe-4S], and heme group) required for electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone were unambiguously assigned into the electron density map (Figure 4A ). FAD is located at the interface of the β barrel subdomain and the embedded subdomain of Fp and is directed into the β barrel (Figure 3B). A covalent bond was found between C8M of FAD and NE2 of His-A57. There were hydrogen bonds between FAD and Fp main-chain atoms of Lys-A50, Gly-A65, Ala-A179, Asn-A413, Ser-A414, and Leu-A415 and side chain atoms of Thr-A49, Ser-A56, Asp-A233, Ser-A414, and Glu-A398. Ip binds the three iron-sulfur clusters (Figure 3, Figure 4). First, in the B64−B73 loop region, [2Fe-2S] is tightly ligated by four conserved cysteines: Cys-B65, Cys-B70, Cys-B73, and Cys-B85. Second, [4Fe-4S] binds to the loop region (B158−B164 and B224−B229) though four cysteine ligands: Cys-B158, Cys-B161, Cys-B164, and Cys-B225. Third, around [3Fe-4S] are two loops, B215−B221 and B167−B171, where the side-chain thiolates of Cys-B221, Cys-B168, and Cys-B215 take the role of ligands to the iron centers. As shown in Figure 3B, the heme group is embedded into the transmembrane region among the four bound helices (helices 2L, 4L, 1S, and 2S). The heme iron is coordinated by the imidazole of two histidines, His-C101 and His-D79, with the same Fe-N distance of 2.2 Å. The heme propionate groups interact with three charged residues, Arg-D47, His-C108, and Arg-C46 (Figure 4A). The hydrophobic interaction between the porphyrin group and four helices further stabilizes the bound heme. In the native structure, clear electron density for two long acyl chains was located among helix 2L, helix 4L, and helix 1S below the heme group, and this was assigned as a phospholipid. The mitochondrial inner membrane is mostly composed of cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Based on the shape of the electron density, we assigned the lipid as PE (Figure 3, Figure 4A). The binding of this PE lipid, termed PE1, shows a tight and hydrophobic mode with two long acyl tails, and no specificity could be found for its head binding. A second phospholipid, also assigned as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE2), was located near helix 3S (Figure 4A). This second phospholipid becomes a mediator for transmembrane interactions when those complexes pack together in the crystal. It is interesting to note that no phospholipid molecules could be found at equivalent positions in the complex structure cocrystallized with inhibitors NPA and TTFA. 3-nitropropionate (NPA) is a succinate analog and a strong inhibitor for the succinate-oxidation enzymatic activity of Complex II. 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) is a classical inhibitor for the ubiquinone reduction of Complex II by occupying its ubiquinone binding sites. The Complex II and these two inhibitors were cocrystallized in the same orthorhombic crystal form (space group P212121) and unit cell as the native structure. The final inhibitor binding complex model was refined to 3.5 Å resolution. One NPA molecule (Figure 4B) was found near the FMN group of FAD, and two TTFA molecules (Figures 4C and 4D) were found in the proximity of [3Fe-4S] and at the distal side of the transmembrane anchor. Electron density in the omit map at the succinate binding site was assigned as an NPA molecule (Figure 4B). The nitryl group of NPA interacts with the side chains of Thr-A266 and His-A254, the main chains of Glu-A267 and Gly-A63, and the FMN group of FAD. The amide group of Gln-A252 anchors one side of the carboxyl group of NPA, while the guanidinium group of Arg-A409 and the imidazole group of His-A365 anchor the other side. It is notable that this substrate binding site near FAD is empty but for a few bound water molecules in the native Complex II structure. One TTFA molecule (TTFA1) could be clearly assigned according to the omit map (Figure 4C). TTFA1 binds to the pocket formed by helix 2L (C38–C52), helix 2S (D77–D91), and the [3Fe-4S] ligating region (B214–B219 and B166–B175), which will be discussed below. The oxygen atom from the thenoyl group forms two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Trp-B173 and Tyr-D91, and another oxygen atom from the trifluoroacetone group interacts with the side chain of Tyr-D91 via one water molecule (W2) as a mediator. The sulfur atom from the thenoyl group interacts with the hydroxyl group of Ser-C42. The hydrophobic environment formed by residues Trp-C35, Met-C39, Ile-C43, Ile-C30, Pro-B169, and Trp-B172 is favorable for TTFA binding, especially for the fluoroform and thiophene groups. Density in the omit map near the C terminii of CybL and CybS could be assigned as a second TTFA molecule (TTFA2) (Figure 4D). Two water molecules surround the inhibitor and are thought to be mediators for interactions between TTFA2 and Complex II. The oxygen atom of the thenoyl group interacts with the side-chain atom of Tyr-D61 via water W3. The interaction between the sulfur atom of the thenoyl group and the side chain of Trp-D134 is mediated by water W1. TTFA2 occupies the position quasiequivalent to the head group of the PE1 phospholipid found in the native structure. Assuming the missing phospholipid was not due to the sample preparation process, this inhibitor-phospholipid exchange should have biological significance. The fact that TTFA1 has stronger electron density than TTFA2 suggests that the binding affinity for TTFA1 is higher than for TTFA2, which is also confirmed by the different binding modes for those two molecules: TTFA1 interacts with Complex II more directly via more hydrogen bonds and more hydrophobic contacts than TTFA2, which interacts mainly through two water molecules. Biochemical studies have indicated that there are at least two ubiquinone binding sites in eukaryotic mitochondrial SQR. One site (Qp) is on the matrix side, and the second (Qd) is near the intermembrane-space side (Hagerhall, 1997Hagerhall C. Succinate: quinone oxidoreductases. Variations on a conserved theme.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The Qp and Qd sites were investigated by mutagenesis studies in yeast mitochondrial SQR, and several residues were identified that could function as ubiquinone binding ligands (Oyedotun and Lemire, 1999Oyedotun K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2114341896,"We describe here a pathway for the import of proteins into the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. Substrates of this pathway are proteins with conserved cysteine motifs, which are critical for import. After passage through the TOM channel, these proteins are covalently trapped by Mia40 via disulfide bridges. Mia40 contains cysteine residues, which are oxidized by the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1. Depletion of Erv1 or conditions reducing Mia40 prevent protein import. We propose that Erv1 and Mia40 function as a disulfide relay system that catalyzes the import of proteins into the IMS by an oxidative folding mechanism. The existence of a disulfide exchange system in the IMS is unexpected in view of the free exchange of metabolites between IMS and cytosol via porin channels. We suggest that this process reflects the evolutionary origin of the IMS from the periplasmic space of the prokaryotic ancestors of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2076411120,"Although the importance of the ARF tumor suppressor in p53 regulation is well established, numerous studies indicate that ARF also suppresses cell growth in a p53/Mdm2-independent manner. To understand the mechanism of ARF-mediated tumor suppression, we identified a ubiquitin ligase, ARF-BP1, as a key factor associated with ARF in vivo. ARF-BP1 harbors a signature HECT motif, and its ubiquitin ligase activity is inhibited by ARF. Notably, inactivation of ARF-BP1, but not Mdm2, suppresses the growth of p53 null cells in a manner reminiscent of ARF induction. Surprisingly, in p53 wild-type cells, ARF-BP1 directly binds and ubiquitinates p53, and inactivation of endogenous ARF-BP1 is crucial for ARF-mediated p53 stabilization. Thus, our study modifies the current view of ARF-mediated p53 activation and reveals that ARF-BP1 is a critical mediator of both the p53-independent and p53-dependent tumor suppressor functions of ARF. As such, ARF-BP1 may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in tumors regardless of p53 status."
https://openalex.org/W1976347829,"Cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) is a global second messenger controlling motility and adhesion in bacterial cells. Synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP is catalyzed by diguanylate cyclases (DGC) and c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDE), respectively. Whereas the DGC activity has recently been assigned to the widespread GGDEF domain, the enzymatic activity responsible for c-di-GMP cleavage has been associated with proteins containing an EAL domain. Here we show biochemically that CC3396, a GGDEF-EAL composite protein from Caulobacter crescentus is a soluble PDE. The PDE activity, which rapidly converts c-di-GMP into the linear dinucleotide pGpG, is confined to the C-terminal EAL domain of CC3396, depends on the presence of Mg2+ ions, and is strongly inhibited by Ca2+ ions. Remarkably, the associated GGDEF domain, which contains an altered active site motif (GEDEF), lacks detectable DGC activity. Instead, this domain is able to bind GTP and in response activates the PDE activity in the neighboring EAL domain. PDE activation is specific for GTP (KD 4 μm) and operates by lowering the Km for c-di-GMP of the EAL domain to a physiologically significant level (420 nm). Mutational analysis suggested that the substrate-binding site (A-site) of the GGDEF domain is involved in the GTP-dependent regulatory function, arguing that a catalytically inactive GGDEF domain has retained the ability to bind GTP and in response can activate the neighboring EAL domain. Based on this we propose that the c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity is confined to the EAL domain, that GGDEF domains can either catalyze the formation of c-di-GMP or can serve as regulatory domains, and that c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity is coupled to the cellular GTP level in bacteria.

The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are universally used as second messengers in intracellular signal transduction pathways. They mediate cellular processes such as vision, electrolyte homeostasis, or smooth muscle relaxation by modulating the activity of protein kinases, GTPases, or ion channels (1Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M.

The intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP are tightly controlled by their rate of synthesis (catalyzed by adenylyl or guanylyl cyclases) and hydrolysis (catalyzed by phosphodiesterases).

They act as effectors of signal transduction, function as homeostatic regulators of cyclic nucleotide levels, have been implicated in desensitization and termination of stimulation, and may also play an important role in controlling the diffusion of cyclic nucleotides and in channeling cyclic nucleotide signals (4Houslay M.D. Milligan G.

Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar)). Whereas cAMP signaling is common to both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, cGMP does not seem to be used by bacterial cells. However, there is accumulating evidence that the cyclic dimer of GMP, c-di-GMP, plays a critical role in bacterial signaling (6Jenal U. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7D'Argenio D.A. Miller S.I. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). c-di-GMP is synthesized from two GTP molecules by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs), and hydrolyzed by PDEs via the linear intermediate pGpG to GMP (Fig. 1A). Even though c-di-GMP was discovered almost two decades ago (8Ross P. Weinhouse H. Aloni Y. Michaeli D. Weinberger-Ohana P. Mayer R. Braun S. de Wroom E. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Benziman M. Nature. 1987; 325: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), its global role in bacterial signaling has become apparent only recently in the view of the growing bacterial genome sequence information available. In recent years, a rapidly increasing number of genetic studies has linked proteins involved in c-di-GMP synthesis or turnover to the ability of different bacteria to switch between a motile, single-cell state and a multicellular behavior associated with the production of extracellular matrix components and surface adhesion (9Spiers A.J.

Kelly R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have associated the DGC activity with the readout domain of the Caulobacter crescentus PleD response regulator protein (22Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This domain, termed GGDEF (after its signature amino acid motif Gly-Gly-Asp-Glu-Phe), is widespread in bacteria but is not found outside the bacterial kingdom (23Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that GGDEF domains are often associated with domains involved in signal perception or signal transduction, argued for the existence of a dedicated regulatory network that converts a variety of different signals into the production of the second messenger c-di-GMP (6Jenal U. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the PleD response regulator in complex with c-di-GMP has not only revealed that the overall fold of the GGDEF domain is virtually identical to the adenylate cyclase, but has also proposed a catalytic mechanism for the condensation of two GTP molecules into c-di-GMP (24Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In contrast to the molecular nature of the DGC, the c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity has remained somewhat of a mystery. Initial genetic and biochemical studies have linked PDE activity to proteins that contain both GGDEF and EAL domains (18Simm R. Morr M. Kader A. Nimtz M. Romling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 19Tischler A.D. Camilli A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 25Tal R. Wong H.C.

Like GGDEF, the EAL (after its signature amino acid motif Glu-Ala-Leu) domain is found only in bacteria and its distribution more or less mirrors that of the GGDEF domains (23Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Galperin M.Y. Natale D.A. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 303-305PubMed Google Scholar). Together, this has led to the proposal that the c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity might reside in the EAL domain (23Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PleD response regulator is required for pole development during the C. crescentus cell cycle (11Aldridge P. Paul R. Goymer P. Rainey P. Jenal U. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1695-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). During Caulobacter cell differentiation PleD specifically sequesters to one pole of the cell, where the morphological changes take place (22Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Polar sequestration of PleD is coupled to the activation of the C-terminal GGDEF output domain via phosphorylation of the N-terminal receiver domain (22Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This observation was lending support for the idea that synthesis of c-di-GMP by PleD might be limited to one cell pole may be to locally activate downstream targets or to restrict c-di-GMP production to one compartment during Caulobacter asymmetric cell division (22Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). One would imagine that in both cases, a potent cellular PDE activity is required to rapidly counteract the DGC activity over time and to maintain spatial gradients established by PleD. To monitor and characterize the c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity in C. crescentus, we first developed an assay based on the hydrolysis of 33P-radiolabeled c-di-GMP. We then showed that the soluble fraction of C. crescentus cell extracts indeed contains a strong PDE activity. To characterize this activity more closely, we concentrated on EAL proteins encoded in the C. crescentus chromosome. A mutant lacking gene CC3396, which codes for a GGDEF-EAL composite protein, showed a more than 80% reduction of the soluble PDE activity (Table I). Enzymatic assays and UV cross-link experiments with purified full-length protein and single domain fragments confirmed that the PDE activity is contained within the EAL domain of CC3396. Remarkably, EAL-based PDE activity of CC3396 is allosterically controlled by GTP. Consistent with this, the GGDEF domain of CC3396, which contains an unorthodox active site motif (GEDEF), lacks DGC activity, but has retained the ability to bind GTP at the active site. Based on this and on the finding that the GGDEF domain is strictly required for the GTP-specific activation of the EAL phosphodiesterase, we postulate that in CC3396 and possibly in other GGDEF-EAL protein homologues, the GGDEF domain acts as an allosteric regulatory domain for the EAL-borne PDE activity (Fig. 1B).Table IComparison of specific PDE activities in C. crescentus crude extracts and purified CC3396PDE activityStrain/proteinc-di-GMP-specificpGpG-specificDGC activityaDiguanylate cyclase activity of purified CC3396-His6 was determined as indicated in Ref. 22.C. crescentus CB15bc-di-GMP and pGpG-specific activity of 100,000 × g supernatant as measured by TLC.0.12 ± 0.02 μmol/(mg min)0.054 ± 0.004 μmol/(mg min)NDcND, not determined.UJ2812 (ΔCC3396)bc-di-GMP and pGpG-specific activity of 100,000 × g supernatant as measured by TLC.0.02 ± 0.01 μmol/(mg min)NDNDCC3396-His6dc-di-GMP and pGpG-specific activity of purified CC3396-His6 as measured by thin layer chromatography.2.42 ± 0.28 μmol/(μmol min)0.12 ± 0.06 μmol/(μmol min)10 ± 5pmol/(μmol min)a Diguanylate cyclase activity of purified CC3396-His6 was determined as indicated in Ref. 22Paul R.

The exact procedure of strain and plasmid construction is available on request. Purification of CC3396 and Preparation of C. crescentus Cell Extracts—E. coli BL21 cells carrying the respective expression plasmid were grown in LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 0.4 to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After harvesting by centrifugation, cells were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, lysed by passage through a French pressure cell, and the suspension was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g. Soluble and insoluble protein fractions were separated by a high-spin centrifugation step (100,000 × g, 1 h). The supernatant was loaded onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen), washed with buffer, and eluted with an imidazol gradient. Protein preparations were examined for purity by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing pure protein were pooled and dialyzed for 12 h at 4 °C. C. crescentus CB15 cells were grown in peptone yeast extract and harvested by centrifugation at an A660 of 0.4. Cells were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm EDTA. Soluble and insoluble protein fractions were separated by a high-spin centrifugation step (100,000 × g, 1 h).

After 5 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. The protein was precipitated by heating for 5 min at 95 °C followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded on a batch RP-18 column, salt was removed by washing 5 times with 200 μl of 25 mm triethylenammonium carbonate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% (v/v) MeOH. c-di-GMP was eluted with 2 × 200 μl of triethylenammonium carbonate containing 5% (v/v) MeOH. The buffer was subsequently removed in the SpeedVac and the purity of the compound was tested by separation on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (1:1.5 (v/v) saturated NH4SO4 and 1.5 m KH2PO4, pH 3.6). Phosphodiesterase Assay—c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity was measured by monitoring the decrease of [33P]c-di-GMP and the increase of [33P]pGpG by thin-layer chromatography. The PDE reaction buffer for the 100,000 × g supernatant of C. crescentus cell extracts or purified preparations of hexahistidine-tagged protein contained 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The GTP/protein mixtures were preincubated for 2 min prior to the addition of c-di-GMP. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C, aliquots were removed at different time points, and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Diguanylate Cyclase Assay—The reaction mixtures with purified hexahistidine-tagged protein contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and were started by the addition of 100 μm [33P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences; 3000 Ci/mmol). At regular time intervals the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0. Polyethyleneimine-cellulose Chromatography—Samples were dissolved in 5 μl of running buffer containing 1:1.5 (v/v) saturated NH4SO4 and 1.5 m KH2PO4, pH 3.60, and blotted on Polygram® CEL 300 polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates (Macherey-Nagel). Plates were developed in 1:1.5 (v/v) saturated NH4SO4 and 1.5 m KH2PO4, pH 3.60 (Rf(c-di-GMP) 0.2, Rf(pGpG) 0.4), dried, and exposed on a Storage PhosphorScreen (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the various radioactive species was calculated by quantifying the intensities of the relevant spots using ImageJ software, version 1.33. Limited Tryptic Proteolysis—To 90 μl of purified hexahistidine-tagged protein samples (0.5–11 mg/ml) dissolved in PDE Reaction Buffer (see above), 10 μl of trypsin solution (2 μg/ml trypsin in 1 mm HCl and 250 mm NaCl) was added. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, 2 μl of freshly prepared phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (AppliChem) solution (0.1% in ethanol) was added, and the reaction was filtered though a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Whatman) before the digest products were separated by gel filtration. Gel filtration experiments were performed on a SMART System using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 80 μl/min. The buffer contained 250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions of 80 μl were collected for the phosphodiesterase activity assay and for UV cross-linking experiments. UV Cross-linking with [33P]GTP and [33P]c-di-GMP—Protein samples were incubated for 10 min on ice in PDE reaction buffer containing 10 μm c-di-GMP, 100 μm GTP, and [33P]c-di-GMP (0.75 μCi, 6000 Ci/mmol) or [33P]GTP (0.75 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol). Samples were irradiated at 254 nm for 20 min on an ice-cooled, parafilm-wrapped 96-well aluminum block in an RPR-100 photochemical reactor with a RPR-3500 UV lamp (The Southern New England Ultraviolet Co.). After irradiation, samples were mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 2.4 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.06% bromphenol blue, 40 mm EDTA) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and quantified by autoradiography. HPLC Analysis and ESI-MS Mass Spectrometry—Reaction products were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 analytical reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography system with a diode array detector at 254 nm. Macherey-Nagel CC125/3 LiChrospher 100 RP-18, 5-μm particle size, was used at 30 °C with 25 mm triethylammonium carbonate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5% (v/v) methanol as mobile phase and a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. ESI-MS mass spectra were measured on an Esquire 3000plus (Bruker Daltonics) and on a TSQ7000 (Finnigan) mass spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization spectra were measured on a Reflex III spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). PDE Activity in the Soluble Fraction of C. crescentus Cell Extracts—To analyze the C. crescentus protein fractions for c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity, we developed an enzymatic assay, which is based on the hydrolysis of radiolabeled c-di-GMP and separation of the products on thin layer chromatography plates (see “Materials and Methods”). The constitutive active PleD mutant form, PleD*-H6 (22Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), was purified to homogeneity and used to enzymatically convert [33P]GTP to [33P]-c-di-GMP. When purified [33P]c-di-GMP was added to aliquots of the dialyzed 100,000 × g supernatant of cell extracts of C. crescentus wild-type strain CB15, the dicyclic nucleotide was rapidly hydrolyzed (Table I), arguing for the presence of a potent PDE activity in the soluble fraction of these cells. A total of five genes encoding soluble EAL proteins were found on the C. crescentus chromosome. To identify a candidate PDE protein and to verify that it contributes to the enzymatic activity found in cell extracts, we selected CC3396 for further analysis. This decision was mainly based on the relatively small size and simple domain architecture of CC3396 (Fig. 1B). An in-frame deletion mutation of gene CC3396 was generated, and extracts of the resulting mutant strain UJ2812 were assayed for PDE activity in vitro. As shown in Table I, PDE activity of strain UJ2812 was reduced by about 80% as compared with wild-type, arguing that under the conditions tested, CC3396 is responsible for a major fraction of the PDE activity of the cell. Purified CC3396 Is a c-di-GMP-specific PDE, Which Converts c-di-GMP into the Linear Form pGpG—The above experiments suggested that CC3396 is a prime candidate for a soluble PDE in C. crescentus. A hexahistidine-tagged version of the CC3396 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity on a nickel affinity column. When used in the PDE assay described above, purified fractions of the CC3396 protein could readily hydrolyze radiolabeled c-di-GMP (Table I). Separation of the reaction mixture on TLC plates revealed that the labeled c-di-GMP was rapidly converted into a new nucleotide species (Fig. 2B). HPLC analysis (Fig. 2A) and mass spectrometry identified this compound as the linearized diguanylate derivative pGpG (Fig. 2C, m/z–689.0, for c-di-GMP and m/z– 707.0 for pGpG). Although the conversion of c-di-GMP into pGpG was relatively rapid (turnover rate: 2.42 ± 0.28 min–1), GMP appeared as a secondary product of the reaction at an about 10-fold slower rate (Table I). Thus, CC3396 specifically and rapidly cleaves c-di-GMP into its linear form, whereas the formation of GMP might be a nonspecific byproduct of the enzymatic reaction. The PDE activity of CC3396 is highly specific for the cyclic dimer of GMP and showed no significant affinity for monocyclic nucleotides cGMP and cAMP (data not shown). Also, whereas Mg2+ ions were critical for PDE activity, Ca2+ showed a strong inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis of c-di-GMP (Table II). Under no conditions were we able to detect DGC activity of the purified protein, arguing that the GGDEF domain of CC3396 is not a DGC (Table I).Table IIActivation of c-di-GMP-specific PDE by GTPNucleotidePDE activityμmol c-di-GMP/μmol minAMP1.93 ± 0.08ATP2.09 ± 0.22cAMP1.17 ± 0.46cGMP2.13 ± 0.32dibu-cGMPa200 μm.1.79 ± 0.18GMP1.87 ± 0.20GDP1.92 ± 0.40GTP106.8 ± 1.5GTP + GDP113.2 ± 1.9GTP + GMP97.2 ± 1.5GTP, no Mg0.23 ± 0.10GTP + Ca1.61 ± 0.37a 200 μm. Open table in a new tab Stimulation of the c-di-GMP-specific PDE Activity of CC3396 by GTP—The activity of monocyclic PDEs is controlled by binding small effector molecules (including cAMP or cGMP) to N-terminal regulatory domains (5Conti M. Jin S.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that CC3396 could also be allosterically regulated, we measured the c-di-GMP-specific PDE activity of CC3396 in the presence or absence of different nucleotides (Table II). cAMP, cGMP, and dibuturyl-cGMP did not affect PDE activity of CC3396. Similarly, AMP, ATP, GMP, and GDP showed no effect. However, when the reaction mixture was supplemented with GTP (100 μm) the initial rate of the reaction increased by about 40-fold to 106.8 ± 1.5 μmol of c-di-GMP formed per μmol of protein and minute (Table II, Fig. 2B). The same positive effect was observed for an equimolar mixture of either GTP and GDP or GTP and GMP, arguing that both GDP and GMP do not counteract the positive effect of GTP. Interestingly, the GTP-activated form of CC3396 quantitatively converted c-di-GMP into the linear form pGpG, but failed to produce substantial amounts of GMP (Fig. 2, A and B, Table I). Together this suggested that the enzymatic activity of CC3396 responsible for the cleavage of c-di-GMP into pGpG is positively controlled by GTP, whereas the consecutive hydrolysis step, which generates GMP is probably a nonspecific side reaction and not subject to allosteric control by GTP. It is important to note that we found no indication for GTP hydrolysis during the enzymatic reaction in the presence of the inducer (Fig. 2A). When logarithmically growing cells were analyzed by nucleotide extraction and HPLC, the internal concentration of c-di-GMP was determined to be 1.1 μm (± 0.11 μm) (data not shown). This is well below the Km for c-di-GMP, which was determined for the basal level PDE activity of CC3396 (>100 μm). To test if GTP activation substantially lowers the Km for c-di-GMP to a physiologically relevant level, PDE activity was determined at different substrate concentrations. The Km for c-di-GMP in the presence of 4 μm GTP (at half-maximal PDE activity, see below) was determined to be 420 nm, close to the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP measured in growing cells. The intracellular concentration of GTP in bacterial cells growing exponentially in rich medium is in the submillimolar range (29Lopez J.M. Marks C.L. Freese E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 587: 238-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but can drop by 70–80% upon entry into stationary phase (29Lopez J.M. Marks C.L. Freese E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 587: 238-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To find out if the concentration of GTP required for activation of CC3396 is physiologically relevant, the KD for GTP was determined at saturating substrate concentrations. Half-maximal induction of CC3396 was found to occur at a GTP concentration of 4 μm, well below the GTP concentrations normally found in bacterial cells (Fig. 2D). The Vmax of the GTP-activated protein was 115 ± 4 μmol/(μmol min) (Fig. 2D). This argues that under physiological conditions promoting cell growth and division, the PDE activity of CC3396 is likely to be fully induced.

Highly mobile L7/12 C-terminal domains promote recruitment of translation factors to the ribosome and stimulate GTP hydrolysis by the ribosome bound factors through stabilization of their active GTPase conformation. Protein synthesis on the ribosome is promoted by a number of translation factors. Several of them, such as initiation factor 2 (IF2), elongation factors Tu (EF-Tu) and G (EF-G), and release factor 3 (RF3), are GTPases (Bourne et al., 1991Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. The GTPase superfamily: conserved structure and molecular mechanism.Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar). Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) studies have revealed that the G domains of these factors interact with a region delineated by the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and a neighboring lateral protrusion, the L7/12 stalk (referred to as the stalk hereafter) (Agrawal et al., 1998Agrawal R.K.

The stalk region encompasses ribosomal protein L11, the region of 23S rRNA that binds proteins L11 and L10 (nucleotides 1030–1124 in E. coli), and a complex formed by L10 and multiple copies of L7/12. (L7 is equivalent to L12 except for an acetylated N terminus. We refer to the proteins from hereon collectively as L12.) L12 is composed of an N-terminal dimerization module and a globular C-terminal domain (CTD) connected by a flexible hinge region (Liljas and Gudkov, 1987Liljas A. Gudkov A.T. The structure and dynamics of ribosomal protein L12.Biochimie. 1987; 69: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On Escherichia coli (eco) ribosomes, four copies of L12 are bound as two dimers via their N-terminal domains (NTD) to L10, while L10 is attached to the rRNA. Extraction/complementation experiments have demonstrated the requirement of L12 for binding of EF-Tu, EF-G, IF2, and RF3 to the ribosome and for ribosome-stimulated factor-dependent GTP hydrolysis (Wahl and Moller, 2002Wahl M.C. Moller W. Structure and function of the acidic ribosomal stalk proteins.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that EF-G has increased GTPase activity in the presence of isolated L12 (Savelsbergh et al., 2000Savelsbergh A. Mohr D. Wilden B. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Stimulation of the GTPase activity of translation elongation factor G by ribosomal protein L7/12.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 890-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and that specific mutations in the L12 CTD affect the binding of the EF-Tu-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex to the ribosome (Kothe et al., 2004Kothe U. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Rodnina M.V. Interaction of helix D of elongation factor Tu with helices 4 and 5 of protein L7/12 on the ribosome.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Based on these data and a comparison of the L12 CTD structure to that of EF-Ts, a model of direct, transient binding of the L12 CTD to the EF-Tu G domain has been proposed (Kothe et al., 2004Kothe U. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Rodnina M.V. Interaction of helix D of elongation factor Tu with helices 4 and 5 of protein L7/12 on the ribosome.J. Mol.

Evol. 2001; 52: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Orthologs of L10 and L12 have been identified in all biological kingdoms. L10 is usually designated L10E in archaea and P0 in eukaryotes. The eukaryotic L12 orthologs belong to two families, P1 and P2, which in some organisms form further subfamilies. Although the proteins diverged in sequence during evolution (Figure 1A ), it is believed that they preserved the overall one (L10 orthologs) to four (L12 orthologs) stoichiometry and their roles in factor-related functions (Gonzalo and Reboud, 2003Gonzalo P.

L10 and L12 are disordered or absent from recent crystal structures of 50S ribosomal subunits (Ban et al., 2000Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A.

On the other hand, cryo-EM reconstructions disclose density features in the stalk region (e.g., Agrawal et al., 1998Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) that cannot be accounted for by the elements seen in the 50S subunit crystal structures and cannot be reliably interpreted without an atomic structure of the L10-L12 complex. Here we describe crystal structures of a complex between L10 and the NTD of L12 from Thermotoga maritima (tma) and refine the structure of the NTD of L10E from Haloarcula marismortui (hma) on the 50S ribosomal subunit. In conjunction with structural features of the stalk seen in cryo-EM reconstructions and with functional studies, we propose a structural model of the stalk that explains its roles in translation. Since the flexible hinge region in L12 may hamper the production of high-quality crystals, we coexpressed full-length tmaL10 and the NTD of tmaL12 (residues M1–G30; L12NTD). The proteins were copurified, and structures at 1.9, 2.1, and 2.3 Å resolution from three different crystal forms were obtained using the multiple anomalous diffraction (MAD) strategy (see Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In all three crystal structures, one molecule of L10 was complexed with six copies of L12NTD, the latter in the form of three dimers. L10 comprises an α/β domain at the N terminus (Figure 1, Figure 2). A long C-terminal helix (α8, K137–K174) protruding from this domain is kinked twice, at residues P151 and G161, dividing it into three ten-residue segments (Figure 1A). Each segment associates with one L12NTD dimer through a five-helix bundle (Figure 2, Figure 3). Thus, the L10-L12 interaction region is characterized by repetition of three almost identical helix α8-L12NTD dimer elements.Figure 3Details of the L10-L12 InteractionShow full caption(A) Top: heterotetrameric arrangement in the crystal structure of isolated tmaL12 (Wahl et al., 2000Wahl M.C.

Residues R147 and K149 of L10 engage in salt bridges with the carboxyl groups of E26 residues from the two L12 molecules (A and B) at the rim of the binding pocket. Within each dimer, the two L12NTD molecules are entangled in an antiparallel fashion by extensive hydrophobic contacts. An identical arrangement of L12 molecules has previously been observed in the crystal structure of isolated tmaL12 (Wahl et al., 2000Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Flexibility, conformational diversity and two dimerization modes in complexes of ribosomal protein L12.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and subsequently in ecoL12 in solution (Bocharov et al., 2004Bocharov E.V.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17697-17706Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A and Figure S2). In the tmaL12 crystal structure (Wahl et al., 2000Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Flexibility, conformational diversity and two dimerization modes in complexes of ribosomal protein L12.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) the hinge region of one L12 molecule folds back as an α helix onto the two entangled NTDs. In the L10-(L12NTD)6 complex, this hinge helix is replaced by the ten-residue segments of L10 helix α8 (Figure 3A). The interfaces of the L12NTD dimers with L10 bury about 1500 Å2 of combined surface area each. About 80% of the interface residues are hydrophobic (Figure 3B). Shape complementarity and electrostatic interactions at the periphery, such as salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and bridging water molecules, register the L12NTD dimers on L10 helix α8 (Figure 3C). Loops of adjacent L12NTD dimers face each other and engage in four backbone-to-backbone hydrogen bonds via residues E11, L13, V15, and S16. Turns of L10 helix α8, which fall at the border of two adjacent L12NTD dimers, are pried apart by interdimer contacts, leading to the two kinks of helix α8. The interdimer interactions support a rigid arrangement of the three L12NTD dimers on helix α8 independent of the crystal environment. In the three crystal structures, helix α8-(L12NTD)6 is positioned differently relative to the L10 NTD (Figure 2B), which can be described as rotations around a pivot point at the beginning of an unstructured loop connecting the L10 NTD and helix α8 (Figure 2C). The structures seem to be stabilized by the formation of different sets of salt bridges between helix α8 and the L10 NTD and between the L12NTD dimers and the L10 NTD (Figure 2D). These salt bridges surround hydrophobic interactions, by which a convex surface area on the first helix α8-L12NTD dimer element is inserted into a concave surface area of the L10 NTD (Figure 2E). These results indicate that the C-terminal helix of L10 bearing L12 is flexibly connected to the L10 NTD. The 6:1 (L12:L10) stoichiometry was unexpected because a 4:1 ratio has been found in E. coli (Subramanian, 1975Subramanian A.R. Copies of proteins L7 and L12 and heterogeneity of the large subunit of Escherichia coli ribosome.J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 95: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, sequence comparisons show that helix α8 in ecoL10 is missing one of the ten-residue L12 binding sections compared to T. maritima (Figure 1A), consistent with the notion that it can only accommodate two L12 dimers. In contrast, other bacteria exhibit a length and partitioning in L10 helix α8 similar to that in T. maritima and are expected to maintain a L10-(L12)6 complex (Figure 1A). In order to confirm the L12 copy number in T. maritima, we produced a recombinant full-length tmaL10-L12 complex. Multiangle laser light scattering indicated a molecular mass of 101 ± 2 kDa for this complex, in excellent agreement with the predicted mass of 102.6 kDa for a L10-(L12)6 complex (Table S2). A recombinant full-length ecoL10-L12 complex showed a mass of 68 ± 2 kDa, as compared to 66.8 kDa predicted for a L10-(L12)4 composition. We also quantified the amounts of L12 on the ribosomes from T. maritima and E. coli by immunoblots. As expected, E. coli ribosomes contained four copies of L12. In contrast, T. maritima ribosomes contained six copies of the protein (Table S2; Figure S3). Thus, the length and sequence of L10 helix α8 determines the number of L12 copies per ribosome. Except for the deletion of one of the three repetitive elements in helix α8-L12NTD, the high degree of overall sequence conservation (Figure 1A) suggests that the L10-L12 complex of E. coli ribosomes closely resembles the L10-L12 complex of T. maritima. An important question is how the L10-L12 complex is situated on the 50S ribosomal subunit. Using a density modification procedure and published structure factors for the 50S subunit from H. marismortui (PDB ID code 1S72 ), we were able to trace the complete NTD of hmaL10E on the 50S subunit (Supplemental Experimental Procedures; Figure S4). The hmaL10E NTD model encompasses two helices (α1 and α3), which could be built previously (chain G in PDB entry 1S72 ). Despite the lack of significant overall sequence identity (Figure 1A), the fold of the hmaL10E NTD is very similar to the NTD of tmaL10 (Cα rmsd 2.0 Å; Figure 1B and Figure S5). hmaL10E employs a shallow, concave surface rimmed by helices α1 and α2 to interact with the L10/L11 binding region in domain II of 23S rRNA (Figure 4A ), which comprises helices H42, H43, and H44 (nucleotides 1142–1221 in hma, 1038–1117 in eco; Figure 4B), consistent with the previous assignment of region 1028–1124 (eco) as the rRNA binding site of L10 (Beauclerk et al., 1984Beauclerk A.A. Cundliffe E. Dijk J. The binding site for ribosomal protein complex L8 within 23S ribosomal RNA of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6559-6563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides U1149–G1151 (hma numbering; for eco numbering, see Figure 4B) of H42 (rRNA region 1 in Figure 4A) are sandwiched between the N-terminal part of helix α3 (R63–T65; R69) and the N terminus/helix α1 region (T9, I12, P13, K16; Figure 4C), in excellent agreement with the protection pattern of L10 on isolated 23S rRNA (Rosendahl and Douthwaite, 1993Rosendahl G. Douthwaite S. Ribosomal proteins L11 and L10.(L12)4 and the antibiotic thiostrepton interact with overlapping regions of the 23 S rRNA backbone in the ribosomal GTPase centre.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The β2-α3 loop (R63, N64) engages in contacts with the upper stem of H42 (nucleotides G1210 and G1211; Figure 4C; region 4 in Figure 4A). The C terminus of β2 (R60, V61) binds to the loop connecting H43 and H44 (nucleotide A1188; Figure 4D; region 3 in Figure 4A). The β1-α2 loop (S43) interacts with the short H42-H43 connector (nucleotides G1160 and A1161; Figure 4D; region 2 in Figure 4A). Thus, hmaL10E interacts with a number of discontinuous regions of the rRNA, contacting predominantly the sugar-phosphate backbone (Figures 4C and 4D). The protein therefore seems to recognize the overall fold of the L10/L11 binding region of the 23S rRNA. By superpositioning the tmaL10 NTD onto the hmaL10E NTD (Figure S5), the tmaL10-(L12NTD)6 complex can be placed on the 50S subunit. Because the structures of the L10/L11 binding region of 23S rRNAs from Haloarcula and Thermotoga are highly conserved (Figure S5) and the protection pattern of bacterial L10 matches the contact sites seen for archaeal L10E, bacterial L10 and archaeal L10E are likely to bind in a similar fashion to rRNA, although the β2-α3 region is the only interaction site in the proteins whose sequence is conserved across the kingdoms (Figure 1A). On the hma50S subunit, the L11 CTD is bound to the rRNA in the direct vicinity of the L10E NTD (Figure 4A). The loop between the two C-terminal L11 helices contacts the region between helix α2 and strand β2 of L10E. There are only a few hydrophobic interactions and two hydrogen bonds connecting the proteins (Y119L11-R50L10E and P114L11-R51L10E; Figure 4E). The L11 CTD structure is also highly conserved between bacteria and archaea (Figures S4 and S5), suggesting similar L10-L11 interactions. To visualize the stalk in complete 70S ribosomes, we attempted to localize an L10-L12NTD complex in cryo-EM reconstructions of E. coli ribosomes. For fitting into the EM maps, we used the crystal structure of the 70S ribosome from E. coli (Vila-Sanjurjo et al., 2003Vila-Sanjurjo A. Ridgeway W.K. Seymaner V. Zhang W. Santoso S. Yu K. Cate J.H. X-ray crystal structures of the WT and a hyper-accurate ribosome from Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 8682-8687Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and a model of an E. coli-like L10-(L12NTD)4 complex that was generated by shortening helix α8 of tmaL10 and omitting the peripheral L12NTD dimer. The 70S crystal structure was docked into the cryo-EM densities and the L10-(L12NTD)4 model was aligned with the crystal structure according to the orientation of the hmaL10E NTD on the hma50S subunit. Cryo-EM reconstructions of ribosomes at various stages of translation showed a well-defined density neighboring the L10/L11 binding region of the 23S rRNA and L11, which is consistent with the crystal structure of the tmaL10 NTD (Figure 5 and Figures S6 and S7A–S7E). In the ribosome-EF-G-GDP complex stalled by fusidic acid (determined herein and in Agrawal et al., 1998Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Visualization of elongation factor G on the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome: the mechanism of translocation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) an elongated protuberance is seen that extends from the L10 NTD (Figure 5 and Figure S6). The L10 helix α8-(L12NTD)4 portion can be fitted to this protuberance by a rigid-body movement of helix α8-(L12NTD)4 around the pivot point in the flexible connection to the L10 NTD (Figure 5 and Figure S6) that was seen in the crystal structures (Figure 2C). The virtual axis between the pivot point and the C terminus of helix α8 of L10 in the fitted structure is rotated by ∼25° compared to an equivalent axis in crystal structure II (Table S1). Protrusions of similar shape are visible in cryo-EM reconstructions of ribosome-RF2 complexes (Rawat et al., 2003Rawat U.B. Zavialov A.V. Sengupta J. Valle M. Grassucci R.A. Linde J. Vestergaard B. Ehrenberg M. Frank J. A cryo-electron microscopic study of ribosome-bound termination factor RF2.Nature. 2003; 421: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). They can be interpreted in the same way, but with a different orientation of the helix α8-(L12NTD)4 portion (∼10° or 20° rotations around the pivot point, respectively; Figures S7D and 7E). The differences in the orientation of the helix α8-(L12NTD)4 extension in the complexes with EF-G and RF2 suggest that its position changes during translation. In various other EM structures, little or no density beyond the L10 NTD can be discerned. The density vanishes at the flexible connection between the L10 NTD and the helix α8-(L12NTD)4 part (Figures S7A–S7C), suggesting that here the helix α8-(L12NTD)4 part adopts multiple orientations with respect to the L10 NTD. To address the role of L12 for the function of translation factors on the ribosome, we have used translation components from E. coli. This system is well characterized biochemically and is known to be representative for bacterial systems in general, in keeping with the high degree of conservation of both sequence and structure as well as the exchangeability of ribosomal components and factors (see Supplemental Data). The E. coli L7/12 stalk encompasses two L12 dimers that may be considered the minimal stalk structure functional in bacterial ribosomes. Early experiments suggested that L12 is involved in interactions with translation factors and GTPase stimulation (Wahl and Moller, 2002Wahl M.C. Moller W. Structure and function of the acidic ribosomal stalk proteins.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recent rapid kinetics and mutagenesis studies showed that the interaction with L12 promotes factor binding to the ribosome (Kothe et al., 2004Kothe U. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Rodnina M.V. Interaction of helix D of elongation factor Tu with helices 4 and 5 of protein L7/12 on the ribosome.J. Mol.

GTPase activation of elongation factors Tu and G on the ribosome.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and is involved in the GTPase activation of EF-Tu and EF-G (Mohr et al., 2000Mohr D. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Arginines 29 and 59 of elongation factor G are important for GTP hydrolysis or translocation on the ribosome.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3458-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Savelsbergh et al., 2000Savelsbergh A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 890-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These studies used ribosomes that were either depleted of L12 or contained mutant L12. The contributions of the domains of L12 were so far not differentiated clearly. We therefore examined the function of the L12 CTD by first measuring the rates of factor recruitment and GTP hydrolysis with ribosomes lacking the CTD of L12. Native ecoL12 was replaced on E. coli ribosomes by a CTD deletion mutant of L12 (L12NTD/hinge). Rate constants of the association of the EF-Tu-GTP-Phe-tRNAPhe complex with ribosomes were measured by fluorescence stopped-flow (Kothe et al., 2004Kothe U. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Rodnina M.V. Interaction of helix D of elongation factor Tu with helices 4 and 5 of protein L7/12 on the ribosome.J. Mol.

GTPase activation of elongation factors Tu and G on the ribosome.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Figure 6A ). The rate constant of EF-Tu-GTP-Phe-tRNAPhe binding to the ribosomes lacking the L12 CTD was 7 μM−1s−1, >10 times smaller than that observed with wild-type ribosomes, suggesting a significant contribution of the L12 CTD to factor binding. A number of single amino acid exchanges in the L12 CTD had an effect similar to removal of the whole domain (Figure 6D). Ribosomes lacking L12 CTDs were also strongly impaired in EF-Tu-promoted GTP hydrolysis compared to wild-type ribosomes (Figure 6B). The low rate of GTP hydrolysis, about 0.4 s−1, did not increase with concentration and was not limited by the binding step (expected to be 7–21 s−1 at 1–3 μM concentrations used in Figure 6B). The rate of GTP hydrolysis was about the same as that of ribosome cores depleted of L12 (0.2 s−1; Mohr et al., 2000Mohr D. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Arginines 29 and 59 of elongation factor G are important for GTP hydrolysis or translocation on the ribosome.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3458-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and >1000-fold slower than that of intact ribosomes (>500 s−1; Pape et al., 1998Pape T.

Complete kinetic mechanism of elongation factor Tu-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site of the E. coli ribosome.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7490-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The rate of GTP hydrolysis by EF-G was reduced about 600-fold by removal of the L12 CTDs (to 0.4 s−1; Figure 6C) compared to intact ribosomes (250 s−1; Savelsbergh et al., 2003Savelsbergh A.

Our findings demonstrate that microRNAs act as specific and essential regulators in a wide range of developmental processes. The recent discovery of genomically encoded small RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), has revealed a new mode of posttranscriptional gene regulation. miRNAs, typically 21–23 nt in length, bind to specific sequences in the 3′UTR of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and effect mRNA degradation or inhibition of protein synthesis, depending on the degree of miRNA:mRNA complementarity (Bartel, 2004Bartel D.P.

Predicting and validating miRNA targets.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 115Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic efforts over the past two years have provided a great deal of insight into the underlying mechanisms, such as the synthesis and processing of miRNAs, and the composition and function of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), a ribonucleoprotein complex that incorporates the mature single-stranded miRNA and mediates the cleavage or translational repression of the target mRNA. However, our understanding of the biological function of miRNAs is still very limited, and few mRNA targets have been validated in vivo. In plants, most mRNA targets are readily identifiable due to near-complete sequence complementarity, and miRNAs appear to act mostly by driving degradation of the target mRNA. This has greatly facilitated the functional analysis of miRNAs; in several cases, the loss of miRNA-mediated target degradation has been shown to cause severe yet specific morphological or physiological defects (Chen, 2004Chen X. A microRNA as a translational repressor of APETALA2 in Arabidopsis flower development.Science. 2004; 303: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, Palatnik et al., 2003Palatnik J.F.

In animals, the situation is more complex. Because of the lack of strict sequence complementarity, miRNA targets in the transcriptomes of worms, flies, and humans are more difficult to detect, and miRNA-mediated regulation is likely to be more biased toward translational inhibition than mRNA degradation. Insight into the biological role of miRNAs in animals comes principally from genetics and is limited to few examples, including the control of developmental timing and cell-fate decisions in worm (Chang et al., 2004Chang S.

This paucity of functional data has precluded a comprehensive assessment of the biological relevance of miRNA-mediated gene regulation in animals. Inspection of the experimentally validated miRNA targets and mutational analyses of known target sites suggest that strong complementarity with the 5′ end of the miRNA (positions 2–8) is critical for the recognition of target mRNAs, while pairing at the 3′ end appears to be more variable (Doench and Sharp, 2004Doench J.G.

Predicting and validating miRNA targets.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 115Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, computational methods have been developed to predict miRNA targets in vertebrate and fly transcriptomes (Enright et al., 2003Enright A.J. John B. Gaul U. Tuschl T. Sander C.

Not surprisingly, the predictions are sensitive to the exact pairing rules, but all show large sets of putative targets and presumably contain both neutral and phenocritical targets (Bartel and Chen, 2004Bartel D.P. Chen C.Z. Micromanagers of gene expression: the potentially widespread influence of metazoan microRNAs.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), as well as false positives. Functional information about miRNAs would help to filter the computational predictions for biologically relevant targets. To gain broader insight into the biological role of miRNAs, we carried out a systematic analysis of miRNA function in Drosophila embryonic development, using an assay in which the activity of individual miRNAs is blocked in vivo by injection of antisense 2′O-methyl oligoribonucleotides and subsequent development is monitored for phenotypic abnormalities. The derivatized oligoribonucleotides are stable throughout embryogenesis and produce no unspecific defects over a wide range of concentrations. We show that antisense but not sense or scrambled 2′O-methyl oligoribonucleotides cause phenotypes and that phenotypes resulting from antisense injection are rescued by genomic overexpression of the cognate miRNAs, indicating that the observed effects are sequence specific. Using this approach, we examine all 46 miRNAs that are expressed during the first half of Drosophila embryogenesis, as revealed by Northern analysis. We find that more than half have internally or externally visible phenotypes, affecting a wide range of developmental processes, often very severely. We use the antisense injections in combination with genomic mutants and reporters to identify and validate the proapoptotic factors hid, grim, reaper, and sickle as phenocritical targets of the miR-2 family. Interestingly, we find that each member of the family shows a distinct interaction profile, strongly suggesting that pairing at the 3′ end of miRNAs is biologically significant and utilized in the differential regulation of targets. To test Drosophila miRNAs for function in development, we depleted individual miRNAs by injection of antisense 2′O-methyl oligoribonucleotides (2′OM-ORNs) into early embryos. 2′OM-ORNs are refractory to nucleolytic cleavage by cellular ribonucleases and therefore more stable than their ribonucleic counterparts. Antisense 2′OM-ORNs have been shown to irreversibly inhibit small RNA function in vitro and in intact cells in a sequence-specific fashion, presumably by stoichiometric binding to RISCs containing the cognate miRNA and thus preventing interaction with its mRNA targets (Hutvágner et al., 2004Hutvágner G. Simard M.J. Mello C.C. Zamore P.D. Sequence-specific inhibition of small RNA function.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e98https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020098Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, Meister et al., 2004Meister G. Landthaler M. Dorsett Y. Tuschl T. Sequence-specific inhibition of microRNA- and siRNA-induced RNA silencing.RNA. 2004; 10: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear that this method would translate to the Drosophila embryo, and several potential problems needed to be addressed: (1) Diffusion? Due presumably to the presence of single-stranded (ss) RNA binding proteins, long (>500 nt) ss RNAs fail to diffuse in the early embryo. To test whether this might also affect the distribution of short ss RNA, we injected a fluorescently labeled 23 nt 2′OM-ORN into early embryos and found that the label disperses rapidly throughout the entire embryo (Figures 1A–1C ). (2) Unspecific effects? To test whether ss 2′OM-ORNs unspecifically affect development, we injected 23 nt 2′OM-ORN antisense GFP into early embryos at a wide range of concentrations (5 μM–2 mM), resulting in estimated end concentrations in the embryo of 0.25–100 μM (Figure 1H). No adverse effects on development were observed up to injection concentrations of 400 μM, but at 2 mM the embryos fail to differentiate and die. Interestingly, when ss oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) are injected, embryos fail to differentiate and die already at concentrations of 20 μM (Figure 1H). This indicates that embryos are in fact quite sensitive to short ss ODNs, precluding their use for miRNA depletion in vivo (Boutla et al., 2003Boutla A. Delidakis C. Tabler M. Developmental defects by antisense-mediated inactivation of micro-RNAs 2 and 13 in Drosophila and the identification of putative target genes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4973-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). (3) Incorporation into RISC? Incorporation of injected ss 2′OM-ORNs into RISC could result in neomorphic effects. However, we find that antisense 2′OM-ORNs directed against GFP are unable to abrogate GFP expression in vivo, suggesting that ss 2′OM-ORNs are in fact not incorporated into RISC (Figures 1D–1G). Several observations indicate that the phenotypic defects observed in 2′OM-ORN-injected embryos are sequence specific (for details see below): (1) 54% of the antisense 2′OM-ORNs cause specific phenotypes; 46% do not. (2) Members of the large miRNA families (miR-2/6/11/13/308; miR-310/311/312/313/92), which share the 5′ core sequence and only diverge in their 3′ portions, show similar but distinct phenotypes. (3) Antisense, but not sense or scrambled oligonucleotides, cause phenotypic defects, as shown for miR-6, 9, and 13. (4) Genomic overexpression of the cognate miRNA (partially) rescues the depletion phenotype, as shown for miR-2, 6, and 9. A further measure of the efficacy of the technique is whether antisense-mediated depletion is able to phenocopy the genomic loss of function of the cognate miRNA. The only two Drosophila miRNAs with extant genomic knockouts are bantam and mir-14. In both cases, embryonic development is normal overall (Brennecke et al., 2003Brennecke J. Hipfner D.R. Stark A.

Biol. 2003; 13: 790-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), a result which we reproduce by antisense 2′OM-ORN injection, although we do observe a modest increase in cell death in bantam depleted embryos (Figure 1I). In bantam genomic null larvae, imaginal disc growth is severely impaired (Brennecke et al., 2003Brennecke J. Hipfner D.R. Stark A. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. bantam encodes a developmentally regulated microRNA that controls cell proliferation and regulates the proapoptotic gene hid in Drosophila.Cell. 2003; 113: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). We find that bantam antisense-injected animals have markedly smaller imaginal discs in second instar (Figures 1J and 1K), indicating that miRNA depletion faithfully phenocopies the genomic loss of function and that the derivatized oligonucleotides are remarkably persistent. Finally, we asked which portions of the antisense 2′OM-ORN are required for the depletion effect. For three miRNAs with different severe depletion phenotypes (miR-2, 6, 31), truncated versions of the antisense oligonucleotide were tested. In all cases, deletion of five bases complementary to either end of the miRNA (3′Δ5; 5′Δ5) mildly reduces the phenotype, but deletion of nine bases either partially (3′Δ9) or completely (5′Δ9) abolishes it (Figure 1L, coordinates relative to the miRNA). This suggests that, while annealing of the antisense 2′OM-ORN to the 5′ end of the RISC bound miRNA is essential, the 3′ end is also accessible to the injected oligonucleotides and makes a significant contribution to the phenotype. Overall, our experiments show that antisense 2′OM-ORN injection is an effective and specific technique for inhibiting miRNA function in Drosophila embryos. Since our approach is based on injection into early embryos, we focused on miRNAs with expression during the first half of embryogenesis. There are currently 78 experimentally validated miRNAs in Drosophila (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003Griffiths-Jones S. Bateman A. Marshall M. Khanna A. Eddy S.R. Rfam: an RNA family database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 439-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar); 48 of these are unique, the remaining 30 belong to groups of identical or near-identical multiple copies or to two miRNA families (see Experimental Procedures and see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). For the majority of the miRNAs, the developmental expression profile had previously been established by Northern analysis (Aravin et al., 2003Aravin A.A. Lagos-Quintana M. Yalcin A. Zavolan M. Marks D. Snyder B. Gaasterland T. Meyer J. Tuschl T. The small RNA profile during Drosophila melanogaster development.Dev.

Computational identification of Drosophila microRNA genes.Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the remainder were tested here. Of the 63 distinct miRNAs, 46 are expressed between 0 and 12 hr of embryogenesis with different temporal profiles, including uniform, maternal, early, and late zygotic (Figures S1, Figure 4, Figure 5). Notably, all of the miRNAs that occur in multiple copies or belong to families are expressed during this time interval, compared to only 65% of the single-copy miRNAs. For all 46 miRNAs showing expression in the first half of embryogenesis, 23 nt antisense 2′OM-ORNs were synthesized and purified (Experimental Procedures); for a small subset of these, sense and scrambled sequence oligonucleotides were generated to examine sequence specificity of the effect. We examined injected embryos during their development for defects using DIC to detect gross morphological abnormalities and with a live GFP marker that allowed us to gauge differentiation and morphogenesis of the nervous system (repo-Gal4;UAS-CD8GFP). After embryonic development was complete (24 hr), the cuticles were evaluated for defects in anteroposterior and dorsoventral pattern formation and morphogenesis. Of the 46 tested candidates, 25 showed clear morphological abnormalities, 17 visible with the live GFP marker or DIC, 25 in the cuticle preparations. Interestingly, 87% of the multiple-copy/family miRNAs show depletion phenotypes (13 out of 15), compared to only 39% of the single-copy miRNAs (12 out of 31). In all cases, the phenotypes are highly penetrant (>50%), with several instances of clear pleiotropy. miRNAs of the same family show similar yet distinguishable phenotypes. None of the sense or scrambled 2′OM-ORNs cause phenotypic defects. The results for all tested miRNAs are collected in Table S1. A number of interesting cases with externally visible phenotypes, including the two miRNA families, were selected for further analysis and are described below. Embryos injected with miR-9 antisense 2′OM-ORNs rarely form any cuticle and show virtually no internal differentiation (Figures 2A and 2F ). Examination of early embryogenesis, using phalloidin and DNA staining as well as DIC, reveal severe defects in nuclear division and migration, pole cell formation, cellularization, and in the basal movement of yolk droplets (Figures 2B–2D and 2G–2I). To establish that these defects are in fact due to depletion of miR-9, we tested whether they can be rescued by genomic overexpression of mir-9. Expression of mir-9 with a strong maternal driver (nos-Gal4VP16;UAS-mir-9a) has no effect on its own, but significantly ameliorates the phenotype of miR-9 antisense injection, confirming that a reduction in miR-9 activity is responsible for the defect (Figures 2D, 2E, 2I, and 2J). Most of the processes affected by miR-9 depletion are complex, but all share an involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton (Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2002Lecuit T. Wieschaus E. Junctions as organizing centers in epithelial cells? A fly perspective.Traffic. 2002; 3: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Mazumdar and Mazumdar, 2002Mazumdar A. Mazumdar M.

Therefore, miR-9 may have a single or a small number of phenocritical targets involved in microtubule function, but a more pleiotropic role cannot be excluded. In contrast to miR-9, miR-31 depleted embryos complete development but show severe segmentation defects. Embryos show abnormal cuticle patterns, ranging from partial fusions of denticle belts to a complete loss of alternating segments, suggesting that pattern formation is disrupted at the level of the pair rule genes (Figures 3A and 3E ). Further examination of pair rule gene expression in the blastoderm (Carroll, 1990Carroll S.B.

Since pattern formation is affected throughout the segmented portion of the embryo, the regional gap factors are less likely to be responsible than ubiquitous or widely expressed factors such as components of the JAK/STAT pathway, Dichaete, grainy head, or Grunge (Hou et al., 1996Hou X.S.

Embryos injected with antisense 2′OM-ORNs for the miR-310/311/312/313/92 family show morphogenetic defects in later development. In cuticle preparations, all family members show head-involution defects; in addition, miR-311 and miR-312 show mild dorsal-closure defects, and miR-313 occasional germ band-retraction defects; miR-310 and miR-313 also show occasional segmentation defects (Figures 3I–3O). Germ band retraction, dorsal closure, and head involution are interconnected morphogenetic processes that share the involvement of several cellular structures and pathways, including the cytoskeleton and cell junctions, and JNK and Dpp signaling (Jacinto et al., 2002Jacinto A.

Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Note that despite sequence identity at positions 2–8, the members of the miR-310 family show some differences in their depletion phenotypes, suggesting that the 3′ end of the miRNA contributes to the specificity of the miRNA:mRNA pairing. Embryos injected with miR-2/13 and miR-6 antisense 2′OM-ORNs fail to differentiate normal internal and external structures (Figures 4A, 4D, and 4G ). At the end of embryogenesis, the embryos fall apart on touch, and no cuticle is recovered. To determine the onset of these problems, we examined blastoderm embryos and found that cellularization and early pattern formation along the anteroposterior axis occur normally for both miRNAs, indicating that early fating and morphogenesis are intact (Figures 4B, 4E, and 4H). Interestingly, in miR-6, but not miR-2/13 depleted embryos, pole cell formation at the posterior end is disrupted (Figures 4P and 4Q). One possible cause of the catastrophic defects observed in miR-2/13 and miR-6 depleted embryos is excessive and widespread apoptosis. We find that in both miR-2/13 and miR-6 antisense injected embryos, the number of apoptotic cells is greatly increased compared to wild-type by stage 13 (Figures 4C, 4F, and 4I). Notably, the overall morphology of miR-6 depleted embryos is much more affected than that of miR-2/13 depleted embryos. miR-6 depleted embryos are generally smaller in size and have fewer and abnormally large (para-) segments, suggesting greater excess or earlier onset of apoptosis. To determine the specificity of the effects of miR-6 and miR-2/13 antisense injections, we again carried out genomic rescue experiments. Embryos ubiquitously overexpressing mir-6 or mir-2 (Actin-Gal4;UAS-mir6-3/2b-2) show normal cell-death patterns. When injected with miR-6 or miR-2/13 antisense, they show significant rescue of miR-6 antisense by mir-6, with respect to both cell death and morphology, and of miR-2/13 antisense by mir-2 (see Experimental Procedures). Interestingly, crossrescue of miR-6 antisense by mir-2 overexpression and of miR-2/13 antisense by mir-6 is weak (Figures 5C, 5F, 5G, 5J, and 5K). The miRNA sequence family miR-6 and miR-2/13 belong to has two additional members, miR-11 and miR-308. Depletion of miR-11 results in a moderate and of miR-308 in a mild increase in apoptosis in midembryogenesis (Figures 4J–4O). Thus, for all members of the miR-2 family, antisense-induced depletion results in excess embryonic cell death, but with marked differences in phenotypic strength. This differential could be due to differences in expression level or to sequence divergence and thus differential interaction with target mRNAs (Figure 4R). In Drosophila, three pathways are known to control caspase activity (Hay, 2000Hay B.A. Understanding IAP function and regulation: a view from Drosophila.Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, Salvesen and Abrams, 2004Salvesen G.S.

A comparison of programmed cell death between species.Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (REVIEWS0003)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The main control is thought to come from the proapoptotic factors Hid, Grim, and Reaper (Rpr), which are transcriptionally activated in response to a range of natural and toxic conditions; they promote caspase activation through inhibition of the caspase inhibitor Diap1. The three factors appear to act independently, with each being sufficient to drive apoptosis. When miR-2/13 and miR-6 antisense 2′OM-ORNs are injected into embryos deficient for the hid, grim, and rpr genes (H99 deficiency), they are unable to trigger apoptosis (Figures 5B, 5E, and 5I), indicating that these miRNAs act through hid, grim, and/or rpr. To determine whether the regulation of the three proapoptotic factors occurs at the transcriptional or at the posttrans"

Here we show that human ABCG1 overexpressed in baby hamster kidney cells in the absence of lipoproteins traffics to the plasma membrane and redistributes membrane cholesterol to cell-surface domains accessible to treatment with the enzyme cholesterol oxidase. Cholesterol removed by HDL was largely derived from these domains in ABCG1 transfectants but not in cells lacking ABCG1. Overexpression of ABCG1 also increased cholesterol esterification, which was decreased by the addition of HDL, suggesting that a proportion of the cell-surface cholesterol not removed by HDL is transported to the intracellular esterifying enzyme acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. A 638-amino acid ABCG1, which lacked the 40 N-terminal amino acids of the predicted full-length protein, was fully functional and of a similar size to ABCG1 expressed by cholesterol-loaded human monocyte-derived macrophages. Mutating an essential glycine residue in the Walker A motif abolished ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux and esterification and prevented localization of ABCG1 to the cell surface, indicating that the ATP binding domain in ABCG1 is essential for both lipid transport activity and protein trafficking. These studies show that ABCG1 redistributes cholesterol to cell-surface domains where it becomes accessible for removal by HDL, consistent with a direct role of ABCG1 in cellular cholesterol transport.

One of the most important atheroprotective roles HDL plays is in reverse cholesterol transport, where excess cholesterol that builds up in peripheral cells is transported to the liver for excretion in the bile (8Glomset J.A. Adv. Intern. Med. 1980; 25: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). The main protein component of HDL is apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). ApoA-I promotes efflux of excess cholesterol and phospholipids from cells through its direct interaction with the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter A1 (ABCA1) (9Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R.

A fully functional ABC transporter has two membrane spanning domains and two nucleotide binding domains, and the hydrolysis of ATP in the nucleotide binding domains provides energy for the transport of substrates across membranes. In the artery wall, ABCA1 is thought to play an important role in the removal of lipids from cholesterol-loaded macrophages of the developing coronary plaque (13Vaisman B.L. Lambert G. Amar M.

By using an inducible expression system, we demonstrate that human ABCG1 can be highly expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, where it redistributes cholesterol to cell-surface domains that are accessible for removal by HDL but not by lipid-free apoA-I. ABCG1 traffics to the plasma membrane, probably as a homodimer, and this process requires an active nucleotide binding domain. Furthermore, a 638-amino acid form of ABCG1 that is missing the 40 N-terminal amino acids of the predicted full-length protein has full lipid transport activity and may be the predominant form of ABCG1 expressed in human macrophages. Overexpression of both a putative full-length and a 19-amino acid N-terminal truncated form of a close homolog of ABCG1, ABCG4, also increased cholesterol efflux to HDL. Thus, the N termini of the predicted full-length forms of both ABCG1 and ABCG4 are not essential for lipid transport activity. Cultured Cells—All cell culture incubations were performed at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. BHK cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). BHK cells expressing human ABCG1 were generated using the mifepristone-inducible GeneSwitch system (Invitrogen). An N-terminal FLAG-tagged human ABCG1 cDNA coding for a 638-amino acid protein (GenBank™ accession number NP_004906.1) was a generous gift from David Wade (CV Therapeutics). Cells were transfected initially with the pSwitch plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Clonal lines were isolated and then transfected with pGene/V5-His/lacZ and assayed for β-galactosidase activity with the β-galactosidase assay kit (Invitrogen). Clonal pSwitch lines that gave the highest mifepristone-induced β-galactosidase activity were then transfected with linearized pGene/V5-HisA containing the FLAG-tagged 638-amino acid human ABCG1. An N-terminal FLAG-tagged cDNA clone containing the reported full-length 678 amino acids (based on GenBank™ accession number NP_004906.3) was constructed by ligation of cDNA coding the 40 extra upstream amino acids into the original clone. The cDNA was obtained using the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) and subsequent PCR. Total RNA for the RT-PCR was obtained from THP-1 macrophages treated with acetylated LDL and the LXR agonist 22-hydroxycholesterol (27Kennedy M.A. Venkateswaran A. Tarr P.T. Xenarios I. Kudoh J.

Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar) of ABCG1 (glycine121 to alanine, GenBank™ accession number NP_004906) was carried out using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). A human IMAGE clone (5763981; ATCC, Manassas, VA) coding for ABCG4 was used to amplify the predicted full-length 646-amino acid open reading frame, which was then ligated into pGene/V5 HisA in-frame with the C-terminal V5-His tag. In a similar manner, a 627-amino acid open reading frame, which lacked the first 19 amino acids of the predicted full-length protein, was also constructed. Mock-transfected BHK cells were derived from the same pSwitch clonal line transfected with linearized pGene/V5-HisA. Cells were grown and maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum until experimental treatments. Unless indicated otherwise, ABCG1 and ABCG4 were induced by incubating cells for 18–20 h in DMEM with 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 10 nm mifepristone. HDL and Apolipoprotein A-I—HDL was prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation in the density range 1.125–1.21 g/ml and was depleted of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apoB by heparin-agarose chromatography, and apoA-I was purified from HDL and subsequently delipidated (30Mendez A.J.

Lipid Efflux, Cholesterol Transport, and Cholesterol Esterification—To radiolabel cellular cholesterol to equilibrium, [3H]cholesterol (0.5 μCi/ml, 40–60 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added to the 10% serum medium 1–2 days prior to mifepristone treatment. To measure lipid efflux, cells were incubated with DMEM/bovine serum albumin with or without 10 μg/ml apoA-I or 25 μg/ml HDL for 2–6 h at 37 °C and chilled on ice, and the medium was collected and centrifuged to remove detached cells. For cholesterol efflux, the medium was counted for 3H, and the cells were assayed for free and esterified [3H]cholesterol after isolation by TLC (31Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To measure cell-surface cholesterol redistribution, cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated with 1 unit/ml cholesterol oxidase (Calbiochem) in DMEM at 37 °C for 10 min (32Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1373-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed twice with PBS; cellular lipids were extracted, and [3H]cholesterol and [3H]cholestenone were measured after isolation by TLC. Immunoblotting—Control, ABCG1-, and ABCG4-transfected BHK cells were solubilized in 50 mm Tris buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA, and proteins were resolved by 8% PAGE. Proteins were transblotted onto nitrocellulose, and ABCG1 was identified with an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) or an anti ABCG1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection assay. ABCG4 was identified using an anti-V5 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). Membrane Labeling of ABCG1—For selective labeling of plasma membrane ABCG1, cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with PBS containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin to biotinylate cell-surface proteins (9Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: R25-R31Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 33Oram J.F. Lawn R.M.

Cells were washed and dislodged from the dish at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline. To isolate ABCG1, cell proteins were solubilized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors, and the extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FLAG antiserum (Stratagene, CA) raised against the FLAG peptide. The antibody-antigen complex was isolated by protein G-coated magnetic beads (Dynal) and electrophoresed in SDS using an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Each gel lane received immunoprecipitated protein corresponding to equal amounts of cells. To measure biotinylated ABCG1, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and identified with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase ECL assay (Pierce). Cross-linking of ABCG1—To assay if ABCG1 exists as a homodimer at the plasma membrane, BHK cells expressing ABCG1 were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with PBS containing 1 mg/ml disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a homobifunctional, noncleavable, amine reactive cross-linking agent. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS containing 20 mm glycine (to quench cross-linker) and twice with cold PBS. The existence of ABCG1 homodimers was assayed using SDS-PAGE of solubilized cellular proteins probed with the anti-FLAG antibody. Statistics—Data were analyzed by paired Student's t test to determine significance. Each experiment shown is representative of at least three similar experiments. The apparent Kd value for HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux specifically to ABCG1 was calculated using the one-site saturation model of nonlinear regression. Induction of ABCG1 Alters the Distribution of Cellular Cholesterol—To examine the effects of ABCG1 expression on cellular cholesterol homeostasis, BHK cells were stably transfected with an N-terminal FLAG-tagged human ABCG1 cDNA, which was inducible by treatment with mifepristone. As a control, cells were also transfected with the same vector lacking the ABCG1 cDNA. This inducible system allows for time-dependent expression of high levels of ABCG1 and minimizes the potentially cytotoxic effects of the long term overexpression of ABCG1 in cell membranes. The mifepristone-treated mock-transfected cells had no detectable FLAG tag, but the ABCG1-transfected cells expressed a FLAG-tagged protein of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1A). A commercially available ABCG1 antibody also detected the FLAG-tagged protein but did not detect ABCG1 in mock-transfected cells (results not shown). As has been demonstrated previously (23Nakamura K. Kennedy M.A. Baldan A. Bojanic D.D. Lyons K. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45980-45989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Wang N. Lan D. Chen W. Matsuura F. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9774-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), the increase in ABCG1 expression led to an increase in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells but no significant change in the efflux of cholesterol to lipid free apoA-I (Fig. 1B). Because the population of ABCG1-transfected BHK cells was mixed, a clonal line was isolated that had a higher level of ABCG1 expression. This line also had a significantly higher level of HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux compared with the mixed population (∼280%) and was used for further studies. We tested the possibility that ABCG1 expression alone could alter cellular cholesterol homeostasis by radiolabeling cellular cholesterol, treating cells for 18 h with increasing concentrations of mifepristone, and measuring labeled cholesterol distribution between cellular pools. The relative distribution of cell-surface free cholesterol was determined by treating cells for 10 min at 37 °C with the enzyme cholesterol oxidase and assaying for cellular cholestenone. Mock-transfected cells had low levels of oxidizable labeled cholesterol (∼4%) and esterified cholesterol (∼5%), which did not change upon the addition of mifepristone (data not shown). Furthermore, the HDL-mediated efflux of labeled cholesterol from these cells did not change with increasing concentrations of mifepristone. In contrast, mifepristone treatment increased the fraction of oxidase-accessible labeled cholesterol in ABCG1 transfectants from 4% to over 10% and increased the fraction of labeled cholesterol that was esterified from 5 to 20% (Fig. 2). When these cells were subsequently incubated for 4 h with HDL, cholesterol efflux increased from 3 to 15% with increasing mifepristone treatment (Fig. 2). ABCG1 is thus altering the distribution of membrane cholesterol, and this is occurring independent of cellular lipoprotein interactions. We examined the effects of increased HDL levels on radiolabeled cholesterol efflux and cellular cholesterol pool sizes in cells lacking or expressing ABCG1. With both mock- and ABCG1-transfected cells, increasing HDL levels up to 400 μgof protein/ml progressively increased cholesterol efflux, but this was greater for the ABCG1-expressing cells at all concentrations (Fig. 3A). The difference in cholesterol efflux between the two cell types revealed a single saturable component. By using the one-site saturation model of nonlinear regression, the apparent Kd value for the reaction was 31 μg/ml HDL protein with a standard deviation of 5.7 μg/ml and an R2 value of 0.98 (Fig. 3A, inset). This ABCG1-dependent cholesterol efflux was largely derived from a cellular pool that was accessible to cholesterol oxidase (Fig. 3B). ABCG1-independent cholesterol efflux was almost exclusively from the nonoxidizable, unesterified cholesterol pool (Fig. 3B). This suggests that inducing ABCG1 alters the distribution of cholesterol within the plasma membrane, making it more accessible to both cholesterol oxidase and HDL. Inducing ABCG1 increased the fraction of cholesterol that was esterified (Fig. 2), suggesting that ABCG1 also promotes flux of cholesterol into the substrate pool for acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the above experiment, HDL had no effect on this fractional esterification because it was added after these esters were formed. To determine whether HDL affects this flux, we radiolabeled plasma membrane cholesterol for 1 h, chased cells without or with HDL for 4 h, and measured the labeled free and esterified cholesterol content. After the chase without HDL, the labeled free cholesterol content of mock cells was higher than that of ABCG1 transfectants (Fig. 4A). Only a small fraction of the radiolabeled cholesterol became esterified in the mock cells (∼2%) after the short term labeling and chase incubations, but the ABCG1 transfectants had a significantly higher content of labeled cholesteryl esters (∼7%, Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with ABCG1 promoting the flux of cholesterol into the ACAT substrate pool. Addition of HDL reduced both the free and esterified cholesterol content of the cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In mock cells, the reduction in labeled free cholesterol was ∼15%, and for esterified cholesterol the reduction was 19%. The reduction in the ABCG1 transfectant was greater; ∼24% for free cholesterol and ∼30% for esterified cholesterol. These data imply that a substantial amount of the increased cholesteryl esters in ABCG1-expressing cells is derived from the free cholesterol pool that is removable by HDL. Because there is a marked increase in cholesteryl ester content in ABCG1 transfectants, it is possible that this alteration in the cellular cholesterol pool is necessary for ABCG1 function. To determine whether the esterification of cholesterol was necessary for the increased HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in ABCG1 transfectants, the ACAT inhibitor compound 58035 (3-(decyldimethylsilyl)-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1-phenylethyl] propanamide) was used to prevent the esterification of cholesterol. The cholesteryl ester content of both mock and ABCG1 transfectants was significantly reduced with 58035 (Fig. 4C), but this did not affect HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux, implying that the esterification of cholesterol was not necessary for ABCG1 cholesterol efflux activity. ABCG1 Is Expressed at the Cell Membrane and Requires an Active Nucleotide Binding Domain—Results showing that induction of ABCG1 increases oxidizable cholesterol at the cell surface support the possibility that this transporter is localized to the plasma membrane. To test this, we biotinylated cell-surface proteins, isolated ABCG1 by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, and identified biotinylated ABCG1 with a streptavidin assay. ABCG1- but not mock-transfected cells expressed a FLAG-tagged protein at the cell surface of the size expected for ABCG1 (Fig. 5A). These data indicate that ABCG1 traffics to the plasma membrane where it may form oxidizable, HDL-accessible cholesterol pools. We used a cross-linking reagent, DSS, to determine whether FLAG-tagged ABCG1 expressed at the plasma membrane is dimerized. Results showed that cross-linking formed an anti-FLAG antibody immunoreactive protein of approximately twice the size of monomeric FLAG-tagged ABCG1 (Fig. 5B). Because DSS does not enter the cell and has a linker of only 11 Å, it is likely that the immunoreactive protein is an ABCG1 homodimer expressed at the cell surface. We also observed, however, a cross-linked immunoreactive band with a molecular mass consistent with a trimer (∼180 kDa). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that ABCG1 is forming a complex with proteins other than itself. Because covalent cross-linking has a relatively low efficiency, these studies do not provide an estimate of the relative fraction of ABCG1 that exists as multimers. To determine whether the presence of a functional NBD is necessary for ABCG1 activity, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to substitute alanine for an essential glycine residue within the Walker A motif (29Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4248) Google Scholar). The mutated protein was expressed at similar levels when compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 5C). Both wild type and mutant ABCG1 appeared as a single band on reduced and nonreduced SDS-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that disulfide bridging does not promote the dimerization of ABCG1 required for activity. The G121A mutation almost completely abolished the ability of ABCG1 to redistribute cholesterol to oxidase- and ACAT-accessible pools and to promote cholesterol efflux to HDL (Fig. 5D). Cell-surface biotinylation studies showed that the NBD mutant did not appear on the cell surface (Fig. 5E). This might be due to the incorrect folding of the mutant protein or the failure of the protein to dimerize, which could be essential for protein trafficking. However, it would appear that a functional NBD in ABCG1 is necessary for both lipid transport activities and protein trafficking to the plasma membrane.

Sliwkowski M. Nat. Rev. MCB. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref Scopus (5538) Google Scholar). Furthermore, truncations of the extracellular domain also lead to partial activation of the EGFR kinase in the absence of ligands (24Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P.

We have used fluorescence microscopy to determine the submicron and nanometer scale association of the EGFR in intact BaF/3 cells. This EGFR/BaF/3 cell system has been used as a model system to examine the biology of the recombinant EGFR in the absence of other EGFR family members and autocrine ligands (26Walker F. Hibbs M.L. Zhang H.H. Gonez L.J. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We produced stable BaF/3 cell lines expressing the EGFR-eGFP chimera at a level of 50,000 receptors/cell and have used image correlation microscopy to determine the average association state of the EGFR-eGFP on the submicron scale (27Petersen N. Brown C. Kaminski A. Rocheleau J. Srivastava M. Wiseman P.W. Faraday Discuss. 1998; 111: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of EGF. To determine the association of the ligand binding sites on the nanometer scale, a biologically active, EGF derivative bearing a unique monovalent fluorophore conjugation site positioned to avoid interference with receptor binding and activation (see “Materials and Methods”) was synthesized by Fmoc chemistry and labeled with suitable donor and acceptor probes. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) depends on the inverse sixth power of separation between interacting donor and acceptor fluorophores on the nanometer scale (28Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4843) Google Scholar) and is therefore sensitive to protein oligomerization. We quantitated ligand FRET using a novel, microscope-based method, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with an LED excitation source (29Hanley Q.S. Clayton A.H.A. J. Microscopy. 2005; 218: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and used a multicomponent analysis (30Clayton A.H.A Hanley Q.S. Verveer P.J. J. Microsc. 2004; 213: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that enabled us to determine FRET in the presence of fluorescence from non-FRET states. In the context of a monomer-dimer-oligomer model, the biophysical data are consistent with a significant fraction of ligated EGFR tetramers. The results support previous observations of preformed EGFR dimers (9Martin-Fernandez M. Clarke D.T. Jobin M.J. Jones G.R. Biophys.

We propose that such an arrangement may facilitate trans-dimer activation and/or phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase (33Murali R. Brennan P.J. Kieber-Emmons T. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-EGFR antibodies (sheep anti-EGFR, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were quantitated by scanning densitometer and wide line integration in ImageQuant.Refolding and Purification of K35EGF—The EGF derivative (K35EGF) is a truncated version of murine EGF (residues 1–48) containing an Asn to pyroglutamic acid substitution to block the N terminus and a single lysine at position 35, which serves as a unique monovalent conjugation site for fluorophores, which is unlikely to interfere with the binding characteristics of the EGF (17Garrett T.P.

The commercial peptide was dissolved in aqueous 10 mm dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and left at 25 °C for 2 h to ensure full reduction. The reduced peptide was then purified by RP-HPLC using a LiChrocart 100 RP-18 column (250 × 4-mm inner diameter) installed in an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC fitted with a diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Australia). The reduced peptide was recovered using a linear 35-min gradient between 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 65% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the column temperature was 25 °C. Detection was at 215 and 280 nm using a reference wavelength of 320 nm. Eluting peptides were recovered manually, allowance being made for the dead volume between the detector and the recovery port. Mass spectrometry analysis of the major peak (retention time 28.5 min, data not shown) gave the anticipated mass of 5,286 Da. The recovered peptide was evaporated to dryness using a Savant SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Electron Corporation). For refolding, the dried peptide was dissolved in 1% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate, and aliquots (50 μg, based on integrated peak area) were left at room temperature for 18 h to refold under aerobic conditions. The refolded material was recovered by micropreparative RP-HPLC using a Brownlee RP-300 (30 × 2.1-mm inner diameter) column using a linear 60-min gradient between 0.15% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 60% aqueous CH3CN containing 0.125% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 100 μl/min. A major peak with a characteristic retention time of 30.1 min was recovered. Rechromatography of this material under identical conditions gave essentially homogeneous material. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated a mass of 5,280 Da, in agreement with the formation of the three disulfide bonds. The overall yield was typically around 15–20%.Preparation and Purification of K35EGF and K35EGF Fluorescent Conjugates—FITC-K35EGF and Alexa 555-K35EGF were prepared from the parent reactive fluorophores (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Alexa Fluor 555 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) and purified by HPLC using methods similar to those described previously (37Domagala T.

The oxidized K35EGF recovered from the micropreparative RP-HPLC columns (∼10 μg) was evaporated to dryness using the Savant SpeedVac concentrator and redissolved in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (25 μl, pH 10.0). FITC (Molecular Probes) was then added (75 μl, 3.3 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) and the mixture left for 1 h at 25 °C in the dark. The sample was then buffer exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline using a Nap 5 column (Amersham Biosciences) and the FITC-K35EGF recovered by micropreparative RP-HPLC as described above for the purification of the K35EGF. A major product eluting at 39.0 min was recovered. Mass spectrometry analysis of this peak indicated that the anticipated mass was 5,671 Da. The yield was ∼70%. Alexa 555-K35EGF was prepared from Alexa Fluor 555 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes) and purified by micropreparative RP-HPLC as described above. The Alexa 555-K35EGF was resolved from the K35EGF and had a characteristic retention time of 31.7 min. The potency of the fluorescently labeled K35EGF conjugates was compared with full-length FITC-EGF in binding to a high affinity truncated form of the soluble ectodomain EGFR501 (40Elleman T.C.

Macrae F.A. St. John D.J. Ma J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 74: 759-765PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were initially grown to confluence, trypsin treated, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with ATG supplement (bovine serum albumin, iron-saturated transferrin, and l-glutamine). The cells were then seeded into 96-well microtiter plates at 5 × 104 cells/well using the Biomek 2000 and incubated for 20 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before the addition of the EGF or EGF analogs. The plates were then incubated for a further 22 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before pulsing with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) and incubation for a further 2 h. 10 mm NaOH (30 μl/well) was then added and the plates left for 30 min at 25 °C before harvesting onto Unifilter 96GF/C plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filter plates were dried, and 20 μl of Microscint 20 (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) scintillation mixture was added per well and the plates counted using a TopCount NXT beta counter (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). The data were fitted to a sigmoidal function using Origin (OriginLab). mEGF, or the K35-EGF, Alexa 555-K35EGF, and FITC-K35EGF analogs were recovered from micropreparative RP-HPLC immediately prior to assay for quantitation and mitogenic assay (43Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All compounds were found to have a potency similar to the mEGF control (EC50 0.021, 0.013. 0.015, and 0.013 nm, respectively).Cell Staining and Fixation Protocol for K35EGF Fluorescent Conjugates—BaF/3 cells stably transfected with wtEGFR were resuspended in serum-free/phenol red-free RPMI (Invitrogen), supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and serum starved at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were washed and then incubated on ice with fluorescein- and Alexa 555-K35EGF (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μm phenylarsine oxide, total EGF concentration 50 nm) in specified ratios for 20 min to allow binding. The phenylarsine oxide was used in micromolar amounts for rigorous prevention of receptor internalization (44Walker F. Orchard S.G. Jorissen R.N. Hall N.E. Zhang H.H. Hoyne P.A. Adams T.E. Johns T.G.

After incubation cells were pelleted to remove free EGF, fixed with paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min.Degree of EGFR-eGFP Aggregation by Image Correlation Microscopy— BaF/3 cells expressing EGFR-eGFP were serum starved for 3 h and incubated with or without saturating concentration of EGF (39Burgess A.W. Lloyd C.J. Nice E.C. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2065-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) at 4 °C prior to fixation with ice-cold methanol. Images representing membrane-associated EGFR-eGFP were collected using a Bio-Rad MRC 1000 scanning fluorescence confocal microscope (Nikon Plan Apo, 60 × NA 1.2 water immersion lens, zoom = 10, pinhole = 2.4) with FITC emission optics (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 520/22 nm band pass). Each image was the accumulation of greater than 50 scans in photon counting mode. Subimages representing areas of the cell surface were autocorrelated using the Fourier Transform Math option in ImageJ (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health). Areas outside the cell boundary were also autocorrelated to provide a background control. The average cluster density 〈N〉 (= number of clusters/μm2) was determined from extrapolating the spatial autocorrelation function at zero lag (g (0)) using a Gaussian-plus-offset function as described by Petersen et al.

Faraday Discuss. 1998; 111: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Lifetime Microscopy—FLIM experiments were carried out using a lifetime fluorescence imaging attachment (Lambert Instruments, Leutingwolde, The Netherlands) mounted on an inverted microscope (TE2000U, Nikon, Inc., Japan) (29Hanley Q.S.

Labeled cells were excited using epi-illumination with a sinusoidally modulated 470 nm LED at 40 MHz and observed with a 100× NA 1.25 oil objective (Nikon Plan-Fluor; Nikon, Inc.) through a filter set designed for FITC (Nikon FITC; DM505, EM 515–555 nm). The phase and modulation were determined from a series of images taken at 12 phase settings using software provided by the manufacturer and converted to phase and modulation with correction for photobleaching as described by van Munster and Gadella (46van Munster E.B. Gadella Jr., T.W. Cytometry. 2004; 58A: 185-194Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescein dianion (lifetime 4.1 ns) was used as a reference (47Magde D. Rojas G.E. Seybold P.G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 737-744Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The mean ± S.D. reported for the phase and modulation reported are from 30 cells/labeling ratio used. We averaged the FLIM data on a cell-by-cell basis because we are interested in the statistics of a cell population. The FLIM distributions are over a number of cells (150 in all, 30/labeling condition).Two-state FRET/Non-FRET Model in the Frequency Domain—An EGF donor located in close spatial proximity (separation, R) to an EGF acceptor within an EGFR oligomer will transfer energy to the acceptor (28Förster T.

This loop, as in homologous nucleic-acid translocases, may bind substrates proximally and, coupled with ATP hydrolysis, translocate them distally, exerting mechanical force that mediates unfolding. Hexameric ring assemblies containing one or two AAA+ ATPase domains per subunit have been recognized to mediate ATP-dependent protein disassembly and unfolding in a variety of contexts in the cell (Sauer et al., 2004Sauer R.T. Bolon D.N. Burton B.M. Burton R.E. Flynn J.M. Grant R.A. Hersch G.L. Joshi S.A. Kenniston J.A.

Moreover, a general role has been identified for the hetero-oligomeric ring of AAA+ ATPases lying at the base of the 19S proteasome cap structure in unfolding and translocating proteins into the 20S proteasome core particle (Glickman et al., 1998Glickman M.H.

In prokaryotic cells, analogous unfolding actions are exerted by such Hsp100 chaperone components as ClpX and ClpA, which associate with the proteolytic ring assembly ClpP (Hoskins et al., 2001Hoskins J.R.

The nature of substrate recognition by these chaperones and how subsequent ATP-driven unfolding and translocation are mediated by them remain unclear. Both ClpX and ClpA typically recognize terminal sequences, or “tags,” in substrate proteins (Keiler et al., 1996Keiler K.C. Waller P.R.H. Sauer R.T.

Analogously, both chaperones are able to bind the fusion protein GFP-ssrA, unfold it, and translocate it into ClpP, where it is degraded (Weber-Ban et al., 1999Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D.

Bolon D.N. Burton B.M. Burton R.E. Flynn J.M. Grant R.A. Hersch G.L. Joshi S.A. Kenniston J.A. Levchenko I. et al.Sculpting the proteome with AAA+ proteases and disassembly machines.Cell. 2004; 119: 9-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Yet, notably, the ClpX ring assembly has affinity on its own for ssrA-tagged proteins (Kim et al., 2000Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Dynamics of substrate denaturation and translocation by the ClpXP degradation machine.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (255) Google Scholar). By contrast, another terminal recognition element, which resides in the N-terminal region of the RepA protein, is recognized only by ClpA, which serves to dissociate the homodimeric form of RepA to a DNA binding competent monomer (Hoskins et al., 2000aHoskins J.R. Kim S.-Y. Wickner S. Substrate recognition by the ClpA chaperone component of ClpAP protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Notably, the RepA element can be recognized whether placed at the N terminus or C terminus of GFP, as judged by degradation of these substrates in the presence of ClpP (Hoskins et al., 2002Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. ClpAP and ClpXP degrade proteins with tags located in the interior of the primary sequence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recent studies of ClpX have suggested, based on a mutational analysis and binding of a synthetic peptide, that it may recognize ssrA-tagged proteins via a motif shared with ClpA, the tetrapeptide GYVG (Siddiqui et al., 2004Siddiqui S.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Role of the protein-processing pore of ClpX, a AAA+ ATPase, in recognition and engagement of specific protein substrates.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 369-374Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar), modeled from the crystal structure of the ClpX subunit monomer (Kim and Kim, 2003Kim D.Y. Kim K.K. Crystal structure of ClpX molecular chaperone from Helicobacter pylori.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50664-50670Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to lie at the channel-facing aspect of its single AAA+ ATPase domain. Yet a related Hsp100 protein, ClpB, which exhibits protein-disaggregation activity associated with translocation of substrates through its central channel (Weibezahn et al., 2004Weibezahn J. Tessarz P. Schlieker C. Zahn R. Maglica Z. Lee S. Zentgraf H. Weber-Ban E.U. Dougan D.A. Tsai F.T.F. et al.Thermotolerance requires refolding of aggregated proteins by substrate translocation through the central pore of ClpB.Cell. 2004; 119: 653-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), has similar tetrapeptides (KYRG and GYVG) modeled to lie at the cavity aspect of each of its two AAA+ ATPase domains (Lee et al., 2003Lee S. Sowa M.E. Watanabe Y.-h. Sigler P.B. Chiu W. Yoshida M. Tsai F.T.F. The structure of ClpB: a molecular chaperone that rescues proteins from an aggregated state.Cell. 2003; 115: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (340) Google Scholar), but it fails to recognize ssrA-tagged substrates. Notably, ClpA also has two AAA+ domains and two motifs identical to those in ClpB. Here, to address the question of which sequences in ClpA are involved with substrate recognition, we have taken a general approach of examining chemical crosslinks formed with ClpA by GFP-RepA and GFP-ssrA substrates bearing photocrosslinkers. The region identified by the ssrA moiety, which faces the central channel of ClpA, as well as neighboring channel-facing structures, was then characterized by mutational study. Each of the six identical subunits of the ClpA ring is composed of three stacked domains, arranged proximal to distal in both primary and tertiary structures as N domain, AAA+ D1, and AAA+ D2. Loops at the distal surface of the D2 domains form contacts with the coaxially associating protease, ClpP. In order to map where recognition tags become bound to ClpA, we employed a crosslinking strategy, placing the bifunctional photoactivatable crosslinker, PEAS (N-((2-pyridyldithio)ethyl)-4-azidosalicylamide), directly onto a cysteine residue substituted within or immediately adjacent to the tag in fusion proteins joining the stable β barrel protein GFP with either the ssrA sequence or the first 15 residues of RepA (Figure 1A ). Such fusion proteins have been previously observed using fluorescence measurements to be efficiently unfolded by ClpA in the presence of ATP and also to be rapidly degraded if ClpP is present, reflecting the behavior of bone fide substrates (Weber-Ban et al., 1999Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Global unfolding of a substrate protein by the Hsp100 chaperone ClpA.Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Hoskins et al., 2002Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. ClpAP and ClpXP degrade proteins with tags located in the interior of the primary sequence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 11037-11042Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In a further set of experiments, the PEAS crosslinker was placed onto cysteine residues substituted into the solvent-exposed surface of the GFP “body” portion of these fusion proteins (Figure 1B), allowing mapping of where this portion of the substrate protein becomes localized at ClpA. (A) Placement of crosslinker immediately adjacent to or within C-terminal recognition tags (in red). A single accessible cysteine was substituted for lysine at the C terminus of the GFP moiety, and the photoactivatable arylazide crosslinker, PEAS (N-((2-pyridyldithio)ethyl)-4-azidosalicylamide), was attached. Note that amino acid substitutions were also programmed at other positions in the terminal flexible regions of GFP (numbered and shown in blue) in order to protect these sites from cleavage during postcrosslinking steps of LysC or GluC proteolytic digestion (see Figure 2A). These alterations in the terminal sequences of GFP did not affect the kinetics of unfolding and degradation of the GFP-tag fusion proteins. (B) Placement of crosslinker on the external aspect of the GFP “body” from the GFP-ssrA and GFP-RepA(1–15) substrate protein. The three residues that are individually substituted with cysteine and PEAS labeled are indicated in red on the model of native GFP (PDB ID code 1EMA ). Photocrosslinking was carried out between PEAS-labeled proteins and ClpA that had been assembled into its functional form, a hexameric ring, by incubation with the nonhydrolyzable analog, ATPγS (top, Figure 2A ). While this nucleotide supports assembly of ClpA subunits, it does not support active unfolding, allowing the step of substrate binding to be distinguished from a subsequent one of unfolding (Weber-Ban et al., 1999Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Global unfolding of a substrate protein by the Hsp100 chaperone ClpA.Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Hoskins et al., 2000bHoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Protein binding and unfolding by the chaperone ClpA and degradation by the protease ClpAP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because GFP-ssrA and GFP-RepA bind to ATPγS-assembled ClpA without becoming unfolded, they maintain their fluorescence, enabling detection of the substrate through subsequent steps (see Figure 2A). Because the stable GFP moiety is relatively resistant to LysC and GluC as compared to ClpA, it was possible to recover proteolytic products via nickel-affinity purification through an N-terminal His10 tag on intact GFP. (A) PEAS crosslinker, represented by an x, was attached to a cysteine substituted immediately proximal to the C-terminal ssrA tag, designated here as a red line (see also Figure 1A). Crosslinked ClpA subunit was recovered by nickel-affinity and MonoS chromatography. LysC proteolysis was then carried out, followed by nickel-affinity chromatography to recover intact GFP-ssrA crosslinked to a proteolytic fragment of ClpA. An aliquot was subjected to HPLC/MS analysis. Because the GFP moiety has an accessible glutamate, further proteolysis by GluC produced a crosslinker-bearing proteolytic fragment cleaved not only in the ClpA portion but also in the GFP portion. Aliquots were analyzed by HPLC/MS both without and with reduction by TCEP. (B) Representative gel analysis of crosslinking (xl) and purification steps, detected by fluorescence and protein staining (Coomassie). Without photolysis (no xl) or in the absence of the recognition tag on GFP (His-GFP in Figure 1A), no crosslinked products were observed (left three lanes in each panel, “no tag”). In its presence (right three lanes, “tag”), multiple crosslinked species were observed, presumed to represent multiple conformations of a single species identified by mass spectrometry (see text). Note that to maintain the crosslinks and the GFP fluorescence, no reductant was present in the SDS sample buffer, and the samples were not heated before loading. GFP fluorescence on the gel was detected by a Storm Phosphorimager in the blue fluorescence mode. An SDS-PAGE analysis of a representative crosslinking and purification is shown in Figure 2B. Crosslinked species the size of GFP-tag substrate + ClpA (∼115 kDa) were observed both by fluorescence of the GFP moiety and also directly by Coomassie staining. These were only obtained when the tag was present (compare “no tag” in fluorescence and Coomassie analyses), indicating specificity of the tags in recruiting the respective substrates to ClpA. While multiple discrete crosslinked products were observed (right-hand lanes), these are likely to be multiple folded conformers of the crosslinked species as opposed to products of different masses because when the crosslinked products were examined by HPLC/MS, only one mass was observed (not shown). The step of nickel-affinity purification removed a large percentage of the ClpA subunits that had failed to become crosslinked, theoretically >80% because the stoichiometry of binding of the substrate appears to be one GFP-ssrA per hexamer (Figure 2B; Piszczek et al., 2005Piszczek G. Rozycki J. Singh S.K. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. The molecular chaperone, ClpA, has a single high affinity peptide binding site per hexamer.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12221-12230Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The further step of MonoS chromatography effectively separated noncrosslinked GFP-tag molecules from those crosslinked to ClpA. After proteolysis and affinity capture on nickel matrix, HPLC/MS was carried out. ssrA. When His10-GFP-ssrA-crosslinked ClpA subunits were digested with LysC and recovered by Ni affinity, only large GFP adducts were recovered by HPLC/MS, including a species whose size was consistent with His10-GFP-ssrA-PEAS plus a fragment of ClpA corresponding to aa 511–555 (not shown). When HPLC/MS was carried out on this sample after TCEP reduction (which separates ClpA-PEAS from GFP-ssrA; see Figure 1), a peptide was indeed observed with the size of ClpA LysC peptide 511–555 coupled with PEAS (Figure 3A ). No other peptide corresponding to a LysC peptide of ClpA coupled to PEAS was recovered. HPLC/MS (A) after LysC digestion of the purified GFP-ssrA-PEAS-ClpA photocrosslinked species and (B and C) after a further GluC digestion of the GFP-ssrA-PEAS-ClpA peptides purified after LysC digestion is shown. (A) GFP-ssrA and ClpA were photocrosslinked, and the products were purified, digested with LysC, and recovered as in Figure 2 and Experimental Procedures. An aliquot was incubated with 2 mM TCEP (to reverse the PEAS crosslink) and subjected to HPLC/MS to identify the peptides. One of these (5145.0684 Da) from the indicated chromatogram peak (top panel, yellow highlight and arrow) corresponds closely to the molecular mass of a LysC peptide of ClpA (aa 511–555; 4934.55 Da) plus PEAS (210.05 Da) and a proton (total predicted mass: 5145.61 Da). (B) The affinity-purified products of the LysC digestion in (A) were digested with GluC as in Experimental Procedures. An aliquot was subjected to HPLC/MS without TCEP reduction. One peptide (4143.2905 Da) from the indicated chromatogram peak (yellow) corresponds to a LysC-GluC double-digestion product of ClpA (aa 527–555; 3036.65 Da) combined with PEAS (209.04 Da), a peptide from GFP-ssrA that contains the crosslink-modified cysteine (GFP236-ssrA5; 896.35 Da), and a proton (total mass: 4143.05 Da). Note that this peptide contains a disulfide bond between the Cys in the GFP-ssrA peptide and the PEAS, so the mass of each is reduced by one proton. (C) An aliquot of the GluC-digested material in (B) was subjected to HPLC/MS after reduction with 2 mM TCEP. The peptide with a mass of 3248.2278 Da corresponds to ClpA (527–555) plus PEAS and a proton (total mass: 3247.71 Da). The GFP-ssrA fragment has been released by reduction, and the PEAS sulfhydryl group is protonated. To confirm this assignment, the purified (nonreduced) LysC products were digested with GluC, which would be predicted to cleave the LysC 511–555 peptide after position 526. HPLC/MS without TCEP reduction detected a peptide consistent with the predicted GluC-LysC fragment (aa 527–555) coupled via PEAS to a predicted fragment bearing the C-terminal residues of GFP (after E235) and the N-terminal five residues of ssrA (see Figure 1, Figure 3). After TCEP reduction, HPLC/MS now directly revealed a peptide whose mass was consistent with ClpA(527–555) plus PEAS (Figure 3C). The released fragment of GFP-ssrA (GFP236 through ssrA5) was also detected by MS, migrating in the HPLC peak at 32.7 min. Because of the coelution of the ClpA-PEAS fragment with several larger peptides derived from GFP-ssrA, it was not possible to analyze this fragment further to determine the site of PEAS attachment. The ClpA segment (aa 527–555) identified by this approach maps to the second AAA+ ATPase domain, D2, lying between its Walker A and B motifs, and corresponds in the crystal structure of the ClpA monomer (Guo et al., 2002Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. Crystal structure of ClpA, an Hsp100 chaperone and regulator of ClpAP protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) to a loop followed by an α helix (Figure 4A ). The position of this region relative to an intact ring could be modeled by homology to mouse p97, a related hexameric ring assembly also containing two stacked AAA+ ATPase domains, for which an X-ray structure of an intact ring has been determined (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Complete structure of p97/valosin-containing protein reveals communication between nucleotide domains.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, there is substantial secondary and tertiary structural similarity of ClpA and p97 through the D2 regions of their subunits between the Walker motifs. The loop present in the crosslinked peptide of ClpA (lower portion of heavy green segment in Figure 4B, centering on aa 531) corresponds in p97 to a loop facing its central channel (Figure 4C), directed toward its 6-fold symmetry axis. The loop in ClpA, however, is almost three times longer than that in p97 (Figure 4B). (A) and (B) show the location of the peptide in the ClpA subunit monomer, as determined from its X-ray structure. (C) shows the position of the analogous loop and α helix in the X-ray structure of the intact hexamer of the related chaperone p97. (A and B) Comparison of primary and secondary structures of ClpA and p97 in the region of their AAA+ D2 domains between the Walker motifs. The sequences are aligned according to shared secondary structural features as shown in (B), where the X-ray structure of the ClpA monomer (PDB ID code 1KSF ; Guo et al., 2002Guo F. Maurizi M.R. Esser L. Xia D. Crystal structure of ClpA, an Hsp100 chaperone and regulator of ClpAP protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46743-46752Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and that of the subunit of p97 (PDB code 1OZ4 ; DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003DeLaBarre B. Brunger A.T. Complete structure of p97/valosin-containing protein reveals communication between nucleotide domains.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) are superposed for the D2 region between the Walker motifs. The secondary structures align closely, except in the region of the crosslinked peptide (overlined in solid green in [A], heavy green line in [B]), where there is both a larger loop in ClpA (aa 526–538) and a longer α-helical segment (aa 539–557). In (A), the additional N-terminal sequences of the larger crosslinked peptide (aa 511–555) identified by the initial LysC digestion (prior to GluC treatment) are denoted by a dotted green line. (C) Putative quaternary structural localization of the crosslinked ClpA peptide, as indicated from position of the related segment of p97, colored green in the X-ray structure of the p97 hexamer. Note that the loop portion of this segment faces the central channel at the proximal aspect of the D2 domain. RepA. In the case of crosslinking a GFP-RepA construct, a different result was obtained. Here, a large peptide detected after LysC digestion and TCEP reduction corresponded to the N domain fragment (aa 1–144) of ClpA plus PEAS (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). A fragment corresponding to the one recovered with GFP-ssrA was not present. After further proteolysis with GluC, the large peptide was no longer observed, but several peptides were detected that were consistent with LysC-GluC peptides from the N domain of ClpA coupled to PEAS. These included one predicted to contain the N terminus (aa 1–5) of ClpA (not shown) and one with ClpA residues 29–126 (Figure S1B). Because the N domains are flexibly tethered to the D1 ATPase domain (Ishikawa et al., 2004Ishikawa T. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. The N-terminal substrate-binding domain of ClpA unfoldase is highly mobile and extends axially from the distal surface of ClpAP protease.J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 180-188Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it is not possible to judge from these crosslinks whether the RepA tag binds at an axial or outside aspect of the domain. When cysteine residues substituted into the external surface of the GFP moiety of GFP-ssrA or GFP-RepA (see Figure 1B) were modified with PEAS and crosslinked to ClpA, different crosslinking efficiencies were observed from different positions (data not shown), but the S202C substitution gave interpretable results with both tags. For both ssrA and RepA S202C constructs, crosslinks were detected with peptides corresponding to LysC-GluC fragments of the N domain, once again including the N-terminal (aa 1–5) fragment (Figure S2). As a further measurement of the position of the GFP body relative to the N domains, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiment was carried out (Figure S3). The GFP fluorophore was the donor, and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) was the acceptor, placed on cysteines substituted at either of two different positions on the N domains of ClpA, one proximal to the root of the domain, C97, and the other at a distal point, C72. Upon binding either GFP-ssrA or GFP-RepA, both TMR-labeled ClpAs produced significant FRET, detected by a decrease of donor fluorescence lifetime. In agreement with the physical crosslinking data, these data place the GFP body portion of the substrate within or adjacent to the N domains, presumably in an axial position inside of them. To evaluate whether the channel-facing segment of D2 that had been photocrosslinked by the ssrA region of GFP-ssrA was directly involved in recognizing the ssrA element, a structure-function analysis was carried out. A series of single amino acid substitutions was produced along the length of the segment, involving both a loop portion that projects into the central channel in the homologous p97 (Figure 4C) and an α helix portion (see Figure 5A ). Both alanine substitutions and more drastic substitutions to acidic character were made, the latter potentially able to produce charge-charge repulsion with the acidic (D4–E5) region of the ssrA element (see Figure 1A). (A) View of the D2 segment crosslinked by GFP-ssrA, with the main chain in green and side chains that have been mutated in red and numbered. This view is from the ClpA channel, as modeled on the structure of p97 (see Experimental Procedures). (B) Degradation of GFP-ssrA by wild-type ClpA and the ClpA D2 mutants in the presence of ClpP and ATP. The reaction was followed by loss of GFP fluorescence, as detailed in Experimental Procedures. A number of mutants (black traces) were as active as wild-type ClpA (red trace). A few were completely inactive (L533D, G535D, and Y540A; dark blue, yellow, and green traces, respectively); several others (V530D, I534C, I534D, and Y540C) had reduced but detectable activity. (C) Binding of GFP-ssrA-PEAS to ClpA and several ClpA D2 mutants determined by photocrosslinking. Photocrosslinking was carried out as in Experimental Procedures and Figure 2, except on a smaller scale. Aliquots were electrophoresed on an SDS gel without reduction or heating to retain both the disulfide crosslink and GFP fluorescence. GFP fluorescence was detected by Phosphorimager. Crosslinked products are indicated by “XL” and noncrosslinked GFP-ssrA by “GFP.” Some mutants show strong crosslinking, indicative of binding, including Y540A, even though it failed to degrade GFP-ssrA (see [B]); others, such as G535D, show no crosslinking, consistent with their inability to degrade GFP-ssrA. In comparison with the wild-type lane, the major crosslinked species with the mutants was the faster-migrating one, but the basis for this difference is not known. (D) Binding of another ssrA-tagged ClpA substrate, λR-ssrA, to selected mutant ClpAs. The change in anisotropy of fluorescein-maleimide-labeled λR-ssrA upon ATPγS addition (at 60 s) was monitored as in Experimental Procedures. Color coding is as in (B). This substrate binds to mutant Y540A, although less well than it does to wild-type ClpA. (E) Binding of GFP-RepA to wild-type ClpA and selected D2 mutants. GFP-RepA-PEAS was incubated with ClpA and the indicated mutants and photocrosslinked as in (C). All of the mutants in D2 show strong crosslinks. Only ClpAΔ143 (missing the N domain) fails to crosslink, as expected because the N domain is required for binding the RepA tag. Selected lanes from the same gel are shown. (F) Degradation of GFP-RepA by wild-type ClpA and selected ClpA D2 mutants in the presence of ClpP and ATP. GFP-"

The P157Q and P160Q mutations of p22phox showed selective inhibition of Nox2/p47phox/p67phox, and selectivity was specific for the organizing subunit (p47phox or NOXO1) rather than the Nox catalytic subunit.

However, until the last several years, the enzymes responsible for generating these ROS were unknown, except for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, a superoxide-generating enzyme whose catalytic moiety, flavocytochrome b558, is composed of a large catalytic subunit (gp91phox or Nox2) and a smaller subunit (p22phox). Beginning in 1999, novel homologues of gp91phox have been reported (11Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D.

The latter contain a peroxidase homology domain in addition to the NADPH-oxidase domain. These homologues share a core structure consisting of six predicted transmembrane α-helixes, which bind two heme groups, plus a C-terminal flavoprotein domain containing the conserved binding sites for NADPH and FAD. In addition to the core structure of Nox, Nox5 contains an N-terminal extension containing calcium binding EF-hand motifs (for a review, see Refs. 18Lambeth J.D. Nature Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar and 19Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Nox2 have been studied extensively. Nox2 is complexed with a small subunit p22phox to form flavocytochrome b558 (9Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Nox2 activation requires stimulus-induced assembly of the cytochrome b558 with the cytosolic regulatory proteins p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (for a review, see Refs. 9Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 20Babior B.M.

In the resting state, p47phox and p67phox are located in the cytosol. Upon cell activation (e.g. exposure to opsonized bacteria, chemoattractants, or a protein kinase C activator, phorbol 11-myristate 12-acetate (PMA)), p47phox becomes hyperphosphorylated in the autoinhibitory region, freeing its tandem SH3 domains to bind to a C-terminally located proline-rich region (PRR) of p22phox and resulting in translocation from cytosol to the membrane-associated flavocytochrome b558 (22Leto T.L.

Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Following GTP binding, the small GTPase Rac translocates to the membrane (24Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Rac and p47phox provide binding sites for p67phox, resulting in its association with Nox2 and activation of electron transfer from NADPH to FAD (25Han C.-H. Freeman J.L.R. Lee T. Motalebi S.A.

Another cytosolic subunit p40phox was identified as a p67phox-binding protein and, while not essential, facilitates the stimulus-induced translocation of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane (29Kuribayashi F. Nunoi N. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), resulting in increased Nox2 activity.Recently, homologues of p47phox and p67phox were reported by several groups and have been named Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1) and Nox activator 1 (NOXA1), respectively (30Banfi B.

Several biochemical studies indicate that like gp91phox, Nox1 activity is also governed by regulatory subunits, in this case NOXO1 and NOXA1, since Nox1-dependent reactive oxygen generation required co-expression of both NOXO1 and NOXA1 (30Banfi B.

In addition, NOXO1 and Nox1 are coordinately expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, consistent with NOXO1 as a physiological regulatory subunit for Nox1 (31Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L.

Hirayama T. Rokutan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3051-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Other Nox proteins show both subunit-dependent and subunit-independent regulation. Human Nox3 requires regulatory subunits, but its regulation is less discriminating than that of Nox1. Nox3 can be activated by NOXO1 alone or by the combination of p47phox and p67phox in a PMA-dependent manner (36Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mouse Nox3 shows similar regulation, except that it requires NOXA1 in combination with NOXO1 (37Banfi B. Malgrange B. Knisz J. Steger K. Dubois-Dauphin M. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46065-46072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Nox4 is constitutively active (14Geiszt M. Kopp J.B. Várnai P. Leto T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8010-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), and it is not activated by these subunits (38Ambasta R.K. Kumar P. Griendling K.K. Schmidt H.H. Busse R. Brandes R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45935-45941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the insulin receptor- or toll-like receptor 4-signaling pathway increases Nox4-derived ROS generation (39Park H.S. Jung H.Y. Park E.Y. Kim J. Lee W.J. Bae Y.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 40Mahadev K. Motoshima H. Wu X. Ruddy J.M. Arnold R.S. Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. Goldstein B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1844-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of this regulation is not known. Nox5-dependent ROS generation is activated by calcium, consistent with its N-terminal calcium-binding domain (16Banfi B. Molnar G. Maturana A. Steger K. Hegedus B. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37594-37601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 41Banfi B. Tirone F. Durussel I. Knisz J. Moskwa P. Molnar G.Z. Krause K.H. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18583-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Similarly, a preparation of Duox1 and Duox2 partially purified from thyroid is also activated by calcium (42De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Roles for additional subunits for calcium-dependent Nox proteins have not been reported.Despite an increasing number of studies documenting the roles of regulatory subunits in Nox regulation, the role of p22phox in Nox family members other than Nox2 remains relatively unexplored. Activity studies have been hampered by the near universal expression of p22phox in experimental cell systems. We thus used siRNA in the present studies to inhibit expression of endogenous p22phox and to determine the requirement of Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, Nox4, and Nox5 for this subunit. We find that Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, and Nox4 require p22phox, but the calcium-dependent enzyme Nox5 does not. In addition, for each of these systems, we have investigated the importance of the PRR of p22phox in regulating ROS generation. Unexpectedly, we have found that forms of p22phox mutated in this region function as dominant inhibitors for Nox1, Nox2, and Nox3 activities but not for Nox4 or Nox5. In addition, specific mutations can discriminate between p47phox-dependent regulation and NOXO1-dependent regulation. The present studies implicate both regulatory subunit binding-dependent and -independent functions of p22phox in regulating ROS production by Nox enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (36Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Chicken anti-human NOXO1 and NOXA1 antibodies were previously described (36Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Jesaitis (Montana State University, Bozeman, MT). Polyclonal antibody R3179 was prepared against human neutrophil p22phox and was shown previously to be specific for p22phox (43Jesaitis A.J. Buescher E.S. Harrison D. Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Livesey S. Linner J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody E39.1, raised against a synthetic peptide representing amino acid residues 235–248 of human Nox1 was kindly provided by Jackie Papkoff (DiaDexus, Inc.). Polyclonal antibody N4-8478 was prepared by immunizing rabbit with expressed protein corresponding to amino acids 322–428 of human Nox4. For immunostaining of tissues, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) polyclonal, anti-β-actin, and anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences, Cell Signaling, and Sigma, respectively. The cDNA clones encoding human Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, Nox4, p22phox, p47phox, p67phox, NOXO1, NOXA1, and V12Rac1 (the constitutively active substitution of human Rac1), were previously described (33Cheng G.

Human colon tissue was obtained from Emory's Human Tissue Procurement and Banking Center from surgeries performed at Emory and generally represented normal tissue obtained along with resected tumors. The procurement of tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Emory University, and written informed consent was obtained. Tissues were embedded in Cryomatrix. Five-micrometer sections were obtained at -22 °C using a cryostat (Thermo Shandon Cryotome) and placed on glass microscope slides. Tissue slides of the human kidney cortex were purchased from BioChain. Nox5 cDNA was amplified by PCR of human spleen cDNA library (BD Biosciences) using a set of primers (5′-GCATGGATCCACCATGAACACATCTGGAGACCCA-3′ and 5′-GCATAAGCTTCTAGAAATTCTCTTGGAAAAATCTGAAGCCGAAC-3′), containing BamHI (italic) and HindIII (underline) sites. After digestion by each enzyme, the cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pCMV-tag 5A vector (Stratagene). The construct was sequenced in both strands using ABI model 377 sequencer and was identified as Nox5α (GenBank™ accession number AF317889).Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized either with or without murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed with GeneAmp PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the following primer sets: p22phox, 5′-ATGGGGCAGATCGAGTGGGCCATGT-3′ and 5′-GTAGATGCCGCTCGCAATGGCCAG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCATGACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACT-3′ and 5′-GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGT-3′. Amplified cDNA fragments were ligated into a pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Each product was confirmed to be the corresponding cDNA fragment using ABI model 377 sequencer.Preparation of Short Hairpin RNA (shRNAs) against Human p22phox—DNA oligonucleotides encoding shRNA sequences with loop sequence (TTCAAGAGA) were subcloned into the pSuper-neo vector (OligoEngine) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific shRNA sequences were selected on the basis of human p22phox cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_000101) as follows: 5′-AACATGACCGCCGTGGTGAAG-3′ for shRNA-p22-N, 5′-AATAGTCCTGCGAGACACGGG-3′ for scrambled shRNA-p22-N, 5′-AAGGAATTACTATGTTCGGGC-3′ for shRNA-p22-M, 5′-AAGCGGCATCTACCTACTGGC-3′for shRNA-p22-C, and 5′-AATGCCTGGTCAACGGTACCC-3′for scrambled shRNA-p22-C. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing.Generation of Truncation and Point Mutation of p22phox, GFP-fused Nox1, and Myc-tagged Nox4 —We amplified the DNA fragments that encode native p22phox and truncated forms of p22phox (amino acid residues 1–149, 1–155, and 1–172) by PCR using sense primer (5′-AAAAGAATTCCCACCATGGGGCAGATCGAGTGGGCCA-3′) and antisense primers as follows: full-length p22phox, 5′-AAAAGTCGACTCACACGACCTCGTCGGTCACCGGGA-3′; p22phox (residues 1–149), 5′-AAAAGTCGACTCACTTGATGGTGCCTCCGATCTG-3′; p22phox (residues 1–155), 5′-AAAAGTCGACTCAGGGGTTGCTGGGCGGCTGCTT-3′; and p22phox (residues 1–172), AAAAGTCGACTCAAGCCTCCTCCTCGCTGGGCTT. These primers contained EcoRI (italic type) and SalI (underlined) sites. After digestion by each enzyme, the cDNA fragments were subcloned into the pCMV-tag 5A vector.Point mutations at prolines were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. p22phox (P160Q) was constructed by amplifying p22phox cDNA using primer set A (primer 1, AAAAGGATCCGCAGTGTCCCAGCCGGGTTCGT; primer 2, 5′-CCCACCGCCGCGGCCACAGGCAGAGG-3′) and primer set B (primer 3, 5′-CTCTGCCTGTGGCCGCGGCGGTGGGT-3′; primer 4, AAAAGAATTCTCACACGACCTCGTCGGTCACCGGGA). Nucleotides that correspond to the mutated amino acid are underlined in primers 2 and 3. These PCR products contained BamHI and EcoRI sites introduced by primers 1 and 4, respectively. After performing a second PCR with primers 1 and 4 and digestion by each enzyme, the cDNA fragments were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. Using a similar strategy, p22phox (P159Q), p22phox (P157Q), p22phox (P156Q), and full-length p22phox DNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen).To generate cDNA that encodes N-terminal GFP-fused protein of Nox1, human Nox1 cDNA was amplified using sense primer (AAAAGAGCTCGGAAACTGGGTGGTTAACCACTGGT) and antisense primer (AAAAGTCGACTCAGAAGTTTTCTTTGTTGAAGTAGAATTG). This sense primer has been designed to delete the initial methionine of native Nox1. The PCR product contained SacI (italic type) and SalI (underlined) sites. For C-terminally Myc-tagged Nox4 protein, human Nox4 cDNA was amplified using sense primer (AAAAGCGGCCGCGGTACCATGGCTGTGTCCTGGAGGA) and antisense primer (AAAAGTCGACGCTGAAAGACTCTTTATTGTATTCAAATCTTGTCCCA) that contain NotI (italic type) and SalI (underlined) sites, respectively. After digestion by each enzyme, the fragments including Nox1 and Nox4 cDNAs were subcloned into the pEGFP-C3 vector (BD Biosciences) and the pCMV-tag 5A vector, respectively. All constructs were verified by sequencing.Transient Transfections—HEK293 cells were grown for 24 h in 6-well plates and allowed to reach to 50% confluence in 2 ml of culture medium. Cells were transfected with vectors carrying Nox1 through Nox5, p67phox, p47phox, NOXO1, NOXA1, full-length p22phox, and mutated or truncated p22phox cDNAs alone or in the indicated combinations using the tranfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, or 72 h when co-transfected with shRNA vectors, cells were washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and were removed from the well, after which cells were harvested by centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspending in Hanks' balanced salt solution.Measurement of ROS—ROS was measured using luminol luminescence as previously described (33Cheng G. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4737-4742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 36Cheng G. Ritsick D. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34250-34255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells (4 × 104) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium and magnesium were mixed with 200 μm luminol plus 0.32 units of horseradish peroxidase in a 200-μl total volume in each well of a 96-well plate. Luminescence was quantified using a FluoStar™ luminometer (BMG Labtech), recording data every minute for 2 h. Luminescence increased during early time points, peaking at 30 min, and this value was reported herein. For the measurement of Nox2 activation, cells were preincubated with 200 nm PMA for 5 min at 37 °C. For Nox5 activation, cells were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin or the same amount of vehicle at 10 min after beginning data collection and immediately achieved the maximum rate, which was reported at the 12-min time point.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in buffer containing 6 m urea, 25% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.8), protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Cell lysates were then incubated with Laemmeli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature. Extracted protein from ∼2 × 105 cell equivalents was resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Following blocking with nonfat dry milk (4%), proteins were probed using their respective antibodies. Visualization was carried out with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) or against chicken IgG (Sigma).Immunostaining—Slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 20 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, tissue sections were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 5 min and were blocked with 1% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-Nox1 antibody E39.1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-p22phox antibody R3179 for colon or rabbit polyclonal anti-Nox4 antibody and monoclonal anti-p22phox antibody 44.1 for kidney) for 2 h. After washing for 30 min, slides were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG for the colon or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG for the kidney) for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with ToPro3 (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at room temperature, and slides were washed for 15 min. Tissues were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and fluorescence images were scanned with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss). Controls were incubated with secondary antibodies only.Phylogenic Analysis of Human Nox Family—Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenic analysis were carried out with the programs ClustalW (available on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) and TreeView (available on the World Wide Web at taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). To perform alignment, we used human Nox1 (GenBank™ accession number AF127763), human Nox2 (NM_000397), human Nox3 (AF190122), human Nox4 (AF254621), human Nox5 (AF353088), Drosophila melanogaster Nox (FlyBase CG3896), and Arabidopsis thaliana Nox (RbohA; GenBank™ accession number AB015475) that was defined as an outgroup.RESULTSEffects of p22phox Expression on Activation of Nox Enzymes— Cellular ROS-generating systems that utilize Nox enzymes and regulatory proteins co-expressed in HEK293 cells have been reported previously (30Banfi B.

For example, co-expression of Nox2, p67phox, p47phox, and V12Rac1 resulted in high rates of PMA-dependent reactive oxygen generation.

In this study we provide evidence that decorin directly binds to the EGFR causing its dimerization, internalization, and ultimately its degradation. Using various pharmacological agents to disrupt clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis, we demonstrate that decorin evokes a protracted internalization of the EGFR primarily via caveolar-mediated endocytosis. In contrast to EGF, decorin targets the EGFR to caveolae, but not to early or recycling endosomes. Ultimately, however, both EGF- and decorin-induced pathways converge into late endosomes/lysosomes for final degradation. Thus, we have discovered a novel biological mechanism for decorin that could explain its anti-proliferative and anti-oncogenic mode of action.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). During quiescence, decorin expression is markedly up-regulated in most normal diploid cells, whereas its expression is nearly abolished in most transformed cells (2Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 1754-1760PubMed Google Scholar). For example, transformation induced by the activating transcription factor-3 and the nuclear v-Src and v-Jun oncoproteins cause a marked suppression of decorin gene expression (21Kolettas E. Rosenberger R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Perez S. Vial E. van Dam H. Castellazzi M.

Lack of decorin expression is permissive for tumor development insofar as mice with a targeted ablation of both decorin and the tumor suppressor gene p53, develop lymphomas at accelerated rates as compared with the p53 null animals (24Iozzo R.V.

Consistent with these findings, decorin expression is differentially down-regulated in hepatocellular (25Miyasaka Y. Enomoto N. Nagayama K. Izumi N. Marumo F. Watanabe M. Sato C. Br. J.

Parisien M. Roskelley C. Chakravarti S. Roughley P.J. Murphy L.C. Watson P.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 207-214PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, adeno-virus-mediated gene transfer of decorin causes a significant growth inhibition of various tumors (6Reed C.C. Gauldie J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Biglari A. Bataille D. Naumann U. Weller M. Zirger J. Castro M.G. Lowenstein P.R.

Kirby S. Kay P. Owens R.A. McQuillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The similarity of the response to decorin in several human cell lines with a diverse histogenetic background and the induction across species suggested that there is a general, well conserved signal transduction system that is operational in mammalian cells. The existence of a “decorin receptor” has been previously reported (31Hausser H. Kresse H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Hausser H. Schönherr E. Müller M. Liszio C. Bin Z. Fisher L.W. Kresse H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, this receptor shows very slow kinetics with no apparent associated signaling and could represent a scavenger receptor, insofar as Class A scavenger receptors bind both decorin and biglycan (33Santiago-García J. Kodama T. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6942-6946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that decorin might induce growth suppression by activating a cell surface receptor, such as members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinase (34van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 35Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The first evidence in support of decorin/EGFR interaction came from cell-free kinase experiments in which immunopurified EGFR was activated in vitro by recombinant decorin proteoglycan or protein core (10Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This biological activity was independently confirmed by expression cloning using as a soluble ligand a decorin/alkaline phosphatase chimeric protein (36Santra M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35671-35681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two species of EGFR were isolated: one containing the full-length EGFR and one that lacked the intracytoplasmic domain. A physiologically relevant interaction between decorin and EGFR was further confirmed using the yeast two-hybrid system (36Santra M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35671-35681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the uptake, internalization, and intracellular fate of the EGFR evoked by decorin, vis à vis the natural ligand EGF. For this purpose, we generated a biologically active proteoglycan chimera containing decorin fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (DCN-EYFP). Using a combination of biochemical and quantitative immunological approaches, we demonstrate that decorin causes a protracted internalization and degradation of the EGFR primarily through a caveolar-mediated pathway. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the down-regulation of EGFR and the anti-oncogenic properties of decorin, and perhaps other related molecules.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Decorin and DCN-EYFP—Recombinant decorin and DCN-EYFP were produced using either a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system or a stably transfected 293-EBNA cell line. Generation of the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the mature form of decorin (38Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol.

DCN-EYFP-expressing 293-EBNA cells were grown to saturation in a CELLine AD 1000 Bioreactor (IBS Integra Biosciences AG, Switzerland), and protein production was achieved by switching to serum-free medium.

Cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS and incubated with the membrane-impermeable, non-cleavable cross-linker Sulfo-SMPB (0.5 mm) in DPBS (2.5 mm Ca2+), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched at room temperature with 90 mm glycine, 9 mm Tris-HCl (final concentrations), pH 8.5, for 5 min. Alternatively, the membrane-impermeable cross-linker bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (0.5 mm) was used for 30 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were subjected to a linear gradient SDS-PAGE (3–15% (w/v) gel) under reducing conditions. Western immunoblottings for EGFR, β-actin, and decorin were done as described before (11Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I. McQuillan D.J. Gross D. Nugent M.A. Hajnóczky G. Iozzo R.V. J.

Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Approximately 5 × 104 A431 cells were plated on 4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with warm serum-free medium and then incubated with DCN-EYFP, DCN, EGF-Rhodamine, or EGF in serum-free medium at 37 °C. Concentrations and incubation times are detailed in the figure legends. Slides were rinsed twice with DPBS and fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with DPBS, 0.25% Triton X-100 for 2 min and washed with DPBS, 1% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, slides were subjected to standard immunofluorescence protocols, and mounted with Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired using an Olympus BX51 microscope driven by SPOT Advanced version 4.0.9 imaging software (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.), and a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss LSM 5, Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Metamorph 5.0 imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp.) was used for image acquisition and analysis. All dual- or triple-labeled samples were analyzed using filters set at 484 (YFP), 555 (rhodamine), and 620 nm (Cy5). Confocal analysis was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning confocal microscopy system (Carl Zeiss Inc.) driven by the Zeiss LSM 510 image software. Beam splitters were set at 405 (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), 488 (YFP), 543 (rhodamine), and 633 nm (Cy5). All the images were analyzed using the software mentioned above along with Adobe Photoshop (version 9.0, Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Image Quantification—Collected images were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop. Briefly, images of single cells were isolated, and total fluorescent signal was quantified for individual fluorescence channels using the Threshold and Histogram tools. Single cells were then operationally divided into three regions of interest: 1) plasma membrane; 2) intracellular region; and 3) perinuclear region (nucleus included). These areas were subsequently masked and each region of interest was individually quantified. Results were plotted as a percentage of total signals. Decorin Causes a Decrease in EGF-independent (Preformed) EGFR Dimers as Well as EGFR Monomers—It is well established that EGFR dimers represent the active subpopulation of this receptor tyrosine kinase family (35Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 42Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 43Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Upon EGF binding, EGFR monomers dimerize, leading to autophosphorylation of various tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain, and subsequent activation of the signal transduction cascade. We investigated whether decorin would affect EGFR dimerization in the well studied A431 human squamous carcinoma cells, which overexpress wild type EGFR. Decorin has been shown to be effective on these cells both in vitro, by down-regulating EGFR phosphorylation (11Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I. McQuillan D.J. Gross D. Nugent M.A. Hajnóczky G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32879-32887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and in vivo, by retarding the growth of A431 tumor xenografts (6Reed C.C. Gauldie J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3688-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Reed C.C. Waterhouse A. Kirby S. Kay P. Owens R.A. McQuillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to recombinant decorin protein core (0.67 μm) or EGF (16 nm) for various intervals and then treated for the last 20 min with the membrane-impermeable chemical cross-linker Sulfo-SMPB (0.5 mm) (41Goldoni S. Owens R.T. McQuillan D.J. Shriver Z. Sasisekharan R. Birk D.E. Campbell S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Decorin protein core caused a reduction in the amount of both monomers and dimers (Fig. 1A). Quantitative analysis of three independent experiments showed that decorin protein core caused a significant and progressive decline in the amount of ligand-independent (preformed) dimers, with a t½ of ∼45 min (Fig. 1B). The EGFR dimer levels reached a plateau at 1 h (70% reduction) and this did not change for up to 6 h. Interestingly, the EGFR monomer amount also declined with similar kinetics; however, its levels partially recovered and reached a plateau at later time points remaining at ∼60% of control EGFR levels (Fig. 1C). Comparable results were obtained using recombinant decorin proteoglycan (not shown). In contrast, EGF caused a rapid (t½ ∼ 2 min) and substantial (∼7-fold) increase in EGFR dimers, and this did not appreciably change at later time points (Fig. 1D). In the presence of EGF, the amount of EGFR monomers declined in the first 30 min, but subsequently increased and thereafter remained relatively constant at ∼90% of control levels (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that decorin protein core, independent of its glycosaminoglycan moiety, affects the intracellular fate of EGFR monomers and dimers in a way that differs from EGF. Decorin Causes a Slow and Progressive EGFR Degradation—A plausible interpretation of the results presented above is that decorin affects the equilibrium of ligand-independent EGFR population by decreasing the amount of dimers and monomers via intracellular degradation. To further investigate this possibility, we incubated A431 cells with decorin core or EGF for the same time points as above (0.5–6 h) but without any cross-linking reagent. Surprisingly, total EGFR did not rapidly decline upon incubation with the decorin core (Fig. 2A). In the constant presence of decorin, total EGFR levels declined slowly during the first 2 h of incubation and later on began to drop significantly, reaching a plateau at ∼3 h (Fig. 2B). Notably, the presence of exogenous decorin core led to a protracted reduction by ∼40% of total EGFR content that lasted for up to 6 h. In contrast, EGF treatment caused a significant and faster decline in total EGFR followed by a nearly full recovery (Fig. 2, A and B). The decorin-induced reduction in EGFR is in agreement with the estimates derived from A431 clones stably expressing decorin. In this study we found three individual clones with ∼40% EGFR levels of control wild-type cells (11Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I. McQuillan D.J. Gross D. Nugent M.A. Hajnóczky G.

In addition, we found that the average number of 125I-EGF binding sites in three independent clones expressing decorin was 1.3 × 106 ± 0.2 receptors per cell as compared with 2.4 × 106 ± 0.1 receptors per cells in the wild-type A431 (11Csordás G. Santra M. Reed C.C. Eichstetter I. McQuillan D.J. Gross D. Nugent M.A. Hajnóczky G. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32879-32887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants determined by Scatchard analysis were not significantly different among the control and decorin-expressing A431 cells, indicating that decorin did not appreciably change EGFR affinity for EGF. Collectively, these results indicate that decorin induces EGFR degradation via a slow pathway that, in contrast to that evoked by EGF, does not lead to recovery. Decorin Can Be Cross-linked to the EGFR and Forms Large Supramolecular Aggregates—After comparing the results shown in Fig. 2, A and B, with the cross-linking data shown in Fig. 1, an apparent discrepancy was noted in the amount of total EGFR detected upon decorin core treatment, especially at the earlier time points, 30 min and 1 h (compare Figs. 1C and 2B). Upon cross-linking and Western immunoblotting analyses, ∼50% of total EGFR was unaccounted for. These data suggest that in the cross-linking experiments a proportion of the EGFR could not be detected, possibly because it was migrating in larger polymeric complexes, which either did not penetrate the 3–15% gradient SDS-PAGE or did not efficiently transfer onto the membrane. Cross-linking experiments were repeated and, indeed, a longer exposure revealed an EGFR immunoreactive band migrating slower than the EGFR dimer (Fig. 2C, arrow). It is well known that EGFR exists in a monomeric form (175 kDa) and in several aggregated states ranging between 350 and >500 kDa (44Northwood I.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7450-7453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether decorin core could also be a component of EGFR-containing high molecular mass complexes, we probed the high molecular mass region (>350 kDa) with an anti-decorin antibody. A significant amount of decorin was cross-linked with EGFR dimers (Fig. 2D, arrow), and higher order oligomers. These decorin-containing aggregates were not present in the absence of decorin or when the cells were challenged with EGF (Fig. 2D), indicating specificity of the decorin signal. Therefore, our results show for the first time a covalent cross-linking between decorin protein core and EGFR dimers and oligomers. Considering that the cross-linker used (Sulfo-SMPB) has an arm length of 14.5 Å, decorin core had to be in very close proximity to the ligand-binding region of the EGFR. By plotting the relative mobility of protein standards from several blots, we estimated the molecular mass of cross-linked decorin-EGFR complexes to be ∼450 kDa (Fig. 2D, arrow). This would correspond to an EGFR dimer (∼350 kDa) and two decorin core molecules (∼100 kDa), suggesting a stoichiometry of 1:1 decorin core:EGFR monomer. These data provide an explanation for the apparent loss of EGFR after cross-linking in the presence of decorin core. Most likely, EGFR epitopes would be masked in the immunoblottings by the formation of EGFR-decorin complexes. Our results, however, cannot rule out the presence of other cross-linked cell surface proteins in addition to decorin and EGFR in the larger supramolecular aggregates with molecular mass >500 kDa. Decorin Inhibits EGF-dependent EGFR Dimerization—The previous results raised the possibility that decorin could directly interact with the EGFR by forming supramolecular complexes. Previous studies using the yeast two-hybrid system have shown that decorin binds to the EGFR within its ligand-binding L2 domain (36Santra M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35671-35681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The binding site partially overlaps with but is distinct from the EGF-binding domain. Thus, we determined whether decorin would compete with EGF in inducing the initial step of EGFR activation, that is, receptor dimerization. In these experiments the cells were first challenged with decorin core"

We have solved crystal structures of a critical intermediate, the ferrous dioxygen complex (Fe(II)-O2), of the wild-type P450cam and its mutants, D251N and T252A. The wild-type dioxygen complex structure is very much the same as reported previously (Schlichting, I., Berendzen, J., Chu, K., Stock, A. M., Maves, S. A., Benson, D. E., Sweet, R.

Due to of the altered conformation of the I helix groove these two waters are missing in the D251N dioxygen complex which explains its lower catalytic activity and slower proton transfer to the dioxygen ligand. Similarly, the T252A mutation was expected to disrupt the active site solvent structure leading to hydrogen peroxide formation rather than substrate hydroxylation. Unexpectedly, however, the two “catalytic” waters are retained in the T252A mutant. Based on these findings, we propose that the Thr252 accepts a hydrogen bond from the hydroperoxy (Fe(III)-OOH) intermediate that promotes the second protonation on the distal oxygen atom, leading to O–O bond cleavage and compound I formation.

Ganguli B.N. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3543-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was the first P450 to be prepared in sufficient quantities for detailed studies (4Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the first to be sequenced (5Haniu M. Armes L.G. Yasunobu K.T. Shastry B.A. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16122-16130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore is not surprising that much of what we now understand about the P450 catalytic cycle is based on studies with P450cam. Of particular interest is the dioxygen activation process wherein the ferrous dioxygen complex (Fe(II)-O2) (8Ishimura Y. Ullrich V. Peterson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) accepts an electron from the iron-sulfur protein, putidaredoxin, plus two protons, which results in heterolytic cleavage of the oxygen O–O bond leaving behind the Fe(IV)=O ferryl intermediate generally considered to be the active hydroxylating species (Fig. 1). Recent studies have identified the hydroperoxy intermediate in WT P450cam (9Davydov R. Macdonald I.D.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10654-10655Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), but as yet, the Fe(IV)=O has not been directly observed in any P450. The P450cam crystal structure suggested that the highly conserved Thr252 in the I helix (Fig. 1) plays an important part of the dioxygen activation machinery. Not surprisingly, Thr252 was an early target for mutagenesis (11Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Replacement of Thr252 with an aliphatic residue leads to a loss in activity although the rate of NADH utilization does not decrease very much. In the Thr252 mutants reducing equivalents and protons are funneled to the production of peroxide rather than substrate hydroxylation, a process often called uncoupling (Fig. 1). A second conserved residue in the I helix is Asp251. In sharp contrast to the Thr252 mutants, replacement of Asp251 with Asn leads to a large drop in NADH consumption rate (13Shimada H. Makino R.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies with the Asp251 → Asn mutant showed that the Asp251 mutation decelerates the electron transfer step and associated proton transfer events (16Vidakovic M. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9211-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These studies clearly implicate Thr252 and Asp251 as critical residues in the dioxygen activation process and especially in the proper delivery of protons to the iron-linked dioxygen. The crystal structures of the Thr252 → Ala (T252A) (17Raag R. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11420-11429Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and Asp251 → Asn (D251N) (16Vidakovic M. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9211-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) mutants of P450cam in the ferric (Fe(III)) state provided the first hints as to how these mutations alter activity. The next major step in providing a structural underpinning to the dioxygen activation process was the structure of the ferrous dioxygen complex (18Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). An unexpectedly large change occurs in the I helix going from ferric to the ferrous dioxygen-bound state. There also is a significant rearrangement of water structure that provides a continuous hydrogen-bonded link between dioxygen, water molecules, and Thr252. Based on these findings, it was proposed that Asp251 and Thr252 form part of proton shuttle pathway that connects the surface to the dioxygen ligand. Given the functional consequences of the Thr252 and Asp251 mutants, it is very likely that the hydrogen bond network observed in the ferrous dioxygen complex is significantly changed or disrupted. Here we report the crystal structures of the ferrous dioxygen complexes of T252A and D251N mutants. Both structures reveal quite different and unexpected changes in active site water structure, which provides important new insights on the precise roles played by Thr252, Asp251, and the water molecule in the dioxygen activation process. Protein Purification and Crystallization—WT and mutant P450cam were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Gunsalus et al. (4Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Diffraction quality crystals of WT and the mutants were obtained as described previously (19Nagano S. Tosha T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42844-42849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A somewhat different procedure was employed in forming the dioxygen complex from that described by Schlichting et al. (18Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) who used a high pressure oxygen cell. A single crystal first was transferred into a cryobuffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4–0.6 m KCl, 1 mm d-camphor, 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 20% glycerol followed by reduction with 10 mm sodium dithionite for 10 min under anaerobic condition in a glove box. After reduction, the crystal was washed in the dithionite-free cryobuffer for 10 min under anaerobic condition and then soaked in the oxygen-saturated cryo buffer at -5 °C for 5 min. The crystal was flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until data collection. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray data were collected in-house using an R-axis IV imaging plate system and rotating anode equipped with confocal optics (Osmic, Auburn Hills, MI) for WT and D251N or at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beamline 9-2 using a Quantum-315 CCD detector (Area Detectors Systems Corp., Poway, CA) for T252A and D251N. At the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory 0.92 Å x-rays were used, and the beam was attenuated by about 50% to decrease the level of x-ray-induced reduction. Structures of the D251N derived from both in-house and Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory data were the same except for resolution and dioxygen ligand occupancy. The in-house data for the D251N was used, since the structure from the in-house data had better dioxygen occupancy/lower temperature factors, although synchrotron data extended to 1.47 Å. HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38445) Google Scholar) was used for indexing, integration, and scaling.

After a single round of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and temperature factor refinement using CNS, version 1.1, both Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc electron density maps showed the presence of iron-linked dioxygen ligand. The dioxygen ligand was fit to the electron density using the graphic program O, version 8.0 (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The previously reported structure of the WT dioxygen complex using the same crystal form shows that only one of these molecules has dioxygen bound (18Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). The method we employed for forming the dioxygen complex, a longer soaking period in dioxygen-saturated buffers rather than a brief exposure to dioxygen under high pressure, leads to both molecules having dioxygen bound as shown in Fig. 2. The unrestrained Fe–O bond length is 1.85 and 1.79 Å, while the Fe–O–O angle is 129° and 133° for molecules A and B, respectively. Temperature factors of the distal oxygen atom of the iron-bound dioxygen ligand, 21.0 and 22.7 Å2 for molecules A and B, respectively, are significantly lower than that reported previously (18Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar), 46.5 Å2. Since temperature factors and occupancy are highly correlated, it appears that the method we used for preparing the oxy complex leads to higher occupancy and/or a more ordered structure. While both molecules in the asymmetric unit have oxygen bound with essentially no differences, we will focus on molecule B, since in the mutants the temperature factors for the dioxygen ligand are lower in molecule B leading to shaper electron density for both the ligand and surrounding residues and water molecules. In the previous structure, one of the new water molecules introduced into the active site upon dioxygen binding (WAT902) is only 1.78 Å from an adjacent water molecule (WAT687) suggesting that each molecule is only partially occupied. Our simulated annealing omit maps again clearly show the presence of two water molecules, WAT234 and WAT453 (Fig. 2) equivalent to WAT902 and WAT687, respectively, in the previous structure. This network is considered critical for the proper delivery of protons to dioxygen for oxygen activation. Our present WT dioxygen complex structure also has structural changes in the I helix first elucidated by Schlichting et al. (18Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). In the ferric state the Asp251 peptide carbonyl is oriented perpendicular to the I helix axis, but in the ferrous dioxygen complex, the peptide reorients along the helical axis thus giving a more normal helical geometry. The peptide flip is accompanied by movement of Thr252. In the ferric state the Thr252 side chain OH group donates a hydrogen bond to the peptide carbonyl group of Gly248. In the dioxygen complex this hydrogen bond is weakened and Thr252 moves into position to interact with dioxygen at a distance of 3.1 Å. This movement also provides the additional room required for the two new water molecules, WAT453 and WAT234 (Fig. 2A), that provide part of the hydrogen bonded network to dioxygen. Ferrous Dioxygen Complex of the T252A Mutant—Electron density maps for the T252A mutant are shown in Fig. 2. The ligand is clearly visible and well ordered as is the surrounding solvent structure in the T252A mutant. Fig. 3A shows a superimposition of the WT and T252A dioxygen complexes. The I helix undergoes the same change as in the WT dioxygen complex where the Asp251 peptide flips and the I helix has a more normal helix structure. Both structures have a well ordered water close to the distal dioxygen atom, 3.4 Å in WT and 3.1 Å in the mutant, respectively. Even the geometry is the same, since the Oproximal–Odistal–Owater angle is exactly the same for the two complexes, 160°. Considering that Thr252 is part of the dioxygen-water hydrogen bond network generally considered to be critical for dioxygen activation, it was very surprising to find such minor changes in water structure. These results show that Thr252 is not required to hold the active site water molecules in place and that uncoupling is not the result of a disordering of the active site water molecules. Ferrous Dioxygen Complex of the D251N Mutant—The most interesting difference between the D251N and WT dioxygen complex structures is that the mutant is missing the two additional water molecules forming the hydrogen bonded network with dioxygen found in the WT dioxygen complex (Figs. 2C and 3B). The reason that these waters are missing is that the I helix does not undergo the same degree of movement found in WT. Although the Asn251 peptide flips as in WT, in the mutant the hydrogen bond between the Thr252 OH group and Gly248 peptide carbonyl oxygen atom remains intact at a distance of 2.8 Å but increases to 3.4 Å in WT. As a result, Thr252 in the mutant is further from dioxygen, 3.4 Å compared with 3.1 Å in WT. Since the I helix does not open to the extent found in the WT dioxygen complex, there is insufficient room for the two new waters found in the WT dioxygen complex. Both the D251N and T252A mutants exhibit greatly diminished camphor hydroxylation activity, ∼4% (11Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc.

However, T252A consumes NADH at about 85% WT rates and is highly uncoupled, since reducing equivalents and protons are funneled into the formation of hydrogen peroxide rather than camphor hydroxylation. In sharp contrast, the D251N mutant exhibits a greatly diminished rate of NADH consumption, which has been interpreted as a slower proton transfer to the iron-linked dioxygen (16Vidakovic M. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9211-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Since these two mutants have quite different effects on enzyme activity, it is not surprising that the structural consequences of the two mutations also are different. The major differences are in the in the active site water structure. In the T252A dioxygen complex, the two “catalytic” waters found in the WT dioxygen complex are present but are missing in the D251N dioxygen complex. These results provide important insights on the role of water and Thr252 in catalysis. As already reported by Shlichting et al. (18Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar), Thr252 makes interaction with both catalytic waters and dioxygen ligand, which is required for proton transfer. The cause of uncoupling in the T252A mutant has been viewed as a disruption of the dioxygen-water hydrogen bond network resulting in release of peroxide rather than the timely addition of the second proton leading to O–O bond cleavage (Fig. 1). This scenario must now be reconsidered, since the T252A dioxygen structure shows that the two catalytic waters remain in place and are well ordered. Thus, Thr252 is not required for properly positioning the active site waters nor is a free side chain OH required, since Kimita et al. (23Kimata Y. Shimada H. Hirose T. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) showed that replacing the Thr252 side chain OH with a methoxy group, OCH3, does not lead to a significant change in activity. Taken together these results show that Thr252 does not serve as a hydrogen bond or proton donor in dioxygen activation. The one remaining role for Thr252 is to serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor from the hydroperoxy intermediate (Fig. 4). The iron-linked dioxygen accepts one proton and two electrons to form the hydroperoxy species. Two electrons enter into anti-bonding orbitals, πx* and πy*, which reduces bond order and elongates O–O distance from 1.21 to 1.49 Å (24Ingraham L.L. Meyer D.L. Friedman E. Biochemistry of Dioxygen. Plenum Publishing, New York1985Crossref Google Scholar). The hydroperoxy species with a longer O–O distance forms a new hydrogen bond with the Oγ of Thr252. The new hydrogen bond also increases proton affinity of the dioxygen distal oxygen atom. Therefore, the main role of Thr252 is to promote the addition of the second proton to the distal oxygen by accepting a hydrogen bond from the hydroperoxy intermediate. For the D251N mutant, it is clear from kinetic isotope and proton inventory experiments (16Vidakovic M. Sligar S.G. Li H. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9211-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that water-mediated delivery of protons is important in P450cam and that the D251N mutation impaired the delivery of protons. The lack of ordered solvent near the oxygen ligand in the D251N dioxygen complex thus explains why the delivery of protons is so slow. Precisely why replacing Asp251 with Asn leads to such changes in solvent structure is more difficult to explain. Since the two catalytic waters are missing in D251N because the I helix does not open up to the extent found in the WT dioxygen complex, it is logical to conclude that Asp251 is somehow linked to the I helix conformational change required to position Thr252 and catalytic waters properly for dioxygen activation. We hypothesize that one reason for the lack of motion in the I helix in the mutant is due to the strong ion pairing between Asp251 and Lys178 and Arg186 (Fig. 3A). When the peptide of Asp251 flips upon oxygen binding, the strain imposed on the helix is relaxed by movement of the I helix that enables Thr252 to be positioned for interactions with dioxygen. This movement also provides room for the two new water molecules. How the strain energy is dissipated in the I helix is highly restricted, since Asp251 is strongly tied to Lys178 and Arg186. In the D251N mutant, however, these ion pairing interactions are lost, and hence, relaxation of the I helix strain resulting form the oxygen binding induced peptide flip has fewer restrictions. In other words, because the I helix has a larger range of freedom in the mutant, the energetic incentive to open up the helix and disrupt the Thr252 H-bond with Gly248 is lost and the I helix remains closed. Given this scenario, one main role of Asp251 is to provide conformational restrictions that ensures dioxygen binding leads to a repositioning of Thr252 and the entry of the two key water molecules required for dioxgyen activation. It also is possible that Asp251 provides some long range electrostatic effects. For example, theoretical work has shown that the nature of the ligand coordinated to the P450 heme ferric iron is significantly affected by the protein electrostatic environment (25Harris D. Loew G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 8775-8779Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, we mention some related work recently published on the P450eryF dioxygen complex (26Nagano S. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 208: 22102-22107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike P450cam, there is no change in the I helix nor is there any change in solvent structure in going from the ferric to ferrous dioxygen-bound form with the exception of the displacement of one water by dioxygen. Most surprising was the lack of any solvent directly hydrogen-bonded to dioxygen, which lead to a proposed proton delivery network involving a peptide carbonyl oxygen atom rather direct delivery of the proton by water. The corresponding peptide carbonyl oxygen atom in P450cam belongs to Gly248, which is 3.1 Å from the distal oxygen in our WT dioxygen structure (Fig. 4). While the ultimate source of protons for dioxygen activation is solvent, the direct proton donor to dioxygen appears not to be water in P450eryF. Whether or not P450cam uses a similar carbonyl-mediated proton delivery system remains to be seen. However, the present work takes us a step closer to understanding how the highly conserved residues, Thr252 and Asp251, work to promote oxygen activation. First, we propose that role of Thr252 is to stabilize the hdyroperoxy intermediate, which favors addition of the second proton over peroxide release. Since the catalytic waters remain in place in the T252A mutant, electron and proton transfer to dioxygen remain fast as evidenced from the WT levels of NADH consumption (11Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 12Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Without stabilization of the hydroperoxy intermediate by Thr252, however, peroxide release is favored over O–O bond cleavage. Second, the ion pairing between Asp251 and Lys178/Arg186 ensures that relaxation of the I helix when the Asp251 peptide flips upon dioxygen binding results in the proper positioning of Thr252 and the two catalytic waters for dioxygen activation. Because the active site waters are absent proton delivery to dioxygen is slowed, which accounts for the slower proton and NADH consumption by the D251N mutant.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, accounting for an estimated 160,440 deaths in 2004 (1American Cancer Society Surveillance Research Cancer Statistics. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA2004: 4Google Scholar). The vast majority (∼90%) of lung cancer is related to tobacco use (2Carbone D. Am. J. Med. 1992; 93: 13S-17SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the predominant risk factor for this disease. Over the past 30 years, the five-year survival rate of lung cancer patients has improved slightly from 7 to 14%, but there remains a dire need for more effective modalities for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Lung cancer is divided into two major histopathologic classes, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 1The abbreviations used are: NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; PKC, protein kinase C; aPKC, atypical PKC; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; wt, wild-type; kd, kinase-dead; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PARP, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase. 1The abbreviations used are: NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; PKC, protein kinase C; aPKC, atypical PKC; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; wt, wild-type; kd, kinase-dead; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PARP, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase. which are characterized by distinct patterns of genetic and epigenetic changes that likely dictate their distinct biologies and responses to therapy. The vast majority of lung cancer (∼80%) is classified as NSCLC, with most remaining cases (∼18%) being small cell lung cancer (3Schiller J.H. Oncology. 2001; 61: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).NSCLC results from progressive genetic and epigenetic changes often caused by exposure to cigarette smoke or other environmental carcinogens. Ten or more genetic and epigenetic changes are likely required to produce a malignant, invasive NSCLC (4Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 974-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The most common molecular changes in NSCLC include oncogenic mutation of the K-ras gene (∼50%), up-regulation of c-myc (20-30%), mutation of the p53 gene (∼50%), deletion of p16Ink4A/Arf, and mutation of the fragile histidine triad gene (5Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 299-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Salgia R. Skarin A.T. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). NSCLCs frequently exhibit overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2 (Her2/Neu), and/or the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor (Met). These receptors and their ligands (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, and hepatocyte growth factor) are often co-expressed in NSCLC tumors, generating autocrine and/or paracrine signaling loops that stimulate proliferation and survival of NSCLC cells. Signaling through epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2, and Met involves activation of cellular Ras, suggesting that Ras-mediated signaling, activated either through receptor-mediated paracrine/autocrine loops or oncogenic mutation, is central to NSCLC development.The atypical PKC (aPKC) isozymes PKCι and PKCζ have been linked to cellular Ras signaling (7Bjorkoy G.

Furthermore, two downstream effectors of aPKC, Rac1 and NFκB, are required for oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation (14Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

However, essentially nothing is known about whether aPKCs play an important role in human cancers, and if so, which aPKC-mediated signaling pathway(s) are involved. Herein, we have investigated the involvement of atypical PKCζ and PKCι in human NSCLC cell growth and transformation. We find that PKCι is the major aPKC isozyme expressed in human lung cells and that PKCι is overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore, we show that PKCι is required for transformed growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo by activating a Rac1/Pak/Mek/Erk-dependent signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Antibodies were from the following sources and were used at the indicated concentrations: PKCζ, 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-17640); PKCι, 1:4,000 (BD Transduction Laboratories, catalog number P20520); aPKC PB1 domain, 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 727); actin, 1:2000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-1616); the FLAG epitope, 1:2000 (Sigma, catalog number A8592); Rac1, 1:3000 (BD Transduction Laboratories, catalog number 610651); cIAP2, 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-7944); Bcl-XL, 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog number 2762); PARP/cleaved PARP, 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog number 9542); IκBα, 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog number 9242); phospho-(Ser32)-IκBα, 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog number 9241); NFκB p65, 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog number 3034); phospho-(Ser536)-NFκB p65, 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog number 3031); Mek, phospho-(Ser217/221)-Mek, and phospho-(Ser298)-Mek, each at 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog numbers 9122, 9121, and 9128, respectively), Erk and phospho-(Thr202/Tyr204)-Erk, each at 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technologies, catalog numbers 9102 and 9101, respectively); CD31, 1:1,000 (or Pecam-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-1506); BrdUrd, 1:100 (DAKO, catalog number M0744). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining was performed using the TdT-FragEL DNA fragmentation detection kit (Calbiochem, catalog number QIA33). Recombinant human PKCι and PKCζ protein were from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog numbers 14-505 and 14-525, respectively). The myristoylated atypical PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide was from BIOSOURCE (catalog number 77-749).Cell Culture, Plasmids, Transfections, and Drug Treatments—Human A549, ChaGo-K-1, H292, H520, H1299, and SK-MES-1 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines as well as the non-transformed HBE4 lung epithelial cell line were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained as suggested by the supplier. The cells were maintained in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. A549 cells were stably transfected with recombinant pBabe retroviruses containing FLAG-tagged human full-length wild-type PKCι (wtPKCι), kinase-dead PKCι (kdPKCι), or empty vector, as described previously by Lu et al. (22Lu Y. Jamieson L. Brasier A.R. Fields A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4777-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Expression of FLAG epitope-tagged PKCι and total PKCι was analyzed by immunoblot analysis, as described previously by Murray et al. (17Murray N.R. Jamieson L. Yu W. Zhang J. Gokmen-Polar Y. Anastasiadis P.Z. Gatalica Z. Thompson E.A. Fields A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In some experiments, A549 cells were transiently transfected with either empty LZRS retrovirus or recombinant LZRS retrovirus expressing the PB1 domain of PKCι (PKCι amino acids 1-113 (PKCι-(1-113)) to generate A549/LZRS- and A549/PKCι-(1-113) cells, respectively. Expression of PKCι-(1-113) was monitored by immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed to the amino-terminal PB1 domain region of aPKCs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number 727).Adherent growth kinetics of A549 cells transfected with empty pBabe, pBabe/kdPKCι, and pBabe/wtPKCι were determined by plating cells (1 × 104 cells/well) into multiwell culture dishes and monitoring cell growth daily over a 7-day period. Each day, cells from triplicate wells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. In some experiments, A549 cells were maintained in medium containing either 10 or 2% or no fetal bovine serum.Soft Agar Growth Assays—Anchorage-independent growth was assayed by the ability of cells to form colonies in soft agar. The bottom agar consisted of growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.75% agarose in 60-mm tissue culture dishes. Nine-hundred cells were resuspended in growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.75% agarose and plated on top of the bottom agar. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell colonies were visualized and quantified under a dissecting microscope (Olympus) after 4-6 weeks in culture.Rac 1 Activity Assay—Rac1 activity in A549 cell transfectants was assessed by affinity isolation of GTP-bound Rac1 using binding domains of PAK, as described previously (21Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at 4 °C for 5 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes containing 20 μl of glutathione S-transferase-p21 binding domain of PAK1 (PAK1-PBD) coupled to agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology). An aliquot of each supernatant was reserved to determine total Rac1 and actin expression by immunoblot analysis. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Bound proteins were solubilized by the addition of 30 μl of SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis for Rac1. An equivalent aliquot of the total cell lysate was subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine total Rac1 expression.NFκB Signaling and Transcriptional Activity Assays—NFκB transcriptional activity was assayed using a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega), as described previously (22Lu Y. Jamieson L. Brasier A.R. Fields A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4777-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, A549 cells stably expressing kdPKCι or pBabe vector control were transiently transfected with 500 ng of 3xMHCLuc, a plasmid containing three NFκB response elements from the major histocompatibility complex promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene, and 25 ng of phRL-SV40 using the FuGENE 6 lipofection reagent (Roche Applied Science), as described by the manufacturer. Twenty four hours after transfection, NFκB activity was stimulated with 50 ng/ml TNFα (R & D Systems) for 2 h. Total cell extracts were prepared for the dual luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's (Promega) instructions. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity were measured using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Turner BioSystems). The activity of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency.The response of A549/pBabe and A549/kdPKCι cells to TNFα was assessed by treating the cells with 50 ng/ml TNFα for the time indicated in the figure legend. The cells were lysed into lysis buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Total cell lysates (10 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis for IκBα, phospho-(Ser32)-IκBα, NFκB p65, phospho-(Ser536)-NFκB, and actin.Tumorigenicity in Nude Mice—The growth of stably infected A549 human lung carcinoma cells as established subcutaneous tumors was studied in athymic nude mice (Harlan-Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) in a defined pathogen-free environment. Briefly, A549 cell transfectants were grown in nutrient mixture F-12K containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A549 cell transfectants were harvested and resuspended in serum-containing medium. 4-6-week-old female nude mice were injected subcutaneously into the flank with 5 × 106 cells in 100 μl of growth medium. Once palpable tumors were established, tumor size was measured once a week. Tumor growth was quantified by measuring the tumors in three dimensions with calipers. Tumor volume (mm3) was calculated using the formula 0.5236(L × W × H), where L represents the length of the tumor, W represents the width of the tumor, and H represents the height. Animals were individually monitored throughout the experiment. At the conclusion of the study, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg/g 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) 1 h prior to sacrificing the mice by CO2 asphyxiation. Tumors were excised and divided into sections for protein extraction and tumor fixation. Total tumor extracts were prepared in SDS buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 4 m urea, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol), and equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoblot analysis. A section of tumor was also fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 μm thickness), and stained for appropriate antigens.Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were harvested by washing with phosphate-buffered saline and scraping off the plate. The cell pellet was lysed in SDS sample buffer. Protein lysates were quantitated using the nitration of tyrosine in nitric acid (57Bible K.C. Boerner S.A. Kaufmann S.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (∼20 μg) were loaded for each sample, resolved in 12 or 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Immobilin-P). A solution of 5% milk and phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 was used for blocking. (Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 was used for phospho-specific antibodies.)

Because NSCLC is one of the most prevalent and deadliest of human cancers, we assessed the expression of the two atypical PKC isozymes, PKCι and PKCζ, in a panel of human NSCLC cell lines. Each of six human NSCLC cell lines tested (A549, H1299, H292, ChaGoK1, Sk-Mes1, and H520) expressed elevated PKCι compared with non-transformed human HBE4 lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1A), whereas none of the cell lines expressed detectable PKCζ. Thus, PKCι is the major aPKC expressed in non-transformed human lung epithelial cells, and PKCι is overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines.We next assessed the role of PKCι in the transformed phenotype exhibited by NSCLC cells. A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were stably transfected with either wild-type human PKCι (wtPKCι) or a dominant negative, kinase-deficient PKCι mutant (kdPKCι) allele (17Murray N.R. Jamieson L. Yu W.

Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis confirmed expression of recombinant PKCι and elevated total PKCι in A549 cell transfectants (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that the immunoblot exposure in Fig. 1B was chosen to visualize the expression of the transfected PKCι. Interestingly, no significant change in growth rate, saturation density, or survival was observed in any of the cell transfectants grown in adherent culture in 10% serum, 2% serum, or in the absence of serum (Fig. 1C), indicating that PKCι signaling is dispensable for adherent growth and survival of A549 cells in culture. These data also demonstrate that the kdPKCι allele is not cytotoxic to these cells.Despite having no effect on adherent growth or survival, kdPKCι had a dramatic inhibitory effect on the transformed phenotype of A549 cells. A549/pBabe and A549/wtPKCι cells form abundant colonies in soft agar, whereas A549/kdPKCι cells exhibit significantly impaired anchorage-independent growth (Fig. 1D). Therefore, PKCι is necessary for the transformed phenotype of A549 cells. Similar inhibitory effects of kdPKCι on soft agar growth were observed in H1299 and ChaGoK lung cancer cells, indicating that these effects are not specific to A549 cells. 2R. P. Regala and A. P.

We first assessed the involvement of NFκB in PKCι-mediated signaling. NFκB protects NSCLC cells from apoptosis through direct transcriptional activation of the anti-apoptotic genes cIAP2 and Bcl-XL (26Jiang Y. Cui L. Yie T.A. Rom W.N. Cheng H. Tchou-Wong K.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Cheng Q. Lee H.H. Li Y. Parks T.P. Cheng G.

Interestingly, neither wtPKCι nor kdPKCι had an effect on the steady-state levels of cIAP2 or Bcl-XL in A549 cells (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, neither wtPKCι nor kdPKCι induced apoptosis in A549 cells as measured by caspase-mediated cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2B) or trypan blue exclusion viability analysis (data not shown). It is well documented that inhibition of NFκB transcriptional activity in A549 cells induces apoptosis (26Jiang Y. Cui L. Yie T.A. Rom W.N. Cheng H. Tchou-Wong K.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2254-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Fig. 2PKCι does not regulate NFκB signaling in A549 cells.

HeLa cells treated with taxol for either 24 or 48 h served as a positive control for cleaved PARP. C, A549/pBabe and A549/kdPKCι cells were treated with 50 μg/ml TNFα for the indicated times and cell lysates subjected to immunoblot analysis for detection of IκBα, phospho-(Ser32)-IκBα, and actin. D, A549/pBabe and A549/kdPKCι cells were treated with 50 μg/ml TNFα for the indicated times and cell lysates subjected to immunoblot analysis for detection of NFκB p65, phospho-(Ser536)-NFκB, p65, and actin.

Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined the effect of kdPKCι on the ability of A549 cells to activate the NFκB pathway in response to TNFα. Treatment of A549/pBabe and A549/kdPKCι cells with 50 μg/ml TNFα leads to transient phosphorylation of IκBα at the IκK phosphorylation site Ser-32 and a subsequent time-dependent degradation of IκBα protein (Fig. 2C). The extent and time course of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation after TNFα treatment was identical in A549/pBabe and A549/kdPKCι cells. Likewise, TNFα induced time-dependent phosphorylation of NFκB p65 at Ser-536 to the same extent in A549/pBabe and A549/kdPKCι cells (Fig. 2D). Finally, A549 cells exhibited significant basal and TNFα-stimulated NFκB activity that is not affected by expression of kdPKCι (Fig. 2E). Taking these data together, we conclude that PKCι does not regulate basal or TNFα-induced NFκB signaling in A549 cells.Rac1 Is a Downstream Target of PKCι in NSCLC Cell Transformation—We next assessed the role of Rac1 in PKCι-dependent signaling in A549 cells. A549/pBabe cells exhibit significant Rac1 activity, as assessed by the level of GTP-bound Rac1, which is inhibited by the expression of kdPKCι but not wtPKCι (Fig. 3A). These data strongly indicate that PKCι kinase activity is required for Rac1 activation in A549 cells. Treatment of A549 cells with the highly selective, cell-permeant atypical PKC pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor also blocks Rac1 activity (Fig. 3B), confirming the involvement of PKCι activity in Rac1 activation.Fig. 3Rac 1 is a critical downstream target for PKCι signaling in human NSCLC cells. A, A549 cell transfectants were assayed for active GTP-bound Rac1 and for total Rac1 expression. B, active and total Rac1 was assessed in A549/LZRS cells, A549 cells treated with the PKCι-selective pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor (PSI), and A549/PKCι-(1-113) cells. Expression of PKCι-(1-113) was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. C, anchorage-independent growth of A549/LZRS and A549/PKCι-(1-113) cell transfectants in soft agar. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The PB1 Domain of PKCι Is Important for A549 Cell Transformation—PKCι couples to Rac1 through interactions involving the PB1 domain of PKCι (29Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2003; 15: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the PKCι PB1 domain may act as a competitive inhibitor of Rac1 activity in NSCLC cells. Transfection of A549 cells with an LZRS retrovirus expressing the PKCι PB1 domain (PKCι-(1-113)) inhibits Rac1 activity to levels comparable with those observed after treatment with pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Immunoblot analysis confirmed expression of the PKCι (1-113) protein in these cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, expression of PKCι-(1-113) inhibits anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Fig. 3C), indicating the importance of the PB1 domain in PKCι-dependent activation of Rac1 and cellular transformation.The PKCι-Rac1 Signaling Axis Is Required for NSCLC Cell Tumorigenicity in Vivo—We next assessed whether Rac1 is an important downstream effector of PKCι-dependent transformation. Expression of a constitutively active Rac1 allele, RacV12, restores transformed growth of A549/kdPKCι cells in soft agar (Fig. 4A), indicating that Rac1 is critical for PKCι-dependent transformation in vitro. We next assessed the importance of the PKCι-Rac1 signaling axis in A549 cell tumorigenicity in vivo. Athymic nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with A549/pBabe, A549/kdPKCι, or A549/kdPKCι/RacV12 cells, and tumor growth was assessed over time. A549/kdPKCι"

https://openalex.org/W2054030208,"ATP hydrolysis by AAA+ ClpX hexamers powers protein unfolding and translocation during ClpXP degradation. Although ClpX is a homohexamer, positive and negative allosteric interactions partition six potential nucleotide binding sites into three classes with asymmetric properties. Some sites release ATP rapidly, others release ATP slowly, and at least two sites remain nucleotide free. Recognition of the degradation tag of protein substrates requires ATP binding to one set of sites and ATP or ADP binding to a second set of sites, suggesting a mechanism that allows repeated unfolding attempts without substrate release over multiple ATPase cycles. Our results rule out concerted hydrolysis models involving ClpX(6)*ATP(6) or ClpX(6)*ADP(6) and highlight structures of hexameric AAA+ machines with three or four nucleotides as likely functional states. These studies further emphasize commonalities between distant AAA+ family members, including protein and DNA translocases, helicases, motor proteins, clamp loaders, and other ATP-dependent enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1969601086,"Zinc is an essential component for the catalytic activity of numerous zinc-requiring enzymes. However, until recently little has been known about the molecules involved in the pathways required for supplying zinc to these enzymes. We showed recently (Suzuki, T., Ishihara, K., Migaki, H., Matsuura, W., Kohda, A., Okumura, K., Nagao, M., Yamaguchi-Iwai, Y., and Kambe, T. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 637-643) that zinc transporters, ZnT5 and ZnT7, are required for the activation of zinc-requiring enzymes, alkaline phosphatases (ALPs), by transporting zinc into the lumens of the Golgi apparatus and the vesicular compartments where ALPs locate and converting apoALPs to holoALPs. ZnT6 is also located in the vesicular compartments like ZnT5 and ZnT7. However, the functions of ZnT6 and relationships among these three transporters have not been characterized yet. Here, we characterized the cellular function of ZnT6 together with ZnT5 and ZnT7 by gene-targeting studies using DT40 cells. ZnT6-deficient DT40 cells showed low ALP activity, suggesting that ZnT6 is required for the activation of zinc-requiring enzymes like ZnT5 and ZnT7. Combined disruptions of three transporter genes and re-expressions of transgenes revealed that ZnT5 and ZnT6 work in the same pathway, whereas ZnT7 acts alone. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that ZnT5 and ZnT6 formed hetero-oligomers, whereas ZnT7 formed homo-oligomers. Interestingly, the Ser-rich loop in ZnT6, a potential zinc-binding site, was dispensable for the zinc-supplying function of ZnT5/ZnT6 hetero-oligomers, suggesting that the His-rich loop in ZnT5 may be important for zinc binding and that the loop in ZnT6 may acquire another function in the hetero-oligomer formation. These results suggest that two different zinc transport complexes operate to activate ALPs."
https://openalex.org/W2009646097,"We used the combination of preparative electrophoresis and immunological detection to isolate two new proteins from the shell calcitic prisms of Pinna nobilis, the Mediterranean fan mussel. The amino acid composition of these proteins was determined. Both proteins are soluble, intracrystalline, and acidic. The 38-kDa protein is glycosylated; the 17-kDa one is not. Ala, Asx, Thr, and Pro represent the dominant residues of the 38-kDa protein, named calprismin. An N-terminal sequence was obtained from calprismin. This sequence, which comprises a pattern of 4 cysteine residues, is not related to any known protein. The second protein, named caspartin, exhibits an unusual amino acid composition, since Asx constitutes by far the main amino acid residue. Preliminary sequencing surprisingly suggests that the first 75 N-terminal residues are all Asp. Caspartin self-aggregates spontaneously into multimers. In vitro tests show that it inhibits the precipitation of calcium carbonate. Furthermore, it strongly interferes with the growth of calcite crystals. A polyclonal antiserum raised against caspartin was used to localize this protein in the shell by immunogold. The immunolocalization demonstrates that caspartin is distributed within the prisms and makes a continuous film at the interface between the prisms and the surrounding insoluble sheets.

Our finding emphasizes the prominent role of aspartic acid-rich proteins for the building of calcitic prisms among molluscs. The secretion of a shell by molluscs is a striking example of a self-assembling process performed outside living tissues. When a mollusc builds its shell, the calcifying epithelium of its mantle extrudes mineral ions, mainly calcium and bicarbonate. In addition, it secretes an extracellular matrix composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides (1Simkiss K. Wilbur K.M. Biomineralization: Cell Biology and Mineral Deposition. Academic Press, London1989Google Scholar). This mixture is released into the extrapallial space, a microvolume delimited by the epithelium, the growing shell, and the leathery periostracum (2Saleuddin A.S.M. Petit H.P. Saleuddin A.S.M. Wilbur K.M. The Mollusca. 4. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 199-234Crossref Google Scholar). In this supersaturated space, the released macromolecules interact with bicarbonate and calcium to form biocrystallites that self-aggregate in an orderly manner. The end product is a densely packed organomineral assembly, the shell, in which the mineral phase represents more than 95% by weight (3Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). As shell proteins exert a control on the biomineralization process, they can be used in the synthesis of biomimetic materials (4Mann S. Biomineralization: Principles and Concepts in Bioinorganic Material Chemistry. Oxford University Press, London2001Google Scholar, 5Kaplan D.L. Curr. Opin. Solid State Mater.

Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2000: 221-249Google Scholar). However, the resolution of the primary structure of molluscan shell proteins has been seriously impaired for decades by their polydispersity, their polyanionic properties, and finally their post-translational modifications (3Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 7Weiner S. Traub W. Lowenstam H.A. Westbroek P. de Jong E.W. Biomineralization and Biological Metal Accumulation, Biological and Geological Perspectives. D. Reidel Publishing Co., Dordrecht, The Netherlands1983: 205-224Google Scholar). Despite these obstacles, investigations on molluscan shell proteins have made significant advances in the last 6 years, with the characterization of 16 proteins and, for most of them, the identification of the corresponding transcript (8Wilt F.H. Killian C.E. Livingston B.T. Differentiation. 2003; 71: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Marin F. Luquet G. C. R. Palevol. 2004; 3: 469-492Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Among the different shell textures that molluscs use to produce their shell, mother-of-pearl has received the greatest deal of attention. Its intrinsic beauty, its incredible mechanical toughness (10Currey J.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3285-3294PubMed Google Scholar), and its occurrence in the three major mollusc phyla (11Carter J.G. Skeletal Biomineralization: Patterns, Processes and Evolutionary Trends. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1990Google Scholar) have indeed contributed to make it the unique model for molluscan mineralization (3Lowenstam H.A. Weiner S. On Biomineralization. Oxford University Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar, 12Weiner S. Traub W. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1984; 304: 425-434Crossref Google Scholar). The interest for studying nacre has also been driven by its economical importance in the pearl industry (13Tisdell C.A. Poirine B. SPC Pearl Oyster Inform. Bull. 2000; 14: 21-31Google Scholar) and recently by its promising use for promoting bone repair (14Lopez E. Berland S. Le Faou A. Bull. Inst. Océanogr. Monaco. 1995; 14: 49-57Google Scholar, 15Westbroek P. Marin F. Nature. 1998; 392: 861-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As a consequence, most of the molecular information accumulated at present concerns nacre proteins. In contrast, the prismatic texture, that always forms the outer calcified layer of nacreous molluscs, has been studied far less. To our knowledge, only four proteins, including MSI31 and the newly discovered prismalin, aspein, and asprich, have been genetically characterized (16Sudo S. Fujikawa T. Nagakura T. Ohkubo T. Sakaguchi K. Tanaka M. Nakashima K. Takahashi T. Nature. 1997; 387: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 17Suzuki M. Murayama E. Inoue H. Ozaki N. Tohse H. Kogure T. Nagasawa H.

ChemBiochem. 2005; 6: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, only prismalin has been characterized both biochemically and at the transcriptional level, the three other protein sequences being simply deduced from their transcripts. Despite the paucity of molecular data, prismatic biominerals fully deserve attention, because they are widespread among molluscs and because prism-like biominerals are also found in other calcifying systems, such as the egg-shell (20Simkiss K. Carter T.C. Egg Quality: A Study of the Hen's Egg. Oliver & Boyd Ltd., Edinburgh1968: 3-25Google Scholar) and the secondary layer of brachiopods (21Gaspard D. Ann. Paléontol. 1978; 64: 1-25Google Scholar). Thus, prism-like biominerals are often considered to represent an efficient and simple strategy adopted by calcifying metazoans for rapid mineralization. Also, because this layer is believed to represent an archaic type of texture, analysis of the associated matrix components may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of early biomineralization (22Runnegar B. Alcheringa. 1985; 9: 245-257Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23Kouchinsky A. Acta Palaeontol. Pol. 2000; 45: 119-150Google Scholar). Finally, because prisms are large crystals, they represent a good model for studying how molluscs are able to control their mineralization over nanometer to millimeter scales. Like several Pteriomorphid bivalves, Pinna nobilis, the giant Mediterranean fan mussel, exhibits a nacroprismatic organization of its shell. Whereas the nacreous layer is restricted to the first half of the shell, the prismatic layer is fully developed and constitutes the predominant shell layer of this species. It is made of long needles of calcite with a polygonal cross-section. The prisms of Pinna represent the so-called “regular simple prism” type (11Carter J.G. Skeletal Biomineralization: Patterns, Processes and Evolutionary Trends. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1990Google Scholar, 24Taylor J.D. Kennedy W.J. Hall A. Bull. Br. Mus. Nat. Hist. Zool. Suppl. 1969; 3: 1-125Google Scholar, 25Cuif J.P. Denis A. Raguideau A. Haliotis. 1983; 13: 131-141Google Scholar). Among adult specimens, these prisms can be several mm long with a diameter less than 100 μm. Growing inward from the periostracum (2Saleuddin A.S.M. Petit H.P. Saleuddin A.S.M. Wilbur K.M. The Mollusca. 4. Academic Press, Inc., New York1983: 199-234Crossref Google Scholar, 25Cuif J.P. Denis A. Raguideau A. Haliotis. 1983; 13: 131-141Google Scholar), they are kept together by an interprismatic organic honeycomb-like framework, which can be destroyed by sodium hypochlorite (26Cuif J.P. Flamand D. Frérotte B. Chabin A. Raguideau A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) Sér. II. 1987; 304: 475-478Google Scholar). Optically, each isolated prism behaves as a monocrystal (27Cuif J.P. Gautret P. Marin F. Suga S. Nakahara H. Mechanisms and Phylogeny of Mineralization in Biological Systems. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo, Japan1991: 391-395Crossref Google Scholar). However, despite this apparent simplicity, the calcitic prisms of P. nobilis are indeed composed of a stack of numerous crystallites, which have a single optical orientation maintained throughout the length of the prisms. When decalcified, the isolated prisms release a soluble acidic matrix. This matrix is thought to be responsible for the choice of the calcite polymorph and for the guidance and correct positioning of the single crystallites, so that the monocrystal-like units emerge (27Cuif J.P. Gautret P. Marin F. Suga S. Nakahara H. Mechanisms and Phylogeny of Mineralization in Biological Systems. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo, Japan1991: 391-395Crossref Google Scholar). But this matrix has been poorly characterized (26Cuif J.P. Flamand D. Frérotte B. Chabin A. Raguideau A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) Sér. II. 1987; 304: 475-478Google Scholar, 28Marin F. Muyzer G.

The work described herein aims to elucidate the structure of this acidic macromolecular assemblage. The results of this study represent a biochemical characterization of two so-called “intracrystalline” proteins, which we have named caspartin and calprismin. In addition, this report presents the localization of one of these proteins, caspartin, by combining immunogold labeling and scanning electron microscopy. Finally, this report describes the dramatic effect of this protein on the morphology of calcium carbonate crystals grown in vitro. Shell Material—The species used in this study is the protected Mediterranean fan mussel P. nobilis (31European Economic Community Official Journal of the EU. 1992; L206: 0007-0050Google Scholar). Fragments of shells of juvenile and adult specimens were kindly provided by CERAM (Prof. Nardo Vicente) (Marseille, France). Detailed descriptions of the nacroprismatic texture of the shell have been reported (11Carter J.G. Skeletal Biomineralization: Patterns, Processes and Evolutionary Trends. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1990Google Scholar, 24Taylor J.D. Kennedy W.J. Hall A. Bull. Br. Mus. Nat. Hist. Zool. Suppl. 1969; 3: 1-125Google Scholar, 25Cuif J.P. Denis A. Raguideau A.

For direct microscopic observations, cleaned shell fragments or isolated prisms were gold-sputtered with a sputter coater (model 108 Auto; Cressington) and directly observed with a Philips XL30 ESEM-FEG scanning electron microscope (Fig. 1). Shell Preparation and Matrix Extraction—The shell fragments were scrupulously brushed to remove epibionts, and the nacreous layer, when present, was removed by abrasion. Only the prismatic layer was used for subsequent analysis. Fragments of this layer were soaked in sodium hypochlorite solution (0.2 g of active chlorine/100 ml of water) for 12 h, rinsed with water, and dried. Cleaned pieces were briefly crushed into minute fragments, which were subsequently treated with dilute sodium hypochlorite (0.2 g of active chlorine/100 ml of water) for 4 days with constant stirring. This treatment resulted in the complete dissociation of the fragments into prisms, which were collected on a membrane by filtering the suspension (Nalgene filtration assembly). The prisms were then extensively rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried before being crushed. For extraction of the soluble matrix, different batches were used, comprising juvenile or adult specimens. Between 3 and 25 g of the prism powder were suspended in water, to which cold acetic acid (5%, v/v) was added until the pH was 4. Decalcification was performed overnight at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g, and the residual insoluble organic matrix was discarded. The clear supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm), and the volume was reduced to approximately 5 ml by ultrafiltration on an Amicon membrane (YM10; cut-off of 10 kDa) at 4 °C. Complete desalting of the solution was accomplished by dialysis against water at 4 °C for 5 days (Slide-A-Lyzer cassette; Pierce). For some of the batches, this solution was freeze-dried, and the resulting pellet was weighed. Soluble Matrix Analysis on SDS-PAGE and on Immunoblots—For each batch, the solution containing the concentrated acetic acid-soluble matrix was diluted with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. After heat denaturation (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar), small aliquots were tested on 10, 12, or 15% discontinuous polyacrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Mini-Protean 3; Bio-Rad). Most of the gels were directly stained with silver nitrate (33Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Other gels were blotted onto PVDF 2The abbreviations used are: PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TFMS, trifluoromethanesulfonic. Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) with the Mini-Trans Blot module (Bio-Rad) for 90 min at 120 mA (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar, 35Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were blocked with 1% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 30 min and then incubated for 90 min with polyclonal antibodies raised against unfractionated acetic acid-soluble prism and nacre matrices of P. nobilis (28Marin F. Muyzer G. Dauphin Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) Sér. II. 1994; 318: 1653-1659Google Scholar). After washing with TBS/Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit, peroxidase-conjugated antibody (A6154; Sigma) for 90 min. After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with luminase buffer for 2 min (36Leong M.M.L. Milstein C. Pannell R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 1645-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and then briefly exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Large Scale Matrix Fractionation—For each batch, large aliquots of the denatured matrix were fractionated on a preparative SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel (model 491 Prep Cell, 28-mm tube diameter; Bio-Rad) (37Marin F. Pereira L. Westbroek P. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Marin F. Scientific World J. 2003; 3: 342-347Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The gel was run at 250 V for 1 h and then at 300 V overnight in a buffer containing Tris (25 mm), glycine (192 mm), and SDS (0.1%), pH 8.3. The same buffer without SDS was used for eluting protein fractions from the gel. After the elution of the migration front, 80 fractions of 5 ml each were continuously collected overnight (Bio-Rad fraction collector 2110) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Since none of the fractions absorbed UV at 280 nm, an immunological detection of the matrix fractions was performed with the anti-prism and nacre matrix antisera (28Marin F. Muyzer G. Dauphin Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) Sér. II. 1994; 318: 1653-1659Google Scholar, 37Marin F. Pereira L. Westbroek P. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 23: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Aliquots (100 μl each) of the 80 fractions were vacuum-blotted on a PVDF membrane with a dot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad Bio-Dot). The membrane was subsequently treated like a normal Western blot as described above. Following the result of the dot blot, the tubes containing two identified fractions were pooled and concentrated to 4-5 ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon ultrafiltration cell, cut-off of 10 kDa) before being dialyzed for 5 days against Milli-Q water at 4 °C to remove Tris and glycine. The fractions were freeze-dried. The purity of the two fractions was assessed on a mini-SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently stained with silver. Two strong bands of 17 and 38 kDa were observed. Amino Acid Composition and N-terminal Sequencing—The amino acid compositions of the two fractions were determined by Eurosequence bv, Groningen. Freeze-dried proteins were hydrolyzed with 5.7 n HCl in the gas phase for 1.5 h at 150 °C. The analysis of the hydrolysates was performed on an HP 1090 Aminoquant (39Schuster R. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 431: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) by an automated two-step precolumn derivatization with o-phtalaldehyde for primary and FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) for secondary amino acids. Cysteine residues were quantified after pyridylethylation. Tryptophan was not determined. In order to ensure that the samples were not contaminated with free amino acids, in particular glycine, amino acid analyses were also performed without prior hydrolysis. The N-terminal sequencing was performed with a Hewlett-Packard G1006A Protein Sequencer connected in line to a Hewlett-Packard model 1100 high pressure liquid chromatograph. Edman degradation used the Routine 3.1 program, and the sequencing cartridge and most chemicals were obtained from Hewlett-Packard. Ethyl acetate was analyzed by Baker Ultraresi, to which 2.5 μl of tributylphosphine were added per 125 ml. The addition of tributylphosphine substantially improved the yield of the PTH-derivative, especially of lysine. 3R. Amons, unpublished results. During sequencing of calprismin, we observed the appearance of an abnormal PTH-derivative in cycles 12, 19, 33, and 40, between PTH-Gly and PTH-His. It is the position of the PTH-derivative of carboxamidoethylcysteine, which may have formed from acrylamide monomer and reduced cysteine during the preparative acrylamide electrophoresis step (see “Large Scale Matrix Fractionation”). Calcium-binding Assay—The calcium-binding capacity of the acetic acid-soluble matrix and of the two purified proteins was analyzed according to two methods: staining with carbocyanine “ Stains-All” dye (40Campbell K.P. MacLennan D.H. Jorgensen A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the overlay method with 45Ca (41Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the first case, minigels were run, extensively washed with 25% isopropyl alcohol, and stained in the dark for 4 days with 0.0025% Stains-All, 25% isopropyl alcohol, 7.5% formamide, and 30 mm Tris base, pH 8.8. In the second case, denaturing gels were blotted onto PVDF membranes, which were subsequently soaked three times for 20 min each in an overlay buffer (10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.8, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and then incubated in the same buffer containing 45CaCl2 (37 MBq/liter, 1.36 × 10-3 mm). After a brief washing (50% ethanol, twice for 2 min each), the membranes were dried at room temperature and exposed to an x-ray film for 1 week or more. Calmodulin, a calcium-binding protein (catalog number P2277; Sigma), was used as a positive control. To test the effect of Laemmli buffer on the calcium-binding ability of the samples, additional tests were performed. Similar amounts of Laemmli-denatured and nondenatured extracts of soluble matrix and of the 17- and 38-kDa proteins were dot-blotted on a PVDF membrane with a Bio-Dot module (Bio-Rad). The membrane was treated with 45Ca as described above. The test was repeated several times. Glycosylation and Deglycosylation Studies—The search for putative glycosylations of the acetic acid-soluble matrix and of the two isolated proteins was performed according to three different sets of techniques: (a) gel and blot staining, (b) deglycosylation studies, (c) monosaccharide analysis. The first set included staining of the gels with Alcian Blue 8 GX according to the protocol of Wall and Gyi (42Wall R.S. Gyi T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 298-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and staining of gels and of Western blots with PAS (43Devine P.L. Warren J.A. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 492PubMed Google Scholar). Deglycosylation studies were performed according to two procedures: chemical deglycosylation with trimethanesulfonic (TFMS) acid/anisole (44Edge A.S.B. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert L.E. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and enzymatic deglycosylation. In the first case, the removal of sugars was performed at 0 °C for 3 h, under N2, with constant stirring. After neutralization with pyridine, the aqueous phase was extracted three times with diethyl ether and then extensively dialyzed before being lyophilized. In the second case, samples were deglycosylated enzymatically at 37 °C for 3 h, with a mixture containing peptide:N-glycosidase F, O-glycosidase, sialidase, β-galactosidase, and glucosaminidase (CarboRelease Kit, catalog number KE-DG01; QA-Bio, San Mateo, CA). In both cases, fetuin was used as a positive control, and BSA was used as a negative control for the chemical deglycosylation. The TFMS acid-treated and enzyme-treated samples were tested on mini-SDS-PAGE, (10, 12, or 15% acrylamide), which were subsequently stained with silver or blotted on PVDF membranes. The blots were then incubated with the anti-nacre matrix antibody (28Marin F. Muyzer G. Dauphin Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris) Sér. II. 1994; 318: 1653-1659Google Scholar). Furthermore, Alcian Blue staining was assayed on the 38-kDa protein, before and after enzymatic deglycosylation. At last, the soluble matrix and the two purified proteins were assayed for monosaccharides (45Hardy M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) before and after hydrolysis. Lyophilized samples (400-800 μg) were dissolved in water at 1 μg/μl. Aliquots of 100 μl were hydrolyzed in 100 μl of trifluoroacetic acid (4 n) at 105 °C for 4 h. Samples were evaporated to dryness before being solubilized with 100 μl of 20 mm NaOH. The neutral and amino sugar contents of the hydrolysates were determined by high performance anion exchange-pulsed amperometric detection (Dionex) (46Dionex Corp. Technical Note. 40. Sunnyvale, CA1998: 1-6Google Scholar) on a CarboPac PA100 column (Dionex P/N 043055). Data were collected and processed using Chromeleon software (version 6.40). Nonhydrolyzed samples were analyzed similarly, in order to detect free monosaccharides. Blank experiments were performed, where acetic acid solutions had gone through all of the steps of the extraction procedure, to assess possible sugar contamination via filtration and ultrafiltration membranes and dialysis tubing. Note that this technique does not allow the quantification of sialic acids, which are destroyed during hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. In Vitro Inhibition Test with the 17-kDa Protein—The 17-kDa protein was subsequently assayed for in vitro inhibition of calcium carbonate precipitation (47Wheeler A.P. George J.W. Evans C.A. Science. 1981; 212: 1397-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Two ml of 20 mm CaCl2 were rapidly added to 2 ml of 20 mm NaHCO3 containing variable amounts of protein extract (1-10 μg). For each experiment, the pH was constantly recorded with a combined glass electrode (catalog number 6.0234.100; Metrohm) coupled with a Metrohm model 692 pH meter. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. Between each experiment, the electrode was refreshed with 0.5 m HCl. Blank tests were performed in the absence of protein. Positive controls were performed with poly-l-aspartic acid (P-6762; Sigma) and negative controls with BSA. Growth of Calcite Crystals in the Presence of the 17-kDa Protein—The effect of the 17-kDa protein on the morphology of calcite crystals was tested in vitro. Calcite crystals were grown by slow diffusion of ammonium bicarbonate vapors into a CaCl2 solution (48Albeck S. Aizenberg J. Addadi L. Weiner S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11691-11697Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Plastic tips were UV-glued on HCl-cleaned microscope glass coverslips (18 × 18 mm) to allow easy handling with forceps. The coverslips were placed into the wells of a Sterilin 5 × 5 square-well plate (catalog number 638161; Greiner), to which were added 4 ml of 10 mm calcium chloride containing increasing amounts of the shell protein (0.1-4 μg/ml). Negative controls were performed with similar amounts of bovine serum albumin. Blanks were performed without any protein. The plate was closed with a plastic cover, which had been pierced with 1-mm holes, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a closed dessicator containing crystals of ammonium bicarbonate. After incubation, the coverslips were gently dried by capillarity and then by incubation at 50 °C. They were subsequently gold-sputtered and observed with a Philips XL30 ESEM-FEG scanning electron microscope. This test was performed five times. Polyclonal Antibodies against the 17-kDa Protein—An aliquot of the 17-kDa protein was used for the production of polyclonal antibodies in a rabbit (Eurogentec). A standard immunization procedure was performed with injections at 0, 14, 28, and 56 days and bleedings at 0 (preimmune), 38, 66, and 80 days. Sera (second and third bleeding) containing the polyclonal antibodies were used for subsequent experiments. Their respective titer was determined by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (49Clark M.F. Adams A.N. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 34: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (3895) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antiserum for the low molecular weight protein was checked by Western blots on complete acetic acid-soluble prism matrix of P. nobilis. The antiserum was also tested on Western blots against the isolated protein, without or after reduction with β-mercaptoethanol. In addition, the antiserum was tested against poly-l-aspartic acid (P-6762; Sigma) and against the acetic acid-soluble matrix extracted from the nacreous shell layer of P. nobilis. In this latter case, the nacre matrix was extracted with cold dilute acetic acid, in the same way as the prism matrix. The same antiserum was used for determining the concentration of the low molecular weight protein in EDTA extracts of the prisms and of the nacre matrix of P. nobilis. Aliquots of 300 mg of cleaned prisms and of nacre powders were dissolved overnight in 10 ml of 20% (w/v) EDTA. The solutions were centrifuged and filtered, and the supernatants were serially diluted with EDTA and then vacuum-blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Known amounts (100 pg to 100 ng of the 17-kDa protein) were used as a standard. The membrane was incubated with the antiserum and then treated as a normal blot. The test was repeated four times in triplicate. To check the effect of s"

A detailed molecular mechanism for redox regulation of GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing Rho GTPases is proposed. Rho GTPases comprise a large branch of the Ras superfamily of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and include the well characterized family members Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 (1Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). They are involved in regulation of a plethora of cellular processes, including cell morphology, movement, and proliferation (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar).The guanine nucleotide bound state of most Rho GTPase family members is regulated by three distinct types of protein modulatory agents, which alter GTPase activity by regulating cycling of the GTPase between inactive GDP and active GTP-bound forms (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 3Burridge K. Wennerberg K.

In particular, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; XO, xanthine oxidase; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; MS, mass spectrometry; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; 8-DIm-DP, 8-diamino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; 5-DIm-DP, 5-diamino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; AIm-DP, 5-amino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; IIm-DP, 5-imino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; DMm-DP, 5-diamino-4O-2-methyl-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; NHE, normal hydrogen electrode; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; XO, xanthine oxidase; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; MS, mass spectrometry; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; 8-DIm-DP, 8-diamino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; 5-DIm-DP, 5-diamino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; AIm-DP, 5-amino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; IIm-DP, 5-imino-4O-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; DMm-DP, 5-diamino-4O-2-methyl-imidazolone ribose diphosphate; NHE, normal hydrogen electrode; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. facilitate exchange of GDP with GTP to promote GTPase activation, whereas GTPase-activating proteins deactivate the GTPase protein by stimulating hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. Deactivation can also be achieved by association with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which prevent membrane association and GDP dissociation. Similar to Ras GTPases, exchange of GDP for GTP leads to a conformational change in the GTPase that greatly enhances affinity to downstream effectors. The interaction between the GTPase and effector leads to activation of GTPase effector-mediated signal transduction pathways.A fourth distinct type of modulatory agent has been shown to regulate Ras GTPase activity (5Lander H.M.

Similar to the action of GEFs, various redox agents, including both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), have been shown to stimulate Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation in vitro and up-regulate Ras function in vivo. We have recently elucidated the molecular mechanism by which certain redox agents modulate Ras activity (10Heo J. Campbell S.L.

However, it is unclear whether redox agents can act directly on Rho GTPases to modulate their activity or whether modulation of Rho GTPase function occurs indirectly.ROS include the superoxide radical anion ( O2˙-) and hydroxyl radical (OH·). In addition, ROS can be generated or interconverted into other ROS by enzyme- and transition metal-mediated catalytic processes. For example, in the presence of transition metals (i.e. Cu2+ and Fe3+), H2O2 is converted into the redox-active free radical, OH·, by the Fenton reaction (24Wardman P. Candeias L.P. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Moreover, O2˙- can be converted to OH· and H2O2 by superoxide dismutase (25McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6056-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or the transition metal-catalyzed Harber-Weiss reaction (26Khan A.U. Kasha M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12365-12367Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The activity of NADPH oxidase enzyme complexes can be regulated by Rap and Rac GTPases, and upregulation of NADPH oxidase activity leads to the production of O2˙- (27Bokoch G.M. Knaus U.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition, xanthine oxidase (XO), a terminal enzyme of purine catabolism in the cell, catalyzes the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to urate, resulting in reduction of O2 to O2˙- (28Harrison R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). XO is also known to produce H2O2 (29Hodges G.R. Young M.J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RNS include nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (·NO2), and dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) (30Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.C. De Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Reaction of NO with O2 produces ·NO2 and N2O3 (30Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E. Santos C.C. De Menezes S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 841-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) catalyze the oxidation of l-arginine to NO and l-citrulline (31Alderton W.K. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). However, when the substrate l-arginine is not present, NOS produces O2˙- (32Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the overwhelming current interest in NOS as a NO-producing enzyme, several studies have implicated XO in the production of NO (33Godber B.L. Doel J.J. Sapkota G.P. Blake D.R. Stevens C.R. Eisenthal R. Harrison R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7757-7763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite is a precursor of both ROS and RNS, as it is formed by the reaction of NO with O2˙-, which can then be decomposed into ·NO2 and OH· (30Augusto O. Bonini M.G. Amanso A.M. Linares E.

Radio-labeled guanine nucleotides ([3H]GDP and [3H]GTP) were diluted with unlabeled guanine nucleotides prior to use, giving ∼1000 dpm/μm nucleotide. Rac1-(1-177), Rac1 F28L, Rac1 C18S, RhoA-(1-181), and Cdc42-(1-188) proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (34Heo J. Thapar R. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6573-6585Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The final proteins were >95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). XO was purchased from Sigma.Experimental Conditions and Preparation of Redox Agents—All assays and sample preparations were performed in sealed cuvettes and vials to avoid diffusion of volatile redox agents into the open atmosphere (10Heo J. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To prevent transition metal-mediated conversion of the O2˙- radical into H2O2 and OH· (26Khan A.U. Kasha M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12365-12367Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) as well as NO into the nitrosonium ion, all buffers used for kinetic and biochemical assays were passed through a metal-chelating Bio-Rad Chelex 100 cation exchange column (10Heo J. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, 0.1 mm) was added to the buffers prior to performing the experiments, unless otherwise noted. Detailed methods for generation and quantification of O2˙- using XO and a methylene blue-coupled assay system under aerobic conditions have been described previously (12Heo J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NO gas was purified by passing it through a scrubbing column with 5 m KOH, and quantification of NO in the assay solution was achieved by using a hemoglobin-coupled assay under anaerobic conditions (10Heo J. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Authentic ·NO2 was used for ·NO2-mediated Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide dissociation assays, and quantification of ·NO2 in the assay solution was achieved by using the NO2/NO3 assay kit C II (Dojindo) under anaerobic conditions. N2O3 was prepared by mixing NO gas and authentic ·NO2 gas (1:1, mol:mol) under anaerobic conditions. Although the content of N2O3 in the assay solution was not directly determined, the quantity of N2O3 in the assay solution was estimated to be similar to the NO content (i.e. 5 μm NO gas, which is mixed with 5 μm ·NO2 gas) in the assay, based on the assumption that NO reacts with ·NO2 stoichiometrically 1:1. H2O2 was used in the presence and absence of CuCl2 (H2O2/Cu2+) under aerobic conditions. Following the Fenton reaction (24Wardman P. Candeias L.P. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the transition metal, Cu2+, catalyzes conversion of H2O into OH·Kinetic Measurements of Guanine Nucleotide Exchange on Redox-active Rho GTPases—A transition metal-free standard assay solution for the measurements consisted of 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm DTPA in ammonium acetate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.5, in the presence of DTPA to remove transition metals). However, when CuCl2 was added, DTPA was omitted from the assay solution. To mimic cellularly abundant nucleotide concentrations, the standard assay solution contained excess unlabeled GDP (20 mm) for all Rho GTPase GDP dissociation assays. Moreover, the presence of excess unlabeled GDP in the assay solution prevented precipitation of Rho GTPases upon treatment with redox agents (i.e. O2˙- or ·NO2). To monitor O2˙--mediated Rho GTPase GDP dissociation, XO (unit activity: ∼0.5 μm s-1) was incubated with its substrate xanthine (10 mm) for 30 min in the presence of O2 to accumulate O2˙- in solution prior to the addition of 1 μm [3H]GDP-loaded Rho GTPase (e.g. Rac1, Rac1 C18S, Rac1 F28L, RhoA, or Cdc42). To monitor Rho GTPase GDP dissociation by other potential redox agents, NO (∼5 μm) in the absence of O2, H2O2 (0.1% v/v) in the presence of O2, a mixture of H2O2 (0.1% v/v) and CuCl2 (1 μm) in the presence of O, authentic ·NO2 (∼3 μm) in the absence of O2, or a mixture of NO (5 μm) and ·NO2 (5 μm) in the absence of O2 was incubated for 2 min prior to the addition of [3H]GDP-loaded Rho GTPase (1 μm). As a control, the intrinsic GDP dissociation rates of Rho GTPases were also measured using experimental conditions identical to those described above, except that XO or redox agents were not added. To monitor O2˙--mediated Rac1 GTP association, unlabeled GDP-loaded Rac1 (1 μm) and 20 mm [3H]GTP were added simultaneously to the assay solution containing O2˙- (generated by XO assay system; see above). To determine the effect of a radical-quenching agent on Rac1 GTP association, ascorbate (1 mm) was added to the assay mixture at assay time 500 s. As a control, the intrinsic rate of Rac1 GTP association was measured using experimental conditions identical to those described above, except that XO was not added. For all assays including both Rho GTPase GDP dissociation and GTP association, aliquots were withdrawn at specific time points and spotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then washed three times with assay buffer, and radioactivity was determined using a Beckman-Coulter scintillation counter. The resultant radioactivity (dpm) values associated with Rho GTPase-bound [3H]nucleotide (either [3H]GDP or [3H]GTP) were converted into the fraction of mol of nucleotide per mol of total Rho GTPase. The data presented in all figures represent mean and standard error values from triplicate measurements. The rates of redox agent-mediated Rho GTPase GDP dissociation and GTP association were obtained by fitting the data to a simple exponential decay and exponential association, respectively. The regression values associated with the fit were r2 > 0.7595.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Mass spectrometry (MS) sample preparations and analyses of the nucleotide derivatives released from Rho GTPases were identical to those described previously (12Heo J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except the Rac1 and Rac1 variants, C18S and F28L (1 μm, 500 μl), were employed instead of Ras and Ras variants.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRedox-active Rho Subfamily GTPases—We have identified a distinct class of redox-active GTPases conserved in nearly 50% of all Rho subfamily GTPases that contain a cysteine, Cys18 (Rac1 numbering), located at the end of the P-loop (GXXXXGK(S/T), residues 10 to 17, Rac1 numbering). This cysteine-containing P-loop motif will be referred to herein as the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif. For comparison, select members of the Ras subfamily of GTPases such as H-, K-, and N-Ras and Rap1A possess an NKCD motif that forms interactions with the guanine nucleotide base and contains a redox-active cysteine, Cys118 (Ras numbering) (5Lander H.M.

Inspection of the available NMR and x-ray crystal structures for the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing Rho GTPases Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 (36Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) indicates that the Cys18 thiol in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif is solvent-accessible, suggesting that ROS and RNS (e.g. O2˙- and ·NO2, respectively) may be able to target the Cys18 thiol. Consistent with this premise, results shown in Fig. 1A demonstrate that O2˙- facilitates WT Rac1 guanine nucleotide dissociation, whereas the Rac1 C18A variant is insensitive to O2˙- produced from XO. To confirm that O2˙- is the redox species that facilitates Rac1 guanine nucleotide dissociation, bovine liver Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (∼1000 units) was added to the assay system. Superoxide dismutases catalyze the conversion of O2˙- into O2 and H2O2 (39Steinman H.M. Naik V.R. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7326-7338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When bovine liver Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase is present, XO-mediated Rac1 guanine nucleotide dissociation is abolished (not shown), indicating that O2˙-, but not H2O2, generated from XO facilitates Ras guanine nucleotide dissociation. Thus, treatment of Rac1 with O2˙- enhances the intrinsic rate of GDP dissociation by over 600-fold (Table I). Results shown in Fig. 1B indicate that, in addition to Rac1, other GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing GTPases such as RhoA and Cdc42 are also sensitive to O2˙-. These results indicate that Cys18 in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 is a redox-active target site of O2˙-.Table IRho GTPase GDP dissociation rates in the absence and presence of various redox agents The data presented are mean values of experiments performed in triplicate (Fig. 1).

Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Coupling between Cys118 and Phe28 appears critical for redox-mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation (11Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol.

Intriguingly, the Cys18 thiol in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif of Rac1 also faces the Phe28 side chain (Rac1 and Ras numbering are the same) and is only ∼3.6 Å away from the center of the Phe28 side chain (36Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 37Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K.

We have previously proposed a mechanism whereby reaction of either NO/O2 (via ·NO2) or O2˙- with Ras generates a Cys118-thiyl radical (Cys118·), which in turn promotes formation of a guanine radical intermediate resulting in perturbation of Ras guanine nucleotide interactions and accelerated release of GDP as GDP derivatives from Ras (11Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Heo J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We further proposed that Phe28 may act as a conduit between the Ras Cys118· and the guanine nucleotide base to facilitate electron transfer (11Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Heo J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). If the mechanism of redox-mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation of GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing Rho GTPases (see below) is similar to that of Ras GTPases (11Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 1423-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Heo J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), electronic coupling between the Rac1 Cys18-thiyl radical (Cys18·) and the Phe28 side chain is expected, with the Phe28 side chain serving as an electron conduit between the Rac1 Cys18· and the bound GDP guanine base.To evaluate whether Phe28 is involved in redox-mediated regulation of Rho GTPase activity, we determined the rate of O2˙--mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation associated with a Rac1 F28L variant. The Rac1 F28L variant shows a faster intrinsic rate of guanine nucleotide dissociation (Fig. 1A) relative to that of WT Rac1, similar to that observed previously for the Ras F28L mutant (40Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Frech M. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17700-17706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the rate of guanine nucleotide dissociation was not further enhanced in the presence of O2˙-. The Cdc42 F28L variant has been characterized previously by NMR, and results from this study indicate that the structure of Cdc42 is not significantly altered by substitution of leucine for phenylalanine (41Adams P.D. Loh A.P. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9968-9977Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rather, loss of the packing interaction between Phe28 and the guanine nucleotide base alters dynamics of the Cdc42 protein guanine nucleotide-binding site, resulting in reduced guanine nucleotide-binding affinity and enhanced guanine nucleotide dissociation. Given the conservation of this residue and the structural homology between Cdc42 and Rac1 (36Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is anticipated that the Rac1 F28L mutant will share similar nucleotide-binding properties to that of Cdc42.These results support the involvement of Phe28 in O2˙--mediated Rac1 guanine nucleotide dissociation. Moreover, we would also expect that the shorter distance between the Phe28 side chain and the Cys18 thiol contained within the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif will result in more efficient redox coupling and consequently enhanced redox-mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation from GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing GTPases relative to NKCD motif-containing Ras GTPases (10Heo J. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Heo J. Prutzman K.C. Mocanu V. Campbell S.L. J. Mol.

In support of this premise, the rates of O2˙--enhanced GDP dissociation from both Rac1 and Cdc42 (∼6 × 10-3 s-1) (Table I) are at least 2-fold faster compared with that observed for H-Ras (∼3 × 10-3 s-1) (12Heo J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12438-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), yet it is not clear whether the faster rate of redox-mediated guanine nucleotide dissociation of Rac1 and Cdc42 compared with H-Ras observed in vitro has implications for their differential regulation by redox agents in vivo. Unlike Rac1 and Cdc42 (36Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 38Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), RhoA possesses another cysteine (Cys18 RhoA numbering; Lys16 Rac1 numbering) in addition to the redox-active cysteine in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif (37Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although this additional cysteine faces the redox-active Cys18 with a distance of ∼10 Å, it does not face either the Phe28 side chain or the bound GDP guanine base (37Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9656-9666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that this additional cysteine interacts electronically with the redox-active Cys18 and thus reduces the efficiency of redox coupling between Cys18, Phe28, and the Rho GTPase-bound guanine nucleotide base, resulting in a slower rate of O2˙--mediated RhoA guanine nucleotide dissociation compared with that of Rac1 and Cdc42 (Table I).In addition to O2˙-, authentic ·NO2, which can be formed by reaction of NO with O2 (10Heo J. Campbell S.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2314-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), can stimulate dissociation of GDP from Rac1 (Fig. 1C), RhoA, and Cdc42 (Table I). However, Rac1 guanine nucleotide dissociation is not enhanced in the presence of NO alone (in the absence of O2) or a stoichiometric mixture of NO and authentic ·NO2 (to produce N2O3) (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the activity of GXXXXGK(S/T)C motif-containing Rho GTPases is sensitive to ·NO2 and O2˙- but not to NO and N2O3. Furthermore, we show that H2O2 alone (in the absence of a transition metal) does not facilitate Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide dissociation, whereas H2O2 in the presence of a transition metal (H2O2/Cu2+) causes production of OH· (24Wardman P. Candeias L.P. Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), which may facilitate gu"

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an active process accompanied by characteristic morphological and biochemical changes. It can be triggered by stimuli either intrinsic or extrinsic to the cell. An internal stress, such as hypoxia, can activate the intrinsic pathway through the disruption of mitochondria. Extrinsic activation may occur following ligand binding to so-called death receptors. The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are believed to converge on a conserved family of cysteine proteases called caspases. Following receipt of an appropriate apoptotic signal, caspases are cleaved from inactive precursors to active mature forms. The initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8, and -9) are responsible for the activation of the effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7). These effector (or executioner) caspases play critical roles in the cleavage of key structural and regulatory proteins, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, nuclear lamins, DNA fragmentation factor, and spectrin (reviewed in Refs. 1Slee E.A.

For example, keratinocytes, erythrocytes, and skeletal muscle cells all utilize caspases during their differentiation (5Weil M. Raff M.C. Braga V.M. Curr.

In this study, we examined the role of the apoptotic machinery in the degradation of cytoplasmic organelles that occurs during the differentiation of lens fiber cells.Organelle degradation is triggered in cells in the center of the lens during embryonic development and is characterized by the rapid and coordinated disappearance of all membrane-bound organelles including nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus (8Bassnett S.

Ophthalmol. 1966; 75: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Capetanaki Y. Smith S. Heath J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Hamai Y.

Despite the absence of organelles, cells in the lens core retain their structural integrity. Indeed, these are the fully functional cells of the lens and persist throughout the life of an individual. The elimination of organelles from fiber cells in the center of the lens results in the formation of a region termed the organelle-free zone (OFZ; Fig. 1). The OFZ includes initially only the innermost lens fiber cells but, over time, expands, eventually encompassing most of the cells in the lens (13Bassnett S. Beebe D.C. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).At the border of the expanding OFZ, fiber cells undergo a series of morphological and biochemical transformations strongly reminiscent of those that occur during apoptosis. For example, the chromatin in the degenerating lens cell nuclei condenses, nuclear pores cluster, there are concomitant changes in nucleolar structure, and, eventually, TUNEL-positive DNA fragments are produced (14Appleby D.W. Modak S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5579-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Bassnett S. Mataic D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). At the same time, mitochondria fragment, resulting in loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex disintegrate (13Bassnett S. Beebe D.C. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Bassnett S. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Bassnett S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1793-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Many classical endogenous substrates of caspases are also expressed in the lens and undergo proteolysis during lens fiber cell differentiation. Thus, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a DNA repair enzyme cleaved during apoptosis by caspase-3, is progressively cleaved during fiber cell differentiation in the rat lens (19Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Nuclear lamins are well known substrates of the executioner caspases. Differentiating lens fiber cells express lamin A/C and lamin B, and both are degraded during organelle breakdown (15Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Dahm R. Ophthalmic Res. 1999; 31: 163-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Spectrin, an actin-cross-linking protein, is also a caspase-3 substrate and is cleaved at the onset of organelle loss (21Lee A. Morrow J.S. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20735-20742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the treatment of lentoid cultures (small clusters of lens cells expressing fiber cell differentiation markers) with the pancaspase inhibitors t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp-FMK or benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-FMK, prevents the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and reduces the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the cultures (19Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 22Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 in mice or chicken lenses results in the abnormal retention of nuclei in the inner fiber cells (23Fromm L. Overbeek P.A. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Sanders E.J. Parker E. Differentiation. 2003; 71: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because lens cell organelle degradation exhibits so many hall-marks of apoptotic cell death, it has been characterized as “incomplete” or “attenuated” apoptosis (20Dahm R. Ophthalmic Res. 1999; 31: 163-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Schwerk C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Lockshin R.A. Zakeri Z. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2766-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and, while never demonstrated directly, the involvement of caspases in this process is widely presumed.In this study, our aim was to better define the role of the executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) in lens cell differentiation by examining mice in which one or more of these genes was inactivated. Our data did not support the hypothesis that caspases are essential for organelle loss but did reveal a previously unsuspected role in the maintenance of lens transparency.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Wild type mice (C57-BL6; Jackson Laboratory) were killed by CO2 inhalation and decapitation. Eyes were enucleated, and lenses were removed using fine forceps, through an incision in the posterior of the globe. Caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 knock-out mice were generated as described (27Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C.Y. Yong D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 28Leonard J.R. Klocke B.J. D'Sa C. Flavell R.A. Roth K.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp.

Med. 2000; 6: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The phenotype of caspase-3-deficient mice is strain-dependent. In the present study, caspase-3 knock-out animals were backcrossed onto a pure C57BL/6J genetic background. On this background, caspase-3-deficient mice reach adulthood, are fertile, and show minimal brain pathology (28Leonard J.R. Klocke B.J. D'Sa C. Flavell R.A. Roth K.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The clarity of lenses from wild type or knock-out animals was assessed photographically. Lenses were dissected from the eye, placed in pre-warmed tissue culture medium, and photographed against a dark background using a CCD camera (Spot RT, Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) mounted on a dissecting microscope (Stemi-2000C; Zeiss). The procedures described herein were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee.Quantitative RT-PCR—To measure the concentration of specific caspase mRNAs in lens fiber cells, we employed a quantitative RT-PCR technique, essentially as described (31Faulkner-Jones B. Zandy A.J. Bassnett S. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 77: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Lens tissue was obtained from 4-6-month-old mice. The capsule was removed along with the adherent anterior lens epithelium. The remaining fiber mass was collected for RNA extraction. Three samples, each composed of fiber cells from two lenses, were used for RNA isolation. Samples were run in triplicate.RNA Preparation and cDNA Synthesis—RNA was purified from lens samples using RNeasy Protect (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), and residual DNA was removed using DNAfree (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Synthesis of cDNA was performed using Retroscript (Ambion) reverse transcriptase. For each PCR, 16 ng of mouse lens fiber cell cDNA was included.Real Time PCR Analysis—Oligonucleotides for each caspase were designed using Vector NTI Suite 7 (InforMax, Inc., Bethesda, MD) based on published sequences from GenBank™. The following primers were synthesized: 5′-AGCAGCTTTGTGTGTGTGATTCTAA-3′ and 5′-AGTTTCGGCTTTCCAGTCAGAC-3′ for caspase-3; 5′-AGACAAGCTGGACAACGTGACC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGAGCCATTCACAGTTTCT-3′ for caspase-6; and 5′-GGAGGACTATGGTGATTGGAGC-3′ and 5′-TAAGGCGCTGGTGGATATGG-3′ for caspase-7 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). The expected PCR products were 137, 133, and 123 base pairs, respectively. The PCR utilized the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). Reactions were loaded on 96-well thin wall plates and sealed with optical quality sealing tape (Bio-Rad). Each reaction was run on an iCycler iQ Multi-Color Real Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 15 min (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) for 50 cycles, 72 °C for 3 min. In preliminary experiments, PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify that, in each case, a single product was amplified. Products were then sequenced to confirm their identity. Amplified products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and used to create a series of dilution standards for the real time PCR.Antibodies—In preliminary experiments, we noted that commercially available caspase antibodies varied widely in specificity. Consequently, we prescreened a number of antibodies in order to identify reagents that reliably labeled each of the executioner caspases in Western blot or immunofluorescence applications. The screening procedure utilized caspase knock-out mice (as negative controls) and tissue extracted from brain or heart (tissues known to strongly express caspase-3, -6, and -7) of wild type mice as positive controls. Recombinant caspases were used as additional positive controls. In our hands, the following antibodies proved to be specific: anti-caspase-3 (catalog no. 9662; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-caspase-6 (catalog nos. 9762 and 9761S; Cell Signaling), and anti-caspase-7 (RB-1199-PO; Neo-markers, Freemont, CA). Each of these antibodies identified a band of the appropriate size on Western blots prepared from wild type mice. These bands were absent in samples from the corresponding knock-out animals. To visualize the activity of caspase-3, we used an antibody raised against the active form of that enzyme (catalog no. 9661; Cell Signaling). The distribution of endoplasmic reticulum within the lens was mapped by indirect immunofluorescence, using an antibody (diluted 1:500) against protein-disulfide isomerase, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, as described (18Bassnett S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1793-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:500) was used as a secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR).Western Blot—Lenses were dissected carefully from the eyes of P21 mice. The epithelium was removed by grasping the capsule with fine forceps and carefully peeling it away from the underlying fiber cell mass. The epithelial cells remained adherent to the isolated capsule. The fiber cell mass was then divided into two fractions. The outer, “cortical,” fraction consisted of a peripheral layer of fiber cells ∼0.5 mm thick. The remainder of the fiber mass was designated as the “core” sample. Whole lenses, or regionally dissected lenses were immediately homogenized in NuPAGE LDS buffer (Invitrogen) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was assayed colorimetrically (Bio-Rad DC protein assay), and 20 μg of protein were separated on NuPage 12% bis-Tris acrylamide gels (Invitrogen) using MOPS SDS running buffer. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the blot was incubated with caspase antibodies (diluted 1:1000). The primary antibodies were detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) followed by Supersignal chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). The chemiluminescent signal was recorded using a 16-bit CCD gel imaging system (Genegnome, Synoptics Inc., Frederick, MD).Caspase Activity Assays—Executioner caspase activity was quantified using an EnzChek assay kit (Molecular Probes). Freshly dissected whole lenses or regionally dissected lenses were freeze-thawed in 100 μl of lysis buffer. An equal volume of fluorogenic substrate solution (2× reaction buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC or Ac-VEID-AMC peptide) was added to each lens lysate. Lysates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a fluorescence microplate reader (model HTS7000; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Changes in fluorescence were monitored over time, using 360-nm excitation and 465-nm emission filters. The concentration of AMC released was deduced from a standard curve containing the fluorescence values of known concentration of pure AMC. Recombinant active human caspase-3, -6, and -7 were used as positive controls (caspase-3 and -7 from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); caspase 6 from BioVision (Palo Alto, CA)). In some experiments, lenses were treated with 1 μm staurosporine prior to lens lysis (Calbio-chem). Staurosporine was added for 24 h in warm Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium, penicillin/streptomycin, and fungizone (Invitrogen). Samples were compared using a two-tailed paired t test. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Generally, samples prepared from caspase knock-out animals were compared with those from age-matched wild type littermates in assays run concurrently. Results were normalized to the wild type samples.Histology—Lenses were fixed overnight in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissue was dehydrated and embedded in paraffin using an automatic tissue processor. Sections (10 μm thick) were cut in the sagittal plane, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and photographed using a CCD camera (Spot RT; Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) mounted on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss).Immunofluorescence—Lenses were dissected from newborn mice and fixed overnight in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Lenses were embedded in 4% agarose in PBS and sliced into 150-μm sections using a Vibratome tissue processor (Vibratome series 1000 plus; TPI Inc., St. Louis, MO). Lens slices were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS for 30 min, blocked in 10% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 1 h, and incubated in primary antibody (diluted 1:500 in blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C. Slices were washed several times in PBS and then incubated in secondary antibody (diluted 1:500 in blocking solution) for 2 h. Sometimes the secondary antibody solution contained 1 μg/ml propidium iodide to label lens nuclei. After additional washes with PBS, slices were coverslipped and viewed using an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss).RESULTSTo determine which, if any, executioner caspases were expressed in the highly differentiated mouse lens fiber cells, we used a quantitative real time RT-PCR technique (Fig. 2). Fiber cell mRNA from adult mouse lenses was isolated and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Executioner caspase transcripts were amplified using primers specific for caspase-3, -6, or -7. Dilution standards prepared from purified PCR products were run simultaneously with fiber cell preparations, and transcript abundance was calculated from the standard curve dilution series. Transcripts for each of the executioner caspases were present in lens fiber cell cDNA (Fig. 2). Caspase-7 was the most abundant of the three mRNA transcripts, being ∼7-fold more concentrated than the least abundant, caspase-6.Fig. 2Expression profiles of executioner caspase mRNA transcripts in lens fiber cells. The abundance of the executioner caspase transcripts was measured by quantitative real time RT-PCR. The number of transcript molecules in 1 ng of mouse lens fiber cell cDNA was calculated. All three executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) are expressed in lens fiber cells. Transcripts for caspase-3 and -7 are significantly more abundant than caspase-6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next examined whether caspases identified at the mRNA level in the adult mouse lens could also be detected at the protein level. Before attempting this, however, it was necessary to evaluate a number of caspase antibodies, because preliminary experiments suggested that many commercially available antibodies lacked sufficient specificity. We tested whether antibodies were able to recognize the pro-form of each enzyme in brain preparations obtained from wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). We also confirmed that the antibodies recognized the cleaved, activated form of the caspases. As negative controls, we utilized samples prepared from the brains of caspase knock-out animals. Using these criteria, we identified a suitable set of antibodies, and these were used to probe Western blots of lens tissue (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Specific detection of executioner caspase protein in different regions of the lens. A, the specificity of caspase antibodies was evaluated by Western blot using tissue samples from wild type and caspase knock-out animals and recombinant activated caspases. Each antibody recognized both the pro-forms (arrow) and active forms (arrowhead) of the respective caspases. B, Western blot of intact and regionally dissected lenses from P21 mice. Procaspase-7 was detected throughout the lens. Procaspase-6 was only detected in the lens epithelium. Caspase-3 was not detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lysates prepared from regionally dissected 3-week-old mouse lenses were probed using antibodies specific for each of the caspases (Fig. 3B). Procaspase-7 was present at approximately equal concentration in each region of the microdissected lens. The cleaved form of caspase-7, however, was not detected in any of the lens samples. Procaspase-6 was present in the lens epithelium but absent from both the core and cortical fiber samples. The active form of caspase-6 was not observed in the lens. Neither procaspase-3 nor the active form of caspase-3 was detected in mouse lenses of this age. Thus, by Western blot analysis, there was no evidence that the cleaved (active) forms of these caspases were present in the lens. However, proteolytic degradation of organelles is believed to occur in a relatively narrow domain bordering the OFZ. Conceivably, therefore, caspases might be active in this region but remain undetected because the organelle degradation domain might constitute only a minor fraction of the analyzed samples.Lysates prepared from freshly dissected lenses or parts thereof were incubated with appropriate fluorogenic substrates (DEVD-AMC for caspase-3 and -7 and VEID-AMC for caspase-6) and monitored using a microplate reader. We compared the endogenous activity for each executioner caspase in lysates prepared from wild type and caspase knock-out lenses (Fig. 4). Significant levels of VEIDase and DEVDase activity were detected in lens lysates (Fig. 4A). In absolute terms, lens samples contained higher levels of VEIDase activity than DEVDase activity (26.218 ± 2.5772 μm AMC released/lens/h compared with 7.18532 ± 1.6699 μm/lens/h), a difference of almost 4-fold. VEID-AMC is considered a specific substrate for caspase-6 and recombinant active caspase-6 (0.1 units) effectively cleaved the VEID-AMC substrate (Fig. 4B). As expected, treatment with VEID-CHO, an inhibitor of caspase-6, reduced the VEIDase activity of the recombinant protein to near background levels. Lysates prepared from wild type lenses contained substantial VEIDase activity, and this activity was almost completely abolished upon treating the lysates with VEID-CHO (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, however, the VEIDase activity observed in lysates from caspase-6 knock-out lenses was indistinguishable from that measured in wild type samples. This observation suggested that most of the endogenous VEIDase activity present in the lens could not be attributed to the action of caspase-6. Furthermore, treatment of lens lysates from caspase-6 knock-out animals with VEID-CHO completely inhibited VEIDase activity. Thus, mouse lenses contained a potent VEIDase that was inhibited by VEID-CHO but was demonstrably not caspase-6. Furthermore, VEIDase activity was probably not due to another caspase, because it was not inhibitable by the potent pancaspase inhibitors, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-FMK and t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp-FMK (data not shown). A similar, but less dramatic, effect was noted using the caspase-3/7 substrate DEVD-AMC. Lysates prepared from wild type lenses contained a significant amount of DEVDase activity (Fig. 4A). However, comparisons with lysates prepared from caspase-3-/- or caspase-7-/- lenses indicated that most of the DEVDase activity was not attributable to either of those enzymes. Specific caspase activity was expressed as the ratio of DEVDase or VEIDase activity in wild type lenses to that of the corresponding knock-out lenses from age-matched littermates (Fig. 4C). Only for caspase-3 did this ratio differ significantly from 1.0, and, even in that case, specific caspase-3 activity accounted for only 10% of the total DEVDase activity measured in the lens. From these experiments, we can conclude that the lens contains a noncaspase protease (or proteases) with the ability to cleave fluorogenic caspase substrates and that, of the executioner caspases, only caspase-3 is active endogenously.Fig. 4Endogenous executioner caspase activity in the mouse lens. Enzyme activity was measured using a fluorescent assay in lysates prepared from P21 wild type and knock-out lenses (see “Materials and Methods” for details). A, lens lysates contain both DEVDase and VEIDase activity. B, wild type and caspase-6-/- lenses contain similar amounts of VEIDase activity. In either case, VEID-CHO, a peptide inhibitor of caspase-6, effectively blocks the activity. Recombinant caspase-6 and substrate alone (Ac-VEID-AMC) are included as, respectively, positive and negative controls. C, endog"

We previously showed that the Prp19-associated complex is required for stable association of U5 and U6 with the spliceosome after U4 is released. Changes within the spliceosome upon binding of the Prp19-associated complex include remodeling of the U6/5′ splice site interaction and destabilization of Lsm proteins to allow further interaction of U6 with the intron sequence. Here, we further analyzed interactions of U5 and U6 with pre-mRNA at various stages of spliceosome assembly from initial binding of tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex to the activated spliceosome to reveal stepwise changes of interactions. We demonstrate that both U5 and U6 interacted with pre-mRNA in dynamic manners spanning over a large region of U6 and the 5′ exon sequences prior to the activation of the spliceosome. During spliceosome activation, interactions were locked down to small regions, and the Prp19-associated complex was required for defining the specificity of interaction of U5 and U6 with the 5′ splice site to stabilize their association with the spliceosome after U4 is dissociated.

Splicing of precursor mRNA takes place on a large, dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome, which is constituted of five small nuclear RNAs, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and numerous protein components (reviewed in Refs. 1Burge C.B.

These components associate with pre-mRNA in a sequential manner to assemble the spliceosome into a functional complex, which can catalyze the splicing reaction (4Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). During spliceosome assembly, U1 first interacts with the 5′ splice site, followed by association of U2 with the branch site to form a stable complex called the prespliceosome. The preformed U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle; HA, hemagglutinin. is then recruited to the spliceosome to form a complex containing all five small nuclear RNAs. A subsequent structural rearrangement of the spliceosome releases U1 and U4, leading to the activation of the spliceosome. Base pair interactions play important roles in mediating splice site recognition and alignment by snRNPs in the spliceosome (reviewed in Refs. 1Burge C.B. Tuschl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F.

During spliceosome assembly, the 5′ splice site is recognized by U1 in part via base pairing with the 5′-end of U1 RNA (5Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M.

Kretzner L. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2533-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Binding of U2 to the branch site is mediated by base pairing between U2 RNA and the branch site sequence (8Wu J. Manley J.L.

The association of tri-snRNP with the spliceosome appears to also involve RNA-RNA interactions as demonstrated by isolation of cross-linked products of U4 small nuclear RNA to the second residue of the 5′ splice site using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vitro trans-splicing system (10Johnson T.L. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1957-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interactions of U5 and U6 with pre-mRNA in the spliceosome have been extensively studied. U5 interacts with exon sequences at the 5′ and 3′ splice sites through the conserved loop 1 sequence (11Newman A.J. Norman C.

U6 has been demonstrated to be a key element in formation of the catalytic core of the spliceosome by simultaneously base pairing with the 5′ splice site and with the U2 RNA (17Madhani H.D.

Science. 1993; 262: 1982-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Two types of U6/5′ splice site base pairing, differed by a shift of 5 bases, were proposed based on biochemical and genetic analysis, respectively (10Johnson T.L. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1957-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Sawa H. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both types of interaction, as shown in Fig. 1, were later shown to exist but take place at different stages of spliceosome assembly, one after the dissociation of U4 but prior to the binding of the Prp19-associated complex and the other after the spliceosome is activated (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel interaction between the 3′-terminal U-tract of U6 and the intron sequence was also detected that requires prior destabilization of Sm-like proteins (Lsm) in the active spliceosome (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The activation of the spliceosome involves a series of structural rearrangement of snRNPs, including dissociation of U1 and U4 and formation of base pairs between U6 and U2 and between U6 and the 5′ splice site. Factors that mediate such structural rearrangement have not been directly demonstrated, although Brr2 was implicated in the unwinding of U4/U6 and Prp28 in displacing U1 from the 5′ splice site (22Raghunathan P.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), is added to the spliceosome after the dissociation of U1 and U4 during spliceosome activation. NTC is required for stable association of U5 and U6 with the spliceosome after U1 and U4 are released (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). NTC-dependent stabilization of U6 is mediated through remodeling of U6 snRNP, which includes the switch of U6/5′ splice site base pairing, and destabilization of Lsm from U6 to allow the interaction of the 3′ end of U6 with the intron sequence (Fig. 1). How stabilization of U5 is mediated remains to be determined. To gain further insights into the rearrangement of RNA-RNA interactions during the activation of the spliceosome, we examined the interactions of U5 and U6 with pre-mRNA at different stages of spliceosome assembly from their initial binding as tri-snRNP until the spliceosome was activated. We surprisingly found that both types of U6/5′ splice site base pairing previously identified in the spliceosome after U4 dissociation existed in the preactivated spliceosome. Upon U4 dissociation, one of the two forms predominated, depending on whether NTC was present. This suggests that U6 might dynamically interact with the 5′ splice site over a broader region of U6 sequence during the association of tri-snRNP with the spliceosome. Similarly, the interaction between U5 and pre-mRNA also spanned a large region of the 5′ exon upon binding of tri-snRNP and post-U4 dissociation and became better defined only after the binding of NTC. We suggest that the association of tri-snRNP with the spliceosome involves dynamic interactions between U5 and U6 with pre-mRNA, and NTC plays a role in determining a stable form of base pairing between U6 and the 5′ splice site and defining specific interactions between U5 and pre-mRNA to stabilize the association of U5 and U6 with the spliceosome after U4 is released, leading to the activation of the spliceosome. Yeast Strains—The following yeast strains were used: BJ2168 (MATa prc1 prb1 pep4 leu2 trp1 ura3), YSCC1 (MATa prc1 prb1 pep4 leu2 trp1 ura3 PRP19-HA), and YSCC43 (MATa prc1 prb1 pep4 leu2 trp1 ura3 PRP4-3HA). Oligonucleotides—The following oligonucleotides were used for directed RNase H cleavage and primer extension: U5-A, GTTCTTGATGTTGACCT; U5-B, CCATGTTCGTTATAAGTTCT; U5-C, ACCCGGATGGTTCTGG; U5-D, ACAGCTTTACCTGTTTC; U5-E, TGGCAAGCCCACAGTA; U6-B, CCTATCCTTATGCAGGG; Pre-I, CAGAATCCATTGTTAATT; Pre-II, TCTTACAGTTAAATGGGATGG; Pre-III, CAATTGGGACCGTGCAATTCT; Pre-VI, TTTCGATCTTGGGAAG; Pre-VII, AAGCAGTAAGCGTGAA; Pre-VIII, CTAAAAGGGGGATCC. The following 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides (Qiagen) were used for affinity selection: U5-Cbio, BioTEG-ACCCGGATGGTTCTGG; U6-Abio, BioTEG-TCTCTTTGTAAAACGG; Pre-IVbio, BioTEG-GGAGGTTATGGGAGAGTG. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-HA antibody 8G5F is a monoclonal antibody produced by immunizing mice with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide of the HA epitope. Anti-Ntc85, anti-Ntc20, and anti-Smd1 are polyclonal antibodies produced by immunizing rabbits with the corresponding recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Streptavidin-Sepharose was purchased from Sigma, protein A-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences, proteinase K from MD Bio Inc., RNase H from Promega, and SuperScript II from Invitrogen. Splicing Extracts, Substrates, and Reactions—Splicing extracts were prepared according to Cheng et al. (29Cheng S.-C. Newman A. Lin R.-J. McFarland G.D. Abelson J.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using yeast strain BJ2168, YSCC1, or YSCC43. A truncated form of actin pre-mRNA, Ac/Cla, in which only 5 nucleotides were retained after the branch point was used in this experiment. Splicing substrates were prepared by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase of plasmid pSPAct6-88 linearized with ClaI. Splicing reactions were performed as described by Lin et al. (30Lin R.-J. Newman A.J. Cheng S.-C. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14780-14792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a large scale. Depletion of NTC—PRP19-HA extracts from strain YSCC1 were used for depletion of NTC with the anti-HA antibody 8G5F. Each 1 ml of the splicing extract was incubated with 3 μg of 8G5F conjugated to a 0.5-ml bed volume of protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation to remove the bound material, the supernatant was used as the NTC-depleted extract. UV Cross-linking, RNase H Mapping, and Primer Extension—For UV cross-linking, each 2 ml of the splicing reaction mixture was precipitated with the anti-Smd1 antibody (400 μl of serum coupled to a 500-μl bed volume of protein A-Sepharose). The bound material was resuspended in 4 ml of Buffer E (12 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 30 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.12 mm EDTA, and 12% (v/v) glycerol) and distributed into two wells of a 6-well culture plate. The plate was placed on ice 10 cm underneath the UV254 lamp in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene Inc.) and irradiated at an energy level of 0.125 J. After deproteinization, RNA was precipitated and resuspended in 79 μl of H2O and then mixed with 10 μl of E. coli tRNA (10 mg/ml), 10 μl of Buffer S (0.2 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, and 0.5 m KCl) and 1 μl of desired 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide U5-Cbio, U6-Abio, or Pre-IVbio at 300 μm. The mixture was boiled for 2 min, slow cooled to room temperature, and precipitated with a 50-μl bed volume of streptavidin-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitate was heated for 2 min to release the selected RNAs, which were fractionated on a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. Individual cross-linked products were excised from gels and eluted. Following precipitation, the amount of RNA was estimated by counting in a scintillation counter (LS6500; Beckman Coulter). For RNase H digestion, 0.015-0.03 fmol of cross-linked RNA dissolved in 4 μl of H2O was mixed with 1 μl of 30 μm desired oligonucleotide, 1 μl of 10 mg/ml tRNA, 1 μl of Buffer S; heated on a hot plate for 2 min; and chilled on ice. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min following the addition of 1 μl of 0.1 m MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of diluted RNase H (0.5 unit/μl). For primer extension, 0.075-0.15 fmol of cross-linked RNA and 105 cpm of 5′-radiolabeled oligonucleotide was mixed in a 5-μl annealing mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 75 mm KCl, heated on a hot plate for 2 min, and immediately transferred to a 45 °C water bath and then mixed with a 5-μl prewarmed reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each of four dNTPs, 30 units of RNasin, and 50 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. Dynamic Interactions of U6 with the 5′ Splice Site in the Preactivated Spliceosome—We previously demonstrated that two different modes of base pairing between U6 and the 5′ splice site can form in the spliceosome, one being NTC-dependent and the other NTC-independent (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We proposed that these base pairings occur at different stages of the spliceosome assembly process after the dissociation of U4 and that NTC might play a role in mediating the base-pairing switch (Fig. 1). To determine whether NTC-independent pairing occurs even before the dissociation of U4, we analyzed the interaction of U6 and the 5′ splice site in the preactivated spliceosome by UV cross-linking. It has been demonstrated that the U4-containing spliceosome can be arrested and accumulated if the splicing reaction is carried out at lower concentrations of ATP (31Tarn W.-Y. Lee K.-R. Cheng S.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that U4 was in the base-paired form with U6, presumably in the di-snRNP or tri-snRNP complex, under such conditions when RNA isolated from the spliceosome was analyzed on nondenaturing gels (lane 3). Therefore, using extracts prepared from a strain in which the U4 snRNP protein Prp4 was tagged with the HA epitope, the U4-containing spliceosome could be isolated by performing the splicing reaction at low ATP concentrations, followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody. To block splicing catalysis after activation of the spliceosome, actin pre-mRNA Ac/Cla, truncated 5 bases after the branch point (32Cheng S.-C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1548-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was used in this experiment as in our previous analysis (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The isolated spliceosome was irradiated with UV light at 254 nm, and pre-mRNA cross-linked to U6 was selected with a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide complementary to U6 RNA and analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For comparison, splicing reactions were also carried out at high concentrations of ATP in either wild-type or NTC-depleted extracts, and total spliceosome or the active spliceosome was isolated by immunoprecipitation with the anti-Smd1 antibody or with the anti-Ntc85 antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, the U6-cross-linked products X1 and X2 appeared in the spliceosome formed at a high concentration of ATP (lanes 1-3) as reported previously (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). X1, appearing only in the active spliceosome, contains cross-links between the Lsm binding site of U6 and the intron sequence in a region ∼30 bases downstream from the 5′ splice site (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). X2a and X2b are cross-linked products between the 5′ splice site and U6 in a region near the conserved ACAGA box (10Johnson T.L. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1957-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). X2a, previously identified as dX2, accumulated in the spliceosome formed in NTC-depleted extracts (lane 2). X2b, which also appears only in the active spliceosome (lanes 1 and 3), was not seen in the spliceosome formed in NTC-depleted extracts (lane 2). These results led us to propose that during spliceosome activation, base pairing represented by X2a forms immediately after dissociation of U4 and switches to the form represented by X2b upon binding of NTC. When splicing was carried out at a low concentration of ATP in Prp4-HA-tagged extracts and the spliceosome was precipitated with the anti-HA antibody, X1 was not seen as expected. Surprisingly, both X2a and X2b were detected (lane 4), indicating that either type of base pairing could form in the preactivated spliceosome. Primer extension analysis confirmed that X2a and X2b from the preactivated spliceosome were cross-linking at similar positions as X2a and X2b isolated from the spliceosome formed at a high concentration of ATP. As shown in Fig. 2C, a mixture of similar extension stops of X2a and X2b from the preactivated spliceosome was seen, except that X2b had more heterogeneous stops between C43 and U46 of U6 (lane 10) than those isolated from the active spliceosome, in which a stop at A44 predominated (lane 9). A cross-link to G39 observed in both X1 and X2, speculated to be cross-linking to a certain spliceosomal protein component in an NTC-dependent manner (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), was not detected in the preactivated spliceosome (lane 10), further supporting the requirement of NTC for this cross-linking. The presence of both X2a and X2b in the preactivated spliceosome was better revealed when comparing spliceosomes formed at various ATP concentrations, as shown in Fig. 3. Splicing at lower concentrations of ATP accumulates more prespliceosome and preactivated spliceosome, whereas at higher ATP concentrations it forms more activated spliceosome. In wild-type extracts, both X2a and X2b were present at lower concentrations of ATP (lanes 1 and 2). Increasing ATP concentrations resulted in decreasing amounts of X2a, accompanied by an accumulation of X2b and X1 (lanes 3-5). In NTC-depleted extracts, both X2a and X2b were also seen at lower ATP concentrations (lanes 6-8). In contrast, X2a accumulated with the disappearance of X2b at higher ATP concentrations (lanes 9 and 10). Thus, both X2a and X2b forms of base pairing formed independently of NTC at lower ATP concentrations, suggesting dynamic interactions of U6 with the 5′ splice site between the two modes of base pairing in early stages of spliceosome assembly. Higher ATP concentrations drove the dissociation of U4, accumulating the X2b form in the presence of NTC, while accumulating the X2a-form in the absence of NTC. These results suggest that, instead of mediating the switch between two different base-pairing modes, NTC is likely to play a role in stabilizing the X2b base pairing between U6 and the 5′ splice site for formation of the active spliceosome. Dynamic Interactions of U5 with Pre-mRNA in the Preactivated Spliceosome—Since stable association of U5 with the spliceosome after the release of U4 also requires NTC (21Chan S.-P. Kao D.-I. Tsai W.-Y. Cheng S.-C. Science. 2003; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), it is possible that U5 might also interact with pre-mRNA in different forms in the presence or absence of NTC. The interaction between U5 and pre-mRNA was investigated by UV cross-linking in a similar way to the aforementioned experiment of U6, and the cross-linked products were selected with a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide complementary to U5 RNA. Fig. 4A shows two major (Y1 and Y3) and two minor (Y2 and Y4) U5-specific cross-linked products identified from total spliceosome formed in wild-type extracts when precipitated with the anti-Smd1 antibody (lane 1). Only Y1 and Y3 were detected in the active spliceosome when precipitated with the anti-Ntc85 antibody (lane 3). In NTC-depleted extracts, Y2 and Y4 became more prominent with a dramatic decrease in the relative amounts of Y1 and Y3. Furthermore, Y1 appeared to be a more heterogeneous mixture of different products (lane 2). Interestingly, all four products were also detected in the preactivated spliceosome (lane 4), indicating that all of these interactions between U5 and the pre-mRNA occurred prior to the release of U4. The generation of the U5-cross-linked products was compared in wild-type and NTC-depleted extracts by performing the splicing reaction at various ATP concentrations (Fig. 4B). The relative amounts of these products from wild-type and NTC-depleted extracts were similar at lower ATP concentrations, when more preactivated spliceosome accumulated (lanes 1, 2, 6, and 7). At higher ATP concentrations that promoted the dissociation of U4, Y2 and Y4 species accumulated in larger amounts at the expense of Y1 and Y3 in NTC-depleted extracts but not in wild-type extracts. In addition, Y1 became more discrete in wild-type extracts (lanes 3-5) but more heterogeneous in NTC-depleted extracts (lanes 8-10). These results indicate that there are multiple forms of U5 interaction, with pre-mRNA occurring early in spliceosome assembly. Upon dissociation of U4, the interaction becomes more specific in the presence of NTC. To elucidate the modes of interaction between U5 and pre-mRNA, the cross-linking sites of individual cross-linked products, affinity-selected and gel-purified, were mapped by RNase H digestion with oligonucleotides complementary to different regions of U5 or actin pre-mRNA. Fig. 5A shows the relative position of the oligonucleotides used to the pre-mRNA. Each oligonucleotide directed the cleavage of the 32P-labeled pre-mRNA into two fragments, indicated as R and L, representing fragments on the right side and the left side of the oligonucleotide, respectively. Within each pair of fragments produced from cross-linked products, the one containing the cross-link will have slower mobility with respect to its cognate uncross-linked species. Judging whether the right or left fragment is up-shifted allows one to locate the cross-link between specific oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 5B, the cross-linking sites of Y1 and Y3 isolated from the spliceosome formed in wild-type extracts were mapped between oligonucleotides I and II of the pre-mRNA in the 5′ splice site region, since the right-sided fragments from oligonucleotides I, VI, VII, and VIII were up-shifted, whereas the left-sided fragment from oligonucleotide II was up-shifted. Y1 and Y3 showed identical digestion patterns, except that the cross-link-containing fragments from Y1 migrated slower than those from Y3, suggesting that they were cross-linked at the same positions of the pre-mRNA to the long form and short form of U5 (U5L and U5S), respectively (see below). Y1 and Y3 isolated from the spliceosome formed in NTC-depleted extracts had identical mapping pattern to those from wild-type extracts (data not shown). The cross-linking sites of Y2 and Y4 isolated from the spliceosome formed in NTC-depleted extracts were mapped to a region upstream of oligonucleotide VII (lanes 21-30), since none of the right-sided fragments were shifted, and Y2 and Y4 were possibly cross-linked pre-mRNA to U5L and U5S at the same positions, respectively. Y2 showed a mixture of digestion pattern of Y2 and Y3 due to close mobility of these two cross-linked products. Y2 and Y4 isolated from the spliceosome formed in wild-type extracts had identical patterns to those from NTC-depleted extracts (data not shown). Since U5 has not been shown to interact with the pre-mRNA in any region other than the 5′ splice site prior to catalytic steps, it was surprising to find cross-linking of Y2 and Y4 near the 5′-end of the pre-mRNA. RNase H mapping with oligonucleotide VIII further upstream revealed that the cross-linking sites were located in the region between oligonucleotides VII and VIII. As also shown in Fig. 5C the large, right-sided fragment VIIIR was up-shifted (lanes 5 and 8), excluding the possibility of cross-linking at the very 5′-end of the pre-mRNA. A change of the sequence in the 5′ exon revealed that such interaction occurred in a region 50-60 bases upstream of the 5′ splice site with no sequence specificity (data not shown). These results suggest that besides the previously observed interactions between the conserved loop and the 5′ splice junction, U5 also interacts with the 5′ exon of pre-mRNA in a region far upstream from the 5′ splice site upon its binding to the spliceosome and that this interaction persisted after the dissociation of U4 if NTC was absent. In the presence of NTC, this interaction was not accumulated as the spliceosome progressed to the active form. Precise cross-linking sites on Y1 and Y3 were determined by primer extension analysis using primer Pre-II. Y1 and Y3 were purified from the spliceosome isolated from various sources for primer extension analysis. Total spliceosome was formed in wild-type and NTC-depleted extracts and precipitated with the anti-Smd1 antibody. The active spliceosome was formed in wild-type extracts and precipitated by the anti-Ntc20 antib"

Previous work from several laboratories has indicated that O-fucosylation plays an important role in ligand mediated Notch activation. Nonetheless, it is not clear whether all, or a subset, of the EGF repeats need to be O-fucosylated. Three O-fucose sites are invariantly conserved in all Notch homologues with 36 EGF repeats (within EGF repeats 12, 26, and 27). To investigate which O-fucose sites on Notch1 are important for ligand-mediated signaling, we mutated the three invariant O-fucose sites in mouse Notch1, along with several less highly conserved sites, and evaluated their ability to transduce Jagged1- and Delta1-mediated signaling in a cell-based assay. Our analysis revealed that mutation of any of the three invariant O-fucose sites resulted in significant changes in both Delta1 and Jagged1 mediated signaling, but mutations in less highly conserved sites had no detectable effect. Interestingly, mutation of each invariant site gave a distinct effect on Notch function. Mutation of the O-fucose site in EGF repeat 12 resulted in loss of Delta1 and Jagged1 signaling, while mutation of the O-fucose site in EGF repeat 26 resulted in hyperactivation of both Delta1 and Jagged1 signaling. Mutation of the O-fucose site in EGF repeat 27 resulted in faulty trafficking of the Notch receptor to the cell surface and a decreased S1 processing of the receptor.

Notch becomes activated upon binding of its extracellular domain to its ligands, members of the Delta and Serrate/Jagged families, which are present on the surface of apposed cells. The extracellular domain of Notch contains 36 tandem epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) 3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor-like; O-FucT-1, O-fucosyltransferase-1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPAEC, high pH anion exchange chromatography; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; RFA, relative-fold activation.3The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor-like; O-FucT-1, O-fucosyltransferase-1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPAEC, high pH anion exchange chromatography; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; RFA, relative-fold activation. repeats many of which contain consensus sequences for modification by O-fucose (6Shao L.

Some of the O-fucose moieties on EGF repeats of Notch can be further elongated by the action of Fringe, a fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H.

Work from several laboratories has established that protein O-fucosyltransferase-1 (O-FucT-1), which catalyzes O-fucosylation of EGF repeats, is essential for Notch function. Experiments carried out in mice and Drosophila have demonstrated that deletion or reduction in levels of O-FucT-1 results in embryonic lethality and, more importantly, that the phenotypes observed are consistent with those observed due to loss of Notch signaling (15Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 16Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several studies have demonstrated that lack of O-fucose alters the interaction of Notch with its ligands (17Sasamura T. Sasaki N. Miyashita F. Nakao S. Ishikawa H.O. Ito M. Kitagawa M. Harigaya K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). With regard to specific O-fucose sites, a previous study revealed that Drosophila Notch bearing a mutation of a highly conserved O-fucose site within EGF repeat 12 is still able to support neurogenesis while showing defects in wing development (19Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This mutant also demonstrated increases in both Delta and Serrate binding to Notch in in vitro binding assays. This effect was specific to the EGF repeat 12 mutant, as mutation of other O-fucose sites did not result in changes in Notch activity. The role of individual O-fucose sites in mammalian Notch signaling has not yet been established. The recent demonstration that O-FucT-1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum where it could function in quality control or possibly even as a molecular chaperone raises the possibility that specific O-fucose sites may be necessary for the processing and maturation of the Notch receptor (20Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 21Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, evaluation of the role of O-fucose at various sites is essential to dissect the mechanism by which these sugars affect Notch function. Notch contains multiple sites for O-fucose modification scattered throughout its EGF repeats. An important clue in evaluating which sites are most important for the regulation of Notch is their degree of conservation (Fig. 1) (7Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Three sites, found in EGF repeats 12, 26, and 27, are invariantly conserved in all known Notch homologues with 36 EGF repeats. In this work, we have sought to determine the role these three O-fucose sites in mouse Notch1 by analyzing the effects of mutation on ligand-mediated signaling, S1 processing, and cellsurface expression. As well, we have analyzed less highly conserved O-fucose sites scattered throughout the extracellular domain. This analysis has revealed that mutation of two highly conserved O-fucose sites results in altered ligand-mediated Notch signaling and in a third site alteration of the processing of the Notch receptor. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A full-length construct of mouse Notch1 where with C-terminal PEST domain is replaced by six tandem MYC epitopes in pCS2+ (a kind gift of Dr. Raphael Kopan, Washington University School of Medicine) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All glycosylation sites (T) were mutated to A. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the site mutant. Revertant mutations were generated from constructs bearing site mutants to ensure that no inadvertent mutations were introduced during the mutagenesis reaction. Cell Lines—COS-7 cells or COS-7 cells stably transfected with empty vector (pCDNA4) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented 10% bovine calf serum and 250 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). L-cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. L-cells stably expressing rat Jagged1 and rat Delta1 (Dl-19) (generously provided by Dr. Gerry Weinmaster) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Co-culture Assay—These assays were adapted from previously described co-culture assays (11Hicks C. Johnston S.H. DiSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (1 × 106) stably transfected with empty vector (pCDNA4) were plated in a 10-cm tissue culture dish and the next day transiently transfected with 12.8 μg of wild type or mutant Notch1-pCS2+, 2.98 μg of TP-1 luciferase reporter construct (Ga981-6, a kind gift of Dr. Georg Bornkamm, Munich, Germany), and 1.49 μgofgWIZ β-galactosidase construct (Gene Therapy Systems) to normalize transfection efficiency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's specifications. Four hours after transfection, Lipofectamine reagent was removed, and cells were allowed to recover in fresh DMEM for 1.5 h. L-cells (1.0 × 105) or L-cells expressing Jagged1 or Delta1 were then plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate. Co-culture was established by overlaying L-cells with the transfected COS-7 cells (7.5 × 104). After 42.5 h of co-culture, cell lysates were prepared in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (28Nofziger D. Miyamoto A. Lyons K.M. Weinmaster G. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1689-1702PubMed Google Scholar). Each co-culture was performed in triplicate, and co-cultures resulting in significant changes as compared with co-culture of wild type Notch were performed at least twice. Metabolic Labeling—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pSecTag2 (Invitrogen) constructs encoding EGF repeats 11–15, 26, or 27 of mouse Notch1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The production of the EGF repeat 11–15 and 26 constructs have been described previously (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The EGF repeat 27 construct was produced by amplifying EGF repeat 27 from full-length Notch1 template using primers: 5′-GCTAAAGCTTCGGATGTCAATGAGTGTGAT and 3′-CGATCTCGAGTCACAAGGTTCTGGCAG. The products were digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into pSecTag2 and sequenced. Following transfection, cells were incubated with 20 μCi/ml [6-3H]fucose for 48 h. Proteins were purified from media, and O-glycans were released by alkali-induced β-elimination and analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography as described previously (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 29Moloney D.J. Lin A.I.

Determination of Percent Fucitol—Saccharide species obtained from gel-filtration chromatography were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac evaporator (Savant). Samples were then hydrolyzed for 2 h in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C. The hydrolysates were dried in a SpeedVac, resuspended in water, and dried again to ensure complete removal of acid. Samples were then analyzed by high pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Dionex DX300 using an MA-1 column (Dionex) as described previously (30Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with internal standards (1 nmol each of fucitol, fucose, and glucose) prior to injection. Fractions (0.5 min) were collected, and radioactivity corresponding to fucose and fucitol peaks was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of radioactivity corresponding to fucitol in each sample was determined by dividing cpms in fucitol by the total cpms in both fucitol and fucose. These percentages were then used to calculate the amount of O-fucose in each pooled peak by multiplying the total cpm in the peak by the percent fucitol. Cell-surface Biotinylation—COS-7 cells (5 × 105) were plated in a 35-mm tissue culture dish and transfected the next day with 4 μg of wild type or mutant Notch1-pCS2+ using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen) and then incubated with 2.5 mm EZ-link sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) or with HBSS (as a control) two times for 10 min each time. The biotinylation reagent was then removed, and cells were incubated with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 15 min to quench the biotinylation reaction. Cells were lysed in 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. ImmunoPure avidin-agarose (25 μl) (Pierce) was added to 100 μl of lysate and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The avidin-agarose was pelleted by brief centrifugation and the lysate removed. Avidin-agarose was washed three times with RIPA buffer and then boiled in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Avidin-bound biotinylated and non-biotinylated samples along with their respective lysates were then run on a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected using a mouse anti-myc epitope antibody (generously provided by Dr. Jen-Chih Hsieh, Stony Brook University). Cadherin expression was determined by blotting samples with mouse anti-Pan cadherin antibody (Sigma). A mouse anti-β-actin antibody (Abcam) was used to analyze β-actin expression. A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody. Quantification of immunoblots was performed using NIH image software. S1 Cleavage Analysis—COS-7 cells (5 × 105) were plated in a 35-mm tissue culture dish and transfected the next day with 0.5 μg of wild type or mutant Notch1-pCS2+ plus 3.5 μg of empty vector (pCS2+) using Lipofectamine 2000. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were washed three times in HBSS and then lysed in 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and a proteosome inhibitor (50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-al) (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. A portion (10 μl) of each sample was then resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with mouse anti-myc epitope antibody (generously provided by Dr. Jen-Chih Hsieh, Stony Brook University). To exclude the possibility that the S1 processing was influenced by the amount of DNA transfected, variable amounts of DNA (0.5–4 μg) were used in transfection and S1-processing evaluated. While there was an increase in the amount of S1-cleaved Notch, there was no detectable change in the proportion of cleaved versus uncleaved Notch1 in either the wild type or mutant samples (data not shown). Mutation of Conserved O-Fucose Sites Results in Changes in Delta1- and Jagged1-mediated Notch1 Signaling—To evaluate the effects of individual O-fucose site mutants on the ability of Notch1 to signal via Delta and Jagged ligands, a previously reported cell signaling system (11Hicks C. Johnston S.H. DiSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) was adapted for use in COS-7 cells. In this system, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding mouse Notch1 along with a luciferase reporter and a β-galactosidase reporter (for normalization of transfection efficiency). The Notch1-expressing COS-7 cells were then co-cultured with L-cells or L-cells stably expressing Delta1 or Jagged1 ligand. The cells were subsequently lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase were assayed to determine relative-fold activation as described previously (11Hicks C. Johnston S.H. DiSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Co-culture of Notch1-expressing COS-7 cells with either Delta1- or Jagged1-expressing L-cells resulted in a statistically significant increase in relative-fold activation (RFA) when compared with co-culture with L-cells expressing no ligand (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, in contrast to what has been observed using the same assay system in other cells (11Hicks C. Johnston S.H. DiSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 14Yang L.T. Nichols J.T. Yao C. Manilay J.O. Robey E.A. Weinmaster G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 927-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the activation of Notch1 in COS-7 cells by Delta1-expressing L-cells was greater than that from the Jagged1-expressing cells. This suggests the COS-7 cells may express an endogenous Fringe homologue (see below). Co-culture of control COS-7 cells (transfected with empty vector, pCS2+) and ligand-expressing L-cells resulted in a slight increase over controls, presumably due to activation of endogenous Notch in COS-7 cells. Thus, activation of exogenous mouse Notch1 by both Delta1 and Jagged1 can be assayed using the COS-7 cell system. To examine which of the O-fucose sites on mouse Notch1 are important for mediating Delta1 and/or Jagged1 activation, glycosylation site mutants were prepared (T to A). Haines and Irvine (7Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) showed that the O-fucose sites found in the extracellular domain of Notch are conserved to varying degrees (7Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Based on their analysis, we mutated the sites that are conserved in all Notch homologues (EGF repeats 12, 26, and 27). In addition, O-fucose sites with lesser degrees of conservation in various regions of the extracellular domain were similarly mutated (EGF repeats 9, 16, 20, 24, and 30, see Fig. 1). Notch1 constructs bearing each of these mutations were then used in the COS-7 cell co-culture assay, in parallel with a co-culture assay of the wild type Notch1 construct, as described above. Analysis of the relative activation in this assay revealed that mutation of the O-fucose sites in EGF repeats 12 and 27 resulted in a nearly complete loss in Jagged1 (Fig. 3A)- and Delta1 (Fig. 3B)-mediated Notch1 signaling when compared with wild type. In contrast, mutation in the O-fucose site of EGF 26 resulted in a 4-fold increase in Jagged1-mediated signaling (Fig. 3A) and a 2-fold increase in Delta1-mediated signaling (Fig. 3B). The O-fucose site mutations in EGF repeats 9, 16, 20, 24, and 30 did not result in any significant changes with either Jagged1 or Delta1. Thus, mutation of the most highly conserved O-fucose sites resulted in significant changes in both Delta1- or Jagged1-mediated Notch1 activation, while single mutants at other sites had no apparent effect. To confirm that the observed effects on Notch1 signaling were due to mutation of O-fucose sites (and not to inadvertent mutations introduced by the PCR-mediated mutagenesis), revertant mutations, which restored the threonine residue at the site of O-fucosylation, were generated in Notch constructs bearing mutations in EGF repeats 12, 26, and 27. These revertant mutations effectively restored Delta- and Jagged-mediated signaling to wild type levels (Fig. 3C). O-Fucose on EGF Repeats 26 and 27 Is Elongated by Endogenous Fringe—The fact that Delta1 activates Notch1 to a greater extent than Jagged1 in the COS-7 cell system suggests that COS-7 cells contain endogenous Fringe. In most contexts, Fringe stimulates activation of Notch1 from Delta1 while inhibiting activation from Jagged1 (11Hicks C. Johnston S.H. DiSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 14Yang L.T. Nichols J.T. Yao C. Manilay J.O. Robey E.A. Weinmaster G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 927-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To examine whether any of the Fringes are modifying O-fucose on EGF repeats 12, 26, or 27, we examined the structure of the O-glycans on these EGF repeats. Although methods for analyzing O-fucose structures at individual glycosylation sites in the context of the native protein have not yet been developed, we have previously shown that individual EGF repeats encode determinants required for Fringe modification (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus analysis of the state of elongation of O-fucose on smaller fragments of the Notch1 extracellular domain (or individual EGF repeats) can be used to approximate Fringe modification at specific sites in the context of the entire Notch molecule. To investigate whether endogenous Fringe modifies O-fucose on EGF repeats 12, 26, or 27, plasmids encoding these EGF repeats were transfected into COS-7 cells. The cells were metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]fucose, the proteins were purified, the O-fucose glycans were released from the protein by alkali-induced β-elimination, and the released saccharides were analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 4). In the case of both EGF repeats 26 and 27, significant elongation of the monosaccharide to di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide species is observed (Fig. 4, B–D). This indicates that COS-7 cells contain an endogenous Fringe activity. Immunoblot analysis shows the presence of Lunatic fringe in extracts of COS-7 cells, indicating the presence of at least one endogenous Fringe (data not shown). This is consistent with the higher level of Delta1 than Jagged1 activation seen in Fig. 2 and suggests that Fringe modification at EGF repeats 26 and 27 may contribute to this effect. Importantly, this also raises the possibility that the effects observed in the co-culture assay with regard to the mutations at EGF repeats 26 and 27 (Fig. 3) may in part be attributable to Fringe modulation of Notch signaling. In contrast EGF repeat 12 is modified almost exclusively by O-fucose monosaccharide (Fig. 4, A and D), suggesting that this site is a poorer substrate for Fringe than EGF repeats 26 and 27. Similar results were obtained in analysis of the glycosylation of EGF repeat 12 in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, which also express endogenous Lunatic fringe (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the effects of the mutation at EGF repeat 12 in the co-culture assay (Fig. 3) are mediated largely by loss of the O-fucose monosaccharide. Mutation of O-Fucose Site in EGF Repeat 27 Results in a Reduction of Cell-surface Expression and S1 Cleavage of Notch1—The variations in Delta1- and Jagged1-mediated Notch1 signaling observed in the co-culture assays may be attributable to changes in the cell-surface expression of the mutated Notch1 proteins. To assess this possibility, COS-7 cells were transfected with either wild type Notch1 or Notch1 bearing O-fucose site mutants in EGF repeats 12, 26, or 27. Cell-surface biotinylation was then carried out, followed by streptavidin precipitation (Fig. 5A). Controls with a cell-surface protein (cadherin) and a cytoplasmic protein (β-actin) were performed with each sample to demonstrate the efficacy of the biotinylation procedure. A ratio of cell-surface Notch1 to cell-surface cadherin was performed to normalize for any differences in sample loading. This analysis showed that Notch1 bearing O-fucose site mutations in either EGF repeats 12 or 26 were expressed on the cell surface similar to wild type. In contrast, there was decreased cell-surface expression of Notch bearing an O-fucose mutation in EGF repeat 27 compared with wild type. Thus, mutation of the O-fucose site in EGF repeat 27 results in reduced cell-surface expression of the Notch protein. Notch is cleaved by a furin-like convertase in the Golgi, which is required for efficient translocation to the cell surface (22Blaumueller C.M. Qi H.L. Zagouras P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1997; 90: 281-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Loss of multiple O-fucose sites in mouse Notch3 results in defective S1 cleavage (23Arboleda-Velasquez J.F. Rampal R. Fung E. Darland D.C. Liu M. Martinez M.C. Donahue C.P. Navarro-Gonzalez M.F. Libby P. D'Amore P.A. Aikawa M. Haltiwanger R.S. Kosik K.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of O-fucose site mutations on Notch1 processing, COS-7 cells were transfected with wild type Notch1 or Notch1 bearing mutations at EGF repeats 12, 26, or 27. The cells were lysed and examined by immunoblot analysis. S1-processing of Notch1 bearing a mutation in EGF repeat 12 was similar to wild type, while that with a mutation in EGF repeat 26 showed a slight decrease in efficiency (Fig. 5B). However, the mutation in EGF repeat 27 caused a significant reduction in S1-cleaved Notch1. Thus, mutation of the O-fucose site at EGF repeat 27 results in decreased in S1-mediated processing and subsequent cell-surface expression of the Notch protein. These results provide an explanation for the reduction in Notch1 signaling caused by the mutation in EGF repeat 27. In this work we have sought to determine the role of highly conserved O-fucose sites on mouse Notch1. Mutation of any of the three invariant sites across species, located in EGF repeats 12, 26, and 27, resulted in changes in both Delta1- and Jagged1-mediated Notch1 signaling. In contrast, there was no detectable effect of mutation of less conserved O-fucose sites. Interestingly, the mutations in each of the highly conserved sites resulted in a distinct effect on Notch1. The mutation at EGF repeat 12 caused a decrease in Notch signaling, that at EGF repeat 26 caused an increase in Notch signaling, and that at EGF repeat 27 caused a decrease in S1 processing and cell-surface expression resulting in decreased Notch signaling. In addition, the O-fucose moieties at both EGF repeats 26 and 27 are elongated by endogenous Fringe in COS-7 cells, while that at EGF repeat 12 remains mainly a monosaccharide. This suggests that the effect of the mutation at EGF repeat 12 is due mainly to the loss of the monosaccharide form of O-fucose, while the mutations at EGF repeats 26 and 27 may be due to the loss of elongated forms. The mutation in EGF repeat 12 resulted in loss of activation by both Delta1 and Jagged1 but no change in S1 processing or cell-surface expression. The fact that it proceeds through endoplasmic reticulum quality control checkpoints and is properly processed suggests that the EGF repeat 12 mutation does not cause a global folding defect. EGF repeats 11 and 12 have been identified as necessary and sufficient for ligand interactions (see Fig. 1) (24Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) suggesting that the signaling effects observed in the EGF repeat 12 mutant are mediated by direct effects on Notch-ligand interactions. Nonetheless, several other studies have suggested that the O-fucose on EGF repeat 12 is not essential for ligand binding but may instead be modulatory. For instance, a recent report demonstrated that bacterially expressed (and therefore unfucosylated) fragment containing EGF repeats 11–13 from mouse Notch1 can bind to cells expressing Delta1 in a calcium dependent fashion, although the EGF 11–13 fragment needed to be aggregated on streptavidin to obtain significant binding activity (25Hambleton S.

Similarly, Lei et al. (19Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealed that Notch bearing a mutation in the O-fucose glycosylation site at EGF 12 still functions during neurogenesis (Delta-mediated Notch signaling) in Drosophila. This same mutation results in alterations of Delta and Serrate binding and shows changes in Notch activation in developing wing discs. Taken together, these studies seem to suggest that the cellular context greatly affects the importance of O-fucose on EGF 12. Presence or absence of O-fucose on EGF repeat 12 appears to modulate Notch-ligand interactions, but it does not appear to be essential in all contexts (e.g. Delta-mediated activation of Notch during neurogenesis in Drosophila). The specific context in which Notch exists, with respect to ligands, Fringe, and other modulators of Notch activity, appear to affect the relative importance of the O-fucose at this site. The fact that mutation of the O-fucose site on EGF repeat 12 has such a profound effect on Notch activation in COS-7 cells suggests that these cells do not have mechanisms to compensate for this loss. The mutation in EGF repeat 26 results in an increase in Notch activation by both ligands: a 2-fold increase in Delta1-mediated signaling and a 4-fold increase in Jagged1 signaling. The hyperactivation caused by this mutation does not correlate with alterations in processing or cell-surface expression, but it is reminiscent of the Abruptex mutations. These are gain-of-function point mutations in Drosophila Notch, which cluster in EGF repeats 24–29 (Fig. 1). The Abruptex region of Notch is thought to act as a negative regulatory domain possibly mediated through cell-autonomous inhibition by ligands (26De Celis J.F. Bray S.J. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that mutation of the O-fucose site in EGF repeat 26 in some manner mimics the effect of Abruptex mutations. Additionally, it has been observed that Abruptex mutations are refractory to Fringe in Drosophila, suggesting that the Abruptex mutations may induce a change in Notch similar to that induced by Fringe. Fringe modifies O-fucose residues in the Abruptex region (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the O-fucose modification on EGF repeat 26 may in fact function as a site for Fringe to negatively regulate Notch activation. Loss of O-fucose at this site, and as a consequence, loss of the ability of Fringe to modify EGF repeat 26, may prevent negative regulation of Notch signaling by Fringe, thus resulting in a hyperactivatable form of the receptor. Hambleton et al. (25Hambleton S. Valeyev N.V. Muranyi A. Knott V. Werner J.M. McMichael A.J. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2173-2183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) have proposed that the majority of the EGF repeats in the Notch extracellular domain are fairly rigid, due to the presence of calcium-binding motifs between EGF repeats. Interestingly, EGF repeats 26, 28 and 29 (overlapping the Abruptex region) do not contain calcium-binding motifs and are thus predicted to be more flexible (see Fig. 1 (25Hambleton S. Valeyev N.V. Muranyi A. Knott V. Werner J.M. McMichael A.J. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 2173-2183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the conformation of Notch may be altered by the extent of elongation on O-fucose moieties at this specific location (Fig. 6). The fact that the O-fucose glycans on both EGF repeats 26 and 27 are elongated supports this idea. Thus, we propose that the change in Notch activation caused by mutation at EGF repeat 26 may be caused by a change in the overall conformation of the extracellular domain. Mutation of the O-fucose in EGF repeat 27 results in a significant reduction in both Delta1- and Jagged1-mediated Notch1 activation that is most likely due to a reduction in S1 processing. It is possible that this highly conserved O-fucose site serves as a “regulatory checkpoint” for further processing of the Notch protein. Since EGF repeat 27 lies in the putative flexible region of Notch (Fig. 6), alteration of its glycosylation state could alter the overall conformation of Notch, and this could affect the ability of the furin-like convertase to process Notch. Indeed, this would not be the first example of glycosylation altering the processing of a protein. Processing of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is regulated by differential glycosylation (27May P. Bock H.H. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37386-37392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that loss of the O-fucose site in EGF repeat 27 causes retention of the Notch protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutation of O-fucose sites has been observed to result in a decrease in the secretion of Drosophila Notch fragments or S1 processing of Notch3, suggesting that they are trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (20Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Arboleda-Velasquez J.F. Rampal R. Fung E. Darland D.C. Liu M. Martinez M.C. Donahue C.P.

The finding that mutation of highly conserved O-fucose sites affects Notch processing and signaling supports the idea that O-fucosylation of individual sites is important for Notch function. Surprisingly, there appears to be heterogeneity in the roles of these highly conserved O-fucose sites. This may in part be explained by the fact some of these sites may also be important for Fringe regulation of Notch signaling. Indeed, our data suggests that the effects observed from the O-fucose on EGF repeat 26 might be most readily attributable to an alteration in the Fringe effect. In contrast, the effects of the O-fucose on EGF repeat 12 appear to be mediated mainly by the monosaccharide form of O-fucose. Interestingly, the O-fucose on EGF repeat 12 is mainly in the monosaccharide form in both CHO (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and COS-7 (Fig. 4) cells, even though both cells express endogenous Lunatic fringe. In contrast, O-fucose on EGF repeat 26 is significantly elongated in both cell types. Overexpression of Lunatic or Manic fringe in CHO cells results in significant increases in O-fucose elongation at EGF repeat 12 (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and loss of Jagged1-dependent activation (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L.

S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, cells expressing low levels of Fringe (e.g. Cos-7 or CHO) preferentially modify EGF repeats 26 and 27 and have an intermediate effect on Delta1 activation and Jagged1 inhibition (see “Moderate Fringe”, Fig. 6). Increased expression of Fringe causes O-fucose elongation at EGF repeat 12 and further inhibition of Jagged1-dependent activation (see “High Fringe”, Fig. 6). This suggests that EGF repeat 12 may play a key role in the ability of Fringe to fully inhibit Serrate/Jagged-dependent signaling. This is consistent with the results reported by Lei et al. (19Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using the EGF repeat 12 mutant in Drosophila wing discs. Determination of the Fringe effect at specific sites and determination of the glycosylation effect on the overall conformation of the Notch extracellular domain are needed for further clarification of the roles of these O-fucosylation sites. Identification of specific amino acids within an EGF repeat necessary for recognition by Fringe will allow us to generate mutations that allow O-fucosylation but prevent Fringe elongation at a particular EGF repeat. This will allow us to differentiate between the effects of O-fucose monosaccharide and the elongated tetrasaccharide at a particular site (e.g. EGF repeat 26).

Post-translational modification of the α subunit of HIF determines its half-life and activity. Among the multiple reported modifications, acetylation, by an acetyltransferase termed arrest-defective-1 protein (ARD1), has been reported to decrease HIF-1α stability and therefore impact on hypoxic gene expression. In contrast, we report that both overexpression and silencing of ARD1 had no impact on the stability of HIF-1α or -2α and that cells silenced for ARD1 maintained hypoxic nuclear localization of HIF-1α. In addition, we show that the ARD1 mRNA and protein levels are not regulated by hypoxia in several human tumor cell lines, including cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells, fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, adenovirus-transformed human kidney HEK293 cells, and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Using two model systems ((a) wild-type and HIF-1α-null mouse embryo fibroblasts and (b) HeLa cells silenced for HIF-1α or -2α by RNA interference), we demonstrate that the level of expression of the ARD1 protein is independent of HIF-1α and -2α. We also demonstrate that ARD1 is a stable, predominantly cytoplasmic protein expressed in a broad range of tissues, tumor cell lines, and endothelial cells.

A strong relationship between hypoxia, angiogenesis, and tumor progression is emerging (1Hockel M. Vaupel P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ARD1, arrest-defective-1 protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain protein; SIMA, similar; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ARD1, arrest-defective-1 protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain protein; SIMA, similar; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcription. is the key player in the hypoxic response of cells by regulating the expression of a myriad of genes including those that control angiogenesis and neovascularization, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (2Manalo D.J.

Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The stability and, thus, activity of HIF-1α is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications, in particular hydroxylation and phosphorylation (4Brahimi-Horn C. Mazure N. Pouyssegur J. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation by prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHD) has been shown to mediate degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosomal system, and our group showed previously that the PHD2 isoform is a key oxygen sensor in determining HIF-1α stability (5Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The expression of this isoform was induced under hypoxia, thus suggesting the existence of feedback regulation. It has also been reported that the instability of HIF-1α is enhanced by its acetylation, by an acetyltransferase termed arrest-defective-1 protein (ARD1), and that ARD1 expression is repressed in hypoxia (6Jeong J.W. Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). We were interested in investigating further the contribution on the function of HIF that this post-translational modification had under different conditions but were surprised to find that ARD1, in contrast to PHD2, had no impact on HIF-1α stability and was not hypoxia- or HIF-α-dependent.ARD1 was first described in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Whiteway M. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1985; 43: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and yeast mutants for ARD1 were shown to be defective in the mitotic cell cycle. The human and mouse homologs have also been designated TE2 (Swiss-Prot; P41227 and Q9QY36, respectively). Based on amino acid alignment, ARD1 has been assigned to the GNAT (GCN5-related N-terminal acetyltransferase) family, of which there are over 50 members, and it possesses a conserved (Q/R)XXGX(G/A) acetyl-CoA binding motif (8Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), which is also conserved from yeasts to humans. ARD1 was found to interact with HIF-1α in a two-hybrid assay using a Gal4-HIF-1α-oxygen-dependent degradation domain vector as bait (6Jeong J.W. Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The expressed HIF protein contains a domain, called the oxygen-dependent degradation domain, which is implicated in the regulation of the half-life of the three isoforms of HIF-α. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis showed in vitro acetylation of lysine 532 on a recombinant oxygen-dependent degradation domain fragment of HIF-1α when incubated in the presence of recombinant ARD1 (6Jeong J.W. Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Acetylated HIF-1α was detected in cell lysates, and mutation of the lysine 532 to arginine resulted in increased stability of overexpressed HIF-1α as also observed previously (9Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Artificial maintenance of the acetylated state of HIF-1α with butyric acid, a global inhibitor of deacetylases, resulted in increased degradation of HIF-1α and correlated with an antiangiogenic effect, consistent with diminished levels of HIF-1α protein (10Kim M.S. Kwon H.J. Lee Y.M. Baek J.H. Jang J.E. Lee S.W. Moon E.J. Kim H.S. Lee S.K. Chung H.Y. Kim C.W. Kim K.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the antiangiogenic properties of berberine, an alkaloid component of an herbal Chinese medicine, result from an increase in the acetylation of HIF-1α (11Lin S. Tsai S.C. Lee C.C. Wang B.W. Liou J.Y. Shyu K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 612-619PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylation of HIF-1α was reported to destabilize HIF-1α protein by enhancing its interaction with a von Hippel-Lindau protein-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (6Jeong J.W. Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Unlike the PHDs, the activity of acetyltransferases is not known to be dependent on the oxygen concentration. It would therefore be expected that ARD1 could acetylate HIF-1α in both normoxia and hypoxia. Less acetylated HIF-1α was detected in hypoxia in comparison with that observed when HIF-1α was stabilized by incubation of HT1080 cells in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, in normoxia (6Jeong J.W. Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The explanation for this was that hypoxia down-regulates ARD1 mRNA and protein. However, a recent publication reports comparable normoxic and hypoxic levels of ARD1 mRNA in HepG2 cells (12Fisher T.S. Etages S.D. Hayes L. Crimin K. Li B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17749-17757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The latter authors also report that the activation of HIF-regulated downstream genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin is not influenced by ARD1, thereby suggesting that ARD1 has little effect on HIF-1.In the present study, we show that ARD1 overexpression or silencing has no impact on HIF-1α and -2α protein stability. We go on to clarify the normoxic versus hypoxic regulation of the expression of ARD1 by showing that neither the mRNA nor the protein levels of ARD1 are regulated by either short term or long term hypoxia in several cell types. We also show for the first time that ARD1 expression is independent of HIF-1α and -2α. In addition, we show convincingly that ARD1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and that its silencing does not modify nuclear transfer of hypoxia-stabilized HIF-1α. We also show that the ARD1 protein is expressed in a broad range of tissues, tumor cell lines, and endothelial cells of different species and that it has a relatively long half-life.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Antibodies, and Plasmids—HeLa, HEK293, and HT1080 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (4.5 g/liter glucose) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin (50 units/ml) plus streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). DLD-1, LS 174T, and MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (HIF-1α+/+) and (HIF-1α-/-) were cultured in DMEM with 10% inactivated FCS and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). These cells were derived from wild-type and HIF-1α-null mouse embryos as described previously (13Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar). Renal clear cell carcinoma cells (RCC4) were cultured in 50% DMEM, 50% F10 (Invitrogen) containing 10% inactivated FCS. Bovine aorta endothelial cells were grown in DMEM (1 g/liter glucose) with 5% FCS, porcine aorta endothelial cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured as previously described (14Vouret-Craviari V. Bourcier C. Boulter E. van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila melanogaster S2 Schneider cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) and cultured at 28 °C. Cells were incubated under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1.2% O2) conditions for the indicated times. Hypoxic treatment was performed in an anaerobic work station (Ruskinn Technology, Biotrace International Plc). For the determination of the half-life of ARD1, cells were incubated with or without cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 15, 24, 48, and 72 h. The effect of 200 μm CoCl2 (Sigma) on ARD1 expression was monitored for the indicated times.A polyclonal antibody to ARD1 was obtained after injection into rabbits of a peptide to the last 20 C-terminal amino acids of the human ARD1 sequence. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to a C-terminal peptide of HIF-1α, to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of Paip2, and to ERK2 were also prepared in the laboratory (15Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G.

Commercial antibodies included rabbit anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-α-tubulin (Zymed Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-IgG horseradish-labeled (Promega), rabbit anti-HIF-2α (Novus), and rabbit anti-IgG horseradish-labeled (Promega).The pSF424-(TE2) mammalian expression vector, kindly provided by Dr. Li-Jung Juan, contains the full-length cDNA of human ARD1 with a FLAG tag on its N-terminal end and is referred to here as pFLAG-ARD1. The cDNA of human ARD1 (NM_003491) was obtained from pSF424-(TE2) using the TaqPCR Master Mix kit (Qiagen) with the following primers: ARD-forward, 5′-CGG GGT ACC GCC GCC ACC ATG AAC ATC CGC AAT GCG-3′ and ARD-reverse, 5′-CTA GTC GAC GGA TCT AGA GGA GGC TGA G-3′ (Eurogentec). The ARD-forward primer introduces a KpnI site for cloning purposes and the Kozak consensus sequence upstream of the initiation codon of ARD1. The ARD-reverse primer abolishes the ARD1 stop codon by the introduction of an XbaI site, which was used for subsequent cloning. The cDNA was inserted into the KpnI and XbaI sites of pcDNA4™/TO/myc-His A (Invitrogen) that contains the inserted myc-His tag (MycARD1). All plasmid DNAs were prepared using a Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Transfections of pFLAG-ARD1, pcDNA3, pcDNA4, or MycARD1 were performed using the calcium phosphate technique, and cell lysis, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting of samples was performed as described below.Semiquantitative RT-PCR—The mRNA levels of ARD1, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and 36B4 were examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Cells were incubated either in normoxia or hypoxia for the indicated times, and the experiment was terminated by simultaneous lysis of all samples. Cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated using the standard phenol/choloroform/isopropyl alcohol method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA was performed using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). Two independent sets of primers were used to amplify ARD1: set 1 forward primer 5′-AAG CTT GCC ATG GAC TAC AAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGT TGG TAT GGC TGA TTA TGA TCA-3′. The ARD1 set 2 primers have been published previously (19Chun Y.S. Lee K.H. Choi E. Bae S.Y. Yeo E.J. Huang L.E. Kim M.S. Park J.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8700-8707PubMed Google Scholar). The primers for HIF-1α were as follows: forward, 5′-ACA AGT CAC CAC AGG ACA G-3′; reverse, 5′-AGG GAG AAA ATCA AGT CG-3′. Primers for HIF-2α were as follows: forward, 5′-GTC ACC AGA ACT TGT GC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAA AGA TGC TGT TCA TGG-3′. Primers for 36B4, used as a control, were forward primer 5′-GGC GAC CTG GAA GTC CAA CT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCA TCA GCA CCA CAG CCT TC-3′. Semiquantitative PCR on cDNA products was performed using the following parameters for the ARD1 primer sets in a Biometra T3 Thermocycler: predenaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, elongation at 72 °C for 40 s, for 22 cycles, and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. PCR of an equal volume of cDNA was also performed in a similar manner for the reference mRNA, 36B4, except that only 18 cycles were performed. The ARD1 PCR products were loaded on 3% agarose gels, after volume calibration using the 36B4 reference mRNA PCR product. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and examined with an ImageMaster VDS (Amersham Biosciences) Gel images were quantified using the GeneGenome chemiluminescent imaging system and GeneTools 3.04 software from SYNGENE (Cambridge, UK).RNA Interference—HIF-1α, SIMA (also known as Drosophila HIF-α), and HIF-2α mRNA silencing using siRNA was performed as previously described (5Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 20Sowter H.M. Raval R.R. Moore J.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6130-6134PubMed Google Scholar). All siRNAs were annealed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Eurogentec). The ARD1 sequence used was as follows: sense, 5′-CCA UGG ACA UAU CAC CUC AdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-UGA GGU GAU AUG UCC AUG GdTdT-3′. Cells at 60% confluence were transfected for 6 h on two consecutive days at a concentration of 20 nm siRNA using the calcium phosphate transfection method. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer 2 days after the second transfection.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Crude cell extracts for SDS-PAGE were prepared in SDS sample buffer and sonicated, and in general 25-35 μg of protein, determined using a Lowry assay (Bio-Rad), was loaded on gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained with Amido Black. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated in the presence of the primary and then secondary antibodies in 1% nonfat milk in TN buffer. After washing in TN buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then in TN buffer, the immunoreactivity was detected with an ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences. The presented immunoblots are representative of at least two independent experiments often run in duplicate. Immunoblots were quantified as for RT-PCR.Conventional and Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips and then fixed in 3.3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% gelatin, 2.0% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with the polyclonal anti-rabbit ARD1 or HIF-1α antibodies (1:1000) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% gelatin, 2.0% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated in the presence of a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 594 (1:1000) and the nuclear fluorescent stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, coverslips were mounted in Cytifluor (Amersham Biosciences), detection of the fluorescence was performed with a Leica DMR fluorescence microscope, and images were recorded using RSImage software. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a LSM 510 metasystem (Zeiss). The diode laser (405 nm) and the HeNe were switched on and set at 21% output intensity. The multitrack band pass filter (420-480 nm) and (593-636 nm) configuration was selected. The pinhole diameter was maintained at 1 airy unit. We used a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil DIC objective. The nontransfected control culture was processed with a scan zoom of 1, and the MycARD1-transfected culture was processed with a scan zoom of 0.7. Images were generated for presentation using ImageJ software.Cell Fractionation—Confluent HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing a protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science), incubated on ice for 10 min, Dounce-homogenized (50 strokes), and centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer, vortexed, and centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm. After protein concentration determination using a Lowry assay, SDS sample buffer was added to the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) and pellet (nuclear fraction), and 30 μg of protein for each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using either anti-ARD1, anti-Sp1 (nuclear marker), or anti-α-tubulin (cytoplasmic marker) antibodies.RESULTSCharacterization of the Specific Immunoreactivity to ARD1 for Use in Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence—To study the expression and cellular localization of the ARD1 protein, we produced a polyclonal antibody against a peptide of the last 20 C-terminal amino acids of the human ARD1 sequence. This sequence is conserved in the mouse, rat, Xenopus laevis, and partially in zebrafish but not in D. melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, or S. cerevisiae. A single highly immunoreactive band was detected at around 30 kDa by immunoblotting of lysates of HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). This corresponded well to the expected size of human ARD1, a protein of 235 amino acids giving a predicted molecular mass of 26,458 Da. To further validate the immunoreactivity, HeLa cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged ARD1 expression vector. An additional, single band migrating just above the endogenous ARD1 band was detected (Fig. 1A). The slower migration can be attributed to a modification in the charge and size of the protein due to the presence of the FLAG tag, which was also detected with an anti-FLAG antibody (data not shown). The immunoreactivity to endogenous ARD1 was further confirmed by attenuation of the corresponding band following transient transfection with siRNA targeting ARD1 mRNA (Fig. 1B). Transfection with a control siRNA to SIMA (Similar, Drosophila HIF) is also shown, and ERK2 (42 kDa) detection was used as a loading control. The polyclonal antibody to ARD1 was validated for immunofluorescence in HeLa cells by transfection of cells with an siRNA targeting ARD1 (Fig. 1C). Comparison with the level of the immunoreactive signal from cells transfected with a control siRNA (SIMA) (Fig. 1C, left) showed an almost total loss in the immunoreactivity in the presence of siRNA directed against ARD1 (Fig. 1C, right panel). Thus, detection of exogenous FLAG-ARD1 and attenuation of the endogenous ARD1 validate the specificity of the ARD1 antibody for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.Overexpression and Silencing of ARD1 Have No Effect on HIF-1α and -2α Stability, and Silencing of ARD1 Does Not Modify HIF-1α Cellular Localization—To examine the effect of ARD1 on HIF-1α and -2α stability, we overexpressed ARD1 and incubated cells under normoxic and short and long term hypoxic conditions. HeLa cells were nontransfected, transfected with a control plasmid (pcDNA4), or transfected with a FLAG-tagged ARD1-expressing vector (Fig. 2, A and B). No substantial difference in the protein level for HIF-1α and -2α at 4 and 8 h was observed in either normoxia or hypoxia between control pcDNA4-transfected cells and cells overexpressing ARD1 when compared with the ERK2 loading control. The level of expression of both the endogenous and exogenous ARD1 remained constant upon exposure of cells to normoxia or hypoxia for 4 and 8 h when the intensity of the bands was compared with ERK2. Similar results were obtained after 24 h of hypoxic treatment (data not shown). There was also no difference in the stability of HIF-1α when ARD1-overexpressing HT1080 cells were incubated for 5 h in hypoxia (data not shown). We conclude that the presence of at least a 2-fold increase in the amount of ARD1 has little effect on HIF-1α stability in normoxia or hypoxia. In addition, silencing of ARD1 did not have a direct impact on HIF-1α or -2α protein stability in either normoxia or hypoxia, as observed for the nontransfected and SIMA control after normalization to the ERK2 loading control (Fig. 3A). This is in contrast to silencing of PHD2, which, as shown both here and previously by our laboratory, results in stabilization of HIF-1α protein in normoxia (5Berra E. Benizri E. Ginouves A. Volmat V. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4082-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Attempts to detect immunoprecipitated acetylated HIF-1α using several anti-acetyllysine (Upstate, Abcam, and Cell Signaling) and anti-HIF-1α antibodies were unsuccessful. In addition, we were unable to detect in vitro acetylation of glutathione S-transferase-HIF-1α fragments (amino acids 365-740, 365-805, 407-597, 504-587, 365-603, 401-603, and 504-603) containing lysine 532 when incubated with recombinant ARD1 (data not shown). Detection of HIF-1α by immunofluorescence in normoxia remained unchanged with silencing of ARD1, and silencing did not alter the nuclear localization of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2Up-regulation of the expression of ARD1 does not modify the normoxic or hypoxic levels of HIF-1α. A, the expression levels of HIF-1α and -2α were examined in HeLa cells incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 4 and 8 h and either nontransfected (-) or transfected with pcDNA4 or pFLAG-ARD1 (1.5 μg of plasmid/15-mm diameter dish) using anti-HIF-1α and HIF-2α antibodies. The endogenous and overexpressed ARD1 proteins were examined by immunoblotting with an anti-ARD1 antibody. Detection of ERK2 was used as a loading control.

The graphs indicate the relative intensity of the HIF-1α and HIF-2α bands normalized to the normoxic signal of HIF-1α (relative intensity of 1) for cells transfected with pcDNA4 for the respective incubation time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Silencing of ARD1 does not modify normoxic or hypoxic HIF-1α stability or its subcellular localization. A, lysates of HeLa cells incubated in normoxia or hypoxia (6 h) after no transfection or transfection with either a control siRNA (SIMA), an siRNA to ARD1, or an siRNA to PHD2 were examined by immunoblotting with anti-HIF-1α, anti-HIF-2α, and anti-ARD1 antibodies. The ERK2 immunoreactivity on the same blot was used as a loading control. B, HeLa cells transfected with either siRNA to SIMA (a and b) or to ARD1 (c and d) were incubated in normoxia (a and c) or hypoxia (b and d) for 6 h and examined by immunofluorescence for HIF-1α using a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 594.

Bae M.K. Ahn M.Y. Kim S.H. Sohn T.K. Bae M.H. Yoo M.A. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Kim K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 709-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), we were interested to know if this was a general phenomenon in tumor cells and if it was maintained under long periods of hypoxia. To this aim, we investigated regulation of the ARD1 mRNA and protein in several cell lines exposed to short and long term hypoxia. The mRNA levels were examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR in breast cancer MCF-7 and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells exposed to 4, 24, and 48 h of hypoxia (1.2% O2). We did not observe substantial changes in the mRNA expression levels when comparing cells in normoxia to cells in short or long term hypoxia for MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4A) and HT1080 cells (Fig. 4B). Expression of 36B4 was used as a loading control. To confirm hypoxic regulation in these cells at the mRNA level, we examined the same samples for the hypoxic induction of two known hypoxia response element-containing genes: carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) (Fig. 4A) and the proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (BNIP3) (Fig. 4B). As expected, these genes were up-regulated in hypoxia. The lack of hypoxic regulation of ARD1 was further confirmed by quantitative real time PCR. 2N. Mazure, F. Dayan, D. Roux, E. Berra, M. C. Brahimi-Horn, and J. Pouysségur, manuscript in preparation. To test the possibility that the previously reported decrease in expression in hypoxia was dependent on the cell density, we seeded cells at different densities and examined ARD1 expression in hypoxia. However, no difference in the mRNA level was detected (data not shown). A second set of primers for PCR amplification of the full-length cDNA for ARD1, which was reported to show decreased mRNA expression in HEK293 cells incubated in hypoxia (1% O2) for 16 h (19Chun Y.S.

Again no difference in expression levels was detected (data not shown). Thus, based on these experiments, which were reproduced repeatedly, ARD1 mRNA does not appear to be influenced either by short or lon"

However, the mechanism by which each PDE family recognizes selectively a category of inhibitors remains a puzzle. Here we report the crystal structure of PDE7A1 catalytic domain in complex with non-selective inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and kinetic analysis on the mutants of PDE7A1 and PDE4D2. Our studies suggest at least three elements play critical roles in inhibitor selectivity: 1) the conformation and position of an invariant glutamine, 2) the natures of scaffolding residues, and 3) residues that alter shape and size of the binding pocket. Kinetic analysis shows that single PDE7 to PDE4 mutations increase the sensitivity of PDE7 to PDE4 inhibitors but are not sufficient to render the engineered enzymes comparable with the wild types. The triple S373Y/S377T/I412S mutation of PDE7A1 produces a PDE4-like enzyme, implying that multiple elements must work together to determine inhibitor selectivity.

However, PDE7 is not sensitive to PDE4 inhibitors (Fig. 1) and thus was originally named as a “rolipram-insensitive PDE family”. To understand the inhibitor selectivity of the PDE7 and PDE4 families, we have determined the crystal structure of the PDE7A1 catalytic domain in complex with 3-isobuty-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and performed mutagenesis on PDE7A1 and PDE4D2. Our results show that several key residues must work together to switch the inhibitor selectivity between PDE4 and PDE7 and thus provide a valuable insight into selectivity of PDE inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSubcloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The cDNA of PDE7A1 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (BE782968) and subcloned into vector pET32a following the standard protocols. A pair of oligonucleotide primers of GCCTGGATCCTCAAATTCCCTAAAC and CGCGCTCGAGTTATGATAACCGATTTTC was synthesized for amplification of the PDE7A1 coding region of amino acids 130-482 by PCR. The amplified PDE7A1 DNA and the expression vector pET32a were separately digested by the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI, purified from agarose gel, and then ligated by T4 DNA ligase. The plasmid pET32-PDE7A1-(130-482) was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (codonplus) for overexpression. The E. coli cell carrying pET-PDE7A1 was grown in 2×YT medium at 37 °C to absorption A600 = 1.0, and then 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for further growth at 15 °C for 12-16 h.The catalytic domain of PDE7A1 was purified with three chromatographic columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen), Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and Sephacryl S300 (Amersham Biosciences). The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column was washed with 15 mm imidazole and eluted with a buffer of 20 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mm imidazole, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After removal of the His tag by thrombin cleavage, the PDE7A1 catalytic domain was loaded into a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with 20 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-ME, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. The PDE7A1 was finally purified by passing through a Sephacryl S300 column in a buffer of 20 mm Tris base, pH 7.5, 1 mm β-ME, and 1 mm MgCl2. A typical batch of purification yielded about 5 mg of PDE7A1 from 4 liters of cell culture. Purified protein showed a single band in SDS-PAGE and native PAGE and is estimated to have purity of better than 95% (Fig. 2).Fig. 2The 15% SDS acrylamide gel on the purified proteins.

The wild type full-length PDE4D2-(1-507) was overexpressed and purified by the same protocols for the PDE4D2 catalytic domain (25Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE showed a purity >95% of the recombinant PDE4D2 (Fig. 2)The mutants of PDE4D2-(1-507) and PDE7A1-(130-482) were produced with a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit and verified by DNA sequencing. All mutants were overexpressed in BL21 (codonplus) and purified using the same procedure as that for the wild types. The expression levels of the PDE7A1 mutants are comparable with that of the wild type PDE7A1. A typical batch of purification of PDE7A1 mutant produced about 2 mg from 2 liters of cell culture. The purified PDE7A1 mutants are estimated to have purity >95% as shown by the SDS gel (Fig. 2).Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of PDE7A1-IBMX were grown by vapor diffusion. The catalytic domain of 5 mg/ml PDE7A1 (amino acids 130-482) in a storage buffer of 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA was mixed with 1 mm IBMX. The PDE7A1-IBMX complex was crystallized by hanging drop at 4 °C. The protein drops contained 2 μl of PDE7A1-IBMX and 2 μl of well buffer of buffer 0.6-0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 2.5-5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.5. The well buffer plus 20% glycerol was used as the cryosolvent for freezing the crystals in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on beamline X29 of National Synchrotron Light Source. The PDE7A1-IBMX crystal has the space group P3121 with cell dimensions of a = 115.8 and c = 64.3 Å. The diffraction data were processed by the program HKL (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The raw diffraction images were automatically indexed and integrated by the subroutine Denzo of HKL, and then all the images were scaled and reduced by subroutine Scalepack of HKL. The statistics on the data process are shown in Table I. The structure of PDE7A1-IBMX was solved by the molecular replacement program AMoRe (27Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), using the catalytic domain of PDE4D2 as the initial model (25Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structure determination by AMoRe includes two steps: rotation function and translation search. The rotation function of AMoRe produced a peak with correlation coefficient of 0.12 for 3795 reflections at 4-8 Å resolution, which is ∼6 times the remaining solutions. A further search of the peak by the translation function of AMoRe yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.73 and R factor of 0.31 for 3795 reflections at 4-8 Å resolution. The phases from the molecular replacement were improved by the density modification package of program CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4) (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

The reactions were terminated by addition of 200 μl of 0.2 m ZnSO4 when 20-35% of cAMP or cGMP was hydrolyzed. The reaction product 3H-AMP or 3H-GMP was precipitated by addition of 200 μl of 0.25 m Ba(OH)2 (Sigma-Aldrich), while unreacted 3H-cAMP or 3H-cGMP remained in the supernatant. Radioactivity of the supernatant was measured in 3.5-ml liquid scintillation cocktails (ScintiSafe Plus™ 50%; Fisher Scientific) by a LKB RackBeta 1214 counter. The activity was measured at nine concentrations of cAMP or cGMP, and each measurement was repeated three times. Vmax and Km values were calculated by the linear plots of Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee. Protein concentrations were calculated from the extinction coefficients at A280 nm by program ProtoParam. For measurement of inhibition, 10-12 concentrations of inhibitors were used under the substrate concentration of one tenth of Km and the enzyme concentration range of 10-300 ng/ml. The enzyme concentration that hydrolyzed 50% of the substrate was chosen for each inhibition assay of mutants. The hydrolysis rate had a linear relationship with the enzyme concentration and time until 65% substrate had been converted to product. Each experiment was repeated two or three times. The IC50 values were the concentration of inhibitors when 50% activities of the enzymes were inhibited.RESULTSKinetic Properties—The catalytic domain of PDE7A1 has a Km value of 0.2 ± 0.03 μm and a kcat value of 1.6 ± 0.2 s-1 for cAMP, in contrast to a Km of 3.9 ± 0.7 mm and a kcat of 6.8 ± 1.3 s-1 for cGMP. The ratio of the specificity constants (kcat/Km)cAMP/(kcat/Km)cGMP is ∼4,000. The full-length PDE4D2 has Km of 1.5 ± 0.2 μm and kcat of 3.9 ± 0.3 s-1 for cAMP and Km of 1.0 ± 0.1 mm and kcat of 5.2 ± 0.8 s-1 for cGMP. The ratio of the specificity constants (kcat/Km)cAMP/(kcat/Km)cGMP is ∼500. Thus, these specific constants confirm that PDE7A1 and PDE4D2 are cAMP-specific. The kcat value of our PDE7A1 catalytic domain is ∼5 times that of PDE7A1 refolded from the inclusion bodies (24Richter W. Hermsdorf T. Kronbach T. Dettmer D. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and about half that of PDE4D2, suggesting that the purified PDE7A1 catalytic domain has a native-like folding. It is interesting to note that both PDE4D2 and PDE7A1 have similar kcat values for cAMP and cGMP. However, the Km values for cGMP are ∼700- and 2,000-fold bigger than those for cAMP, thus implicating Km as the dominant factor of the substrate specificity.Overall Structure of PDE7—The catalytic domain of PDE7A1 (residues 130-482) contains 17 α-helices (Fig. 3) and has the same topology of folding as do other PDEs (31Xu R.X.

Two divalent metals were tentatively interpreted as zinc and magnesium for the purpose of structure refinement. Residues 130-138 and 458-482 were not traceable in the structure because of the lack of electron density. The N-terminal fragments of the catalytic domains in the PDE families (130-157 in PDE7A1) do not have comparable amino acid sequences and vary in their secondary structure elements. Among them, PDE4B, PDE4D, and PDE1B (25Huai Q. Wang H. Sun Y. Kim H.Y. Liu Y. Ke H. Structure. 2003; 11: 865-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 31Xu R.X.

The catalytic domain of PDE7A1 resembles PDE4 mostly, and their entire catalytic domains are comparable, as shown by an average difference of 0.93 Å for the superposition of Cα atoms of PDE7A1 residues 139-455 on the equivalents of PDE4D2. However, minor differences are observed between PDE7A1 and PDE4D2. First, PDE7A1 has two deletions around residues 297 and 341 (Fig. 3C). Second, two 310 helices (a type of helix involving 3 residues/turn) in PDE4D2 appear as α-helices in PDE7A1 (Fig. 3C, He and H10) and a 310 helix in PDE4D2 (residues 98-102) becomes a coil in PDE7A1. The most significant change is associated with the N-terminal portion of helix H11 (residues 304-310 of PDE7A1), which shows an average positional movement of 2.8 Å, ∼3 times the overall average of 0.93 Å for the whole catalytic domain. This structural change appears to be statistically meaningful, but the biological significance is not clear. The positional change of helix H11 may either reflect intrinsic conformation variation between PDE4 and PDE7 or may be due to the tetramer formation in the PDE4D2 crystal, because H11 contributes a small portion of the interface of the PDE4D2 tetramer but is not involved in lattice packing in PDE7A1.Fig. 3PDE structures.

A. 2000; 97: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of PDE7A1 has an IC50 of 8.1 ± 0.4 μm for IBMX, thus implying that the binding determinants are located within the catalytic domain of PDE7. This argument is supported by the crystal structure of PDE7A1, in which IBMX occupies the bottom of the deep pocket and is not exposed at the surface of the catalytic domain. The xanthine ring of IBMX stacks against Phe-416 (Fig. 4), and its oxygen O6 forms a hydrogen bond with Gln-413. It also contacts PDE7A1 residues Tyr-211, Val-380, and Phe-384 via van der Waals interactions. Two water molecules bound to O2 and N7 of xanthine, respectively. The isopropanyl group of IBMX interacts with residues Phe-384, Ile-412, and Phe-416. The above interactions of IBMX with PDE7A1 are similar to those in other PDEs (36Huai Q. Liu Y. Francis S.H.

Sci., U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For an accurate comparison, IBMX binding in the families of PDE4, 5, and 9 was re-examined. IBMX shows good electron density and temperature factors in PDE5 and PDE9 so that both orientation and conformation in these crystals are uniquely defined (36Huai Q. Liu Y. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D.

A. 2004; 101: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the B-factor, a thermal movement index, for IBMX in PDE4D2 crystal is significantly higher than the average B-factor for all the atoms of the protein (36Huai Q. Liu Y. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13095-13101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), indicating a low occupancy or high thermal flexibility of IBMX in PDE4D2. Therefore, we re-adjusted the orientation of IBMX in PDE4D2 (new Protein Data Bank entry code 1ZKN) for the best comparison. Overall, IBMX shows conservation of stacking against phenylalanine and a hydrogen bond to the invariant glutamine in all the PDE families. However, IBMX shows significant positional shifts among PDE4, 5, 7, and 9. For example, IBMX in PDE7A1 has an average positional shift of ∼1.3 Å from that in PDE4D2. This may reflect that the large pockets in PDEs allow orientational variation of IBMX, as long as the stacking and the hydrogen bond are conserved. Based on the crystal structures of PDE4, 5, and 9 in complex with IBMX, we proposed that the hydrogen bond with the invariant glutamine and stacking against the phenylalanine are two key components for common binding of all PDE inhibitors (36Huai Q.

However, it remains a puzzle how the conserved catalytic domains of the PDE families selectively recognize their individual inhibitors.Fig. 4The inhibitor binding.

Rolipram and its derivatives RO-20-1724 and zardaverine do not significantly inhibit the wild type PDE7A1 (Table II), consistent with reports in the literature (22Gardner C. Robas N. Cawkill D.

To characterize the impact of glycosylation at the 23 consensus O-fucose sites in Drosophila Notch, we conducted deletion mapping and site-specific mutagenesis and then assayed the binding of soluble forms of Notch to cell-surface ligands. Our results support the conclusion that EGF11 and EGF12 are essential for ligand binding, but indicate that other EGF domains also make substantial contributions to ligand binding. Characterization of Notch deletion constructs and O-fucose site mutants further revealed that no single site or region can account for the influence of Fringe on Notch-ligand binding. Additionally, we observed an influence of Fringe on a Notch fragment including only 4 of its 36 EGF domains (EGF10–13). Together, our observations imply that glycosylation influences Notch-ligand interactions through a distributive mechanism that involves local interactions with multiple EGF domains and led us to suggest a structural model for how Notch interacts with its ligands.

Notch proteins are transmembrane receptors for an intercellular signaling pathway that affects numerous cell fate decisions throughout the Metazoa (reviewed in Refs. 1Schweisguth F. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R129-R138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 2Lai E.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of Notch receptors are composed largely of tandemly repeated epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; Fng, Fringe; AP, alkaline phosphatase. 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; Fng, Fringe; AP, alkaline phosphatase. domains. The main class of Notch ligands, collectively referred to as DSL (Delta-Serrate-Lag2) ligands, are also transmembrane proteins with multiple EGF domains. In the main Notch signaling pathway, association of Notch with its ligands triggers proteolytic processing of Notch. This liberates the cytoplasmic domain of Notch from the membrane, upon which it travels to the nucleus and forms part of a transcriptional activation complex. The Notch pathway is highly conserved but generally more complex in vertebrates due to the greater number of paralogs for Notch pathway components. Binding between Notch and its two Drosophila ligands, Delta and Serrate, was first demonstrated by their ability to mediate the aggregation of cultured Drosophila S2 cells (3Fehon R.G. Kooh P.J.

The remaining 34 EGF domains were identified as having no influence or possibly interfering with optimal binding. Subsequent studies have confirmed the importance of EGF11 and EGF12 to DSL ligand binding (5Lawrence N. Klein T. Brennan K. Martinez Arias A.

The activation of Notch receptors by DSL ligands is influenced by glycosyltransferases that participate in the synthesis of O-linked fucose glycans attached to EGF domains (reviewed in Refs. 11Haines N.

However, studies in Drosophila indicate that OFUT1 has a chaperone activity that is separable from its fucosyltransferase activity (19Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), which might account for the universal requirement for OFUT1 in Notch signaling. Nonetheless, some aspects of Notch function clearly depend on O-fucosyltransferase-1 activity, as they depend on elongation of the O-linked fucose monosaccharide.

Genetic and cell culture studies indicate that Fringe (Fng) functions specifically on the receiving side of the Notch pathway (17Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol.

Cell-based and in vitro binding studies conducted with Drosophila components of the Notch pathway have consistently supported the conclusion that Fng influences Notch signaling at the ligand binding step (10Perez L.

Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although in mammalian cells, the effects of Fng might be more complex (23Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G.

Biol. 2003; 4: 786-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 31Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), 23 of the 36 EGF repeats of Drosophila Notch could potentially be O-fucosylated (see Fig. 1). Additional constraints that influence Fng-dependent elongation of O-fucose on particular EGF domains also exist (32Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but it is not yet possible to predict which of the potential sites in Drosophila Notch are efficiently modified by Fng. Initial studies of O-fucose sites focused on two regions of interest. The Abruptex region is defined by mutations in EGF24–29 (see Fig. 1) (33Kelley M.R. Kidd S. Deutsch W.A. Young M.W. Cell. 1987; 51: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which result in dominant gain-of-function Notch phenotypes (34de Celis J.F. Garcia-Bellido A. Genetics. 1994; 136: 183-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and there are some genetic similarities between the effects of Abruptex mutations and those of Fng (35de Celis J.F. Bray S.J. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, individual or paired mutations in O-fucose sites within this region do not detectably influence Notch activity in vivo (29Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and Abruptex-like mutations do not consistently influence glycosylation of Notch1 by Fng (32Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Another region of interest is the ligand-binding domain. The presence of a potential O-fucose site within EGF12 is highly conserved among Notch receptors from different phyla, and EGF12 is O-fucosylated in both mammalian and insect cells (see Fig. 1) (29Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site in Drosophila indicated that glycosylation of EGF12 is not essential for Notch signaling, but does contribute to the modulation of Notch signaling by Fng (29Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this site cannot fully account for the influence of Fng, as Fng still influences both Serrate and Delta binding to a Notch receptor that cannot be O-fucosylated on EGF12 (29Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We report here on a series of mutations that collectively encompass all of the 23 potential O-fucose sites in Notch. This site-specific mutagenesis has been complemented by analysis of a series of Notch deletion constructs. Our results support the conclusion that EGF11 and EGF12 are the most critical EGF domains for ligand binding. However, they indicate that other EGF domains also make substantial contributions to ligand binding. Our results also show that Fng glycosylation influences Notch-ligand binding by a distributive mechanism: there is no single site whose glycosylation can fully account for the effects of Fng; rather, Fng can influence binding through multiple distinct O-fucose sites. This suggests that an influence on local interactions between individual EGF domains of Notch and its ligands is most likely responsible for the influence of Fng glycosylation, rather than glycosylation of a unique site or region or a global influence on Notch structure. Consistent with this, an effect of Fng did not require a complete Notch protein, but could be detected on a fragment of Notch including only four EGF domains. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids expressing truncated versions of the extracellular domain of Notch fused to alkaline phosphatase (AP; referred to as N:AP) were created using a PCR cloning strategy. First, plasmid pMT-WB/N-AP was constructed by cloning a 6.3-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment including Notch EGF domains fused to AP from pRmHa-3/N-AP (20Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) into pMT-WB. A 4.5-kb EcoRI-BspEI fragment including most of the Notch sequences was then excised from pMT-WB/N-AP and replaced with a PCR product (cut with EcoRI and BspEI) encoding amino acids 1–58 of Notch and a PCR product (cut with BspEI) encoding a subset of Notch EGF domains. The addition of the BspEI site adds two amino acids (Ser and Gly) between amino acids 58 and 59 of Notch. For the N-EGF1–10, 13–36 construct, the N-terminal EcoRI-BspEI PCR fragment extended instead through EGF10. The junction sequences and the orientation of the BspEI fragment were determined by DNA sequencing. The primers and junction amino acids encoded by these PCR products are as follows. For amino acids 1–58, the forward primer was gtggaattcgagctcgaattaactgga, and the reverse primer was gtactatagtccggacaccaacgcggtatcagttcc. For the BspEI fragments, we used combinations of the following primers: N terminus of EGF1 (begins at Ala59), aatagatccggagccgcttcctgcacaagtgtc (forward primer); N terminus of EGF6 (begins at Tyr256), agtacttccggatacaagccctgctcgccatcg (forward primer); N terminus of EGF10 (begins at Asp411), agtacttccggagatgcctgtacctcgaatccc (forward primer); N terminus of EGF13 (begins at Ile527), agccgttccggaattgacgaatgccaatcgaat (forward primer); C terminus of EGF10 (ends at Asp449), agaacttccggagtcctctgaacaatccacgcc (reverse primer); C terminus of EGF13 (ends at Asn564), actagttccggaattgatttgacatcgtgcgcc (reverse primer); C terminus of EGF24 (ends at Asp984), actagttccggagtccgtctcgcagtgctt (reverse primer); C terminus of EGF27 (ends at Tyr1098), agtacttccggaatattcggaacactgttt (reverse primer); C terminus of EGF30 (ends at Asn1221), agaacttccggagttcagttcgcaattctgacc (reverse primer); and C terminus of EGF36 (ends at Gly1465), gcgatcatttccggatcccgaacc (reverse primer). Site-specific mutagenesis was conducted as described previously (29Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis was conducted within pBS-N or O-fucose site mutant derivatives. Mutagenesis was designed to change the O-fucosylation site from Ser or Thr to Ala. The primers used for the mutagenesis of each EGF domain were as follows: EGF1, cagaatggcggcgcatgcgttacacaact; EGF2, caaaatggtggcgcctgtcaggtgacctt; EGF3, ctcaatggaggcgcctgtcagctgaagac; EGF4, cggaatggagccgcctgcaccgctttggc; EGF5, aaatacggcggcgcatgtgtcaacaccca; EGF7, cagaacggaggagcctgcatcgatggcat; EGF8, cagaacggagccgcctgtacaaacactca; EGF9, ttctacggagccgcgtgcatcgatggcgt; EGF12, cagaacgagggagcttgcctggatgatcc; EGF13, ctgaacgatggagcttgccacgacaagat; EGF17, aacaatggtgccgcctgcatcgatggcat; EGF20, cagcatggtggcgcctgttatgataagct; EGF21, ggaaatggaggcgcctgcattgacaaggt; EGF23, cggaatggagctgcctgtttgaatgttcc; EGF24, cagaacggtggagcctgtctggatgggat; EGF25, cagaatggtgccgcgtgcattcagtatgt; EGF26, ttaaacggtggcgcttgcatcgatggcat; EGF27, ttgaacggagccgcctgccacgagcaaaa; EGF28, gagaatggagcggcctgtagccagatgaa; EGF29, tgcaacaatggcgcgtgcaaggattacgg; EGF30, cagaatggtggagcgtgccgagatctcat; EGF31, cagaatggcggcgcttgccacgaccgtgt; and EGF32, cacaacaacggcgcctgcatcgatcgcgt. Drosophila Stocks and Crosses—UAS-N-EGF1–9f, UAS-N-EGF13–21f, and UAS-N-EGF23–32f transgenes were created and transformed into Drosophila. Initial analysis of these lines was conducted by crossing them with ptc-Gal4 and examining wing imaginal discs and adult wings. Other Gal4 and UAS transgenes used and the corresponding FlyBase ID numbers (available at flybase.bio.Indiana.edu/) were ptc-Gal4 (FBti0002124), ap-Gal4 (FBti0002785), UAS-GFP (FBti0003040), and UAS-lacZ (FBtp0000355). Cell Binding Assay—Protein expression and cell binding assays were conducted as described previously (17Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 20Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). In brief, the binding assay involved mixing conditioned medium containing N:AP or Fc:AP (a control protein consisting of the Fc domain of human IgG fused to AP) with S2 cells expressing a Notch ligand or with control S2 cells. To ensure consistency, wild-type N:AP and Fc:AP controls were always run in parallel with N:AP mutants. A slight variation between completely independent sets of experiments was observed (e.g. compare N:AP in Table I with N:AP in Table II), but the results were qualitatively consistent. To normalize for variation in transfection efficiency and secretion of different constructs, the amount of fusion protein in the medium was assayed by measuring AP activity and was then equalized among experiments presented in the same table by the addition of conditioned medium from untransfected S2 cells (to dilute) or by centrifugation though Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Mr 10,000 cutoff; Millipore Corp.) (to concentrate). Equal amounts of fusion protein (as determined by measuring AP activity) were always used for experiments run in parallel. S2 cells endogenously express OFUT1, but elevated OFUT1 expression can modulate Notch-ligand binding (17Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). S2 cells do not endogenously express Fringe. In cases where no exogenous glycosyltransferases were added, the total amount of DNA in the transfections was kept constant by adding vector DNA (pRMHa-3) as needed. S2 cells do not endogenously express significant levels of Serrate or Delta, and thus, S2 cells transiently transfected with vector (pRMHa-3) were used as a negative control for ligand binding (control S2 cells). In separate experiments (not shown), the amount of AP activity detected was not affected by transfection of S2 cells. Delta-expressing cells were stably transfected, and Serrate-expressing cells were transiently transfected. AP activity was determined by spectrophotometric detection of a reaction product. A mock assay in which S2 cell-conditioned medium was incubated with each corresponding cell type was used as the spectrophotometer blank. In the complete absence of binding, fluctuations in assay background levels could therefore lead to the assay result being a negative number.Table IBinding of Notch deletion constructsMediaControl S2 cellsDelta-expressing S2 cellsSer-expressing S2 cellsNoneOFUT1FngNoneFngNoneOFUT1FngmAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.-fold increasemAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.-fold decreaseN:AP0.260.090.070.030.030.049.872.49256.3950.1726.010.810.9692.5012.850.810.3713.4N:AP-EGF1-100.340.29-0.030.030.680.230.670.480.490.401.390.311.311.120.680.35N:AP-EGF1-130.410.390.170.13-0.010.051.060.4150.068.532.780.600.070.380.950.252.9N:AP-EGF1-24-0.040.080.130.090.030.021.780.6056.8314.2631.93.661.2536.205.970.600.076.1N:AP-EGF6-360.460.31-0.020.030.030.0412.411.94321.7862.9025.913.561.74102.6718.381.470.079.2N:AP-EGF10-360.380.320.070.050.060.033.532.1129.174.968.33.790.4040.0010.612.191.421.7N:AP-EGF13-360.460.410.030.040.170.200.400.230.330.561.120.260.050.03-0.150.55N:AP-EGF1-10,10-360.010.040.070.030.060.01-0.010.24-0.040.880.710.300.220.150.800.07Fc:AP0.160.150.160.130.070.150.670.200.020.200.660.250.660.030.000.07 Open table in a new tab Table IIBinding of Notch point mutationsMediaControl S2 cellsDelta-expressing S2 cellsSer-expressing S2 cellsNoneNoneOFUT1FngNoneOFUT1FngmAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.-fold increasemAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.mAU/minS.E.-fold decreaseN:AP0.130.0812.640.765.920.79337.6750.5926.711.670.59112.366.892.930.634.0N:AP-EGF1-9f0.780.385.311.131.770.7560.2310.2011.410.000.5934.928.162.811.593.6N:AP-EGF13-21f0.140.334.461.751.080.5046.076.6310.33.570.4825.757.791.650.512.2N:AP-EGF23-32f0.340.196.311.351.290.61163.0023.6425.87.120.4039.296.502.181.123.3Fc:AP0.020.060.620.500.050.14 Open table in a new tab Sequence Comparisons—The conservation of O-fucose sites and Ca2+-binding sites was assessed by comparing the sequences of Notch from Drosophila melanogaster (GenBank™ accession number P07207), Lucilia cuprina (accession number AAC36151), Boophilus microlus (accession number AAN06819), Lytechinus variegatus (gi 7512075), Takifugu rubripes (accession number BAA20535), Danio rerio (gi 18859115), Halocynthia roretzi (gi 7522619), Branchiostoma floridae (gi 12057020), and Xenopus laevis (gi 1709335); Notch1 from Mus musculus (gi 6679092), Rattus norvegicus (gi 6093542), and Homo sapiens (gi 27894368); and Notch2 from H. sapiens (gi 24041035), M. musculus (gi 20138876), and R. norvegicus (gi 13242247) using C2XXX(A/G/S)(S/T)C3 as a consensus O-fucose site and (D/N/E)X(D/N/E)(E/D/Q)C1... C3X(D/N)XXXX(Y/F)XC4 as a consensus Ca2+-binding site, where C1, C2, C3, and C4 are the first, second, third, and fourth cysteines of an EGF domain. Multiple EGF Domains Contribute to Notch-Ligand Binding—The observation that Fng can influence Notch-ligand binding even when the only O-fucose site in the previously identified ligand-binding region is eliminated suggests that other EGF domains can actually make a substantial contribution to Serrate and Delta binding (29Lei L. Xu A. Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6411-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This prompted us to re-examine the contributions of different EGF domains. This was accomplished by employing a cell-based reverse binding assay in which the extracellular domain of Notch was fused to alkaline phosphatase (N:AP), and this soluble form of the receptor was bound to S2 cells transfected to express a Notch ligand (20Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). An AP-tagged immunoglobulin protein domain (Fc: AP) and S2 cells transfected with empty vector served as negative controls. This assay has been employed previously to characterize the influences of Fng, OFUT1, and Notch mutations on ligand binding (10Perez L. Milan M. Bray S. Cohen S.M. Mech.

It appears to be more sensitive to differences in binding affinity than the cell aggregation assay, as the influence of Fng is readily detectable with this assay, but cannot be detected by cell aggregation (36Klueg K.M. Muskavitch M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2V. M. Panin and K. D. Irvine, unpublished data. It facilitates quantitation of input amounts of Notch (a critical issue when evaluating mutant proteins) as well as amounts of bound Notch, and assays of AP activity were used to normalize the amounts of fusion protein in each experiment. The assay is also roughly linear over a range of concentrations (17Okajima T. Xu A. Irvine K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42340-42345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), permitting comparisons of relative binding strength to be made. Binding studies on fragments of Notch including different EGF domains (see Fig. 2A) are summarized in Table I. No constructs lacking EGF11 and EGF12 exhibited binding significantly above background levels, even when 34 of the 36 EGF domains of Notch were included (N:AP-EGF1–10, 13–36), consistent with a prior study indicating a critical requirement for these EGF domains in ligand binding (4Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). However, truncation of Notch EGF domains from either the N terminus (N:AP-EGF10–36) or the C terminus (N:AP-EGF1–24) substantially impaired ligand binding. This suggests that EGF1–9 and EGF25–36 contribute to ligand binding. An intermediate deletion from the N terminus (N:AP-EGF6–36) bound to ligands as well as or slightly better than full-length Notch, indicating that EGF1–5 are dispensable for ligand binding. A more severe deletion from the C terminus (N:AP-EGF1–13) bound detectably to Serrate-expressing cells, but not to Delta-expressing cells. Intermediate deletions from the C terminus (N:AP-EGF1–27, N:AP-EGF1–30, and N:AP-EGF6–30) were not extensively characterized because they were secreted very poorly, presumably due to misfolding. Fringe Influences Notch-Ligand Binding through Different Regions of Notch—To investigate the contributions of O-fucose sites within different regions of Notch to ligand binding, studies were conducted on Notch fragments produced in S2 cells cotransfected to express Fng.

https://openalex.org/W2109010802,"Polyamine depletion prevents apoptosis by increasing serine/threonine phosphorylation leading to either inactivation or activation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, respectively. Despite evidence that protein kinases are regulators of apoptosis, a specific role for protein phosphatases in regulating cell survival has not been established. In this study, we show that polyamine depletion inhibits serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Inhibition of PP2A in cells depleted of polyamines correlated well with increased phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. Bad Ser112 phosphorylation in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α treatment decreased with time in cells grown in control as well as those grown in the presence of α-difluoromethylornithine plus putrescine. However, a sustained increase in the levels of Bad Ser112 phosphorylation was maintained in response to TNF-α treatment in cells grown in the presence of α-difluoromethylornithine. Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid and fostriecin or PP2A small interfering RNA transfection significantly decreased TNF-α-induced apoptosis in control and polyamine-depleted cells. Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid: 1) increased Bad and Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser112 and Ser70, respectively; 2) increased ERK activity; 3) prevented JNK activation; 4) prevented cytochrome c release, and activation of caspases-9 and -3 in response to TNF-α. Inhibition of MEK1 by U0126 prevented phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. These results indicate that polyamines regulate PP2A activity, and inhibition of PP2A in response to polyamine depletion increases steady state levels of Bad and Bcl-2 proteins and their phosphorylation and thereby prevents cytochrome c release, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation. Polyamine depletion prevents apoptosis by increasing serine/threonine phosphorylation leading to either inactivation or activation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, respectively. Despite evidence that protein kinases are regulators of apoptosis, a specific role for protein phosphatases in regulating cell survival has not been established. In this study, we show that polyamine depletion inhibits serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Inhibition of PP2A in cells depleted of polyamines correlated well with increased phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. Bad Ser112 phosphorylation in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α treatment decreased with time in cells grown in control as well as those grown in the presence of α-difluoromethylornithine plus putrescine. However, a sustained increase in the levels of Bad Ser112 phosphorylation was maintained in response to TNF-α treatment in cells grown in the presence of α-difluoromethylornithine. Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid and fostriecin or PP2A small interfering RNA transfection significantly decreased TNF-α-induced apoptosis in control and polyamine-depleted cells. Inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid: 1) increased Bad and Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser112 and Ser70, respectively; 2) increased ERK activity; 3) prevented JNK activation; 4) prevented cytochrome c release, and activation of caspases-9 and -3 in response to TNF-α. Inhibition of MEK1 by U0126 prevented phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. These results indicate that polyamines regulate PP2A activity, and inhibition of PP2A in response to polyamine depletion increases steady state levels of Bad and Bcl-2 proteins and their phosphorylation and thereby prevents cytochrome c release, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation. In eukaryotic cells, reversible protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases and protein phosphatases regulates numerous cellular processes including apoptosis (1Garcia A. Cayla X. Guergnon J. Dessauge F. Hospital V. Rebollo M.P. Fleischer A. Rebollo A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The kinases themselves are dephosphorylated and deactivated by a type-2A protein phosphatase. Kinases and phosphatases may even bind the same protein at different locations (2Sim A.T. Scott J.D. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Every third protein undergoes reversible phosphorylation in an average eukaryotic cell. Previous studies have implicated serine/threonine protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) 1The abbreviations used are: PP2A, serine/threonine protein phosphatase-2A; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; DFMO, α-difluoromethylornithine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IEC, intestinal epithelial cell; dFBS, dialyzed fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CHX, cyclohexamide; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. in a wide array of cellular functions including metabolism, transcription, translation, ion transport, development, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Garcia A.

This includes increasing or decreasing enzyme activities (phospholipase, glycogen synthase kinase 3β), marking a protein for degradation (IκB), allowing a protein to move from one cellular location to another, or enabling a protein to interact with or dissociate from other proteins (Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-associated death promoter (Bad)). The Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis. Three subfamilies have been identified: 1) prosurvival Bcl-2 (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) proteins; 2) the proapoptotic Bax (e.g. Bax and Bak) proteins; and 3) the BH3 domain-only (e.g. Bad, Bim, and Bid) proteins (5Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 6Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Normal cellular homeostasis is maintained by suppression of proapoptotic proteins by various mechanisms, which include phosphorylation, intracellular localization, and heterodimerization with prosurvival Bcl-2 family proteins. The BH3-only proapoptotic protein Bad exerts its death promoting effects by heterodimerizing with Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 death antagonists at the mitochondrial membrane (8Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsemeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar, 9Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsemeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are present in virtually all eukaryotic cells. Polyamines are low molecular weight aliphatic amines and are highly charged cations at physiological pH. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are synthesized from a common precursor, ornithine, which is decarboxylated by the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) to form putrescine. S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, another rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis, converts S-adenosylmethionine into decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine. Decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine in turn acts as an aminopropyl donor in the synthesis of spermidine and spermine (10Seiler N. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 843-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Persson L. Svensson F. Lovkist-Wallstrom E. Nishioka K. Polyamines in Cancer: Basic Mechanisms and Clinical Approaches. Landis, Austin, TX1996: 19-43Google Scholar). The role of polyamines in cell proliferation and differentiation has been extensively studied using enzyme inhibitors and polyamine analogs (12Marton L.J. Pegg A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 13Kramer D.L. Fogel P.M. Diegelman P. Cooley J.M. Bernacki R.J. McManis J.S. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5521-5527PubMed Google Scholar). Interference of polyamine homeostasis not only alters cell proliferation but also may even cause cell death depending on the cell type or pharmacological agent used. Involvement of ODC in cell death processes first emerged from studies on neuronal cell death (14Bernstein H.G. Muller M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 57: 485-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both up- and down-regulation of polyamine levels were reported during apoptosis. Various studies using different cell systems have shown a rapid and marked increase of ODC activity during apoptotic cell death suggesting an active role for ODC in apoptosis (15Schipper R.G. Penning L.C. Verhofstad A.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). If polyamines play an active role in apoptosis, inhibition of polyamine synthesis should inhibit apoptosis. Tewari et al. (16Tewari M. Hamid Q.A. Tuncay O.C. Tewari D.S. Oral Oncol. 1998; 34: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reported that degradation of ODC by forced expression of ODC antizyme, prevented cell death in human fibroblasts. Furthermore, inhibition of ODC activity with the highly specific ODC inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and subsequent depletion of polyamines inhibit apoptosis in almost all systems studied (15Schipper R.G. Penning L.C. Verhofstad A.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Monti et al. (17Monti M.G. Ghiaroni S. Pernecco L. Barbieri D. Marverti G. Franceschi C. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that polyamine depletion protected human promyelogenous leukemia cells (HL60) from 2-deoxy-d-ribose-induced apoptosis. Recent studies imply that a change in ODC activity per se is not obligatory for apoptosis. Noda et al. (18Noda T. Iwakiri R. Fujimoto K. Matsuo S. Aw T.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G270-G276PubMed Google Scholar) showed that ischemia-reperfusion damage in rat intestinal mucosa resulted in elevated ODC activity accompanied by DNA fragmentation. Inhibition of ODC activity by DFMO did not affect DNA fragmentation, indicating that apoptosis was independent of ODC activity (19Lin C.K. Zou H.Y. Kaptein J.S. Yen C.F. Kalunta C.I. Nguyen T.T. Park E. Lad P.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Penning et al. (20Penning L.C. Schipper R.G. Vercammen D. Verhofstad A.A. Denecker T. Beyaert R. Vandenabeele P. Cytokine. 1998; 10: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) also showed that apoptosis stimulated by TNF-α was independent of ODC activity per se but was dependent on intracellular levels of spermine. Our laboratory has studied the growth and repair of the gastrointestinal mucosa and has examined these processes in both rats and in cultured intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6), a non-transformed line derived from rat crypt cells (21Wang J.Y. Johnson L.R. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 22McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: G426-G435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that polyamine depletion inhibits apoptosis induced in response to camptothecin, TNF-α, and γ-irradiation in IEC-6 cells (23Ray R.M. Viar M.J. Yuan Q. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C480-C489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Deng W. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; (April 28)10.1152/ajpgi.00564.2004Google Scholar). In an attempt to delineate the mechanisms regulating apoptosis, we have shown that polyamine depletion causes sustained activation of ERKs, which in turn prevents the activation of pro-apoptotic N-terminal c-Jun kinase (25Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G980-G991Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G479-G490Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, polyamine depletion with DFMO caused constitutive activation of Akt and NF-κB (27Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 759-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, each of these pathways controls the levels or activities of Bcl-2 family proteins that are responsible for determining whether cytochrome c is released from mitochondria. The activities of many of the components of these pathways and the Bcl-2 proteins are regulated by serine-threonine phosphorylation. We have also shown that Akt and ERKs are activated immediately following exposure of IEC-6 cells to TNF-α. These activities peak around 3-4 h and then decrease to basal levels by 9 h (26Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G479-G490Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 759-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In polyamine-depleted cells, however, the activities of these enzymes increase to higher levels and then plateau. Thus, it appears that there is no inactivation of Akt and ERK in DFMO-treated cells. These findings suggest that increased serine/threonine phosphorylation might be because of inactivation of PP2A in polyamine-depleted cells, and that inactivation protected the cells from apoptosis. Earlier reports also indicated that polyamines activate PP2A specifically compared with PP1 (28Tung H.Y. Pelech S. Fisher M.J. Pogson C.I. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Cornwell T. Mehta P. Shenolikar S. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphor. Res. 1986; 11: 373-382PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of PP2A in the regulation of apoptosis in polyamine-depleted cells. Materials—Cell cultureware was purchased from Corning Glass works (Corning, NY). Media and other cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Dialyzed fetal bovine serum (dFBS) was purchased from Sigma. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Geneticin (G418) was purchased from Invitrogen. TNF-α was obtained from Pharmingen. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection system was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DFMO was a gift from ILEX Oncology™ Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Caspase-3 substrate DEVD-pNA was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-PP2A and caspase-3 antibodies, PP2A-specific and non-targeting control siRNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-ERK, total ERK, and caspase-3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Okadaic acid and fostriecin were purchased from Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA), and Sigma, respectively. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus kit were purchased from Roche. The IEC-6 cell line (ATCC CRL 1592) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) at passage 13. The cell line was derived from normal rat intestine and was developed and characterized by Quaroni et al. (30Quaroni A. Wands J. Trelstad R.L. Isselbacher K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). IEC-6 cells originate from intestinal crypt cells as judged by morphological and immunologic criteria. They are nontumorigenic and retain the undifferentiated character of epithelial stem cells. Tests for mycoplasma were always negative. All chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Cell Culture—IEC-6 cell stock was maintained in T-150 flasks in a humidified, 37 °C incubator in an atmosphere of 90:10, air:CO2. The medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5% heat inactivated FBS and 10 μg of insulin and 50 μg of gentamicin sulfate per ml. The stock flask was passaged weekly, fed 3 times per week, and passages 15-22 were used. To set up experiments, the cells were trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA and counted by a Beckman Coulter counter (model Z1). General experimental protocols for using IEC-6 cells have previously been described (31Ray R.M. Viar M.J. Yuan Q. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C480-C489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, IEC-6 cells were plated at 6.24 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM as described, fed every other day, and serum starved during the 24 h before harvesting. We have previously reported that maximal polyamine depletion in IEC-6 cells occurs after 4 days of treatment with DFMO, with putrescine undetectable after 6 h of DFMO, spermidine depleted after 24 h, and spermine reduced to a stable 40% after 4 days of DFMO (32McCormack S.A. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G367-G374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis—Cells were plated (day 0) at a density of 6.25 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM/dFBS with or without 5 mm DFMO and DFMO plus 10 μm putrescine in triplicate for each group. The DFMO plus putrescine group served as a control to show that the effects of DFMO were because of polyamine depletion and not DFMO itself. In all experiments the results with this group of cells were identical to those of the untreated controls. Cells were fed on day 2. On day 3, the culture medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium. On day 4, TNF-α (20 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) was added to the serum-free medium for 3 h, with the appropriate vehicle added. Me2SO was used as vehicle in most experiments involving inhibitors. siRNA Transfection—PP2A-specific siRNA sequence (20-25 nucleotides) was derived from the Mus musculus protein phosphatase 2a, catalytic subunit α isoform (GenBank™ accession number NM_019411), which is 97.84% homologous to Rattus norvegicus PP2A (GenBank accession number NM_017039). FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was mixed with 10 μm PP2A or 10 μm control (non-targeting un-conjugated) siRNA (3:3.4 μl) in serum-free medium, to a total volume of 100 μl and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. IEC-6 cells at a relatively early passage were grown to 50% confluence in 12-well plates. For transfection, the cell monolayer was rinsed with serum-free medium and the siRNA/FuGENE mixture was added dropwise onto the cell monolayer and further incubated for 30 h at 37 °C. Cells were serum starved for 24 h, treated with TNF-α/CHX for 3 h, and subjected to quantitative DNA fragmentation analysis. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated control siRNA was used to monitor the efficiency of transfection. Quantitative DNA Fragmentation Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cells were grown in 12-well culture plates for both DNA fragmentation and protein determination. After treatment, floating cells were discarded, and the attached cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed and centrifuged to remove the nuclei. An aliquot of the nuclei-free supernatant was placed in streptavidin-coated wells, respectively. A mixture of anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA peroxidase-conjugated antibody for DNA fragmentation was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After incubation, the sample was removed and the wells were washed 3 times with incubation buffer. After the final wash was removed, 100 μl of the peroxidase substrate, 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazolin-sulfonate), was placed in the wells and incubated at room temperature. The absorbance was read at 405 nm using a microplate reader. Results were expressed as absorbance 405 nm/min/mg protein. Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of protein (100-200 μg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the presence of 2 μg of Bcl-2 or anti-phosphotyrosine or PP2A catalytic subunit-specific antibodies and adsorbed overnight at 4 °C to protein A-Sepharose beads. Samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm CaCl2. Protein A-Sepharose beads were resuspended in either SDS sample buffer or serine/threonine assay buffer and used for Western blot analysis or to assay PP2A activity, respectively. Measurement of PP2A Activity—PP2A protein immunoprecipitated as described above was used to determine enzyme activity using a PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit from Upstate USA Inc. following the manufacturer's instructions. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation assay was tested by the addition of 2 nm okadaic acid, a concentration that specifically inhibits PP2A activity in vitro. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were first washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed for 10 min in ice-cold extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants from 25 to 50 μg of protein were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and eluted in 1× SDS sample buffer for 5 min and separated on 10-15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred overnight to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C in TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk (blotting grade, Bio-Rad). Membranes were subsequently incubated with secondary antibody-conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h, and the immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL detection system. Blots were stripped and probed with the indicated antibodies to determine equal loading of the samples. Cytochrome c Release—IEC-6 cells were grown in control and DFMO containing media as described earlier in the section on apoptosis. Cells were either treated with 10 nm okadaic acid or left untreated for 1 h. TNF-α/CHX was added to each well, and plates were further incubated for 30 min. 1 μl of mitosensor reagent, prepared in incubation buffer, was added to each well and further incubated for 30-45 min at 37 °C and washed 3 times with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence images were captured using a microscope with a bandpass filter to detect fluorescein and rhodamine. Aggregates of the mitosensor dye localized in the mitochondria exhibit red fluorescence, whereas its monomers in the cytoplasm, indicative of apoptotic cells, exhibit green fluorescence. Densitometry and Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. All experiments were repeated three times, with triplicate samples. Analysis of variance and appropriate post-hoc testing determined the significance of the differences between means. Values of p < 0.05 were regarded as significant. Polyamine Depletion Decreases PP2A Activity—Earlier reports from our laboratory have shown that polyamine depletion as a consequence of ODC inhibition by DFMO increases basal levels as well as TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of ERKs, IκBα, STAT3, and AKT (25Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Viar M.J. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G980-G991Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G479-G490Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Bhattacharya S. Ray R.M. Johnson L.R. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 759-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These proteins were phosphorylated on either serine or threonine residues, and phosphorylation persisted longer in polyamine-depleted cells compared with controls. These data suggest that the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylation of these proteins is inactivated in polyamine-depleted cells. We examined the activity of PP2A, which is inactivated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody and then subjected to Western blotting using an antibody specific for the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac). Results in Fig. 1A demonstrate that polyamine depletion did not alter the level of PP2Ac protein. However, tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly higher in cells grown in DFMO containing medium compared with those grown in control and DFMO plus putrescine containing media. Furthermore, polyamine depletion of cells significantly decreased PP2A enzyme activity (2-3-fold) compared with controls (Fig. 1B). Effect of Inhibition of PP2A on TNF-α-induced Apoptosis—Okadaic acid is the most widely used inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases. PP2A is inhibited most strongly, whereas PP2B is less sensitive, and PP2C is not inhibited (33Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid at the dose and conditions of our experiments is considered a selective inhibitor of PP2A. Fostriecin is the most selective small molecule inhibitor of protein phosphatases described to date and has a greater potency against PP2A than PP1 (34Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkaneu R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Lewy D.S. Gauss C.M. Soenen D.R. Boger D.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 22: 2005-2032Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We used okadaic acid and fostriecin to inhibit PP2A in the presence and absence of TNF-α, and measured DNA fragmentation as an index of apoptosis. Okadaic acid and fostriecin significantly decreased (65-70%) apoptosis in cells grown in control conditions (Fig. 2A). Cells grown in DFMO containing medium had significantly less apoptosis compared with cells grown in control conditions, and okadaic acid further decreased apoptosis almost 50% in these cells. We also determined the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A as described earlier (Fig. 1A) to ascertain the specificity of okadaic acid. Fig. 2B shows that okadaic acid increased the tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation of PP2A in control cells and those treated with TNF-α. Interestingly, TNF-α itself increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PP2A, suggesting that the initial response to TNF-α results in both anti- and proapoptotic signals. Although, TNF-α treatment in the presence or absence of okadaic acid increases PP2A phosphorylation, total amounts of PP2A protein levels remained unchanged. These results indicate that PP2A inactivation protects cells from apoptosis, and that decreased PP2A activity in response to polyamine depletion might be responsible for protection in these cells. Although okadaic acid and fostriecin are specific inhibitors of PP2A at doses used in this study, we used a molecular approach to prevent expression of PP2A protein by PP2A siRNA transfection. Transfection of cells with PP2A siRNA resulted in a 50% decrease in PP2A enzyme activity compared with cells transfected with control siRNA as well as untransfected cells (Fig. 3A). Cells transfected with siRNA for PP2A also showed a significant decrease in the expression of PP2A protein compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Transfection with PP2A siRNA significantly reduced DNA fragmentation in response to TNF-α compared with cells incubated with transfection reagent alone (Fig. 3C). One group of cells grown under the conditions of siRNA transfection was treated with 100 nm fostriecin, and showed almost 60% inhibition of DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3C), which is similar to that shown in Fig. 2A. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated control siRNA was used to monitor the transfection efficiency (data not shown). PP2A Mediates Bad Ser112 Phosphorylation via Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase—Inactivation of Bad involves the phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 112, 136, and 155, which decrease its affinity for Bcl-xL at the mitochondrial membrane and increases its cytoplasmic binding to protein 14-3-3 (1Garcia A. Cayla X. Guergnon J. Dessauge F. Hospital V. Rebollo M.P. Fleischer A. Rebollo A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 8Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Decreased PP2A activity in polyamine-depleted cells should increase the phosphorylation of Bad, and consequently inactivate it. Cells grown in the presence of DFMO had significantly higher levels of Bad protein phosphorylated at Ser112 compared with controls without any changes in the total amount of Bad protein (Fig. 4A). Because TNF-α also induced tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of PP2A (Fig. 2B), we determined the phosphorylation of Bad during 1.5-6.0 h exposure to TNF-α. Phosphorylation of Bad (Ser112) decreased progressively during the 1.5-6.0 h exposure to TNF-α in cells grown in control groups (Fig. 4B). However, a significantly higher level of Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 was evident in polyamine-depleted cells than in either control or DFMO plus putrescine groups. Unlike control cells, phosphorylation of Bad Ser112 was maintained during the entire time course in polyamine-depleted cells. Total Bad protein levels were almost identical in all three groups, changing only slightly during the entire time course. Levels of actin were the same in all three groups. Next, we determined whether PP2A inhibition by okadaic acid increased phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112. Okadaic acid increased Bad phosphorylation at Ser112 of control cells both in the presence and absence of TNF-α, indicating that inhibition of PP2A inactivates Bad by phosphorylation at Ser112.

The best characterized of these related transporters is the plant vacuolar localized CAX1. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the impact of altering the seven histidine residues to alanine within Arabidopsis CAX1. The mutants were expressed in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that is sensitive to Ca2+ and other metals. By utilizing a yeast growth assay, the H338A mutant was the only mutation that appeared to alter Ca2+ transport activity. The CAX1 His338 residue is conserved among various CAX transporters and may be located within a filter for cation selection. We proceeded to mutate His338 to every other amino acid residue and utilized yeast growth assays to estimate the transport properties of the 19 CAX mutants. Expression of 16 of these His338 mutants could not rescue any of the metal sensitivities. However, expression of H338N, H338Q, and H338K allowed for some growth on media containing Ca2+. Most interestingly, H338N exhibited increased tolerance to Cd2+ and Zn2+. Endomembrane fractions from yeast cells were used to measure directly the transport of H338N. Although the H338N mutant demonstrated 25% of the wild type Ca2+/H+ transport, it showed an increase in transport for both Cd2+ and Zn2+ reflected in a decrease in the Km for these substrates.

Cation exchanger (CAX) 1The abbreviations used are: CAX, cation exchanger; sCAX, N-terminal truncated CAX; TM, transmembrane domain; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. -like cation/proton antiporters are a group of proteins that export cations out of the cytosol to maintain ion homeostasis across biological membranes (1Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). They are energized by the pH gradient established by proton pumps such as the H+-ATPase or H+-pyrophosphatase (2Gaxiola R. Fink G. Hirschi K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CAX-like exchangers have been classified as one of the five families of exchangers that make up the cation/H+ exchanger superfamily (3Cai X. Lytton J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1692-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The plethora of genomic sequencing has identified ∼130 CAX-like transporters from bacteria, fungi, and plants. 2T. Shigaki, I. Rees, and K. Hirschi, submitted for publication. The term CAX was first used to describe the cation exchangers CAX1 and CAX2 in Arabidopsis thaliana (5Hirschi K. Zhen R. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These transporters were identified by function. Namely, N-terminal truncations of these proteins (sCAX1 and sCAX2) suppressed the Ca2+ sensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport. Cation specificities of CAXs may vary, and there is evidence that specificities may be determined by local primary structures. By using yeast assays, a sequence of 9 amino acids from CAX1 can confer strong calcium transport ability to its homologue CAX3 (6Shigaki T. Cheng N. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A 3-amino acid-long manganese specificity determinant in TM4 of CAX2 has also been identified (7Shigaki T. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6610-6617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Substrate selectivity of the rice cation/H+ exchanger OsCAX1a appears to be dependent on residues in internal repeat regions (termed c-1 and c-2) located between TM3 and TM4 and between TM8 and TM9 (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ability to manipulate the expression levels and substrate specificity of these transporters may positively affect plant properties through increasing the nutrition quality of foods or through the removal of toxic metals from soils (9Park S. Kim C. Pike L. Smith R. Hirschi K. Mol. Breed. 2004; 14: 275-282Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Hirschi K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2338-2342Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Other transporters have also been engineered with altered transport properties. For example, histidyl residues in many transporters have been shown to play critical roles in transporter function (11Chen X.Z. Steel A. Hediger M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is particularly the case for membrane proteins involved in H+ translocation or those that exhibit H+ sensing. Histidine residues may also function in substrate recognition, interaction of helices, and for coupling conformational changes between helices (12Wiebe C.A. Dibattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All the characterized CAX transporters are about 400 amino acids long and are predicted to have 11 membrane-spanning domains with several conserved histidine residues. 2T. Shigaki, I. Rees, and K. Hirschi, submitted for publication. However, no methodical analysis has been undertaken on the functional role of these amino acids in CAX transporters. Identification of novel substrates of CAXs, and determining structural requirements for ion specificity, will provide important information for constructing “designer” proteins to utilize for plant improvement. With this long range goal in mind, this immediate study demonstrates the effects of point mutations in the histidine residues of CAX1. Although a series of mutations in six of the seven histidines did not appear to alter transporter function, we show that a histidine to alanine mutation at position 338 can effectively abolish the transport function of sCAX1. A systematic analysis of sCAX1 variants in which His338 has been altered to 19 other amino acids affords new insights into the involvement of this region in substrate specificity. Most interestingly, specific sCAX1 variants increase metal transport while dramatically decreasing Ca2+ transport. These mutants now offer novel tools by which nutrients and toxic metals can be redistributed across plant membranes. Yeast Strains, Vectors, and DNA Manipulations—The yeast strain K667 (cnb1::LEU2 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1) was used to express the wild type CAX1 and mutant constructs. The clones were propagated in either pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and inserts were transferred to the shuttle vector piHGpd (13Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) for their expression in yeast. The plasmids were introduced into yeast by lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol transformation (14Geitz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar), and standard techniques were used to manipulate DNA (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—CAX1 mutants were produced by class IIS restriction enzyme-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (16Shigaki T. Hirschi K. Anal.

Ca2+ and Metal Transport Assays—Yeast vacuole membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (7Shigaki T. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6610-6617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For the measurement of 45Ca2+ uptake, membrane vesicles were incubated in buffer containing 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm sodium azide, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. H+ translocation by the vacuolar H+-ATPase was initiated by the addition of 1 mm MgSO4 and 1 mm ATP. The vesicles were allowed to reach steady state with respect to pH gradient for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of 45Ca2+ (6 mCi ml–1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). The final concentration of Ca2+ in the reaction mixture was 10 mm. Proton-coupled metal exchange was measured in yeast vacuole vesicles (30 μg of protein) by monitoring the metal-dependent recovery of quinacrine (6-chloro-9-{[4-(diethylamino)-1-methylbutyl]amino}-2-methoxyacridine dihydrochloride) fluorescence following the formation of an inside acid pH gradient across the vesicles generated by activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase, as described previously (19Barkla B.J. Vera-Estrella R. Maldonado-Gamma M. Pantoja O. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was monitored in a thermostated cell at 25 °C using a fluorescence spectrometer (model LS-50, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 427 and 495 nm, respectively, both with a slit width of 5 nm. As shown by Bennett and Spanswick (20Bennett A. Spanswick R. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 71: 95-107Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the rate of fluorescence recovery is directly proportional to proton flux. Thus initial rates of fluorescence recovery represent initial rates of proton-dependent metal transport. Assay for Yeast Suppression—The assay for metal tolerance on solid agar was as described previously (6Shigaki T. Cheng N. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Shigaki T. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6610-6617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to characterize the role of histidine residues in the translocation of metal ions in the Arabidopsis CAX1 transporter. Like other CAXs from a variety of different organisms, analysis of the 463-amino acid sequence suggests that the protein has 11 TMs (Fig. 1A). CAX1 has an acidic motif in the cytosolic loop between TM6 and TM7 and repetitive domains between TM3 and TM4 and between TM8 and TM9 of 36 residues, 14 of which are identical (repeats c-1 and c-2 (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar)). There are seven histidine residues in the CAX1 polypeptide at positions 35, 210, 259, 338, 412, 443, and 446. We initially generated a H35A variant of CAX1 to determine whether this would disrupt the autoinhibitory domain. Previously, we showed that the N-terminal domain (the first 36 amino acids) of CAX1 inhibits the ion transport activity in yeast assays (17Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We cloned the H35A CAX1 open reading frame into a high copy yeast expression plasmid and expressed this plasmid in a yeast strain deficient in vacuolar Ca2+ transporters and lacking functional calcineurin (5Hirschi K. Zhen R. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This strain (K667) lacks the endogenous vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase PMC1 and vacuolar H+/Ca2+ antiporter VCX1 and thus is defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport, making it unable to grow on high Ca2+ media such as 200 mm CaCl2 (21Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The H35A mutant of CAX1 remained autoinhibited when expressed in yeast (unable to grow on the Ca2+-containing media; data not shown). For the remainder of our studies, we used a truncated CAX1 (sCAX1) that removed the first 36 residues from the full-length cDNA (CAX1). High level expression of sCAX1 suppresses the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of K667 cells. When the six sCAX1 mutants (H210A, H259A, H338A, H412A, H443A, and H446A) were similarly expressed in K667 cells on Ca2+-containing media, only the H338A mutant showed an altered phenotype compared with sCAX1. In H338A-expressing K667 cells, the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype was not suppressed, highlighting the importance of this residue in the Ca2+ transport of CAX1 (Fig. 1C). To demonstrate that the changes in transport were not due to alterations in protein expression or stability, we generated a c-myc tagged version of H338A and several of the other histidine mutants, and the tags were expressed in K667 cells. These tagged transporters retained the same growth phenotypes as the original sCAX1 variants. Immunoblotting of the crude membrane fractions prepared from the various CAX1 mutant expressing yeast cells demonstrated approximately equal accumulation of the tagged protein (Fig. 1D; data not shown). We confirmed the differences in calcium sensitivity of the mutants by measuring 45Ca2+ uptake activity using isolated membrane vesicles. In this system, the pH gradient across yeast vacuolar membrane vesicles was generated by activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase. The vesicles of sCAX1-expressing cells took up 45Ca2+ from the medium in a pH- and time-dependent manner for up to 10 min (Fig. 2, sCAX1). The accumulated 45Ca2+ was released after the addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Fig. 2, 12 min). In the absence of ATP or in the presence of gramicidin, a protonophore that dissipates the pH gradient (6Shigaki T. Cheng N. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), no such activity was detected. Membrane vesicles of yeast cells expressing an empty vector or H338A had negligible activity (Fig. 2). These results corroborate that sCAX1 but not H338A could function as a Ca2+/H+ exchanger in yeast. The His338 residue of CAX1 is part of the c-2 repeat that contains the consensus sequence GNAAEHX6AXDX2LGX3GSX2QX3FX found in various CAX transporters (Fig. 1B). This region has been proposed to function as a cation selectivity filter (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In order to determine further the importance of His338, this residue was changed to all possible amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis (Table I) (16Shigaki T. Hirschi K. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 118-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and yeast cells expressing these variants of sCAX1 were tested on a variety of media containing different metals. Yeast cells expressing 3 of the 19 His338 variants and the wild type sCAX1 demonstrated tolerance to 50 mm CaCl2. The cells expressing the wild type sCAX1 were the most tolerant to Ca2+ in the media, but H338N > H338Q > H338K were all able to grow at low levels of Ca2+ (Table II). To confirm the yeast growth phenotypes on Ca2+-containing media, we measured 45Ca2+ transport activity directly. Membranes isolated from yeast expressing the H338N mutant demonstrated ∼25% of the Ca2+ transport activity when compared with His338-expressing cells (Fig. 2). Because of the limited sensitivity of the transport assay, we were unable to reproducibly detect Ca2+ transport activity in the H338Q- and H338K-expressing cells.Table IISupression of metal sensitivity of the yeast strain K667 expressing various sCAX1 mutantsAmino acids at position 338Growth on 50 mm Ca2+Growth on 5 μm Cd2+Ala--Arg--Asn+++++++++Asp--Cys--Glu--Gln++++++Gly--His (WT)++++++++Ile--Leu--Lys+++Met--Phe--Pro--Ser--Thr--Trp--Tyr--Val-- Open table in a new tab Yeast cells expressing the same four constructs (sCAX1, H338N, H338Q, and H338K) also conferred tolerance to Cd2+ (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Vector controls and strains expressing other CAX transporters will not grow well in media containing 2 or 3 μm Cd2+ (data not shown). Furthermore, ion competition studies suggest that sCAX1 is capable of transporting both Ca2+ and Cd2+ (6Shigaki T. Cheng N. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), discounting the possibility that other metal ions transported by CAX1 produce this metal tolerance. To investigate further the difference in metal tolerance of H338N-expressing cells as compared with sCAX1, we studied metal-dependent H+-transport in isolated membrane vesicles from yeast vacuoles. The ability of H338N-expressing yeast cells to confer higher Cd2+ and Zn2+ tolerance suggested a greater transport capability of this mutant for these metals. Quinacrine fluorescence recovery was used to monitor the dissipation of a preset transmembrane pH gradient (generated by activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase), following the addition of different metal ions. For both Zn2+ and Cd2+ ions, H338N demonstrated a higher metal/H+-dependent transport activity than that measured in sCAX1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Other metal ions tested, including Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, showed no detectable H+-dependent transport activity in either sCAX1 or the H338N-expressing cells, confirming the growth phenotype observed on these metals (Fig. 5; data not shown). Furthermore, no Zn2+- nor Cd2+-dependent H+ transport was measured in the K667 vector control strain confirming that metal transport required the presence of sCAX1 (data not shown).Fig. 5Specificity of metal-dependent proton transport in isolated vacuolar membrane vesicles from yeast cells expressing H338N. A preset, steady-state pH gradient (inside acidic) was generated by activation of the H+-ATPase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The recovery of quinacrine fluorescence, indicative of metal/H+ exchange, was measured upon addition of 300 μm CdCl2, ZnCl2, MnCl2, NiCl2, or CoCl2. The results are original traces from one experiment representative of a total of four. F, fluorescence intensity, is relative to that prior to addition of metal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of the data showed that increased metal transport in the H338N-expressing yeast cells was a result of a decrease in the Km value for the metals with little or no change in the Vmax values. The Km values for Cd2+ decreased from a value of 230 μm in sCAX1 to a value of 187 μm in the H338N mutant, whereas the Vmax values increased slightly from 150%F min–1 mg–1 protein to 164%F min–1 mg–1 protein (Fig. 6A). In the case of Zn2+, the Km values decreased from a value of 225 μm in sCAX1 to a value of 162 μm in H338N, whereas the Vmax values showed little change; from 144%F min–1 mg–1 protein in sCAX1 to 149%F min–1 mg–1 protein in H338N (Fig. 6B). We used site-directed mutagenesis to modify the histidine residues in CAX1. Histidine residues have been shown to be important functional determinants in various membrane proteins, including those involved in H+ translocation and H+ sensing (12Wiebe C.A. Dibattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data presented here strongly implicate the His338 as being vital for the kinetic properties and ion selectivity of this transporter. We performed histidine-scanning mutagenesis throughout the CAX1 transporter. Only His338 appears to be required for sCAX1 Ca2+ transport, as mutations at His35, His210, His259, His412, His443, and His446 did not alter transport as measured by the yeast suppression assay (Fig. 1). His338 is closely associated with predicted transmembrane domain 8 and is part of the c-2 domain (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have reported on the importance of this region, our studies firmly establish that this motif is involved in the ionic filter. Previously, work with the rice cation/H+ exchanger (OsCAX1a) has shown that replacing His330 (in the equivalent position of His338 in CAX1) with arginine or alanine (H330R or H330A) abolished activity in yeast (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). His330 of OsCAX1a, like His338 of CAX1, is located within a repetitive motif designated c-2 that contains a conserved GNXXEH motif, and similar residues are found in animal Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mutation of the glutamic acid residue of OsCAX1a (E329D) severely reduced the ability of mutant yeast to grow in high Ca2+ medium (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This evidence has been used to suggest that this region of the CAX transporters may form an ion filter within the protein (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Like OsCAX1a H330R, the CAX1 H338A mutant, and 15 other His338 mutants, lost Ca2+ transport activity (Table II). There are several possible mechanisms that could contribute to the reduced transport activity of a particular mutant. For example, the mutation may cause the transporter to misfold and consequentially be targeted for degradation (22Zhou F. Pan Z. Ma J. You G. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the altered protein may not be correctly targeted to the tonoplast. However, the epitope-tagged version of H338A is highly expressed in crude membrane fractions, and several mutants at position 338 are active in Ca2+ transport (Fig. 1D; see below), implying proper expression and localization of CAX1 variants that have replaced His338 with another amino acid. Furthermore, the H338N-expressing cells demonstrate increased transport of Cd2+ and Zn2+ when compared with wild type. This implies that there is not a decrease in tonoplastlocated CAX1 protein among these variants. In the topology of CAX1, the c-2 repeat is thought to form a re-entrant loop and act as a region involved in cation translocation (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The c-2 region contains several hydrophilic residues that may act as a solvent-accessible region that forms an ion filter (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing several of the His338 variants (H338K, H338N, and H228Q) are only able to weakly suppress the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype, but some confer robust growth on media containing several different metals (Table II; Fig. 3). Because the yeast strains are sensitive to high levels of both Cd2+ and Zn2+, the concentrations used in the yeast growth assays were significantly lower than those used in the in vitro transport assays. Nonetheless, direct transport measurements from membranes prepared from H338N-expressing cells agreed with the growth phenotypes, i.e. the tolerant mutants had higher transport rates for Zn2+ and Cd2+ reflected in lower Km values but reduced Ca2+ transport (Figs. 2 and 4). These experimental observations suggest that rather than destroying the filter, these mutants have altered ion selectivity. Our hypothesis is that the H338N variants have an increased Km value for Ca2+ transport; however, the negligible Ca2+ transport measured in H338N-expressing cells makes precise measurements of changes in Ca2+ kinetic parameters difficult. The four amino acids at residue 338 that can confer calcium tolerance are similar in hydropathy (Fig. 7). This suggests hydropathy is an important determining factor for cation selectivity within the c-2 region. Despite the similar hydropathy of Asp and Glu to His, Lys, Asn, and Gln residues, these negatively charged amino acids at position 338 cannot confer calcium tolerance in yeast (Table II). Given that there is another Glu residue adjacent to His338, we hypothesize that the H338D and H338E variants are nonfunctional because of an excess of negative charge within the filter domain (Fig. 1B). The selectivity of H338N for Cd2+ > Ca2+ (Figs. 3, 4, 5) suggests that the putative filter domain of H338N appears to be able to discriminate between these similar ions (ionic radius for Cd2+ is 97 Å whereas that of Ca2+ is 99 Å). However, extensive alterations in this region appear to inhibit completely the Ca2+ activity of the transporter (see above). The fact that H338N also has increased affinity for Zn2+ is intriguing (ionic radius of 74 Å) and confirms that alterations in His338 affect the uptake of other metals, as indicated by our preliminary findings using the yeast growth assay and transport experiments (data not shown and Fig. 5). The observation that changes in hydrophilic residues within the transporter filter can change substrate specificity has been detailed with K+ channels and other transporters (23Gaber R. Dreyer I.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, a Q103A mutation in the plant metal transporter IRT1 apparently eliminated zinc transport but did not alter the transport of other metals (25Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Similarly, a T354A mutant of OsCAX1 may increase Mn2+ transport without altering Ca2+ transport (8Kamiya T. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 812-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the IRT1 and OsCAX1 studies utilized yeast growth assays to infer transport function, and thus the kinetic changes in these transporters can only be inferred. The role of histidines can vary for different transporters and can also depend on the position of the residue within the protein sequence. For some channel proteins such as the guard cell inward-rectifying K+ channel, KST1, and the cardiac pacemaker channel NCN2, the histidine residues appear to be involved in a pH-sensing mechanism (26Hoth S.

In the sucrose/H+ cotransporter, SUC1, a histidine residue is implicated in substrate recognition and directly in the transport reaction (28Lu J.M.-Y. Bush D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9025-9030Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In human H+/peptide cotransporters, two different histidines play two different roles; one conserved histidyl residue appears to be important for translocation of protons (29Fei Y. Sugawara M. Nakanishi T. Huang W. Wang H. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23707-2371730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas the second seems to be responsible for the recognition of transportable peptide substrates (11Chen X.Z. Steel A. Hediger M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although these are only some examples, such a diverse role of histidine residues is not surprising; histidine is capable of forming intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. These bonds can have a variety of effects on the protein, from inducing conformational changes and changes in pore size to influencing activity and transport of H+ and other ions (12Wiebe C.A. Dibattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This site-directed mutagenesis study will help future crystallography studies to define the quaternary structure of CAX1 and other H+/cation exchangers. The ability to manipulate the metal transport activity and selectivity of CAX transporters through simple mutations, as has been demonstrated in this study, holds promise that plants can be custom-engineered to become metal accumulators, enhancing characteristics needed when selecting plants to be employed as phytoremediators.

https://openalex.org/W1982433403,"Although some members of Ras family small GTPases, including M-Ras, share the primary structure of their effector regions with Ras, they exhibit vastly different binding properties to Ras effectors such as c-Raf-1. We have solved the crystal structure of M-Ras in the GDP-bound and guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)-bound forms. The overall structure of M-Ras resembles those of H-Ras and Rap2A, except that M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p exhibits a distinctive switch I conformation, which is caused by impaired intramolecular interactions between Thr-45 (corresponding to Thr-35 of H-Ras) of the effector region and the γ-phosphate of Gpp(NH)p. Previous 31P NMR studies showed that H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p exists in two interconverting conformations, states 1 and 2. Whereas state 2 is a predominant form of H-Ras and corresponds to the “on” conformation found in the complex with effectors, state 1 is thought to represent the “off” conformation, whose tertiary structure remains unknown. 31P NMR analysis shows that free M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p predominantly assumes the state 1 conformation, which undergoes conformational transition to state 2 upon association with c-Raf-1. These results indicate that the solved structure of M-Ras-Gp-p(NH)p corresponds to the state 1 conformation. The predominance of state 1 in M-Ras is likely to account for its weak binding ability to the Ras effectors, suggesting the importance of the tertiary structure factor in small GTPase-effector interaction. Further, the first determination of the state 1 structure provides a molecular basis for developing novel anti-cancer drugs as compounds that hold Ras in the state 1 “off” conformation.

Small GTPases H-, K-, and N-Ras, collectively called Ras, are the products of the ras proto-oncogenes and function as molecular switches by cycling between a GTP-bound “on” state and a GDP-bound “off” state in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Barbacid M.

The conformational change induced by GTP binding enables Ras to execute downstream signaling through direct interaction with its effectors, such as Raf kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinases, RalGDS family proteins, and phospholipase Cϵ (4Corbett K.D. Alber T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 710-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Conversion from the GDP-bound state to the GTP-bound state is controlled positively or negatively by GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins, respectively (4Corbett K.D. Alber T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 710-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). In particular, GEFs enhance the formation of the GTP-bound active conformation in response to upstream signals mediated by various cell surface receptors. Impairment of the GTPase activity is the most common biochemical defect associated with oncogenic Ras mutations. Ras comprises the Ras family of small GTPases together with a number of its relatives, including Rap1, Rap2, R-Ras, M-Ras, Ral, Rin, Rit, Rheb, etc. Crystal structure of H-Ras indicated that the exchange of guanine nucleotide results in allosteric conformational changes in two adjacent regions of Ras, termed “switch I” and “switch II” (5Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic and NMR analyses of H-Ras and Rap1A in complex with the RBDs of c-Raf-1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ or with the Ras-associating domain of RalGDS revealed that switch I (residues 32-38 in H-Ras) almost overlaps with the effector region (residues 32-40), which forms a principal interface for effector recognition (6Nassar N.

On the other hand, switch II (residues 60-75) plays a limited role in the effector recognition, whereas it plays a crucial role in interaction with GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (5Vetter I.R.

Association with c-Raf-1 RBD induced transition of state 1 to state 2, suggesting that state 1 and 2 corresponds to the “off” and “on” conformations of H-Ras-GTP, respectively. Whereas state 2 corresponds to the structure found in the crystals of H-Ras as well as in its complex with the effectors (10Geyer M. Schweins T. Herrmann C. Prisner T. Wittinghofer A. Kalbitzer H.R.

Like other Ras family members, Rap1, Rap2, R-Ras, and R-Ras2 (TC21), M-Ras share the identical effector region with Ras. Overexpression of the mutationally activated form of M-RasQ71L causes cellular transformation or inhibition of differentiation as well as H-RasQ61L (12Kimmelman A. Tolkacheva T. Lorenzi M.V. Osada M. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). M-Ras is shown to interact, although poorly, with some of the Ras effectors, including c-Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf, phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ, RalGDS, and Rin1, resulting in weak activation of the downstream cascades (13Quilliam L.A.

McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4943-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). On the other hand, M-Ras appears to have its own effectors, such as Rap-specific GEFs, RA(PDZ)-GEF-2, and MR-GEF, which possess an Ras-associating domain exhibiting direct and specific interaction with M-Ras-GTP (15Rebhun J.F.

Little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying such differences in effector recognition between Ras and M-Ras. To address this problem, we have determined the crystal structures of M-Ras-GDP and M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p. The overall structure of M-Ras resembles those of H-Ras and Rap2A, except that M-Ras-Gp-p(NH)p exhibits a distinctive switch I conformation, which is caused by impaired intramolecular interactions, in particular the interaction between Thr-45 (corresponding to Thr-35 of H-Ras) and the γ-phosphate group of Gpp(NH)p. From 31P NMR analysis, free M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p is shown to predominantly assume the state 1 conformation, which undergoes conformational transition to state 2 upon association with c-Raf-1 RBD. These results indicate that the solved structure of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p corresponds to the state 1 conformation. The predominance of state 1 in M-Ras may account for its weak binding ability to the Ras effectors, providing a new insight into the mechanism whereby small GTPases with the identical effector region make differential interactions with their effectors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Mouse M-Ras (residues 1-178), human H-Ras (residues 1-166), and c-Raf-1 RBD (residues 50-131) were expressed as fusions with GST using pGEX-6p-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). After removal of the GST tag by cleavage with Prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences), the proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography to achieve a final purity of >95% as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used for the crystallization and NMR spectroscopy.Crystallization of M-Ras-GDP and M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p—Crystals of M-Ras-GDP were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C using the reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and 50 mm potassium phosphate at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Gpp(NH)p loading of M-Ras was achieved with thorough degradation of the bound GDP using resin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (17Cherfils J. Menetrey J. Le Bras G.

Crystals of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p were grown by the hanging drop method at 20 °C using the reservoir solution containing 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 80 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 160 mm magnesium acetate at a protein concentration of 18 mg/ml. The guanine nucleotide configuration of the protein was monitored on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The crystals of M-Ras-GDP and M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p were grown to the dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.1 × 0.1 and ∼0.2 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm3, respectively.Data Collection and Structure Determination—The data collections were carried out at BL40B2 and BL26B1 of SPring-8 (Harima) using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector and Rigaku RAXIS-V image plate detector, respectively. The data were collected at 100 K, processed using the program MOSFLM (18Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography 26.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Binding Assay—c-Raf-1 RBD (residues 50-131) was expressed with an N-terminal GST fusion and a C-terminal His6 tag using pGEX-6p-1. H-Ras (residues 1-166), M-Ras (residues 1-178), and their mutants were expressed as GST fusions. After the removal of the GST tag by cleavage with Prescission protease, the proteins were used for in vitro binding assays. Ras (10 pmol) were preloaded with [γ-35S]GTP (2000 cpm/pmol) and incubated with various concentrations of c-Raf-1-RBD-His6 at 4 °C for 2 h in 200 μl of the reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. After the incubation, 50 μl of Ni2+-NTA resin was added to collect c-Raf-1-RBD-His6. After washing the resin, radioactivities eluted from the resin with 250 mm imidazol were counted to calculate the amount of the bound Ras.NMR Spectroscopy—31P NMR spectra of M-Ras or H-Ras (1 mm) loaded with Gpp(NH)p were recorded in the presence or absence of c-Raf-1 RBD. Protein solutions in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol contained 10% D2O to get a lock signal. 31P NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE-500 NMR spectrometer operating at a phosphorous resonance frequency of 202 MHz. Measurements were performed in a 5-mm probe by using 5-mm Shigemi sample tubes at 5 °C. The 31P spectra were referenced as described previously (11Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R.

Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), and PyMOL (DeLano Scientific; available on the World Wide Web at pymol.sourceforge.net/).RESULTSStructure of M-Ras in Complex with GDP or Gpp(NH)p—The crystal structure of M-Ras-GDP was refined to 1.3 Å resolution (Table I). The final electron density is clear for all of the atoms except the N-terminal 9 residues. The structure consists of a central β-sheet and five α-helices like H-Ras (Fig. 1B). The β-sheet contains six strands, of which one is anti-parallel and five are parallel. The switch I and switch II regions, assigned to residues 42-48 and 70-85, respectively, by analogy with H-Ras (Fig. 1A), are well defined. For evaluation of the structural similarity, root mean square deviations were calculated based on a least-squares fitting of the 166 Cα atoms. The values were 2.56 Å between M-Ras-GDP and H-Ras-GDP (Protein Data Bank identification code 4Q21), 2.67 Å between M-Ras-GDP and Rap2A-GDP (Protein Data Bank identification code 1KAO), and 2.73 Å between H-Ras-GDP and Rap2A-GDP, indicating that the overall structure of M-Ras-GDP resembles those of H-Ras-GDP and Rap2A-GDP. The switch II region of M-Ras-GDP, consisting of α2-helix and the loop connecting β3-strand and α2-helix (switch II loop), has a short insertion of a310-helix (residues 72-74) (Fig. 1B). Presence of a 310-helix in the switch II region is unprecedented in GDP-bound forms of any Ras family GTPases in the Protein Data Bank data base.The structure of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p was refined to 2.2 Å resolution (Table I). There is no interpretable electron density for the N-terminal residues 1-10 and for residues 69-73, which form a part of the switch II loop (Fig. 2A). The overall structures of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p and M-Ras-GDP superimpose well (root mean square deviation of 161 Cα atoms = 1.02 Å) except for the switch regions (Fig. 2A). In the GDP-bound forms, the switch I loop of M-Ras, that connects α1-helix and β2-strand, overlaps well with those of H-Ras and Rap2A (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in the Gpp(NH)p-bound forms, the conformation of the switch I loop of M-Ras exhibited a marked deviation from those of H-Ras and Rap2A (Fig. 2B). This was evidenced by calculation of root mean square deviations of seven Cα atoms of the switch I region. The values were 2.13 Å between M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p and H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p (Protein Data Bank identification code 5P21), 2.19 Å between M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p and Rap2A-GTP (Protein Data Bank identification code 3RAP chain R), and 0.43 Å between H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p and Rap2A-GTP. In addition, M-Ras switch I was apparently pulled away from the guanine nucleotide, especially at the region around Thr-45. These conformational features of M-Ras switch I prompted us to make a close examination of the electron density map around the nucleotide-binding site, because Mg2+ coordinated and direct interactions between the phosphate groups of GTP and the residues in switch I, switch II, and the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop, residues 10-18) are known to be crucial for stabilizing the conformations of the switch regions (5Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the comparison of the Mg2+-binding site between H-Ras and M-Ras. In the case of H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p (Protein Data Bank identification code 5P21), Mg2+ ion is coordinated to one oxygen each of the β- and γ-phosphates and to the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr-35 and the P-loop residue Ser-17. These interactions are conserved among various nucleotide-binding proteins (26Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 27Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). In addition, Asp-57 binds to the Mg2+-binding ligands, Ser-17 and Wat-173, making an indirect interaction with the Mg2+ ion. The main chain carbonyl group of Asp-33 forms hydrogen bonds with Wat-172, making indirect interactions with the α- and β-phosphates. In addition, the switch II residue Gly-60 (not shown) makes a direct interaction with the γ-phosphate. The Mg2+-binding site of Rap2A-GTP (Protein Data Bank ID code 3RAP) bears similar hydrogen bonding networks to H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p (not shown). In contrast, Thr-45 of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p (corresponding to Thr-35 of H-Ras) fails to interact with the Mg2+ ion and any phosphate groups, although the hydroxyl groups of Ser-27 make hydrogen bonds with Mg2+ ion and the β- and γ-phosphates like those of H-Ras Ser-17 (Fig. 3A). The corresponding position where the hydroxyl group of Thr-35 of H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p exists is occupied by Wat-3. Asp-67, like H-Ras Asp-57, binds to the side chain of Ser-27 and Wat-1, making an indirect interaction with the Mg2+ ion, but Asp-43 fails to make an indirect interaction with any phosphate groups via Wat-2 (Fig. 3A). Because the 2Fo - Fc map for the residues 69-73 was invisible in the M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p crystal, the association of Gly-70 in switch II with the γ-phosphate could not be examined. Collectively, the most remarkable difference found in the nucleotide-binding interfaces between M-Ras and H-Ras/Rap2A is an impairment of the direct and Mg2+-coordinated interactions of Thr-45 with the γ-phosphate group. The interaction between Thr-35 and the γ-phosphate of H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p is thought to stabilize the switch I loop by affecting the hydrogen bonding network involving Thr-35, Ser-17, and Asp-57 and thereby yield a formation of links between switch I loop, α1-helix, and β3-strand (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the loss of this interaction in M-Ras may have caused a drastic shift of the switch I loop, yielding an open conformation (Figs. 2B and 3B).Fig. 2Structural features of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p.

The orientation of the α2-helix of M-Ras-Gpp(NH)p shows a remarkable difference from those of H-Ras and Rap2A (Fig. 4). This seems to be a peculiar property of M-Ras switch II, because the orientation in the GTP-bound form is generally conserved among various GTPases, including H-Ras and Rap2A (17Cherfils J.

On the other hand, electron paramagnetic resonance and31P NMR studies of H-Ras-Gpp(NH)p had suggested that the coordination of Thr-35 to the γ-phosphate is transient in solution and that some population of H-Ras exhibits the loss of this interaction (10Geyer M.

This study demonstrates that HSV induces rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in several human target cells and that phosphorylation is important for entry post-binding. Nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore, and downstream events (including expression of immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation) were substantially reduced in cells transfected with dominant-negative mutants of FAK or small interfering RNA designed to inhibit FAK expression. These observations were substantiated using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived from embryonic FAK-deficient mice. Infection was reduced by >90% in knockout cells relative to control cells and was further reduced if the knockout cells were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2, which was also phosphorylated in response to HSV. The knockout cells were permissive for viral binding, and virus triggered an intracellular calcium response, but nuclear transport was inhibited. Together, these results support a novel model for invasion that implicates FAK phosphorylation as important for delivery of viral capsids to the nuclear pore.

Novel strategies to prevent HSV-2 and other sexually transmitted infections are urgently needed. Development of new approaches requires an understanding of the molecular and cellular events critical for the establishment of infection. Previous work demonstrates that HSV entry is a complex process requiring the following steps: (i) binding to heparan sulfate receptors; (ii) engagement of glycoprotein D coreceptors; (iii) penetration, which, for human epithelial cells, is mediated primarily by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane; (iv) transport of the viral tegument protein VP16 (trans-inducing factor (αTIF)) to the nucleus; and (v) transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore with release of viral DNA into the nucleoplasm (1Sodeik B. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 2Spear P.G. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10179-10185Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein B plays the major role in mediating binding of HSV-2 to heparan sulfate receptors, whereas glycoprotein C plays a more dominant role in mediating binding of HSV-1 (3Cheshenko N. Herold B.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2247-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For both serotypes, glycoproteins B, D, and H-L are required for penetration, but their precise role and the cellular pathways important for viral invasion have not been fully elucidated. The observations that heparan sulfate is the major attachment receptor for HSV and that heparan sulfate moieties also interact with gp120 of HIV fostered the development of sulfated or sulfonated polymers as candidate topical microbicides to prevent viral transmission. These compounds prevent genital herpes in the mouse and simian immunodeficiency virus in the macaque and are currently being evaluated in Phase II/III clinical trials (5Keller M.J. Klotman M.E. Herold B.C. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 51: 1099-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Keller M.J. Tuyama A. Carlucci M.J. Herold B.C. J. Antimicrobial. Chemother. 2005; 55: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, competitive antagonists of viral binding are not likely to be sufficient to fully protect against sexual transmission. Experience with systemic therapy indicates that combination therapies that target more than one step in the viral life cycle are optimal. Thus, elucidating the cellular pathways required for viral entry may provide novel targets for microbicide development. We reported previously that both serotypes of HSV trigger inositol triphosphate-mediated release of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and that Ca2+ signaling plays a critical role in viral entry (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Pharmacological inhibition of ER Ca2+ release or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ reduces nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16, a surrogate marker for capsid transport, and the downstream events in the viral life cycle, including expression of viral immediate-early genes and viral plaque formation. Activation of Ca2+ signaling is associated with triggering of phosphorylation signaling pathways. Specifically, we observed previously that HSV-1 and HSV-2 trigger the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) within 5-10 min following exposure of Vero (monkey kidney) or CaSki (human cervical epithelial) cells to virus. FAK phosphorylation appears to occur downstream of release of ER Ca2+ stores, as treatment of cells with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inositol triphosphate receptor antagonist that prevents release of ER Ca2+, or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ blocks the virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK. Activation of both pathways (Ca2+ and FAK phosphorylation) requires exposure to entry-competent virus, as HSV-1 deleted in the glycoproteins essential for penetration (glycoproteins B, D, and H-L) fails to induce Ca2+ release or to trigger FAK phosphorylation, whereas Ca2+ release and phosphorylation are preserved following exposure to the repaired viruses and to inactivated virus, which retain the ability to penetrate cells. These findings led to the proposal of a new paradigm for HSV entry in which HSV triggers inositol triphosphate-mediated release of ER Ca2+ stores, which may facilitate fusion of the viral envelope and cell membrane, allowing delivery of capsids to the cytoplasm (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In response to activation of the Ca2+ pathways, we hypothesize that FAK and related signaling pathways are activated, which may promote transport of the viral capsids to the nuclear pores. This study was designed to test this hypothesis and to evaluate whether HSV exploits FAK signaling pathways to promote its nuclear transport. We used complementary molecular techniques, including dominant-negative variants, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and knockout cells, to explore the role played by FAK in HSV invasion. We tested the hypothesis with both serotypes using human and murine cells. Our findings indicate that FAK phosphorylation plays a central role in promoting transport of viral capsids. Cells and Viruses—CaSki (human cervical epithelial), CaCo-2 (human colonic epithelial), and SK-N-SH (human neuroblastoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immortalized human endocervical and ectocervical cells were a generous gift from R. N. Fichorova and D. J. Anderson (8Fichorova R.N. Rheinwald J.G. Anderson D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 847-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from embryonic FAK-deficient mice (FAK-/-) and control MEF cells (FAK+/+) were originally described by Ilic et al. (9Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar) and were a generous gift from I. H. Gelman (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The FAK+/+ cells were derived from the same age embryos (day 8). Cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium to minimize background tyrosine phosphorylation due to growth factors in serum. HSV-2(G) (provided by B. Roizman, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) and vesicular stomatitis virus-Indiana (provided by P. Palese, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) were grown on Vero cells. HSV-1 containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VP26 fusion protein (designated K26GFP) was a generous gift from P. Desai (The Johns Hopkins University) (10Desai P. Person S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7563-7568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heat-inactivated virus was prepared by heating to 56 °C for 30 min. Purification and Quantification of Viruses—For binding and Ca2+ studies, dextran-purified viruses were used as described previously (4Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herold B.C. Visalli R.J. Susmarski N. Brandt C.R. Spear P.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1211-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Titers of the purified virus were determined by plaque assays. Relative viral particle numbers were determined by comparing the amounts of glycoprotein D by optical densitometry after Western blotting with anti-glycoprotein D monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1103 (Rumbaugh-Goodwin Institute, Plantation, FL) as described previously (3Cheshenko N. Herold B.C. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2247-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Qie L. Marcellino D. Herold B.C. Virology. 1999; 256: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reagents—EGTA and ionomycin were purchased from Calbiochem and diluted in Me2SO or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) following the manufacturer's instructions. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Heparin and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids and Transfections—pKH3-FAK carrying the gene for wild-type FAK and pKH3-Y397 carrying the FAK gene with a Y397F mutation were gifts from J.-L. Guan (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). All transfections were done with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. CaSki, FAK+/+, and FAK-/- cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected with siRNA for FAK and Pyk2 and with control nonspecific siRNA using siRNA/ siAB™ assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at a concentration of 100 pmol/well. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with virus and analyzed for expression of phosphorylated FAK/FAK and phosphorylated Pyk2/Pyk2 by preparing cell lysates and performing Western blotting as detailed below. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were loaded with 25 mm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester prepared in PBS for 30-60 min, rinsed with PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and then exposed sequentially to PBS buffer or HSV diluted in PBS at 37 °C. The viral inoculum was equivalent to a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) equal to 1-5 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell. Using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted epifluorescence microscope linked to a cooled Pentamax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced with a digital imaging system (MetaFluor, Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA), [Ca2+]i was measured in individually identified fura-2-loaded cells visualized using a Nikon S Fluor ×40 objective (numerical aperture of 0.9 and window of 0.3) as described previously (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm, and the images were digitized for subsequent analysis. Images were acquired every 2-10 s. An intracellular calibration was performed at the conclusion of each experiment as described previously (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 8-15 cells were monitored for each experiment. Plaque Assays—Briefly, cells in 6-well dishes were exposed to virus for 2 h at 37 °C; the inoculum was removed; and cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were then overlaid with medium containing 0.5% methylcellulose for 48 h. For HSV-1(KOS) and HSV-2(G), plaques were counted by immunoassay (black plaque) (4Herold B.C. WuDunn D. Soltys N. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For vesicular stomatitis virus, cells were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose, fixed after 24 h with methanol, and stained with Giemsa stain. Unless indicated otherwise, the m.o.i. was selected to yield ∼200-500 pfu/well (e.g. m.o.i. ∼ 0.005 pfu/cell) on control wells. Viral Binding and VP16 Time Course Assays—To examine which steps in HSV infection are blocked in transfected or knockout cells, viral binding and VP16 transport to the nucleus were compared. For binding studies, cells were exposed to serial 2-fold dilutions of purified HSV-2(G) for 5 h at 4 °C. Unbound virus was removed by washing, and cell-bound virus was analyzed by preparing Western blots of cell lysates and probing with anti-glycoprotein D mAb 1103. To examine transport of VP16 to the nucleus, synchronized infection assays were conducted as described previously (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cells were precooled and exposed to HSV at 4 °C for 2 h at a m.o.i. of 0.1, 1, or 10 pfu/cell to allow binding. Unbound virus was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS and then transferred to 37 °C for 15 min to allow penetration. Unpenetrated virus was inactivated by washing the cell monolayer with a low pH citrate buffer adjusted to pH 3.0 for 2 min and then by washing three times with PBS. The cells were overlaid with fresh medium, and nuclear extracts were prepared 1 h after citrate treatment. The nuclear proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a Trans-Blot system (Bio-Rad), and blocked overnight in 5% milk-containing Tris-buffered saline. Membranes were incubated with mouse anti-VP16 antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), diluted in 5% milk-containing Tris-buffered saline for 2 h, and rinsed extensively with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution; Calbiochem) in 5% milk-containing PBS for 2 h. After rinsing, the membranes were developed using Immuno-Star-AP chemiluminescent kit (Bio-Rad). Blots were scanned and analyzed using the GelDoc 2000 system. Detection of FAK or Pyk2 Phosphorylation by Immunoblotting—Nearly confluent cell monolayers were preincubated with serum-free medium for 12 h before infection and then exposed to HSVs at a m.o.i. of 1 pfu/cell for the indicated times (5-120 min). Cell lysates were prepared as described above, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Membranes were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr397 FAK antibody, which recognizes the tyrosine autophosphorylation site at position 397 of FAK (catalog no. 44-624G, BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), or with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr402 Pyk2, which recognizes the tyrosine autophosphorylation site at position 402 (catalog no. 44-618G, BIOSOURCE). The membranes were then stripped and reincubated with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-FAK mAb (catalog no. F15020, Transduction Laboratories), which recognizes total FAK, or with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-Pyk2 antibody, which recognizes total Pyk2 (catalog no. 07-437, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Confocal Microscopy—CaSki, FAK+/+, and FAK-/- cells were grown on glass coverslips in 12-well plates and, if indicated, transfected with siRNA as described above and then infected 24 h post-transfection with K26GFP at the indicated m.o.i. (range of 0.1-10 pfu/cell). At the indicated times post-infection, the infected cell monolayers were washed three times with PBS. To label plasma membranes, the cells were stained for 30 min with EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidobiotin reagent (1:1000 dilution; Pierce), which reacts with primary amines on cell-surface proteins prior to fixation (13Foster T.P. Melancon J.M. Olivier T.L. Kousoulas K.G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13262-13277Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the biotinylated cells were reacted with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated streptavidin antibody (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.). Microtubules were labeled with anti-α-tubulin mAb (1:200 dilution; catalog no. A1126, Molecular Probes, Inc.) and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.). Nuclei were detected by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Images were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope fitted with ×100 objective. Image analysis and subcellular co-localization were generated and analyzed using the LSM confocal software package. Quantification of amounts of cell-associated GFP was performed with NIH Image densitometric software. In addition, to determine the fraction of cells expressing nuclear GFP 8 h post-infection, 100 cells were analyzed and counted. We previously showed that HSV induces FAK phosphorylation in CaSki or Vero cells and that phosphorylation requires fusion-competent virus (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This study was expanded to include multiple cell types known to be susceptible to HSV-2. Cells were serum-starved overnight and exposed to HSV-2 or mock-infected. At the indicated times post-infection, cell lysates were prepared and examined for expression of total and phosphorylated FAKs by Western blotting. HSV-2 induced an increase in phosphorylated FAK within 5 min in CaSki cells (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained with immortalized human ectocervical cells (Ecto1E6/E7), colonic cells (CaCo-2), neuronal cells (SH-N-SK), and macrophages (Fig. 1). To determine whether phosphorylated FAK contributes to HSV infection, we used several different strategies. First, we exposed MEF cells derived from embryonic FAK-deficient mice (FAK-/-) (9Ilic D.

HSV-2 induced an ∼3-fold increase in the level of phosphorylated FAK as a percentage of total FAK compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 2A, left panel); the response persisted for ∼1 h. In contrast, no FAK or phosphorylated FAK was detected in FAK-/- cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). Moreover, FAK-/- cells showed reduced susceptibility to infection by either serotype (Fig. 2B). Viral titers were reduced by 93 and 96% in FAK-/- cells relative to FAK+/+ cells for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Notably, no reduction in susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus was observed for FAK-/- cells relative to FAK+/+ cells. Susceptibility to HSV infection was partially restored if cells were transfected with the wild-type FAK gene (data not shown). To more carefully explore which steps in viral infection are impaired in FAK-/- cells, we compared viral binding and nuclear transport of the viral tegument protein VP16 in FAK-/- and FAK+/+ cells. The results demonstrate that there was no reduction in binding of virus to cells in FAK-/- cells relative to FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 3A). However, nuclear transport of VP16 1 h after citrate treatment was substantially reduced in FAK-/- cells compared with FAK+/+ cells (Fig. 3B). The blots were scanned, and optical densitometry corrected for differences in loading. At a m.o.i. of 10 pfu/cell, there was an ∼93% reduction in the relative amounts of VP16 detected in the nuclei of FAK-/- cells compared with FAK+/+ cells. The amount of nuclear VP16 detected was comparable with that observed if FAK+/+ cells were infected with 10-fold less virus (m.o.i. = 1 pfu/cell). To ensure that nuclear VP16 reflects transported and not newly synthesized protein, experiments were also conducted in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis (Fig. 3C). Comparable amounts of nuclear VP16 were detected 1 h after citrate treatment in FAK+/+ cells independent of cycloheximide treatment and accounted for ∼73% of total cell-associated VP16. As anticipated, a substantial reduction in viral ICP4 expression was also observed in FAK-/- cells compared with FAK+/+ cells, consistent with impaired delivery of viral DNA to the cell nucleus and thus viral gene expression (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that, in the absence of FAK, viral invasion is blocked at a step post-binding, leading to reduced nuclear transport of VP16 and inhibition of downstream events, including expression of immediate-early gene products and plaque formation. Because the embryonic knockout cells are murine and because our goal is to identify the signaling pathways required for HSV infection of human target cells, we adopted a complementary strategy to assess the role of FAK and its phosphorylation in human cervical epithelial cells. CaSki cells were transfected with siRNA specific for FAK, a dominant-negative variant of FAK (Y397F) in which the major autophosphorylation site has been mutated (a gift from J.-L. Guan) (14Zhao J. Pestell R. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4066-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), or appropriate controls, and the impact on HSV infection was examined. Transfection with FAK sequence-specific siRNA (but not control nonspecific siRNA) reduced FAK protein expression by ∼85% (based on optical densitometry scanning of blots) and prevented HSV-induced FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Similarly, a substantial reduction (∼70%) in virus-triggered phosphorylated FAK was also observed in CaSki cells transfected with Y397F compared with cells transfected with wild-type FAK (Fig. 4B). Transfection with the FAK-specific siRNA or the Y397F FAK variant also reduced HSV-2 infection (Fig. 4C), supporting the results obtained for FAK-/- cells showing that FAK and its phosphorylation play important roles in HSV infection. To determine whether FAK inactivation prevents viral capsid transport, confocal microscopy studies were conducted. For these studies, we took advantage of the viral variant, K26GFP, an HSV-1 that expresses a GFP-VP26 fusion protein; VP26 is a major viral capsid protein. K26GFP grows comparably to wild-type virus in cell culture (10Desai P. Person S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7563-7568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and infection of FAK-/- cells was impaired to a similar extent for K26GFP compared with HSV-2(G) (Fig. 2B). To determine the optimal m.o.i. for confocal experiments, CaSki cells were first infected with K26GFP at a m.o.i. of 0.1, 1, or 10 pfu/cell; at the indicated times post-infection, fixed and stained with EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidobiotin to detect cellular plasma membranes and with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to detect nuclei; and viewed by confocal microscopy. Viral GFP was detected in the cytoplasm of most of the cells infected with 10 pfu/cell as early as 1 h post-infection and in some cells infected with 1 pfu/cell (Fig. 5A). However, at a m.o.i. of 0.1 pfu/cell, GFP was not visible. Notably, 4 h post-infection, newly synthesized GFP appeared to accumulate in the nucleus in cells infected with 1 or 10 pfu/cell. To confirm that the observed nuclear GFP reflects newly synthesized protein, experiments were conducted in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (m.o.i. = 5 pfu/cell). Cycloheximide had no effect on delivery of viral capsids to the cytoplasm and its transport to the nuclear pore at 1 and 2 h post-infection, but blocked synthesis of GFP at 4 and 8 h post-infection (Fig. 5B). Next, to explore the role played by FAK in HSV entry, CaSki cells were transfected with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 6A, upper panels) or FAK-specific siRNA (middle panels), infected with K26GFP (m.o.i. = 10 pfu/cell), and then fixed and stained 1, 2, 4, and 8 h post-infection as described above. Viral GFP was detected at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm of CaSki cells as early as 1 h post-infection independent of transfection. However, transport of viral capsids to the nuclear pore and newly synthesized GFP were rarely detected in cells transfected with FAK-specific siRNA 4 and 8 h post-infection. Parallel experiments were conducted with MEF cells (Fig. 6B). As reported previously (15Gelman I.H. Cell Biol. Int. 2003; 27: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), knockout of FAK alters the morphology of fibroblast cells with loss of typical elongated morphology. Intracellular GFP-VP26 was detected 1 h post-infection in both FAK+/+ and FAK-/- cells, but newly synthesized GFP was observed only in FAK+/+ cells. The relative amounts of intracellular and nuclear GFPs at 1 and 8 h post-infection, respectively, were determined by scanning ∼100 cells using NIH Image densitometric software (Fig. 6C). No measurable reduction in intracellular GFP was detected 1 h post-infection in the absence of FAK (FAK-/- cells or CaSki cells transfected with FAK-specific siRNA), suggesting no impediment to viral entry. In contrast, a substantial reduction in newly synthesized GFP was detected, consistent with a block at the level of capsid transport to the nuclear pore. To further explore the role of FAK in capsid transport, confocal experiments were modified; and instead of staining the plasma membrane, microtubules were immunostained using anti-α-tubulin mAb. In CaSki and FAK+/+ cells, viral capsids were readily detected associated with microtubule structures 1 and 2 h post-infection (Fig. 7, upper and middle panels, respectively). In contrast, no GFP was detected in microtubules in FAK-/- cells (Fig. 7, lower panels). Taken together, these results indicate that, in the absence of FAK, there is a restriction to capsid transport, leading to a reduction in the delivery of viral DNA to the nucleus and subsequent viral gene expression. Our previous study suggested that phosphorylation of FAK is triggered downstream of Ca2+ signaling because pharmacological agents that block the release of ER Ca2+ or chelation of intracellular Ca2+ prevent virus-induced phosphorylation of FAK (7Cheshenko N. Del Rosario B. Woda C. Marcellino D. Satlin L.M. Herold B.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Ca2+ signaling should be preserved in FAK-/- cells. To test this directly, we examined the virus-induced Ca2+ signaling response by excitation ratio fluorometry of cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-2. FAK+/+ and FAK-/- cells were exposed sequentially to PBS or HSV-2(G) at a m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell. A rapid increase in the superfusate flow rate of PBS alone, simulating the conditions elicited by the addition of virus to the bathing medium, had no effect on resting [Ca2+]i. The resting [Ca2+]i of FAK+/+ and FAK-/- cells were comparable (∼100 nm) (Fig. 8). Exposure of both FAK+/+ and FAK-/- cells to HSV resulted in a significant rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, which peaked within 1 min and returned to the base line within ∼3 min (p < 0.001, analysis of variance) (Fig. 8), although the mean change in peak [Ca2+]i was greater for FAK+/+ cells compared with FAK-/- cells (181.4 ± 101.1 versus 70 ± 45 nm, respectively; mean ± S.E., n = 20 cells), possibly reflecting a reduction in virus-induced Ca2+ signaling in the absence of FAK or perturbations of other signal transduction pathways in the knockout cells. The ability of HSV to induce a significant Ca2+ response in FAK-/- cells supports the notion that FAK phosphorylation occurs downstream of virus-induced release of ER Ca2+.

During siderophore transport into the periplasm, the FhuA cork domain has been proposed to undergo conformational changes that allow transport through the barrel lumen; alternatively, the cork may be completely displaced from the barrel. To probe such changes, site-directed cysteine mutants in the cork domain (L109C and Q112C) and in the barrel domain (S356C and M383C) were created within the putative siderophore transport pathway. Molecular modeling predicted that the double cysteine mutants L109C/S356C and Q112C/M383C would form disulfide bonds, thereby tethering the cork and barrel domains. The double cysteine FhuA mutants were denatured under nonreducing conditions and fluorescently labeled with thiol-specific Oregon Green maleimide. Subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis revealed two distinct species: FhuA containing a disulfide bond and FhuA with free sulfhydryl groups. To address the role of the putative siderophore transport pathway and to evaluate possible rearrangements of the cork domain during ferricrocin transport, disulfide bond formation was enhanced by an oxidative catalyst. Cells containing double cysteine FhuA mutants that were subjected to oxidation during ferricrocin transport exhibited disulfide bond formation to near completion. After disulfide tethering of the cork to the barrel, ferricrocin transport was equivalent to transport by untreated cells. These results demonstrate that blocking the putative siderophore transport pathway does not abrogate ferricrocin uptake.

We propose that, during siderophore transport through FhuA, the cork domain remains within the barrel rather than being displaced. Iron is required by most living cells because of its diverse roles in numerous metabolic processes, including glycolysis, energy generation by electron transport, and DNA synthesis (1Klebba P.E. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1422-s1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, however, iron forms highly insoluble ferric hydroxide complexes, thereby severely limiting the bioavailability of iron. The outer membrane receptor FhuA of Escherichia coli transports Fe3+ chelated to hydroxamate siderophores such as ferrichrome and its structural analog ferricrocin. FhuA also serves as a primary receptor for the antibiotics albomycin and rifamycin CGP 4832; the antibiotic peptide microcin J25; the bacterial toxin colicin M; and the bacteriophages T5, T1, UC-1, and Φ80. Structural determination of FhuA identified a monomeric C-terminal 22-stranded β-barrel domain (residues 161-714) and an N-terminal globular cork domain (residues 1-160) that resides within the barrel lumen (2Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 3Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The position of the cork domain within the barrel occludes the barrel lumen and prevents diffusion of ligand into the periplasm. The mechanism by which this occlusion is modulated to facilitate siderophore transport remains unclear. Ferric siderophore transport requires a pathway with a minimal diameter of ∼15 Å, which is not apparent in either apo-FhuA (Protein Data Bank code 2FCP) or the ferrichrome-bound crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1FCP) (1Klebba P.E. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1422-s1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Comparison of these two FhuA structures revealed distinct conformations; most differences are localized to the cork domain, thereby providing direct evidence for conformational changes that occur within FhuA upon ligand binding. In the ferrichrome-bound state, apices in the cork domain are translated 1.7 Å toward the ferrichrome-binding site, forming multiple hydrogen bonds with the ligand (2Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 3Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 95: 771-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The most conspicuous structural change takes place in an N-terminal region referred to as the switch helix. Upon ferrichrome binding to FhuA, the switch helix is entirely unwound, resulting in a 17.3-Å translocation of the N terminus (2Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Despite these changes in the ferrichrome-bound state, a transport pathway sufficient to accommodate a siderophore remains undetected. Therefore, after siderophore binding, the additional structural alterations that FhuA must undergo to allow passage of ligand though the barrel lumen are as yet undisclosed by x-ray crystallographic structures. Proposed models of siderophore transport through FhuA involve subtle rearrangement(s) of the cork domain; alternatively, complete or partial removal of the cork domain from the barrel has been postulated (1Klebba P.E. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1422-s1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. J. Biol.

Transport into the periplasm requires reduced stability of ferrichrome for its initial binding site, eventually facilitating dissociation from the outer membrane receptor. In ferrichrome-bound FhuA, the N-terminal region of the receptor interacts with the energy-transducing complex TonB-ExbB-ExbD anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane. Selected residues of the Ton box, a sequence of amino acids highly conserved among TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors, make direct interactions with TonB as demonstrated by disulfide cross-linking (7Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These interactions are not only required for transport, but are likely coupled to conformational changes in the cork and barrel during transport (8Endriss F. Braun M. Killmann H. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4683-4692Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Such conformational changes have been proposed to destabilize ferrichrome contacts with extracellular loops of the barrel domain and apices of the cork domain (9Braun V. Braun M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Disruption of siderophore binding to the receptor may result from TonB interactions, shifting the cork apices toward the periplasm. When viewed along the barrel axis, a previously identified 10-Å solvent-accessible channel (2Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), now referred to as the putative siderophore transport pathway, connects the extracellular environment to the periplasm. Conformational changes in loops of the cork domain could result in sufficient widening of this pathway to accommodate ferrichrome. Highly conserved residues along the inner barrel wall of the putative siderophore transport pathway may facilitate the diffusion of ferrichrome through FhuA by a series of low affinity binding interactions. Such a mechanism was shown for diffusion of maltose and maltodextrins along the greasy slide of LamB porin (10Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Bartoldus I. Saint N. Prilipov A. Winterhalter M. Wang Y. Philippsen A. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Conversely, complete or partial removal of the cork domain could expose the lumen of the barrel and allow diffusion of siderophores (11Braun M. Killmann H. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Experiments comparing the structure and function of wild-type FhuA with FhuA containing N-terminal deletions (FhuAΔ21-128) indicate that the cork domain contributes to overall protein stability (12Bonhivers M. Desmadril M. Moeck G.S. Boulanger P. Colomer-Pallas A. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cork domain is stabilized within the barrel by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, rendering complete removal of the cork during ferrichrome transport energetically unfavorable (1Klebba P.E. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: s1422-s1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Ferguson A.D. Deisenhofer J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). However, recent molecular dynamics simulations suggest that solvation of polar interactions within this network can reduce the energy expenditure necessary for cork removal (15Faraldo-Gomez J.D. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1406-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Deletions of the cork domains from the outer membrane receptors FhuA and FecA result in decreased affinity for siderophores, but retention of TonB-dependent functions (4Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Bonhivers M. Desmadril M. Moeck G.S. Boulanger P. Colomer-Pallas A. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that displacement of the siderophore from its initial binding site drives an inward motion of the extracellular loops, resulting in removal of the cork from the barrel lumen (4Scott D.C. Cao Z. Qi Z. Bauler M. Igo J.D. Newton S.M.C. Klebba P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13025-13033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this model, the siderophore could pass through a transiently formed pathway by diffusion. It has even been suggested that the cork domain may physically import bound ligands through the barrel during its own translocation into the periplasm (6Ferguson A.D. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 2004; 116: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Usher K.C. Özkan E. Gardner K.H. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10676-10681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite many mutational studies and crystal structures generated in recent years, the mechanism of siderophore transport through FhuA is poorly understood. In this study, site-directed disulfide cross-linking was used to assess the role of the cork domain during transport of the ferrichrome analog ferricrocin. Selected amino acids along the putative siderophore transport pathway (Leu109 and Gln112 in the cork domain and Ser356 and Met383 in the barrel domain) were mutated to cysteine residues to allow disulfide bond formation in the presence of an oxidative catalyst. Disulfide tethering of barrel and cork domains was predicted to limit siderophore uptake either by blocking the putative siderophore transport pathway or by preventing the removal of the cork domain. Instead, we observed levels of ferricrocin uptake comparable with untethered FhuA. Our data suggest that uptake does not require displacement of the cork domain and that siderophores transit the FhuA receptor through a route other than the putative siderophore transport pathway. Chemicals and Reagents—The antibiotics ampicillin and tetracycline were obtained from Sigma, as were N-ethylmaleimide, copper sulfate, and 1,10-phenanthroline. Other materials were Oregon Green maleimide (OGM) 1The abbreviations used are: OGM, Oregon Green maleimide; OMV, outer membrane vesicles; OMP, outer membrane proteins; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; CuP, copper(II) phenanthroline. from Molecular Probes, Inc., restriction enzymes AvrII and MluI and T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs Inc., and radiolabeled 55FeCl3 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—E. coli strain AW740 (hisG4 thr-1 fhuA31 tsx-78 ΔompF zcb::Tn10 ΔompC) harboring plasmid pHX405, which expresses FhuA plus a hexahistidine tag at residue 405, was used for thiol-specific fluorescent labeling experiments (17Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Ismail A.A. Turnbull J.L. Coulton J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). E. coli strain SG303fhuA (MC4100 aroB T5-resistant) (18Moeck G.S.

Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and encoding the fhuACDB genes was used for iron uptake assays. Both plasmids are derivatives of the pBR322 replicon. E. coli AW740 cultures were grown in LB broth (Fisher) supplemented with 125 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline. E. coli SG303fhuA cultures were grown in TY medium (8 g/liter Tryptone (Fisher), 5 g/liter Bacto yeast extract (Difco), and 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 125 μg/ml ampicillin. Construction of Cysteine FhuA Mutants—Residues within the putative siderophore transport pathway were selected for cysteine mutagenesis by exploiting the molecular modeling program SSBOND (20Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Beginning with a Protein Data Bank file, the program identifies candidate residue pairs for disulfide formation by sampling all possible dihedral angles and atomic distances. Six single cysteine mutations (L109C, Q112C, D336C, S356C, M383C, and W451C) were created by PCR mutagenesis of plasmid pHX405 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For all mutants, base changes were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Centre, McGill University). Mutant plasmids transformed into E. coli AW740 were used for labeling studies. Each cysteine mutant plasmid was doubly digested with the restriction enzymes MluI and AvrII and then ligated into the backbone of the pPM18 vector that had been cut with the same enzymes. These recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli SG303 for iron uptake assays. Labeling with Thiol-specific Reagents—Bacterial cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 125 μg/ml ampicillin and 20 μg/ml tetracycline to A600 = 0.5. Cells were harvested and suspended to A600 = 2.5, and 250-μl aliquots were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes. Cells were pelleted and suspended in Buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4 and 100 mm K2SO4 (pH 7.0)) (21Larsen R.A. Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), followed by the addition of 5 mm OGM in 50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 9.0). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, excess OGM was quenched by the addition of 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were washed twice with Buffer A, and outer membrane vesicles (OMV) were isolated as described previously (22Hantke K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 182: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Briefly, harvested cells were suspended in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed by the sequential addition of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1.0 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mg/ml lysozyme, and distilled water. After formation of spheroplasts, membranes were extracted with 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mg/ml each DNase and RNase. Pelleted outer membrane fractions were washed three times with water prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Labeling with 5 mm OGM was also conducted directly on OMV and on outer membrane proteins (OMP) that had been extracted from vesicles by 0.1% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide. Labeling with 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was carried out with all three FhuA preparations (intact cells, OMV, and OMP) under the same conditions as with OGM. Preparations without or with NEM labeling were denatured in nonreducing (no 2-mercaptoethanol) sample buffer, followed by 5 mm OGM. Thiol-specific labeling of all three FhuA preparations was also assessed after the addition of 1.0 μm ferricrocin and 0.5% glucose. An ∼20:1 molar ratio of thiol-specific probe to FhuA was used for all labeling experiments. 55Fe-Ferricrocin Transport Assay and Disulfide Cross-linking—Bacterial cells were grown overnight in TY medium and then transferred to 10 ml of fresh TY medium until A578 = 0.4 was reached. Cells were washed with iron uptake medium (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.5% glucose, and 1.0 mm MgSO4) and then suspended in 10 ml of iron uptake medium with 100 μm nitrilotriacetate. 55FeCl3 was complexed with desferrated ferricrocin in equimolar ratios and incubated for several minutes at room temperature. Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in a shaking water bath prior to 55Fe-ferricrocin uptake or to oxidative cross-linking. Following the addition of 1.0 μm 55Fe-ferricrocin, 1.0-ml samples were removed at 5-min intervals, collected on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp.), and washed twice with 0.1 mm LiCl. Filters were dried and counted in a Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer. For cells containing double cysteine FhuA mutants, disulfide bond formation was enhanced by the addition of an oxidative catalyst. Specifically, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 100 μm copper(II) phenanthroline (CuP) or with 50 μm copper sulfate (CuSO4) either before or after initiation of 55Fe-ferricrocin uptake. SDS-PAGE, Western Immunoblotting, and Fluorescence Imaging—Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on gels containing 10% acrylamide. For OGM labeling experiments, gels were scanned for fluorescence using a Bio-Rad FX scanner. Following cross-linking and uptake assays, proteins were transferred from acrylamide gels to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp.) overnight at 38 mA in a 4 °C cold chamber by electrophoresis in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 39 mm glycine, 0.04% SDS, and 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked in 30 ml of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The blocking buffer was used to dilute both the primary monoclonal antibody FhuA4.1 (18Moeck G.S. Ratcliffe M.J.H. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177 (J. H.): 6118-6125MCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the secondary antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd.). Membranes incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of antibody FhuA4.1 for 1 h at room temperature were washed three times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then treated in a similar manner with a 1:8000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase. After washing, blots were developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate developing reagents (Roche Diagnostics) in 100 mm NaHCO3 and 1.0 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of water. Immunoblots were scanned with a Bio-Rad FX scanner, followed by densitometry using Bio-Rad Quantity One software to quantitate the percentage of disulfide bond formation in the double cysteine FhuA mutants. Engineering Cysteine Mutants within the Putative Siderophore Transport Pathway—To evaluate the role of specific amino acids within the putative siderophore transport pathway of FhuA, site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken. Our objectives were to engineer disulfide bonds that tethered the cork and barrel domains and to create a barrier within the putative siderophore transport pathway. Using the FhuA crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2FCP) as input, the molecular modeling program SSBOND (20Hazes B. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) identified candidate amino acids for mutagenesis to cysteine residues. Based on the proximity and side chain orientation of residues in the crystal structure, SSBOND predicted their propensity to form disulfide bonds. Two single cysteine mutants (L109C and Q112C) were created in the cork domain, and two others were created in β-strands 8 (S356C) and 9 (M383C) of the barrel domain (Fig. 1A). Given these selections, SSBOND predicted disulfide formation for the double cysteine mutants L109C/S356C and Q112C/M383C (Fig. 1B). Thiol-specific Labeling of Putative Siderophore Transport Pathway Cysteine Mutants—The accessibility of four cysteine mutants (L109C, Q112C, S356C, and M383C) within the putative siderophore transport pathway was evaluated by reactivity of their sulfhydryl groups with the thiol-specific probe OGM. The additional FhuA mutants D336C (located in surface-exposed loop L4) and W451C (located in periplasmic turn T5) were created as controls to probe for surface accessibility and periplasmic accessibility, respectively (Fig. 1C). E. coli AW740 was transformed with plasmids encoding wild-type FhuA, single cysteine FhuA mutants (L109C, Q112C, D336C, M383C, and W451C), or double cysteine FhuA mutants (L109C/S356C and Q112C/M383C). E. coli transformants were used for intact cell labeling experiments with OGM; alternatively, OMV and detergent-solubilized OMP were labeled with OGM. SDS-poly-acrylamide gels were scanned to detect the fluorescent modification of sulfhydryl groups with OGM. In both intact cells and OMV, only Cys336 in surface-exposed loop L4 was modified with OGM (Fig. 2, A and B). Cysteine mutants in the putative siderophore transport pathway were not labeled, indicating that OGM did not have access to the barrel lumen of FhuA. Consequently, assessment of disulfide bond formation in the double cysteine mutants L109C/S356C and Q112C/M383C could not be conducted by fluorescent labeling. Whereas periplasmic turn T5 residue Cys451 was not accessible to OGM in intact cells or OMV, FhuA residue Cys451 became accessible to OGM modification once OMP were extracted in 0.1% N,N-dimethyldodecylamine N-oxide (Fig. 2C). Initial labeling with NEM was predicted to prevent subsequent reaction with OGM. In all three FhuA preparations, labeling with NEM blocked OGM modification of Cys336. NEM labeling of detergent-solubilized W451C also blocked subsequent reaction with OGM (Fig. 3). Thiol-specific labeling assays with OGM or NEM/OGM were conducted during ferricrocin transport; identical labeling outcomes were observed for intact cells, OMV, and detergent-solubilized OMP compared with FhuA not transporting ligand (data not shown). Analysis of Double Cysteine FhuA Mutants by Nonreducing SDS-PAGE—To determine whether intact cells expressing double cysteine FhuA mutants are able to form predicted disulfide bonds within the putative siderophore transport pathway, FhuA was denatured under nonreducing conditions, followed by labeling with OGM. Upon denaturation of FhuA, all mutated cysteine residues (Cys109, Cys112, Cys336, Cys356, Cys383, and Cys451) were accessible to OGM, whereas wild-type FhuA remained unmodified (Fig. 4A, upper panel). Analyses of cells containing double cysteine FhuA mutants by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions displayed a mixture of two distinct species: FhuA in which the disulfide bond had formed and FhuA containing free sulfhydryl groups (Fig. 4, A and B, lower panels). The faster migrating and more abundant species indicated by the lower band was modified by fluorescent labeling, indicating free sulfhydryl groups. The upper band (Fig. 4A, lanes 8 and 9) corresponding to the slower migrating and less abundant species could not be fluorescently modified, signifying the presence of disulfide bonds. When wild-type FhuA was denatured in the presence or absence of reducing agent, the resulting proteins displayed similar electrophoretic mobilities. Double cysteine FhuA mutants electrophoresed under reducing conditions were fully denatured, resulting in one band with mobility identical to that of wild-type FhuA. FhuA samples initially labeled with NEM and then analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE revealed that NEM modified the surface-exposed mutant D336C, periplasmic mutant W451C, and putative siderophore transport pathway mutant Q112C (Fig. 4B, upper panel) because subsequent OGM labeling was not observed. Oxidative Cross-linking of Double Cysteine FhuA Mutants—To ensure maximal disulfide bond formation during ferricrocin transport assays, we employed an oxidative catalyst that promotes cross-linking. Treatment of cells with an oxidative catalyst has been shown to enhance disulfide bond formation between appropriately positioned cysteine thiols (21Larsen R.A. Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cross-linking the sulfhydryl groups of the mutated double cysteine residues can be accomplished with zero-length cross-linkers such as CuP and CuSO4. The oxidative catalyst CuP has been extensively reported to enhance disulfide bond formation between transmembrane domains of membrane proteins (23Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18232-18238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 11546-11551Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To achieve maximal disulfide formation in our double cysteine FhuA mutants, intact cells suspended in iron uptake medium were treated with an oxidative catalyst (CuP or CuSO4). To calculate the relative proportions of FhuA containing disulfide bonds under these conditions, the cross-linked samples were resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, followed by densitometry. Cross-linking between the cork and barrel domains in double cysteine FhuA mutants was apparent from the reduced electrophoretic mobilities of cross-linked species compared with protein containing free sulfhydryl groups. Cross-linked protein was not detected in wild-type FhuA (Fig. 5) or in any single cysteine mutant (data not shown). Oxidation with CuP yielded 99 and 90% disulfide-formed species for L109C/S356C and Q112C/M383C, respectively (Fig. 5). Replacing CuP with CuSO4 as the cross-linking agent resulted in nearly equivalent efficiencies of disulfide formation in cells expressing L109C/S356C (99%) and Q112C/M383C (83%) (Fig. 5). 55Fe-Ferricrocin Uptake in Cells Expressing Cysteine FhuA Mutants—Strains expressing single and double cysteine FhuA mutants were assayed for their ability to transport the iron-ferricrocin complex. FhuA and the FhuCDB accessory proteins required for transport were expressed in the aroB mutant E. coli SG303 strain. The aroB mutant strain prevented endogenous synthesis of enterochelin, which might chelate radiolabeled 55Fe in transport assays. Iron uptake by wild-type FhuA was measure"

It is required for transcription elongation of most class II genes. P-TEFb phosphorylates numerous substrates, including the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and the Spt5 subunit of the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF). The DSIF prevents transcription from proceeding efficiently after initiation. The kinase activity of P-TEFb antagonizes this inhibitory effect. Several class II genes such as heat-shock or U2 small nuclear RNA genes do not have a strong requirement for P-TEFb activity to elongate, but rather to terminate, transcription properly (3Medlin J.E.

HEXIM1 expression is up-regulated in smooth muscle cells treated with hexamethylene-bisacetamide (13Kusuhara M. Nagasaki K. Kimura K. Maass N. Manabe T. Ishikawa S. Aikawa M. Miyazaki K. Yamaguchi K. Biomed. Res. 1999; 20: 273-279Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or down-regulated by estrogen in breast cancer cells and therefore named EDG-1 (14Wittmann B.M. Wang N. Montano M.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5151-5158PubMed Google Scholar). HEXIM1 has also been reported as a protein accumulating in heart tissues during early embryogenesis and therefore named CLP-1 (cardiac lineage protein) (15Huang F. Wagner M. Siddiqui M.A. Gene. 2002; 292: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Disruption of the HEXIM1/CLP1 gene results in heart defects leading to death at birth in homozygote CLP-1(-/-) mice (16Huang F. Wagner M. Siddiqui M.A. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 559-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because P-TEFb plays a general role in class II gene expression, such a late developmental defect suggests the existence of a compensatory mechanism at the cellular level. Indeed, a BLAST search within genome and Expressed Sequence Tag data bases suggests the existence of HEXIM2, a mammalian protein strongly related to HEXIM1 but smaller, 286 instead of 359 amino acids, and coded by a distinct gene in the same locus (7Michels A.A.

This work was initiated to investigate HEXIM2 characteristics. In agreement with observations published while it was in progress, it was found that HEXIM2 binding to P-TEFb and 7SK RNA is a transcription-dependent process (17Yik J.H. Chen R. Pezda A.C. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16368-16376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol.

These findings were extended, mapping domains involved in HEXIM/HEXIM interactions. Hydrodynamic parameters and chemical cross-links of the HEXIM1 oligomers were used to investigate their stoichiometry. It was demonstrated that multiple P-TEFb units bind to a HEXIM1 multimer. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—For two-hybrid assays, L40 yeast cells were co-transformed with LexA DNA binding domain and GAL4 activation domain fusion constructs derived from plasmids pBTM116 and pACTII, respectively (19Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Transformants were double-selected on medium lacking both tryptophan and leucine. Quantitative β-galactosidase activities were determined from pools of more than 10 transformed yeast colonies. Plasmids—HEXIM2 cDNA was generated by reverse transcription PCR from HeLa cell total RNAs. Its sequence was identical to AK056946 (GenBank™). HEXIM2 cDNA was fused to an N-terminal FLAG tag by insertion into NheI/ClaI sites of pAdRSV-FLAG3 (20Giudicelli F. Taillebourg E. Charnay P. Gilardi-Hebenstreit P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). HEXIM2 cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pBTM116 or the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pActII. The HEXIM2 sequence starts at methionine n°2. Deletion mutants were constructed by insertion of PCR-generated fragments of the corresponding HEXIM2 sequences into pAdRSV-FLAG3, pBTM116, and pActII. Full-length HEXIM1 and Cyclin T1 cDNAs were inserted into EcoR1/SalI cloning sites of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech). Full-length CDK9 cDNA was fused to an N-terminal 3XFLAG tag (21Licciardo P. Napolitano G. Majello B. Lania L. AIDS. 2001; 15: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PCR-generated HEXIM1 cDNA was inserted into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pET21d to generate HEX-His6. The HEX-(148-359)His6 and HEX-(162-359)His6 truncated proteins were generated by PCR; amino acids 148 and 162 in the HEXIM1 sequence were placed just after the start codon. The recombinant proteins, expressed in Escherichia coli Novablue DE3, were purified as described (10Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H.

Cells, Drugs, Transfections, and Lysis—HeLa (MRL2 strain), G3H, GCM, or 3XFLAG-CDK9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. G3H cells were labeled for 20 h by addition of 50 μCi/ml Redivue Pro-mix L-[35S] (Amersham Biosciences) ml-1. G3H stably express HA-tagged Cyclin T1 (23O'Keeffe B. Fong Y. Chen D. Zhou S. Zhou Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 279-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). GCM cells are HeLa (MRL2) cells stably transfected with pEGFP-HEXIM1. 3XFLAG-CDK9 cells are H1299 cells stably transfected with 3XFLAG-CDK9. Cells were treated or not for 1 h with actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) or DRB (100 μm). For reversibility, after 1 h of DRB treatment, cells were allowed to recover for 1 h in fresh medium. UV irradiation (40 J·m-2) was performed at 254 nm. Log-phase cells were used for all experiments. Cells were transfected following the standard calcium phosphate method with coding plasmid supplemented with a noncoding carrier plasmid added up to 10 μg/dish (25 cm2). Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in ice-chilled buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA), supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units·ml-1 RNasin (Promega), protease inhibitor mixture (P-8340; Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. When indicated 150 mm NaCl was added to buffer A. Lysates were vortexed and incubated for 20 min on ice and clarified by sequential centrifugations for 5 min at 500 × g and 5 min at 9,000 × g at 4 °C. The final supernatant was used in all experiments. Antibodies—Antibodies used were rabbit anti-Cyclin T1 (H-245; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-Cyclin T1 (T-18; Santa Cruz), anti-CDK9 mouse monoclonal (D-7; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-CDK9 (C-20; Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal (M2; Sigma), antipolyhistidine (Qiagen). Anti-HEXIM1 (N2) was generated against a peptide corresponding to the 15 N-terminal amino acids of HEXIM1; anti-HEXIM1 (C4) was directed against a peptide corresponding to the 15 C-terminal amino acids of HEXIM1 (7Michels A.A.

Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled (Promega or Sigma) or Cy3-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibodies. Anti-GFP-agarose (MBL), anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma), and anti-HA-agarose (Sigma) beads were used for immunoprecipitations. Autoradiograms of immunoprecipitated proteins were obtained with a Fuji-Bas phosphorimager. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned. Quantification of numeric files was performed with the Fuji Image Gauge program. Immunofluorescence was performed after formaldehyde fixation (7Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Molecular Weight Determinations—Protein samples were loaded on a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel-permeation column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted at 18 °C in 25 mm, pH 7.9, Hepes buffer supplemented with NaCl. Fractions of 240 μl (checked by weighing) were collected. For each particle, the Stokes radius (RS, nm) was determined from the elution parameter Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo). Ve is the elution volume of particle, and Vt is the total bed volume of the column provided by the supplier. The void volume, Vo, corresponded to elution of blue dextran 2000. Protein samples were ultracentrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 21 h at 4 °C on 5-35% glycerol gradients in buffer A supplemented with NaCl using a SW41 Beckman rotor. 24 fractions of 500 μl were collected. The sedimentation coefficients (S, Svedberg units) of HEXIM1 complexes were determined by comparison with those of well defined protein standards. By definition, molecules in fraction 1 have a sedimentation coefficient of zero. Proteins from column eluates and glycerol gradients were detected by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot using low signals to avoid saturation effects. For a given protein, peak fraction determination was highly reproducible from one experiment to the other (within half a fraction). As a calibration control, β-galactosidase was included in all runs and detected by Western blot. The Amersham high molecular weight calibration kit contained aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin. Bovine serum albumin and E. coli β-galactosidase were from Sigma. Covalent Cross-linking—Disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (25 mm stock solution) and added at 4 °C under vigorous mixing either to a solution of purified recombinant protein HEXIM1-His6 in buffer A supplemented with 400 mm NaCl or to an extract from HeLa cells treated with actinomycin D (to eliminate P-TEFb·HEXIM1·7SK RNA complexes). Reactions were arrested by addition of glycine (1 m stock solution buffered at pH 7.9) up to 200 mm final concentration. Samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with unstained protein standards (SDS-6H; Sigma). Characterization of FLAG-HEXIM2—To investigate HEXIM2 properties, its cDNA was fused to a FLAG epitope and expressed in HeLa cells. The resulting FLAG-HEXIM2 protein was localized in the nucleus and excluded from nucleoli (Fig. 1). Upon deletion of the C-terminal sequences, the (2-226) protein remained nuclear, but the (2-118) and (2-168) proteins were perinuclear. In contrast, deletion of N-terminal sequences in the (84-286) protein did not affect the nuclear localization, whereas the (119-286) protein was spread out through the entire cell. As previously reported (7Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Yik J.H. Chen R. Nishimura R. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), FLAG-HEXIM1 coimmunoprecipitated the Cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb as well as 7SK RNA in transient transfection assays (Fig. 2A, lane 3). These interactions were abolished when cells were treated with actinomycin D prior to lysis (lane 4). The same observations were made when FLAG-HEXIM2 was used instead (lanes 5 and 6). Actinomycin D triggered the dissociation of the FLAG-HEXIM2/CDK9 interaction (Fig. 2B, lane 5). DRB, another transcription inhibitor, also promoted the disruption of HEXIM2/P-TEFb interaction (lane 3). As previously observed with HEXIM1, DRB action was reversible (lane 4). UV irradiation also resulted in the HEXIM2/P-TEFb disruption (lanes 6 and 7). However, as previously reported for HEXIM1, the UV effect was not immediate. Importantly, equivalent amounts of HEXIM1 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-HEXIM2 independently of transcription and P-TEFb association (lanes 2-7). Thus, HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 show very similar behavior; both P-TEFb·HEXIM complexes are dissociated following transcriptional arrest. HEXIM2 also associates with HEXIM1, but this interaction is not affected by an arrest in transcription. The HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 C-terminal Domains Interact with Each Other and with Cyclin T1 in a Two-hybrid Assay—To identify which P-TEFb subunit directly interacts with HEXIM2, a yeast two-hybrid study was performed. HEXIM1, HEXIM2, CDK9, and Cyclin T1 were fused to the LexA DNA binding or GAL4 activation domains. Robust growth on medium lacking histidine and elevated β-galactosidase activities were obtained with cells co-transformed with LexA-HEXIM2 and GAL4-CyclinT1 or with LexA-CycT1 and GAL4-HEXIM2 (Fig. 3A). Slightly stronger responses were obtained with HEXIM1 and Cyclin T1. In contrast, cells co-transformed with HEXIM2 and CDK9 fusions did not show increased β-galactosidase activity compared with negative controls. Thus, the HEXIM2 interaction with P-TEFb occurs through a direct contact with Cyclin T1. In two-hybrids, the HEXIM2/Cyclin T1 interaction did not require the presence of 7SK RNA (Fig. 3A) as previously described for HEXIM1 (7Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Strong homotropic HEXIM2/HEXIM2 and HEXIM1/HEXIM1, as well as heterotropic HEXIM1/HEXIM2, interactions were also observed. To map the HEXIM2 region required for interaction with HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and Cyclin T1, deletion mutants were analyzed. Like the full-length protein, both (84-286) and (119-286) N-terminal deletions interacted with Cyclin T1, HEXIM1, and HEXIM2 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, none of the HEXIM2 mutants with C-terminal domain deletions (mutants (2-118), (2-168), and (2-226)) interacted with HEXIM1, HEXIM2, or Cyclin T1. Thus, sequences in the C-terminal half of HEXIM2 are involved in the interaction with HEXIM1, HEXIM2, and Cyclin T1. HEXIM1 deletion mutants were probed next for self-association. The HEXIM1/HEXIM1 interaction was maintained for the HEXIM1 N-terminal deletion mutants (120-359) and (181-359) (sequence homologous to the (84-286) and (119-286) HEXIM2 mutants, respectively) (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the HEXIM1 N-terminal deletion mutant (181-359) fused to LexA interacted with the same mutant (181-359) fused to the GAL4 activation domain. However, this mutant did not interact with the C-terminal truncations (1-180) and (1-240) (sequence equivalents to the (1-118) and (1-168) HEXIM2 mutants, respectively). These experiments suggest a direct interaction of the HEXIM2 C-terminal domain with Cyclin T1 as previously reported for HEXIM1 (7Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Homo- and heterocontacts between HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 proteins appear to involve their homologous C-terminal domains. Transcription-independent HEXIM/HEXIM Interactions in HeLa cells—To validate the two-hybrid analysis, we next investigated the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous HEXIM1 with transfected truncated HEXIM2 mutants in HeLa cells. Truncation of the HEXIM2 83 N-terminal amino acids did not affect the capacity to immunoprecipitate the Cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb (Fig. 4A, lane 7). However, the coimmunoprecipitation was suppressed for the truncated mutants (2-118) (lane 5) and (119-286) (lane 9). Anti-FLAG antibodies also retained large amounts of HEXIM1 when the cells were transfected with full-length, N-terminal-deleted (84-286) or (119-286) HEXIM2 (lanes 3, 7, and 9). Although HEXIM2-(119-286) interacted with Cyclin T1 in the two-hybrid test, it did not associate P-TEFb as found for its HEXIM1-(181-359) homolog, possibly because both have lost their basic RNA binding domain (10Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). No HEXIM1 was retained when the C-terminal domain was deleted in mutants (2-118), (2-168), and (2-226) (lane 5 and data not shown). When actinomycin D was added to the culture medium prior to lysis, no Cyclin T1 was retained by anti-FLAG antibodies. In contrast, the amount of HEXIM1 retained was not affected by actinomycin D treatment (lanes 4, 8, and 10). The coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous HEXIM1 with transfected truncated HEXIM1 mutants was investigated next in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). The full-length endogenous protein (H) co-migrated with the transfected one (1-359) and could not therefore be distinguished (lanes 3 and 4). The N-terminal truncated HEXIM1-(120-359) (a) and -(181-359) (b) were equivalent to HEXIM2-(84-286) and -(119-286), respectively. They were detected with the C4 antibody that is directed against the last 15 amino acids of HEXIM1. The C-terminal truncated HEXIM1-(1-240) (c) and -(1-180) (d) were equivalent to HEXIM2-(2-119) and -(2-118), respectively. They were detected with the N2 antibody that is directed against the first N-terminal 15 amino acids of HEXIM1. In contrast to the C-terminal truncations (lanes 5-8), both the (120-359) and (181-359) HEXIM1 deletion mutants coimmunoprecipitated endogenous HEXIM1 (lanes 9-12). However, the (120-359) and the (181-359) HEXIM1 differed in that the latter did not bind P-TEFb (7Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 show very similar behavior; their interaction with P-TEFb is disrupted by actinomycin D treatment and requires their basic domains. In contrast, the HEXIM1/HEXIM2 coimmunoprecipitation is not affected by actinomycin D treatment and does not require the presence of the basic domain. Multiple HEXIM1 Molecules in P-TEFb·HEXIM1·7SK RNA Complexes—HEXIM1 cDNA was fused to GFP, and a cell line stably expressing the fusion protein was established from HeLa cells (GCM cells). The fusion protein was nuclear and excluded from nucleoli like the endogenous protein (not shown). Western blot analysis with anti-HEXIM1 antibodies (Fig. 5A) or anti-GFP antibodies (not shown) revealed that lysates from GCM cells express a GFP-HEXIM1 fusion protein that migrates as a 90-kDa polypeptide, whereas endogenous HEXIM1 migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa. The capacity of GFP-HEXIM1 to interact with P-TEFb was investigated by immunoprecipitation. Anti-GFP antibodies retained CDK9 and Cyclin T1 from GCM cell extracts (Fig. 5A, lane 6). Coimmunoprecipitation of CDK9 and Cyclin T1 with GFP-HEXIM1 was suppressed when RNase was added to the extracts (lane 7) or when the cells were treated with actinomycin D prior to lysis (lane 8). The anti-GFP antibodies also retained endogenous HEXIM1 from GCM lysates but not from untransfected HeLa cell lysates. Thus, GFP-HEXIM1 and HEXIM1 molecules coexist within the same complexes. This association was affected by neither RNase nor actinomycin D treatments (lanes 7 and 8) in contrast to P-TEFb association to HEXIM1. HEXIM1 can be fractionated by ultracentrifugation on glycerol gradients into two complexes (7Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The large one also comprises CDK9, Cyclin T1 or T2, and 7SK RNA. Because the same HEXIM1 domain interacts with other HEXIM molecules and Cyclin T1, the formation of P-TEFb·HEXIM1·7SK RNA complexes might involve the disruption of HEXIM/HEXIM interactions. To address this possibility, lysates from GCM cells were loaded on a glycerol gradient, and both the HEXIM1 and the GFP-HEXIM1 proteins were separated into “small” (fractions 2-4) and “large” (fractions 7 and 8) complexes (Fig. 5B). Buffer A without salt addition was used for cell lysis and gradient to optimize the separation of both complexes. Under these conditions, all soluble CDK9 and Cyclin T1 are bound to HEXIM/7SK. 3V. T. Nguyen, unpublished results. The small GFP-HEXIM1 complexes peaked at a slightly higher molecular mass than small endogenous HEXIM1 complexes. The large GFP-HEXIM1 and HEXIM1 complexes comigrated with Cyclin T1 and CDK9 and thus likely corresponded to GFP-HEXIM1 and HEXIM1 bound to P-TEFb. Indeed, anti-GFP beads retained Cyclin T1 and CDK9 from fraction 7 (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, anti-GFP antibodies retained endogenous HEXIM1 from both small (lane 3) and large (lane 7) GFP-HEXIM1 complex fractions. This observation, combined with the lack of RNase and actinomycin D sensitivity, suggests that HEXIM1 behaves as an oligomeric module independently of its interaction with P-TEFb. HEXIM1 Complexes Are Anisotropic—To establish the stoichiometry of HEXIM1 molecules, the molecular mass of the small HEXIM1 complexes was determined. A HeLa cell extract was loaded on glycerol gradients and on gel-permeation columns (Fig. 6, A and B). HEXIM1 sedimented between ovalbumin (43 kDa, marker 8) and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, marker 1), suggesting an intermediate molecular mass (Fig. 6A). In contrast, elution from the gel-permeation column suggested a particle close to β-galactosidase (460 kDa, marker 5) (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar observations were made with purified recombinant HEXIM1. An anisotropic particle runs in a gelpermeation column like a spherical particle of much bigger mass, as an increased Stokes radius diminishes the capacity of a particle to enter the beads. In contrast, the higher the Stokes radius the slower a particle sediments in a glycerol gradient. An anisotropic particle runs on a glycerol gradient like a spherical protein of much smaller mass. Hence, the large difference between apparent molecular mass deduced by simple comparison with protein standards either in centrifugation or by gelpermeation chromatography indicates that HEXIM1 complexes form highly anisotropic particles. Sizing the HEXIM1 Particles—The parameter obtained by multiplication of the sedimentation coefficient with the Stokes radius (S*RS) is proportional to the molecular mass of the particle and is not affected by its shape (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Indeed, according to published hydrodynamic parameters for a collection of protein standards, the native molecular mass of proteins verified the relation Mw = 4 (S*RS) over two orders of magnitude (Fig. 6C). Sedimentation coefficients of HEXIM1 complexes were determined by comparison with protein standards on glycerol gradients (Fig. 6, A and D). Ultracentrifugation during 49 h was optimal to determine sedimentation coefficients of HEXIM1 not bound to P-TEFb·7SK. Under these conditions, ovalbumin (3.5 S) and bovine serum albumin (4.55 S) sedimented in fractions 10.75 ± 0.25 and 13.5 ± 0.25, respectively. Cellular HEXIM1 from HeLa cells was concentrated in only two fractions and showed a sedimentation coefficient of 4.2 ± 0.15 S. Recombinant HEXIM1 peaked in fraction 12.5 ± 0.25 corresponding to a sedimentation coefficient of 4.3 ± 0.15 S. However, a significant amount of this protein was dispersed in upper and lower fractions. Stokes radii were determined by comparison with elution of protein standards from a gel-permeation column (Fig. 6, B and E). Cellular HEXIM1 eluted like β-galactosidase (6.9 ± 0.5 nm). Hence, its S*RS value corresponded to a protein of 116 ± 15 kDa molecular mass. In contrast, the elution profile of the full-length recombinant HEXIM1 was much more dispersed (6.25 ± 1.5 nm), overlapping β-galactosidase (6.9 nm) and catalase (5.2 nm). Hence, its S*RS value corresponded to a 95 ± 35-kDa particle. Because sequences N-terminal to the basic domain appeared not to be involved in oligomerization, a purified recombi"

The second intracellular loop (IL2) of SERT contains consensus sequences for cGMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. A 24-residue region of SERT including IL2, from Ile-270 through Ser-293, was analyzed by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and chemical modification. 2-(Aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) failed to inhibit serotonin transport or binding of the cocaine analog 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) in intact cells expressing these mutants, but it inactivated β-CIT binding in membrane preparations. From the pattern of sensitivity, IL2 appears to extend from Trp-271 through Ile-290, a significantly longer region than that initially predicted by hydropathy analysis. Six mutants reacted with MTSEA much faster than the others, and the pattern of the more reactive mutations suggested that IL2 is in an α-helical conformation. Some of the mutants had significantly elevated transport rates, suggesting a possible mechanism for the regulation of SERT activity.

SLC6A4) is a presynaptic plasma membrane protein responsible for the reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytrypatamine, abbreviated 5-HT) after its release by neurons. It is a member of a large family of amine and amino acid transporters (SLC6, NSS) distributed throughout the prokaryotic and animal kingdoms. Together with norepinephrine and dopamine transporters (NET and DAT), SERT is part of a subgroup of transporters that mediate the transport of biogenic amine neurotransmitters by symport with Na+ and Cl– ions (1Rudnick G. Reith M.E.A. Neurotransmitter Transporters, Structure, Function, and Regulation. 2nd. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 25-52Google Scholar). SERT is of particular interest in neurobiology because it is the molecular target of several drugs of abuse and many therapeutic agents used to treat psychiatric disorders. Along with NET and DAT, SERT is inhibited by cocaine, and cocaine analogues bind to SERT with high affinity (2Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wall S.C.

Amphetamine and its derivatives, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy), interact with SERT, DAT, and NET as substrates (5Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Inhibitors that prevent 5-HT reuptake into serotonergic neurons have been used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including affective disorder, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and autism (7Murphy D.L.

Furthermore, the incidence of some psychiatric disorders and the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs has been linked to polymorphisms in the promoter of the gene encoding SERT (10Lesch K.P. Bengel D. Heils A. Sabol S.Z. Greenberg B.D. Petri S. Benjamin J. Muller C.R. Hamer D.H. Murphy D.L. Science. 1996; 274: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar, 11Sher L. Goldman D.

A naturally occurring mutation in human SERT, I425V, was found to be associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder and several other 5-HT-related disorders (14Ozaki N. Goldman D. Kaye W.H. Plotnicov K. Greenberg B.D. Lappalainen J. Rudnick G. Murphy D.L. Mol. Psychiatry. 2003; 8: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Further investigation revealed that this mutation caused SERT to be in an activated state that is reached in the wild type through the action of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (15Kilic F. Murphy D.L. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of SERT predicted 12 transmembrane (TM) domains connected by intracellular and extracellular loops (16Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 17Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). This analysis predicted that the second intracellular loop (IL2) was a short cytoplasmic loop containing nine residues connecting TM domains 4 and 5. Further analysis suggested that this loop contained consensus phosphorylation sites for cGMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (18Miller K.J. Hoffman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27351-27356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the location of glycosylation sites in the second extracellular loop, the NH2 and COOH termini were predicted to be cytoplasmic (19Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments using mutagenesis and chemical modification in intact cells and disrupted membranes have verified the overall topology (20Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

The results reported here suggest that it is longer than predicted and contains an α-helical structure. Mutagenesis—Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene). The mutated region was excised by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the X5C mutant of rat SERT, which contains sequences encoding a c-Myc epitope tag at the NH2 terminus and a FLAG epitope tag at the COOH terminus (19Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X5C (C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A) is lacking all of the endogenous cysteine residues known to react with MTS reagents (25Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All mutations were screened by restriction mapping and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression—The expression system used has been described in detail elsewhere (26Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Stephan M.M. Chen M.A. Penado K.M. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were plated in 96-well culture plates and allowed to grow overnight. The confluent cells were infected with recombinant VTF7-3 virus and transfected with a plasmid containing rat SERT cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter. Transfected cells were incubated for 20–22 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then assayed for transport. Protein concentration was determined with the Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Surface expression of SERT mutants was determined using the membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) as described previously (20Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12675-12681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing SERT mutants were treated twice with NHS-SS-biotin for 20 min on ice. After labeling, the cells were rinsed with 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS/CM) for 20 min on ice to quench excess sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. The cells were then lysed, and the biotinylated proteins were recovered using streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) in an overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed, and the biotinylated proteins were eluted with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Portions of each sample were applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Western blotting. The transporters were detected using anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) (1:1000) against the FLAG epitope tag at the COOH terminus of rat SERT (19Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) was used to visualize the signal by Super Signal West Femto (Pierce). The amount of surface expression was determined by quantitative luminescence imaging using a UVP Biochemi imaging system. Transport Assay—[3H]5-HT influx was assayed in monolayer cultures at room temperature. Transfected HeLa cells in 96-well plates were washed once with 100 μl of PBS/CM. Transport of 5-HT was measured by adding 100 μl of PBS/CM containing 20 nm [3H]5-HT (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) to each well and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. The assays were terminated by three rapid washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then solubilized in 30 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min. The extent of [3H]5-HT accumulated was determined by a Wallac MicroBeta plate counter. Mutants were tested for their accessibility to extracellular 2-(aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario Canada) in intact cells. Cells were preincubated with 1 mm MTSEA for 10 min at room temperature in PBS/CM and washed three times with 100 μl of PBS/CM to quench unreacted MTSEA, and the transport assay was performed as described above. Whole Cell Binding Assay—Cells expressing each of the IL2 mutants were preincubated with 1 mm MTSEA for 10 min at room temperature and washed three times with 100 μl of PBS/CM. 2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT) binding was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of PBS/CM containing 0.1 nm β-CIT (RTI-55; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle rocking, and the assay was terminated by washing the cells three times with 100 μl of ice-cold PBS. The cells were then solubilized in 30 μl of 0.1 m NaOH for 30 min. The amount of β-CIT bound was measured by a Wallac MicroBeta plate counter. Membrane Preparation and Binding Assay—Binding of the high affinity cocaine analogue β-CIT was measured in crude membrane preparations. HeLa cells grown in 75-cm2 cell culture flasks were transfected with rat SERT cDNA as described above. After overnight transfection, the cells were rinsed once with room temperature 10 mm lithium-HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES-free acid brought to pH 8.0 with LiOH) and scraped into 10 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed by two cycles of freeze-thawing and sonication, and the resulting crude membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer and stored at –80 °C in 0.1-ml aliquots until used. For membrane binding assays, aliquots of membranes from cells expressing rat SERT mutants were thawed on ice and diluted with 1 ml of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). Binding was measured in Multiscreen-FB 96-well filtration plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which were pretreated by the addition of 200 μl of 0.1% polyethyleneimine to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The polyethyleneimine was rinsed away with 3× 100 μl of room temperature binding buffer, and then 100 μl of the diluted membrane solution was added per well. The membranes were washed twice by filtration with 200 μl of binding buffer, and binding was then initiated by the addition of 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.1 nm β-CIT (RTI-55; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Binding was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The reaction was stopped by washing all wells three times with 100 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. The filters were removed from the plate and counted after soaking in 150 μl of Optifluor. For determination of MTSEA or (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) sensitivity, the membranes were incubated with MTSEA or MTSES at varying concentrations for 15 min at room temperature following the initial washing of the membranes, and then the MTS reagent was removed by washing the membranes three times with binding buffer. The β-CIT binding after MTS treatment was measured by the addition of β-CIT as described above. Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve-fitting algorithm. The statistical analysis given was from multiple experiments. Data with error bars represent the mean S.D. for triplicate measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t tests. Transport Activity of IL2 Mutants—Initial predictions based on hydropathy profiles suggested that IL2 is a nine-residue loop between TM4 and TM5 (from Trp-271 through Lys-279) (16Blakely R. Berson H.

Amino acid alignment indicates the residues in IL2 are highly conserved within the neurotransmitter transporter family and especially so within the biogenic amine transporters (Fig. 1). To investigate the structural and functional properties of this region, we substituted the native residue at each position from Ile-270 to Ser-293, one at a time, with cysteine. The cysteine mutants were individually subcloned into a background construct designated X5C (C15A/C21A/C109A/C357I/C622A), which is relatively insensitive to cysteine MTS reagents (25Sato Y. Zhang Y.-W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). X5C has ∼25–30% of wild type transport activity. Fig. 2 shows the transport activity of each cysteine substitution mutant relative to the parental X5C construct. Of the twenty-four mutants, most retained transport activity comparable with or greater than that of X5C with the exception of V291C and L292C, which retained <50% of X5C activity. Seven mutants (W271C, K272C, K275C, T276C, A285C, F287C, and I290C) had levels of 5-HT uptake similar to that of X5C, and in the remaining mutants transport activity was increased from 150 to 400% that of X5C. Full kinetic analysis was performed on each mutant, yielding the data for Km and Vmax shown in Table I. Actual surface expression levels are shown in Fig. 3. The majority of the cysteine mutants were expressed at lower levels than X5C on the cell surface. One of the mutants, L292C, was almost undetectable. However, the surface expression of about one-third of the mutants was not significantly different from that of X5C (Fig. 3, A and B). From the Vmax values and the levels of surface expression, we calculated a normalized Vmax for each mutant (Fig. 3C). Several of the mutants had maximal rates of transport higher than both the parent X5C construct (Fig. 3C, white dashes) and the wild type transporter (black dashes).Fig. 25-HT transport activity of HeLa cells transfected with SERT IL2 cysteine mutants.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Cell surface expression of SERT IL2 cysteine substitution mutants. A, cells expressing the indicated mutants were treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin to label cell surface proteins. Cells were lysed, proteins were solubilized, and the biotinylated fraction was extracted with streptavidin beads. Transporters were detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope tag. B and C, from the relative integrated density of each 96-kDa band, which represents the mature, fully glycosylated form of SERT, the expression levels of IL2 mutants were estimated as a percentage of X5C expression (B). Asterisks in panel B indicate values significantly different (p < 0.05) from that of control (X5C). Using the Vmax values for these mutants from Table I and the surface expression levels from panel B, we calculated a normalized Vmax for each mutant (C). These normalized values are expressed relative to the activity of SERT C109A (black dashes). The activity of X5C is shown by the white dashes. Asterisks in panel C indicate values significantly higher (p < 0.05) than C109A activity.

Each of these mutants was constructed in the X5C background, which was relatively insensitive to MTSEA (Table II). For each mutant we measured 5-HT influx and β-CIT binding after incubation with 1 mm MTSEA for 10 min. As shown in Table II, extracellular MTSEA had little effect on transport activity or binding activity in any of the cysteine mutants, all of which were similar to the background X5C, suggesting that, as expected, these residues were not accessible from the external medium.Table IIEffect of MTSEA on 5-HT transport and β-CIT binding activities of IL2 cysteine mutants in intact cellsMutantTransport activityBinding activityX5C82.4 ± 5.785.5 ± 1.7I270C78.3 ± 5.183.5 ± 2.2W271C87.1 ± 6.885.9 ± 11.6K272C82.6 ± 11.191.8 ± 5.1G273C78.6 ± 5.278.9 ± 9.9V274C76.1 ± 14.075.4 ± 8.5K275C84.9 ± 2.683.5 ± 6.5T276C84.2 ± 11.180.7 ± 7.4S277C85.4 ± 2.884.6 ± 6.2G278C79.3 ± 10.579.2 ± 3.6K279C86.1 ± 3.181.1 ± 6.0V280C87.6 ± 1.186.0 ± 2.9V281C81.7 ± 6.285.5 ± 1.7W282C90.9 ± 3.083.5 ± 2.2V283C87.9 ± 2.985.9 ± 11.6T284C74.6 ± 12.591.8 ± 5.1A285C89.1 ± 9.378.9 ± 9.9T286C86.6 ± 3.675.4 ± 8.5F287C89.9 ± 3.983.5 ± 6.5P288C89.2 ± 2.580.7 ± 7.4Y289C89.9 ± 4.484.6 ± 6.2I290C87.3 ± 4.879.2 ± 3.6V291C87.5 ± 7.581.1 ± 6.0L292C97. ± 8.686.0 ± 2.9 Open table in a new tab MTSEA Inactivation of β-CIT Binding—In previous studies (21Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Ghassemi F. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45933-45938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), intact cells expressing cysteine substitution mutants in putative intracellular domains were insensitive to MTS reagents in the external medium. However, in membrane preparations from those cells, binding of the cocaine analog β-CIT was inactivated by the same reagents, presumably by inducing an indirect conformational change at the binding site. We infer that the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane became accessible to MTS reagents in the membrane preparations. For this reason, we tested the effect of MTSEA concentration on β-CIT binding to membrane preparations from cells expressing each mutant. Representative data for four of the mutants and X5C are shown in Fig. 4. These inactivation profiles show that some mutants, for example, G273C and V274C, were completely inactivated at low concentrations of MTSEA, whereas others, such as K272C and K275C, retained partial activity even at the highest MTSEA concentrations used. Each of the curves in Fig. 4 and similar curves from the 20 other mutants were fit to estimate the MTSEA concentration that led to half-maximal inhibition for each mutant and also the maximal extent of MTSEA inhibition. Fig. 5 shows the level of β-CIT binding remaining after maximal inhibition, which was estimated from fits of MTSEA-dependent inactivation. Remarkably, MTSEA either partially or completely inactivated almost all of the mutants with cysteines at positions between 271 and 290. Significant binding activity was retained in W271C, K272C, K275C, K279C, Y289C, and I290C. Mutants with cysteines at positions proximal to 270 and distal to 290 retained levels of β-CIT binding similar to that of the parental construct X5C after treatment with MTSEA. These results suggest that IL2 functionally extends from Trp-271 to Ile-290. In addition to MTSEA, the negatively charged MTSES was also used to treat some of the mutants. Although MTSES failed to inactivate X5C over this concentration range, Fig. 6 shows that it was quite effective at inactivating mutants at positions 272–279 including the three lysine-to-cysteine mutants K272C, K275C, and K279C. The differences in sensitivity of K272C, K275C, and K279C to treatment with MTSES and MTSEA were apparently due to their inability to react with MTSEA. Treatment with MTSEA up to 1 mm failed to protect these mutants from subsequent inactivation by MTSES as shown in Fig. 7. In this experiment, membranes were treated with various concentrations of MTSEA prior to MTSES. The EC50 concentration of MTSEA, sufficient to half-maximally inactivate each mutant, was used to calculate rate constants with the assumption of bimolecular kinetics and a first-order time course of activity loss (29Rudnick G. Quick M.W. Transmembrane Transporters. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2002: 125-141Crossref Google Scholar). In the 15-min inactivation reaction, half-maximal inactivation gives a t½ of 15 min and a pseudo first-order rate constant of 0.046 min–1. From this value and the concentrations of MTSEA required for half-maximal inactivation, the rate constants shown in Fig. 8 were calculated. We interpret a higher inactivation rate as greater accessibility to MTSEA. Six cysteine mutants, G273C, V274C, S277C, V280C, V281C, and T284C, reacted with rate constants over 20 s–1 m–1, which is >75 times faster than the background X5C, whereas the remaining mutants reacted with rate constants below 1 s–1 m–1. The data presented in Fig. 5 clearly define a region of SERT from approximately Trp-271 through Ile-290, where the residues are likely to be in contact with the cytoplasm. A significantly shorter region (271–279) was initially predicted from hydropathy profiles to constitute the IL2 of SERT (16Blakely R. Berson H. Fremeau R. Caron M. Peek M. Prince H. Bradely C. Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 17Hoffman B.J. Mezey E. Brownstein M.J. Science. 1991; 254: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 28Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A. Moore K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Chang A. Ganapathy V. Blakely R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2542-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The region is likely intracellular, because mutants with cysteine at these positions were inactivated by MTSEA in membrane preparations (Figs. 4, 5, and 8) but did not react with extracellular MTSEA in intact cells (Table II). It is possible that IL2 extends even beyond this range, because residues proximal to Trp-271 or distal to Ile-290 might react with MTSEA with no consequence for transport or binding activity. However, it is problematic to measure reactivity in the absence of a change in activity. There were two mutations within the reactive region, K275C and K279C, where substitution with cysteine did not adversely affect transport or binding activity and which retained a considerable fraction of activity even at high MTSEA concentrations (Fig. 5), although the negatively charged MTSES was able to totally inactivate each of the lysine-to-cysteine mutants (Fig. 6). Cysteine mutants at neighboring positions were mostly inactivated by the same treatment. We considered the possibility that the modified cysteine residue, a disulfide with 2-thioethylamine, was sufficiently similar in structure to the endogenous lysine residues at these positions so that the modification did not disrupt function. An example in which an MTSEA-modified cysteine mimicked a lysine residue was described for the dopamine D2 receptor (30Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 692-698PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative possibility was that MTSEA did not fully modify K275C or K279C, possibly because of electrostatic repulsion from neighboring residues. Consistent with this latter hypothesis, pre-treatment with MTSEA failed to protect these mutants against subsequent inactivation by MTSES, as would be expected if MTSEA modified these positions (Fig. 7). Thus, it is most likely that MTSEA did not react with K275C and K279C. At six positions, cysteine substitution mutants were inactivated with dramatically higher rate constants than those of the remaining positions tested (Fig. 8). These six positions appeared to be in a repeating pattern, every 3–4 residues, within IL2. When modeled as an α-helix (Fig. 9), the more reactive positions mapped to a vertical stripe along the side of the helix encompassing four helical turns. This was somewhat surprising, because structure prediction algorithms did not identify this region as α-helical. Neither the Garnier-Osguthrope-Robson algorithm, nor the Agadir algorithm (31Lacroix E. Viguera A.R. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), nor the Predict-Protein algorithm (32Rost B. Yachdav G. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W321-W326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar) predicted helical structure in this region. The pattern or reactivity, however, strongly suggests that at least part of this region is in an α-helical conformation. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of secondary structure in the cytoplasmic domain of a neurotransmitter transporter in the NSS family. We assume that the increased reactivity of G273C, V274C, S277C, V280C, V281C, and T284C results from increased accessibility of the substituted cysteine residue to aqueous MTSEA. Other possibilities are that the microenvironments of these positions lead either to greater ionization of the cysteine sulfhydryl group (pKa = 8.33) or to a higher local concentration of MTSEA. We consider the first of these possibilities unlikely, because at pH 7.3 we expect ∼10% of the cysteine sulfhydryl groups to be ionized, and the maximum increase from a decrease in pKa would be 10-fold. The more reactive mutants are up to 100-fold more reactive than the less reactive ones (Fig. 8). It is also possible that limited aqueous accessibility increases the pKa of cysteine at the less reactive positions. In the absence of any evidence in favor of an increased local MTSEA concentration, we consider that accessibility is the most likely determinant of reactivity in this region. Our estimates of first-order rate constants for inactivation were based on measurements over a range of MTSEA or MTSES concentration rather than time courses at a single concentration. As a consequence, all these estimates were based on the amount of inactivation in a 15-min incubation. Because hydrolysis of the MTS reagents during this time competes with inactivation, the concentrations are only estimates of the true rates. However, by using the same time point for each measurement we minimize the variability in the fraction of reagent hydrolyzed between mutants that reacted at different rates. Because the positions studied were accessible only in disrupted plasma membrane preparations that expose residues facing the cytoplasm, we have used β-CIT binding rather than transport as an assay to follow modification of these mutants. However, the incubations with MTSEA and MTSES were performed in the absence of β-CIT and presumably reflect the properties of unliganded SERT. The dramatic change in reactivity from one side of the helix to the other suggests that other parts of the protein or associated proteins must restrict access to some of the residues but not to others. The helical region could be an extension of one of the adjacent transmembrane domains as seen in the structures of Ca2+-ATPase (33Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) and a glutamate transporter homologue (34Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and postulated for SERT extracellular loop 4 (22Mitchell S.M. Lee E. Garcia M.L. Stephan M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24089-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the IL2 helix could be independent of the transmembrane domains as in the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter (35Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). We must also consider the possibility that a major part of the accessible region represents part of TM5 and that the accessibility of this region indicates that TM5 lines part of the permeation pathway for substrates and ions. On the opposite side of the putative helix from the reactive residues are three lysine residues. These residues are highly conserved within the animal members of the NSS family (Fig. 1). Even among the prokaryotic members of the family there are usually at least two lysine residues separated by 2–3 residues, suggesting that this basic stripe along the IL2 helix is an important structural or functional element. When one of these lysines was replaced with cysteine (as in K275C or K279C), MTSEA (but not MTSES) reactivity was reduced dramatically (Figs. 4, 5, 6), suggesting that MTSEA was repelled by the electrostatic influence of the remaining lysine residues. Cells expressing many of the cysteine mutants in this region transported 5-HT more rapidly than the parental X5C construct (Fig. 2). Our results (Figs. 3 and 9) suggest that the increased activity of these mutants was not due to higher levels of surface expression. Moreover, several of these mutants had greater maximal transport activity when normalized for surface expression than wild type SERT. The pattern of positions where cysteine substitution elevated Vmax over that of wild type was not a typical α-helical pattern (Fig. 9B) but rather delineated a set of positions at an acute angle to the putative helical axis. In the middle of this region is Pro-288. If a kink was formed in the helix at this point, then the residues where cysteine replacement increased activity could potentially define a contiguous region. The ability of mutations in this region to increase transport activity suggests the possibility that the region between TM4 and TM5 may fulfill a conformationally active role in the catalytic cycle of SERT. Disruption of the native conformation, evidently an α-helix, may allow greater flexibility in this region and a consequently increased turnover. In the related GABA transporter, GAT-1, Hansra et al. (36Hansra N. Arya S. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4082-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that IL4 acts similarly as a negative regulator of transport rate, presumably by forming a barrier near the substrate permeation path. If IL2 represents an inhibitory element by decreasing SERT activity through intramolecular interactions, then mutations in SERT IL2 might disrupt its inhibitory influence, possibly by destabilizing the α-helix, and increase the intrinsic activity of the transporter. We are currently investigating this possibility that mutations or other modifications in this region affect activity by disrupting the apparently helical structure between Gly-273 and Thr-284."

https://openalex.org/W2088273206,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We examined the role of LPL in modulating tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)- and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated inflammatory cytokine signal transduction pathways in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). LPL significantly suppressed TNF-α-induced gene expression, and this suppression was reversed by tetrahydrolipstatin and heparinase. In contrast, LPL synergistically enhanced IFN-γ-induced gene expression in HAECs. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of LPL action, we investigated the role of transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (Stat1). The anti-inflammatory response of LPL in suppressing TNF-α-induced gene expression was a result of its inhibition of NF-κB activity by the abrogation of IκB-α degradation and phosphorylation of the p65 subunit. Although LPL alone had no effect on Stat1 activation, LPL enhanced IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of Stat1 on tyrosine 701 and serine 727, as well as Stat1-mediated transactivation. The synergistic effect of LPL on IFN-γ-induced Stat1 activation was mediated by enhanced activation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 and was abrogated by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway. Our studies indicate that LPL has differential effects on several inflammatory pathways known to be important in atherosclerosis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key enzyme in the hydrolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We examined the role of LPL in modulating tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)- and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated inflammatory cytokine signal transduction pathways in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). LPL significantly suppressed TNF-α-induced gene expression, and this suppression was reversed by tetrahydrolipstatin and heparinase. In contrast, LPL synergistically enhanced IFN-γ-induced gene expression in HAECs. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of LPL action, we investigated the role of transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1 (Stat1). The anti-inflammatory response of LPL in suppressing TNF-α-induced gene expression was a result of its inhibition of NF-κB activity by the abrogation of IκB-α degradation and phosphorylation of the p65 subunit. Although LPL alone had no effect on Stat1 activation, LPL enhanced IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of Stat1 on tyrosine 701 and serine 727, as well as Stat1-mediated transactivation. The synergistic effect of LPL on IFN-γ-induced Stat1 activation was mediated by enhanced activation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 and was abrogated by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway. Our studies indicate that LPL has differential effects on several inflammatory pathways known to be important in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, and inflammatory cytokine synthesis in the developing plaque is known to play a crucial role in atherosclerotic progression (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Stat1, signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1; HSPG, heparin sulfate proteoglycan; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; JAK, Janis kinase; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell; THL, tetrahydrolipstatin; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; IL-8, interleukin-8; GBP-1, guanylate-binding protein-1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift; LDLR, low density lipoprotein receptor. and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) cause activation of endothelium and are implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease (2Lusis A.J.

In the presence of cytokines, endothelial cells acquire the capacity to bind and activate leukocytes by enhanced expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a multifunctional protein in both health and disease. LPL plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and causes a wide variety of alterations in lipoprotein metabolism, including lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. LPL is synthesized mostly in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle tissue and secreted into the interstitial space. Small amounts of LPL are also produced in endothelial cells, macrophages, and pancreatic islet cells. LPL binds glycosaminoglycans on the interstitial side of endothelial cells and undergoes transcytosis to the luminal surface of the capillary endothelium (4Mead J.R. Irvine S.A. Ramji D.P. J. Mol.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of lipid lowering drugs have shown that vascular function is improved by LPL-mediated generation of free fatty acids (10Kuvin J.T. Rämet M. Patel A. Pandian N. Mendelsohn M. Karas R. Am. Heart J. 2002; 144: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, humans with mutations in the promoter region of LPL are at increased risk for developing atherosclerosis (11Reymer P. Gagne E. Groenemeyer B. Zhang H. Forsyth I. Jansen H. Seidell J. Kromhout D. Lie K. Kastelein J. Hayden M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In macrophages, LPL is known to mediate increased uptake of lipoproteins and to induce TNF-α. This autocrine activation may result in pro-atherogenic activity. LPL can synergize with IFN-γ to increase inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene expression in mouse macrophages (12Renier G. Lambert A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, LPL may have pro-atherogenic or anti-atherogenic effects depending upon cell type and on local conditions in the arterial wall. Epidemiological studies have also suggested a strong correlation between hyperlipidemia and colon cancer (13Bruce W.R. Wolever T.M. Giacca A. Nutr. Cancer. 2000; 37: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In mouse models of adenomatous polyposis such as Min and APC1309 age-dependent hyperlipidemia, increased intestinal polyp formation and down-regulation of LPL was reported (14Niho N. Takahashi M. Kitamura T. Shoji Y. Itoh M. Noda T. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6090-609512PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of NO-1886, a compound known to increase LPL mRNA and protein levels, resulted in concurrent suppression of hyperlipidemia, cyclooxygenase-2 levels, and intestinal polyp formation (15Niho N. Mutoh M. Takahashi M. Tsutsumi K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2970-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TNF-α activation of endothelial cells leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, activation of an inflammatory cascade, and endothelial cell dysfunction (16Agnoletti L. Curello S. Bachetti T. Malacarne F. Gaia G. Comini L. Volterrani M. Bonetti P. Parrinello G. Cadei M. Grigolato P.G. Ferrari R.

Circulation. 2001; 104: 3023-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The active NF-κB complex consists of either homo- or heterodimers of NF-κB/Rel family proteins with Rel domain homology. The proteins NF-κB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-κB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), c-Rel, RelA (p65), and RelB are part of the complex. In the cytoplasm, NF-κB is inactive due to the binding of inhibitory protein IκB-α. Following TNF-α stimulation of cells, an activation cascade involving IκB kinases phosphorylates the IκB-α protein, results in the release of NF-κB from the IκB proteins and translocation to the nucleus where it binds to NF-κB sites in the promoter region of target genes (18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). IFN-γ, predominantly secreted by activated T cells is a proinflammatory cytokine important for leukocyte recruitment and endothelial cell activation. Within target tissues, IFN-γ induces expression of multiple chemokines, further enhancing leukocyte recruitment. IFN-γ also induces the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), which plays an important role in the adherence and migration of leukocytes at sites of inflammation (20Hou J. Baichwal V. Cao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11641-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 21Bennion S.D. Middleton M.H. David-Bajar K.M. Brice S. Norris D.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The binding of IFN-γ to its surface receptor activates the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2. JAK kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the latent cytosolic transcription factor Stat1. Phosphorylated Stat1 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to the γ-activated sequence elements of IFN-γ response genes (22Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.H. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 23Ramana C.V. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Nguyen H. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This initial step may be crucial in the development of atherogenesis (2Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4735) Google Scholar). This study was designed to test the effects of LPL on TNF-α- and IFN-γ-induced gene expression in human aortic endothelial cells. Our studies showed that LPL attenuates the inflammatory cascade generated by TNF-α, but synergizes with IFN-γ induced gene expression through differential modulation of NF-κB and Stat1, respectively. Cell Culture and Reagents—HAECs were purchased from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and grown to confluence in Medium 200 containing penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B with or without low serum growth supplement. Experiments were conducted with cells at passages 4-6 that were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator. Cells were removed using a trypsin/EDTA solution, and followed by trypsin neutralizer solution (Cascade Biologics). An acute inflammatory stimulus was produced by incubating with 10 ng/ml human recombinant TNF-α or 1000 units/ml human recombinant IFN-γ (Roche Applied Science). LPL (catalog number L2254) and heparinase I were obtained from Sigma. LPL was used at a concentration of 3 units/ml, unless stated otherwise. Antibodies to IκB-α, p50, and p65 subunits of NF-κB were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and β actin antibody was from Sigma. Phospho-serine and phospho-tyrosine Stat1, phospho-serine p65 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA). Tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) was obtained from Roche Applied Science and was used at a concentration of 100 μm. LPL and THL were incubated for 30 min in vitro on ice and then dialyzed in Tris (10 mm)-EDTA (1 mm) buffer before treatment of cells. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay, and the cell viability levels were ≥96% after treatment. HAECs were pre-treated with heparinase I (2 u/ml) in the medium lacking serum for a period of 45 min, then the media containing heparinase I was removed by washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Plasma samples from voluntary recruits (The University of California-Davis, Human Research approved protocols) were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 25 min in a 50.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 15 °C. Following the separation of chylomicrons, total Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL, d > 1.006 g/ml) was then isolated by ultracentrifugation for 20 h in a 50.3 Beckman rotor at 12 °C. Total VLDL was further dialyzed to d = 1.21 g/ml with two changes of dialysis buffer over a 24-h period and subjected to ultracentrifugation in an SW41 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 6 h at 40,000 rpm and 17 °C. VLDL was used at a concentration of 5 or 50 μg/ml. Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis—Detection of gene transcript levels was performed using the GeneAmp 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitation of mRNA of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), fractalkine, guanylate-binding protein-1 (GBP-1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were performed from cDNA prepared from total RNA extracts isolated from HAECs and subjected to different treatments. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared with 1 μg of total RNA and SuperScript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase by following the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). Primers for genes of interest were designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). The primer sequences are as follows: MCP-1 (sense, 5′-GCCAAGGAGATCTGTGCTGAC-3′; antisense, 5′-CATGGAATCCTGAACCCACTTC-3′), IL-8 (sense, 5′-GTGTAAACATGACTTCCAAGCTGG-3′; antisense, 5′-GCACCTTCACACAGAGCTGC-3′), ICAM-1 (sense, 5′-CAGAAGAAGTGGCCCTCCATAG-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGCCTTTGTGTTTTGATGCTA-3′), fractalkine (sense, 5′-TCACGTGCAGCAAGATGACA-3′; antisense, 5′-AGTGGATGAGCAAAGCTACAGGTAT-3′), GAPDH (sense, 5′-CACCAACTGCTTAGCACCCC-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACG-3′), and GBP-1 (sense, 5′-GAAGAAGAAGTGAAGGCGGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-GAGACGATAGCCCCCTGGTT-3′). Sample cDNAs were diluted 1:10 and analyzed in duplicate on 96-well optical plates using the SYBR Green I Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). In each reaction, 600 nm forward and reverse primers were used to amplify message. The thermal cycling parameters were as follows: thermal activation for 10 min at 95 °C and 40 cycles of PCR (melting for 15 s at 95 °C and annealing/extension for 1 min at 60 °C). A standard curve for each gene was made from positive control samples diluted 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160. Optimal sample cDNA and primer concentrations were performed to determine efficiency and specificity of all primers. PCR product formation was verified by analysis of product heat-dissociation curves and amplification plots, and product quantification values were taken from the linear region of the PCR curve. Expression levels for inflammatory genes were normalized to GAPDH levels for each sample. Measurement of VCAM-1, E-selectin by Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin was performed with a Beckman Coulter Epics XLFACScan and analyzed with Expo 32XL4 Color software. Confluent cultures of HAECs were harvested by trypsinization, and staining of HAECs was performed by the following protocol: cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in staining buffer (Mg+2/Ca+2 free phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal calf serum and 0.09% sodium azide, pH 7.4), repelleted, and resuspended in 50 ml of staining buffer. Cells were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 4 °C with CD106-PE-Cy5 (VCAM-1) and CD62E-PE (E-selectin) antibodies (BD Pharmingen). At the end of the incubation cells were washed twice in staining buffer and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of surface antigen (VCAM-1 and E-selectin) was performed in staining buffer containing 1% paraformaldehyde. Following a wash with Perm/Wash solution, the cells were resuspended in staining buffer, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed, by selecting between 5,000 and 10,000 events for each sample. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts of HAECs were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce). Nuclear proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad assay and stored at -80 °C. EMSAs were performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for the consensus binding sites of transcription factors. The binding reactions consisted of 25 μg of nuclear protein and 20 fmol of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. Oligonucleotides were labeled (20 ng/μl) with 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 3 μl of [γ-32P]dATP at 37 °C for 45 min. End-labeled oligonucleotides were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by using chromaspin-10 columns (Clontech). The double-stranded NF-κB consensus sequence, 5′-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGT-3′, and γ-activated sequence, 5′-GTCGACATTTCCCGTAAATCG-3′, were used in the reaction. The binding reactions (20 μl) were carried out for 20 min in binding buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC). To check the specificity of the protein-DNA interactions, the supershift reaction was carried out by adding 1 μg of polyclonal antibody to NF-κB (p 50) to the binding reaction. The reaction products were separated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed following the autoradiography of the dried gel. Western Blotting—Protein expression levels were checked by Western analysis. 25-50 μg of proteins was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then placed in Tris-buffered saline blocking solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and either 5% nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h. Blots were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody and washed extensively with 1× Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20. Following horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation and washes, bound IgG was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—To examine the effect of test compounds on NF-κB and Stat1 promoter activity, HAECs were transiently transfected with 5× NF-κB-luc or 4× Stat1-luc reporter constructs (19Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 29Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid and 2 μg of Renilla luciferase (to verify transfection efficiency) using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Eight hours after transfection, the cells were divided into four 100-mm plates. After incubation for 40 h, transfected cells were treated for 6 h with IFN-γ1000 units/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), LPL (3 units/ml) alone or in combination with IFN-γ or TNF-α. The cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity in Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold System). The luciferase activity was normalized and expressed as -fold induction relative to the controls. The experiment was repeated three times, and typical data are shown. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t test. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Attenuation of TNF-α-induced Inflammatory Gene Expression by LPL—To examine the role of LPL on cytokine-induced inflammatory gene expression, HAECs were treated with TNF-α alone or in combination with LPL for 4 h and compared with untreated cells. The effect of LPL on TNF-α-induced gene activation was measured by quantitative real-time PCR analysis for ICAM-1, fractalkine, IL-8, and MCP-1. TNF-α treatment significantly increased ICAM-1, fractalkine, IL-8, and MCP-1 compared with untreated cells. Combined treatment with LPL and TNF-α significantly reduced ICAM-1, fractalkine, IL-8 and MCP-1 transcript levels relative to TNF-α-treated HAECs (Fig. 1). No significant changes were observed in cells exposed LPL alone. We also investigated the effect of LPL pre-treatment on TNF-α-induced gene expression. We pretreated HAECs with LPL (3 units/ml) for 2 h. LPL was removed from the media by washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then HAECS were incubated with TNF-α. We did not observe a significant suppression of TNF-α-mediated gene expression in HAECs pre-treated with LPL (data not shown). Effect of LPL Concentration and Serum on TNF-α-induced Gene Expression—To assess whether the modulatory effect of LPL on TNF-α-induced gene expression is dose-dependant, HAECs were co-incubated over a range of concentrations of LPL with TNF-α. LPL-mediated suppression of MCP-1 and ICAM-1 was dose-dependent (Fig. 2, A and B). To determine whether LPL activity was dependent on the presence of serum in the medium, we grew the HAECs in serum-free media for 12 h and then they were treated with either TNF-α alone or in combination with LPL. Real-time analysis showed that LPL attenuated TNF-α-mediated gene induction in serum-free medium (Fig. 2, C and D). These data suggest that LPL effect is not due to its interaction with serum. Effect of LPL on Cell Surface Adhesion Molecule Expression—To elucidate further the role of LPL in the acute inflammatory response induced by TNF-α in HAECs, we measured cell surface expression of E-selectin and VCAM-1 by flow cytometry. We observed attenuation of E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression in cells treated with TNF-α plus LPL, in contrast to treatment with TNF-α alone (Fig. 3). THL Co-treatment or Heparinase I Pre-treatment Reverses LPL Effect on TNF-α-mediated Gene Expression—We further tested whether LPL enzymatic activity is required for the inhibition of TNF-α-induced gene expression by co-incubating LPL with tetrahydrolipstatin, which is known to inhibit LPL catalytic activity by binding to the active site of the enzyme (24Lookene A. Skottova N. Olivecrona G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 25Yin B. Loike J.D. Kako Y. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Silverstein S.C. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Co-treatment of THL with LPL reversed LPL-mediated inhibition of TNF-α-induced gene expression (Fig. 4, A-C). These results indicate that the enzymatic activity of LPL is required for the modulation of TNF-α-induced gene expression. We have also tested the role of receptor-associated protein, which is known to bind to low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and low-density receptor-related protein and modulates lipoprotein catabolism (26Medh J.D. Fry G.L. Bowen S.L. Pladet M.W. Strickland D.K. Chappell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 536-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Treatment with 10 μm of receptor-associated protein did not alter TNF-α-induced gene expression or reverse the LPL-inhibitory effect on TNF-α-induced gene expression (data not shown). The function of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in the binding and internalization of LPL has been shown in various cell types and to assess the role of HSPGs in LPL modulation, we pre-treated HAECs with heparinase I and then incubated with either TNF-α alone or TNF-α plus LPL. Heparinase I pre-treatment resulted in the loss of the LPL inhibitory effect on TNF-α-induced gene expression (Fig. 4, A-C). Heparinase I treatment did not effect TNF-α-mediated gene expression, indicating that the disruption of HSPGs did not interfere with TNF-α ligand-receptor interactions. Based on these results, we conclude that the LPL modulatory effects are mediated by LPL catalytic activity as well as its interaction with HSPGs on HAECs. To further gain insight into the source of the substrate for lipolysis, we incubated TNF-α plus varying amounts of VLDL and sub-optimal LPL in HAECs. Total VLDL (5 μg/ml) in combination with suboptimal LPL dose (0.75-1.5 units/ml) synergistically suppressed TNF-α induction of ICAM-1 gene expression. However, this suppression was abrogated at higher concentration of VLDL (50 μg/ml) in combination with LPL (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with MCP-1 and IL-8 gene expression (data not shown). These results indicate that VLDL levels can modulate LPL effect on TNF-α-induced inflammatory gene expression. Effect of LPL on NF-κB Activation—TNF-α induction of chemokine and cell adhesion molecules is mediated by activation of NF-κB transcription factor. To test the effect of LPL on TNF-α-mediated NF-κB transactivation, a plasmid containing NF-κB luciferase reporter gene was transfected into HAECs. Transfected cells stimulated with TNF-α increased reporter activity compared with untreated cells. Treatment with LPL and TNF-α resulted in significantly reduced NF-κB dependent reporter activity (Fig. 6A). These data indicate that LPL attenuation of TNF-α-induced inflammatory gene expression is mediated by NF-κB. To further confirm these results, we used EMSA to study the effect of TNF-α and LPL on activation of NF-κB. Analysis of nuclear extracts of TNF-α-treated HAECs showed p50/p50 and p50/p65 complexes, whereas TNF-α- and LPL-treated cells showed abrogation of p50/p65 without any effect on p50/50 complexes (Fig. 6B). The specificity of the p50/p50 homodimer was confirmed by the supershift with the p50 antibody in the DNA binding assay. Western analysis indicated that TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 and that LPL abrogated TNF-α-induced p65 phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that LPL suppresses the TNF-α-induced transactivation function of p65. LPL Inhibits the Rapid Degradation of IκB-α Induced by TNF-α—To test the effect of LPL on TNF-α-mediated degradation of IκB-α in HAECs, cytoplasmic protein fractions were analyzed for the expression of IκB-α by Western analysis. Following endothelial cell stimulation with TNF-α, degradation of IκB-α was detected within 20 min and restored to control levels in 1 h due to resynthesis (19Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In contrast, LPL plus TNF-α-treated cells showed abundant levels of IκB-α after 20 min of treatment (Fig. 6D). No significant changes in IκB-α protein levels were observed at 4 h of TNF-α or TNF-α plus LPL treatment (data not shown). LPL Enhances Interferon-γ-dependent Gene Activation—To study the effect of LPL on IFN-γ-induced gene activation, HAECs were incubated with IFN-γ as well as co-incubated with IFN-γ and LPL, and compared with untreated HAECs. The mRNA levels of guanylate-binding protein (GBP-1) and ICAM-1 in HAECs incubated with IFN-γ were significantly up-regulated, whereas cells co-incubated with IFN-γ and LPL had a synergistic increase in both mRNA (Fig. 7). Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (PI3K) pathway is known to suppress the IFN-γ-induced serine phosphorylation and transactivation of Stat1 without significantly affecting its DNA-binding activity (29Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of PI3K, HAECs were pretreated with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K for 30 min followed by stimulation with IFN-γ or IFN-γ plus LPL. Pre-treatment of cells with LY 294002 suppressed the activation of ICAM-1 and GBP-1 by IFN-γ, as well as the transcriptional synergy of IFN-γ and LPL (Fig. 7). These data implicate a role for PI3K activation in both IFN-γ-dependent gene expression as well as the synergistic activation of LPL plus IFN-γ. To further analyze the role of LPL in modulating the IFN-γ response, Stat1-luciferase reporter was transfected into HAECs. IFN-γ treatment induced luciferase activity in HAECs. LPL and IFN-γ synergistically induced Stat1-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 8A). EMSA analysis of nuclear fractions of cells treated with IFN-γ plus LPL showed an increased Stat1 DNA-binding activity compared with IFN-γ alone (Fig. 8B). These results show that LPL synergizes with IFN-γ in activating Stat1-mediated gene transcription through enhancing its DNA-binding activity. Full activation of Stat1 by IFN-γ is achieved by two distinct phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation of Stat1 on Tyr-701 is required for Stat1 homodimer formation and binding to γ-activated sequence elements (27Bach E.A. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

Neurofibrillary tangles are bundles of paired helical filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is one of the tau protein kinases that increase paired helical filament epitopes in tau by phosphorylation. Recently, various mutations of tau have been identified in frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). Here, we investigated the phosphorylation of FTDP-17 mutant tau proteins, K257T, P301L, P301S, and R406W, by Cdk5 complexed with p35, p25, or p39 in vitro and in cultured cells. The extent of phosphorylation by all Cdk5 species was slightly lower in mutant tau than in wild-type tau. Major phosphorylation sites, including Ser202, Ser235, and Ser404, were the same among the wild-type, K257T, P301L, and P301S tau proteins phosphorylated by any Cdk5. On the other hand, R406W tau was less phosphorylated at Ser404 than were the other variants. This was not due to the simple replacement of amino acid Arg406 with Trp close to the phosphorylation site, because Ser404 in a R406W peptide was equally phosphorylated in a wild-type peptide. The decreased phosphorylation of mutant tau by Cdk5s was canceled when tau protein bound to microtubules was phosphorylated. These results indicate that FTDP-17 mutations do not affect the phosphorylatability of tau by Cdk5 complexed with p35, p25, or p39 and may explain part of the discrepancy reported previously between in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation of FTDP-17 tau mutants.

Neurofibrillary tangles are bundles of paired helical filament composed of the microtubule (MT)-associated protein tau in a hyperphosphorylated state (1Goedert M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Stoothoff W.H. Johnson G.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 280-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Intracellular inclusions made of tau are also found in several other neurodegenerative diseases, including Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), collectively called tauopathies (3Lee V.M.

Exonic and intronic mutations in the tau gene have recently been identified in familial FTDP-17 (5Hutton M. Lendon C.L. Rizzu P. Baker M. Froelich S.

A. 1998; 95: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar), indicating that dys-function of the tau protein can cause the above mentioned neurodegenerative diseases. Many of the exonic mutations reduce the ability of tau to promote MT assembly (8Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 9Hong M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11714-11721Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), but why these mutations cause the formation of tau inclusions is unknown. The tau protein in inclusions is hyperphosphorylated. Around 25 phosphorylation sites have been identified in paired helical filament tau from AD brains (11Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 12Hanger D.P. Betts J.C. Loviny T.L. Blackstock W.P.

Characteristic phosphorylation sites are Ser or Thr residues followed by Pro that are phosphorylated by the proline-directed protein kinase activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). Phosphorylation reduces the ability of tau to bind to and polymerize MTs, resulting in an increase in the soluble form of tau dissociated from MTs. However, it is unclear how phosphorylated soluble tau assembles into filamentous aggregates of neurofibrillary tangles and then induces neurodegeneration. Elucidating the relationship between tau phosphorylation and aggregate formation is critical to our understanding of the pathogenesis. Phosphorylation of FTDP-17 mutant tau has been studied mainly with GSK3β or in non-neuronal cultured cells (14Pérez M. Lim F. Arrasate M. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2583-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Mack T.G. Dayanandan R. Van Slegtenhorst M. Whone A. Hutton M. Lovestone S. Anderton B.H.

Mutant tau proteins were not phosphorylated more than wild-type (WT) tau either in transfected cultured cells or in vitro. Among them, R406W mutant tau showed significantly reduced phosphorylation in those experiments. However, both mutant tau and wild-type tau deposited in FTDP-17 brains are also hyperphosphorylated (18Reed L.A. Grabowski T.J. Schmidt M.L. Morris J.C. Goate A. Solodkin A. Van Hoesen G.W.

It is important to resolve the discrepancy between the reduced phosphorylation of mutant tau in vitro and in cultured neurons and the high phosphorylation of mutant tau in pathological brains. Cdk5 is a proline-directed Ser/Thr kinase activated by a p35 or p39 Cdk5 activator (20Tang D Wang J.H. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1996; 2: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Dhavan R Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 22Hisanaga S. Saito T. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cdk5 activity is primarily detected in differentiated neurons because p35 and p39 show limited expression in neurons. As described above, Cdk5 is one of the tau protein kinases that phosphorylate tau in living neurons and is also able to generate several paired helical filament epitopes of tau in AD (23Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation of FTDP-17 mutant tau by Cdk5 has not yet been examined. This question should be addressed because the involvement of Cdk5 in the pathogenic phosphorylation of tau has recently become more evident (25Noble W. Olm V. Takata K. Casey E. Mary O. Meyerson J. Gaynor K. LaFrancois J. Wang L. Kondo T. Davies P. Burns M. Veeranna Nixon R. Dickson D. Matsuoka Y. Ahlijanian M. Lau L.F. Duff K.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In particular, it is important to investigate the phosphorylation of tau by Cdk5 bound to p25 or p39. p25, the N-terminal-truncated form of p35 generated by cleavage with calpain, a calcium-activated cysteine protease, accumulates in AD brains (27Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) and neurons undergoing cell death (28Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M.

Commun. 2000; 274: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is also thought to induce the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Although the generation of p25 in human brains is still controversial because of possible obfuscation by postmortem delay (31Taniguchi S. Fujita Y. Hayashi S. Kakita A. Takahashi H. Murayama S.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), p25 is also generated in the brains of mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Niemann-Pick disease type C (34Nguyen M.D. Lariviere R.C. Julien J.P. Neuron. 2001; 30: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 35Bu B. Li J. Davies P. Vincent I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6515-6525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing p25 or p25 with P301L FTDP-17 mutant tau have recently been reported to display enhanced phosphorylation and the formation of tau tangles (25Noble W. Olm V. Takata K. Casey E. Mary O. Meyerson J. Gaynor K. LaFrancois J. Wang L. Kondo T. Davies P. Burns M. Veeranna Nixon R. Dickson D. Matsuoka Y. Ahlijanian M. Lau L.F. Duff K.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Although p25-Cdk5 has a higher kinase activity for tau than p35-Cdk5 in vitro (36Hashiguchi M. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Hashiguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44525-44530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), its phosphorylation of FTDP-17 mutant tau proteins has not been investigated. On the other hand, it was recently shown that Cdk5 bound to p39 phosphorylates tau in vivo in p35–/– mice (37Takahashi S. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Pant H.C. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10506-10515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This suggests that p39-Cdk5 is the major Cdk5 that phosphorylates tau in the brain and may also contribute to the pathological phosphorylation observed in neuro-degenerative diseases. However, the phosphorylation of tau by p39-Cdk5 has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we examined the phosphorylation of K257T, P301L, P301S, and R406W mutant tau by Cdk5 complexed with p35, p25, or p39. There was no difference in tau phosphorylation among the Cdk5s used. P301L, P301S, and R406W mutant proteins were less phosphorylated than was WT tau, but the phosphorylation sites were not altered by the mutations except in R406W. Binding to MTs increased the extent but not the sites of phosphorylation in mutant tau more than in WT tau, indicating that the association with MTs cancels the effects of the FTDP-17 mutation in reducing phosphorylation. These results may explain part of the previously described discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation. Chemicals and Antibodies—Roscovitine, an inhibitor of Cdk5, was purchased from Calbiochem. Synthetic peptides were obtained from Qiagen (Hercules, CA). The anti-tau antibody, tau-C, has been described previously (38Ishiguro K. Sato K. Takamatsu M. Park J. Uchida T. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 202: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All of the other reagents were of analytical grade. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human tau—The pRK172 bacterial expression vector containing recombinant human wild-type and FTDP-17 mutant tau cDNAs (encoding a tau protein with one N-terminal insert and four repeat domains (1N4R), WT, K257T, P301L, P301S, or R406W) was used to transform competent Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells (8Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). tau protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cells collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C were lysed in MOPS buffer (10 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm Pefabloc SC) by sonication. The supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C was adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was dialyzed against MOPS buffer overnight at 4 °C. The tau proteins were purified with a Mono S FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) used after dialysis against MOPS buffer. The amount of tau protein was estimated by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of gels using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In Vitro Mutagenesis—Wild-type human tau cDNA in the pRK172 vector served as the template for site-directed mutagenesis. T181A and S404A mutations were generated by PCR using complementary primers containing the mutation. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Tubulin and Microtubule Polymerization—Tubulin was prepared from porcine brains by three cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization/depolymerization. Tubulin was separated from MT-associated proteins using a phosphocellulose column (Whatman P-11, Brentford, UK). tau (0.1 mg/ml) was bound to MTs, which were polymerized from 1 mg/ml tubulin with 20 μm Taxol in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.8) and 1 mm MgCl2 by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Insect Cell Culture, Expression of Cdk5s, and Their Purification—Sf9 cells were maintained in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus encoding p35his-Cdk5, p25his-Cdk5, or p39his-Cdk5. We expressed Cdk5 activators tagged with a histidine hexamer at the C terminus (p35his, p25his, and p39his) for purification in this study; they are however described as p35, p25, and p39 in the text. Sf9 cells were collected at 48 h after infection. p35his-Cdk5 and p25his-Cdk5 were purified from Sf9 extracts with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described previously (39Saito T. Onuki R. Fujita Y. Kusakawa G. Ishiguro K. Bibb J.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as was p39his-Cdk5 with some modifications. 2M. Yamada, T. Saito, Y. Sato, A. Sekigawa, Y. Hamazumi, A. Asada, and S. Hisanaga, manuscript in preparation. In Vitro Phosphorylation—The tau protein (0.1 mg/ml) was phosphorylated by 1 μg/ml Cdk5 complexed with each activator in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 35 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 4× Laemmli sample buffer, and the sample was then boiled. Synthetic peptides (50 μg/ml) of wild-type (396SPVVSGDTSPRHLS409), R406W (396SPVVSGDTSPWHLS409), and S404A (396SPVVSGDTAPRHLS409) tau proteins were phosphorylated by p35-Cdk5 at 35 °C. Phosphorylation of the peptides was detected with a BAS 2000 Bioimage analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) after Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (40Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tau bound to MTs was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg/ml Cdk5 to a prewarmed mixture of tau and MTs in the presence of 20 μm Taxol. The reaction was stopped by boiling in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. Boiled samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the heat-stable supernatants were collected. After SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gel, the extent of tau phosphorylation was quantified by Cerenkov counting using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). Cell Culture and Metabolic Phosphorylation of tau—Cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day-17 rat brains and labeled 11 days after plating with [32P]orthophosphate, as described previously (39Saito T. Onuki R. Fujita Y. Kusakawa G. Ishiguro K. Bibb J.A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were transfected with cDNAs for tau, Cdk5, and each Cdk5 activator using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were labeled by incubation for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation of tau—32P-Labeled cell lysate was boiled in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl. The boiled samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the heat-stable supernatant was collected. Polyclonal tau-C antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the addition of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), the mixture was incubated further at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF), and the tau proteins bound to protein A beads were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Map Analysis—The tau proteins phosphorylated by Cdk5s were digested with trypsin (Sigma) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.4) at 30 °C. The digested peptides were subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide map analysis using a thin-layer cellulose plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as described previously (41Wada Y. Ishiguro K. Itoh T.J. Uchida T. Hotani H. Saito T. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). WT and Mutant tau Proteins and Cdk5s—Fig. 1A shows CBB staining of tau proteins (WT, K257T, P301L, P301S, and R406W) on 10% SDS-PAGE. Each tau protein was purified as a single band. The CBB staining of Cdk5 and its activators, p35, p25, and p39, purified from Sf9 cell is shown in Fig. 1B. Cdk5 and each activator were isolated as major bands in these fractions. The specific activities of these Cdk5 fractions for WT tau protein were determined to be 10.6, 15.5, and 0.38 nmol/min/mg protein with p35-Cdk5, p25-Cdk5, and p39-Cdk5, respectively. These values for Sf9 p35-Cdk5 and p25-Cdk5 are similar to the value of 22.00 nmol/min/mg protein for tau phosphorylated with p25-Cdk5 purified from bovine brains (24Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the only available datum to our knowledge. p39-Cdk5 showed a lower kinase activity because the formation of this complex is more labile. 2M. Yamada, T. Saito, Y. Sato, A. Sekigawa, Y. Hamazumi, A. Asada, and S. Hisanaga, manuscript in preparation. Cdk5 Is the Major Kinase Phosphorylating tau in Cultured Rat Cortical Neurons—tau is phosphorylated by many protein kinases in vivo and in vitro (2Stoothoff W.H. Johnson G.V. Biochim. Biophys.

To determine the extent to which Cdk5 contributes to tau phosphorylation in neurons, we used two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping to compare the phosphorylation of tau labeled metabolically in cultured rat brain cortical neurons (Fig. 2B) with that of tau phosphorylated by p35-Cdk5 in vitro (Fig. 2A). The major spots, spots 1–5 but not spot 6, that were detected in cultured neurons comigrated with in vitro phosphorylation spots produced by p35-Cdk5 (Fig. 2C). Our in vitro phosphopeptide map pattern was almost identical to the map patterns of previous reports for Cdk5 (41Wada Y. Ishiguro K. Itoh T.J. Uchida T. Hotani H. Saito T. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J.

These results indicate that Cdk5 is a major tau kinase in rat brain cortical neurons. On the basis of previous reports (41Wada Y. Ishiguro K. Itoh T.J. Uchida T. Hotani H. Saito T. Kishimoto T.

There were two unidentified, discrete spots in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps, spot 5 in in vitro phosphorylated tau (Fig. 2A) and spot 6 in metabolically labeled tau (Fig. 2B). We used site-directed mutagenesis to determine their phosphorylation sites. Because spot 6 was also weakly detected in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of in vitro phosphorylation (longer exposure around spot 6) (Fig. 2A, inset), we examined the phosphorylation sites reported for Cdk5. The two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of Ala mutants at Thr181 (T181A) and Ser404 (S404A) are shown in Fig. 2, D and E, respectively. Spot 5 disappeared in the two-dimensional phosphopeptide map of S404A tau (Fig. 2E), and spot 6 was lost in the map of T181A (Fig. 2D, inset). These results indicate that spot 6 is the peptide containing phosphorylated Thr181 and spot 5 is the peptide containing phosphorylated Ser404, which might be cleaved differently from the peptide of spot 3. Mutant tau Is Less Phosphorylated by Cdk5s than Is WT tau in Vitro—We phosphorylated WT and FTDP-17 mutant tau (0.1 mg/ml) by p35-Cdk5, p25-Cdk5, or p39-Cdk5 at 35 °C and measured the initial rate of phosphorylation after a 5-min incubation and the plateau level of phosphorylation after a 2-h incubation. The initial rates of phosphorylation are compared in Fig. 3. As was reported previously (36Hashiguchi M. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Hashiguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44525-44530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), p25-Cdk5 showed stronger kinase activity for tau than did p35-Cdk5. p39-Cdk5 displayed tau phosphorylation activity similar to that of p35-Cdk5 when the kinase activity was normalized to histone H1 phosphorylation,2 although the specific activity was low. Here, we focused on comparing the phosphorylation between WT and mutant tau. The phosphorylation of mutant tau is expressed as a ratio relative to that of WT tau (Fig. 3, mean ± S.E., n = 3). Although K257T showed a phosphorylation level similar to that of WT tau, other mutant tau proteins were less phosphorylated by all of the complexes of Cdk5 and its activators. The extent of phosphorylation of P301L, P301S, and R406W was also reduced after incubation for 2 h, at which time phosphorylation had almost reached plateau levels (data not shown). Cdk5 Phosphorylation Sites in Mutant tau—The sites at which tau is phosphorylated by Cdk5 were examined by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. tau was phosphorylated by each Cdk5 complex for 5 min at 35 °C and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. We applied the same amount of radioactivity to the two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps to compare the relative phosphorylation intensity of each spot. Four major phosphorylation spots were detected, and the phosphorylation patterns were identical for WT, K257T, P301L, and P301S, indicating that K257T, P301L, and P301S mutations do not change the Cdk5 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4). Furthermore, no difference was observed among tau proteins phosphorylated by p35-Cdk5, p25-Cdk5, or p39-Cdk5. One additional spot was observed in each tau variant phosphorylated by p39-Cdk5 (Fig. 4, white arrow in bottom panels), but this spot was not the result of p39-Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation because the phosphorylation of this spot varied depending on the preparation of p39-Cdk5 and was not reduced in the presence of the Cdk5 inhibitor, roscovitine, in the reaction mixture. The spot may have been phosphorylated by another kinase contaminating the p39-Cdk5 fraction. p39-Cdk5 is an unstable complex compared with p35-Cdk5 and p25-Cdk5. To purify the active p39-Cdk5 complex, we needed to use a purification procedure milder than that used for p35-Cdk5 or p25-Cdk5.2 Except for this spot, other spots were the same as those phosphorylated by p35-Cdk5 or p25-Cdk5, indicating that p39-Cdk5 has the same substrate preference for tau as do p35-Cdk5 and p25-Cdk5. Because mutant tau proteins were less phosphorylated than WT tau even though the phosphorylation sites were the same, each site might be equally less phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of R406W tau by Cdk5s—Two phosphopeptide spots containing Ser404, spots 3 and 5, were missing in R406W tau phosphorylated by p35-Cdk5, p25-Cdk5, or p39-Cdk5 (Fig. 4, R406W). The R406W mutation changes the tryptic peptide pattern by eliminating the cleavage site just C-terminal of the mutation site, which could result in a different migration of the peptide on two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. To determine whether the mutant peptide moved in the other direction in the first dimension of electrophoresis, we changed the spotting origin, but we did not detect a new spot. It is also possible that the longer peptide that was generated by the elimination of the cleavage site might remain in the acrylamide gel even after trypsin digestion. However, there was no difference between R406W tau and other tau proteins in the radioactivity remai"

In particular, the conservative mutation E67Q dramatically reduces phosphotransfer to P1 without significantly affecting the affinity of P1 for the CheA ATP-binding domain. High resolution crystallographic studies revealed that although all mutants disrupt the hydrogen-bonding network to varying degrees, none affect the conformation of His-45. 15N-NMR chemical shift studies instead showed that Glu-67 functions to stabilize the unfavored Nδ1H tautomer of His-45, thereby rendering the Nϵ2 imidazole unprotonated and well positioned for accepting the ATP phosphoryl group.

Histidine phosphorylation is a key feature of bacterial signaling. Histidine kinases transduce information from the extracellular environment to regulate many cellular processes including gene expression, membrane permeability, energy production, and motility (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 2Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev.

Mammals do not contain histidine kinases homologous to those found in prokaryotes. Thus, these enzymes are attractive targets for the development of new antibiotics, and thus, their catalytic mechanisms hold great interest. The dimeric histidine kinase CheA initiates the phosphorylation cascade that regulates the directed movement of bacteria toward and away from chemical stimulants. All necessary elements for histidine phosphorylation are found in the phosphotransfer (P1) and kinase (P4) domains of the five-domain CheA protein (4Bilwes A.M. Quezada C.M. Croal L.R. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Conserved residues in the P4 domain bind ATP in a pocket that optimally positions the γ-phosphoryl for transfer to a specific histidine on the N-terminal P1 domain (4Bilwes A.M. Quezada C.M. Croal L.R. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5Hirschman A. Boukhvalova M. VanBruggen R. Wolfe A.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13876-13887Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although P1 residues other than the active histidine have been shown to impact phospho-transferase activity, their chemical functions have not been assigned (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D.

The structure of CheA domain P4 revealed no similarity to eukaryotic Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases but significant resemblance to ATPases from the functionally divergent GHL 1The abbreviations used are: GHL, GyrB, Hsp90, MutL; PEG, polyethylene glycol; AmAc, ammonium acetate; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. family (for GyrB, Hsp90, MutL) (4Bilwes A.M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Instead of using ATP as a phosphodonor to histidine, the GHL ATPases effectively transfer the ATP γ-phosphoryl group to a water molecule. CheA and the GHL family of ATPases share similar topologies, a deep cavity for ATP binding, and four regions of sequence conservation surrounding the ATP-binding site: the N, G1, F, and G2 boxes (4Bilwes A.M. Quezada C.M. Croal L.R. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Bilwes A. Alex L. Crane B. Simon M. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Despite the similarities, there are also interesting differences in residue composition between histidine kinases and ATPases that likely delineate their divergent functions. CheA does not contain an analog of an essential glutamate in the GHL ATPases (7Bilwes A. Alex L. Crane B. Simon M. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), presumed to be the general base involved in water activation for ATP hydrolysis (8Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the CheA phosphotransfer domain (P1) contains a conserved glutamate adjacent to the phospho-accepting histidine (Glu-67 in T. maritima and Glu-70 in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) (9Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In S. typhimurium, mutation of Glu-70 to Ala abolishes CheA activity (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D.

Thus, this glutamate may tune the reactivity of the phospho-accepting histidine in a manner similar to the water-activating glutamate of the GHL-ATPases (7Bilwes A. Alex L. Crane B. Simon M. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The properties of the CheA phospho-accepting histidine (residue 48 in E. coli or 45 in T. maritima) deviate from those of typical solvent-exposed histidines. NMR spectroscopy showed His-48 to have a higher than normal pKa of 7.8 (9Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a hydrogen bond to His-48 Nδ1H locks the imidazole ring in the Nδ1H unfavored tautomeric form, even at pH values above its pKa (9Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the phosphotransfer domain, P1, implicated a glutamate residue (67 and 70 in T. maritima and S. typhimurium, respectively) as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the phospho-accepting histidine (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D. Tolstykh T. Faurie C. Guillet V. Stock J.B. Samama J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31074-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Quezada C.M. Gradinaru C. Simon M.I. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A group of conserved residues (Glu-67, Lys-48, and His-64 in T. maritima) also forms a hydrogen bond network with His-45 that could modulate its reactivity (10Quezada C.M. Gradinaru C. Simon M.I. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Herein, we present biochemical studies of mutants of the T. maritima CheA P1 domain that disrupt hydrogen-bonding networks surrounding the phospho-accepting histidine. Biochemistry, crystallography, and NMR spectroscopy were combined to define how local hydrogen bonds activate the CheA histidine for phosphotransfer. Protein Cloning, Expression, and Purification—T. maritima full-length CheA, Δ289 (domains P3, P4, and P5, residues 290-671), domain P1 and its mutants (residues 4-133), and the truncated P1 variants P1E67Qshort, P1K48Ashort, and P1H64Ashort (residues 4-104) were subcloned in the vector pET28(a) (Novagen), transformed, and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Full-length P1 domain constructs were used in all biochemical assays. P1 short constructs were utilized for crystallization trials. Crystals were obtained only by removing the region corresponding to the fifth helix (residues 105-133) in S. typhimurium P1. Protein purification was achieved by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) and gel filtration as described previously (7Bilwes A. Alex L. Crane B. Simon M. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Phosphorylation Assays—Initial velocities of full-length CheA and its mutants CheA E67Q, CheA K48A, CheA H64A (2-10 μm), or P1 (30 μm) incubated with CheA Δ289 (2 μm) were measured in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at 50 °C. The initial velocities of full-length CheA and CheA H64A were also compared with one another at room temperature in the same buffer at pH 7.5. Reactions were initiated upon the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. At specific time intervals, aliquots were quenched with 2% SDS electrophoresis buffer containing 25 mm EDTA. Samples were then electrophoresed on 12-18% Criterion Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) using a Criterion Dodeca cell (Bio-Rad). Gels were dried under vacuum and phosphorylation-quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The pH dependence studies were performed in the same manner over a pH range of 6.5-9.6. The same protocol was used when P1 (30 μm) was incubated with Δ289 (2 μm) in the presence of a 10-fold excess of P1 mutant (300 μm) or the control bovine serum albumin (300 μm). Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Orthorhombic crystals belonging to the P2221 space group were obtained by mixing 2 μl of 7-15 mg/ml protein with 2 μl of the reservoir solution (14% PEG 2000, 0.1 m NaAc, pH 4.5, 0.2 m AmAc for P1E67Qshort; 32% PEG 4000, 0.1 m NaAc, pH 4.5, 0.2 m AmAc for P1K48Ashort; 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 m NaAc, pH 4.5, 0.2 m AmAc for P1H64Ashort). Crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (36% PEG 8000, 0.1 m NaAc, pH 4.5, and 0.2 m AmAc) and then flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) on beamline A1 (λ = 0.9363 Å) to 1.1, 1.4, and 1.25 Å resolution for P1E67Qshort, P1H64Ashort, and P1K48Ashort, respectively. Data were processed, scaled, and reduced using the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite of programs (11Otwinowski A. Minor W.

Biol. 2004; 341: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and as such, this model (Protein Data Bank code: 1TQG) served as a starting point for refinement. Based on model phases, the “warpNtrace” feature of ARP/wARP v 5.0 (12Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar) was used to automatically build the initial protein model of E67Q (one molecule per asymmetric unit in all cases). For E67Q and the other mutants, iterative cycles of refinement using the program SHELXL (13Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) and manual rebuilding of the model in XtalView (14McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Crossref Google Scholar) were used to generate protein models (see Table I). As previously observed in the wild-type structure of P1 (10Quezada C.M. Gradinaru C. Simon M.I. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), several discrete residues (14, 16, 39, 51, 54, and 55) exist in alternate conformations. Extended regions of helices A and D (residues 21-32 and 82-105) also display alternate conformations. Atomic resolution refinement of the E67Q structure (1.1 Å resolution) including the addition of riding hydrogen atoms and anisotropic individual thermal factors was carried out with SHELX (13Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar), as described for the wild-type P1 structure (10Quezada C.M. Gradinaru C. Simon M.I. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on a 600-MHz Inova spectrometer equipped with 1H [13C/15N] pulsed-field gradient probes. NMR samples contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.05% sodium azide, and 10% D2O. All experiments were recorded at 50 °C. Assignments for all non-proline backbone amides of wild-type P1 were obtained from D. J. Hamel and F. W. Dahlquist. For this work, three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC and two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC correlation experiments were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled proteins (15Zhang O.W. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Formankay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). For amide (imidazole) HSQC spectra, the 15N carrier frequency was set to ∼121 (190) ppm, using a delay of 4.8 (50) ms to refocus chemical shift evolution arising from the coupling between the backbone amide proton and nitrogen (carbon-bound proton and imidazole nitrogen). In all correlation experiments, 100 (128) complex t1 increments were recorded. Spectral widths were 1600 (4800) Hz in F1 and 8000 Hz in F2. The number of scans in individual two-dimensional experiments ranged from 4 to 128 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio. Quadrature detection in the 15N dimension used the States-TPPI (time-proportional phase incrementation) method (16Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). Three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectra were recorded for each mutant and used to verify backbone amide resonance assignments. These spectra had the same parameters listed above with 64 complex t2 increments, spectral width of 8000 Hz in F3, and a 150-ms mixing time. In the pH titration experiments, a series of spectra were recorded for each protein, ranging from approximately pH 4 to 10. The pH was adjusted with small amounts of HCl or NaOH. HSQC experiments centered at 121 ppm in nitrogen were used to measure chemical shift changes with pH of the amides. HSQC experiments centered at 190 ppm were used to measure pH-dependent chemical shift changes of the histidine rings. All data were processed using the FELIX software package from MSI. The pKa values of the imidazole rings and the fraction of each histidine tautomer were calculated as described previously (9Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Hydrogen-bonding Network Surrounding His-45 Optimizes Phosphotransfer—Mutations of Glu-67 to Gln, Asp, and Ala were used to probe whether the hydrogen-bonding ability or negative charge of Glu were critical for phosphorylation of P1 by the kinase domain. The phosphorylation level of wild-type protein was compared with that of mutant protein following a 30-min incubation with [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. Mutations were made both in full-length CheA and in the isolated phosphotransfer domain, P1. CheA containing the mutations E67Q, E67D, and E67A showed dramatically reduced autophosphorylation activity (5.7, 8.4, and 2.4%, respectively). The same mutants in separate P1 domains produced even larger reductions in phosphotransfer activity (∼ 1% of wild type) when assayed with a protein containing CheA domains P3, P4, and P5 (CheAΔ289). Although the E67A mutation in S. typhimurium has been shown to reduce the ATP phosphotransfer rate (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D. Tolstykh T. Faurie C. Guillet V. Stock J.B. Samama J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31074-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), these experiments did not distinguish whether the decrease in activity was due to the disruption of secondary structure, the loss of binding between the P1 and the kinase domain, or a catalytic defect. In 10-fold excess, P1E67Q reduces phosphate transfer from wild-type Δ289 to wild-type P1 by more than 70%. The addition of control proteins, such as bovine serum albumin, reduced activity by less than 10%. Assuming a competitive mechanism and taking a measured Km value for wild-type P1 of 100-250 μm (10Quezada C.M. Gradinaru C. Simon M.I. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this level of inhibition under presaturation conditions indicates that E67Q interacts with a Km value within a factor of 2 when compared with wild type. This minimal defect in Km value cannot account for the low phosphotransfer activities of the conservative mutations E67Q and E67D. Thus, these results suggested that there are stringent requirements on the length, charge, and hydrogen-bond accepting capability of residue 67. The phosphorylation of P1 by Δ289 has a pH dependence that suggested the phospho-accepting histidine has an elevated pKa when compared with that of an average solvent-exposed histidine (data not shown). Indeed, the pH dependence of P1 phosphorylation at 50 °C correlates with the fraction of deprotonated histidine present only if the histidine pKa is increased to 6.9 from 5.9, the estimated pKa value of a solvent-exposed histidine at 50 °C (9Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At pH 6.5, wild-type P1 became phosphorylated to only ∼20% of the maximum level observed at pH 8.5. In contrast, the phosphotransfer reactions of the three Glu-67 mutants reflected a more typical pKa for His-45 in that they are pH-independent above pH 6.0 (data not shown). The conserved hydrogen-bonding network involving His-45 was disrupted by the mutations K48A and H64A. The activity of CheA H64A was ∼15-fold greater than K48A and roughly 270-fold greater than E67Q at 50 °C, pH 8.5. The activity of wild-type CheA was too rapid to be measured under these conditions. At pH 7.5 and room temperature, the initial velocity of wild-type CheA was ∼60-fold greater than CheA H64A. A 10-fold excess of K48A reduced the phosphotransfer to wild-type P1 by 44%, indicating that this mutant still competes for the CheA kinase domain but with weaker affinity when compared with wild type or E67Q. Diminished phosphorylated P1 (P1-P) in our assays could reflect a reduction in phosphorylation by the kinase or a decrease in P1-P stability. However, mutations at Lys-48, His-64, or Glu-67 do not affect phosphoramidate bond stability (data not shown), and neither P1K48A nor P1E67Q affects the phosphotransfer activity to the response regulator CheY (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D. Tolstykh T. Faurie C. Guillet V. Stock J.B. Samama J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31074-31082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, there appeared to be no direct effect of the Lys-His-Glu triad on phospho-histidine stability. High Resolution Structures of P1 Mutants Reveal a Disrupted Hydrogen-bonding Network—To structurally characterize the mutants P1E67Q, P1K48A, and P1H64A, we have determined the crystal structures of their truncated forms, termed short (residues 4-104) to high resolution (for details, see Table I and “Experimental Procedures”). All mutants retain the overall four-helix bundle fold of wild-type P1 (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D. Tolstykh T. Faurie C. Guillet V. Stock J.B. Samama J.-P. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of P1E67Qshort (helices A-D) was determined to atomic (1.1 Å) resolution (Table I). The Gln-67 side-chain amide rotates around χ3-30° from the position held by the Glu-67 carboxylate in wild-type P1. This movement disrupts the conserved hydrogen-bonding network involving His-45, Glu-67, Lys-48, and His-64 (Fig. 1). The Nδ1 atom of the phospho-accepting His-45 still hydrogen-bonds to the Gln-67 carbonyl oxygen (2.82 Å), but the His imidazole ring is not co-planar with the glutamine amide, unlike its alignment with the Glu-67 carboxylate in wild-type P1 (Fig. 1B). The altered position of the Gln-67 amide allowed the amide nitrogen to hydrogen-bond with two water molecules (2.83 and 3.15 Å). Note that both His-45 imidazole nitrogens should be protonated at the conditions of crystallization (pH 4.5). Although Gln-67 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to Nδ1 of the phospho-accepting histidine under these conditions, the distorted geometry and longer hydrogen bond of this interaction indicated that it has weakened relative to the wild type. Discontinuous density surrounding the phosphorylation site of the K48A mutant indicated that Lys removal destabilizes the positions of Glu-67 and His-64. In particular, His-64 has two alternate conformations, neither of which hydrogen-bond to Glu-67 (Fig. 1, D and E). When compared with the native configuration, the two His-64 conformers swiveled about angle χ1 by -42 and 121° degrees, one conformer hydrogen bonding to a water molecule (2.4 Å) and the Ala-61 residue (3.0 Å), and the other hydrogen bonding to the neighboring residue Asn-68 (3.3 Å) and another water molecule (3.4 Å). In response, the Glu-67 carboxylate rotated but still hydrogen-bonded to the Nδ1 atom of His-45 (2.9 Å). Although removal of Lys-48 destabilized the conformations of Glu-67 and His-64, the position of His-45 was largely unaffected. The structural changes incurred by the H64A mutation are not as disruptive as those observed for K48A (Fig. 1C). Glu-67 remained hydrogen-bonded to the His-45 Nδ1 (2.5 Å) but had a slightly altered position Lys-48 is also displaced and hydrogen-bonds to a water molecule (2.5 Å) instead of forming a salt bridge with Glu-67. However, the orientation of His-45 remained largely unchanged. Because none of these mutations perturbed the conformation of His-45 nor drastically affected binding of Δ289, reduced phosphorylation activity does not likely derive from structural effects alone. Glu-67 Stabilizes the Reactive Protonation Tautomer of His-45—To evaluate how mutations of the residues involved in the hydrogen-bonding network affect the chemical properties of the phospho-accepting histidine, we expressed 15N-labeled P1E67Q, P1K48A, and P1H64A for NMR spectroscopy. In solution, histidine imidazole groups have three protonation states: a charged state and two neutral tautomers Nδ1H and Nϵ2H, which undergo fast exchange in solution (18Bachovchin W.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7751-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Schuster I.I. Roberts J.D. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 3864-3867Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Chemical shift values for histidine nitrogens report on hydrogen-bonding interactions, protonation, and tautomeric states. The P1 mutants contained two or three histidines: 1) His-45, the site of phosphorylation; 2) His-64, a participant in the hydrogen bond network; and 3) a residual N-terminal histidine introduced by the expression vector. Histidine deprotonation at each site was monitored as a function of pH using two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments (Fig. 2). The E67Q mutation of T. maritima P1 altered the tautomeric state of the phospho-accepting histidine and shifts the effective pKa of the imidazole. The pH titration of wild-type E. coli P1 showed that His-48 (T. maritima His-45) Nϵ2 deprotonates with an elevated pKa of 7.8 at 30 °C (9Zhou H. Dahlquist F.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and 6.9 at 50 °C. As expected, in E67Q, the His-45 imidazole pKa shifts down to a more typical value of 5.8 (Fig. 2a and Table II). Surprisingly, the Nδ1 of His-45 deprotonated instead of Nϵ2. At pH 3.97, the chemical shift values of Nδ1 and Nϵ2 (178.4 and 174.3 ppm, respectively) approached the expected value for a protonated imidazole nitrogen (176.5 ppm). At the high pH limit, Nδ1 shifts to 226.7 ppm, whereas Nϵ2 remains relatively constant at 184.5 ppm (Fig. 2a). The large change in the Nδ1 chemical shift (pKa = 5.8) indicates that the phospho-accepting histidine primarily exists in the Nϵ2H tautomeric state after deprotonation (Nδ1H:Nϵ2H tautomeric ratio = 1:3.3; Table II). The difference in charge between Glu and Gln is likely responsible for this effect on histidine reactivity. A negatively charged glutamate carboxylate is a stronger base than a glutamine amide. A Glu in optimal hydrogen-bonding geometry can therefore stabilize an otherwise unfavorable Nδ1H histidine tautomer over a large pH range.Table IIThe pKa values and predominant tautomeric states of the phosphoaccepting histidine in Thermotoga maritima P1, its variants, and the homologous HPt domain ArcBcpKaaHistidines have a temperature dependent heat of ionization. pKa values of free His are 6.5 at 30 °C degrees, but 5.9, at 50 °C (9).

Open table in a new tab Similar titration experiments determined that in K48A and H64A, the His-45 imidazole also has properties analogous to native P1 (pKa = 6.8 and, Nδ1H:Nϵ2H = 2.6:1) (Fig. 2, b and c; Table II). Thus, of these mutants, E67Q has the most dramatic effect on His-45 reactivity by switching the tautomeric state from Nδ1H to Nϵ2H. Presumably, the Nϵ2H tautomer cannot position the unprotonated Nδ1 appropriately for nucleophilic attack onto the ATP phosphoryl group bound in the P4 kinase domain. Chemical and Structural Determinants of Histidine Phosphorylation—CheA phosphorylation requires His-45 to have the Nδ1H tautomer, and Glu-67 stabilizes this otherwise unfavored protonation state. Although the three mutations studied all affect side-chain positions in the region of the active histidine, these steric changes had minor effects on reactivity when compared with switching the tautomeric state of His-45. For example, K48A is much more active than E67Q, despite this mutation disrupting the conserved hydrogen-bonding network and weakening the Km for Δ289 to a greater extent. E67Q and H64A both disrupt a hydrogen bond from Lys-48 to either Gln-67 or Glu-67, respectively, but H64A is 270-fold more active than E67Q. Within the catalytic triad of serine proteases, a carboxylate also stabilizes the Nδ1H tautomer of His (20Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Comparision with GHL-ATPases—In addition to sharing a common fold and ATP-binding site, CheA and GyrB also share common mechanistic features. However, CheA and the GHL family of ATPases differ in the moiety activated by a conserved glutamate residue. In GHL ATPases, a conserved glutamate likely acts as a general base to activate a water molecule for γ-phosphoryl group attack (8Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in CheA, a conserved glutamate residue perturbs the phospho-accepting histidine pKa and stabilizes the normally unfavored Nδ1H tautomeric state. These effects combine to make His-45 a better nucleophile for phosphate transfer (Fig. 3). The P1 domain provided a catalytic dyad consisting of the nucleophile for phosphate transfer (His-45) and the activating glutamate (Glu-67). Thus, P1 and P4 produces a catalytic center analogous to that of GyrB. Histidine-dependent peptide catalysts have been developed for the specific phosphorylation of small molecules (21Sculimbrene B.R. Morgan A.J. Miller S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11653-11656Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Sculimbrene B.R. Miller S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 10125-10126Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Strategies employed by bacterial histidine kinases to optimize phosphotransfer may be applicable to tuning similar reactivities in such non-biological systems. Phosphotransfer Mechanisms in Bacterial Signaling—All known histidine phosphotransferase domains display the reactive His on a four-helix bundle scaffold (6Mourey L. Re S.D. Pedelacq J.-D.

Cell. 1997; 88: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Within these common structural motifs, differences in amino acid composition, electrostatics, hydrogen-bonding networks, and surface properties tunes the reactivity of histidine phosphorylation sites to optimize reactions with phosphotransferase partners. For example, the chemical determinants for histidine phosphorylation differs among monomeric HPt domains from CheA, ArcB (ArcBc), and Ypd1. In contrast to CheA, Ypd1 and ArcBc accepted a phosphoryl group from the aspartyl phosphate of response regulators instead of from ATP. In these proteins, a Gln hydrogen-bonds to the Nδ1H atom of the phospho-accepting histidine, which in ArcBc has the Nϵ2H tautomeric state and an unaltered pKa value (25Ikegami T. Okada T. Ohki I. Hirayama J. Mizuno T. Shirakawa M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Table II). An equal population of each His protonation tautomer allows for phosphorylation at Nϵ2 (25Ikegami T. Okada T. Ohki I. Hirayama J. Mizuno T. Shirakawa M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both ArcBc and Ypd1 mutations of the hydrogen-bonding Gln do not affect histidine phosphorylation (26Matsushika A. Mizuno T. BioSci. Biotech. Biochem. 1998; 62: 2236-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Janiak-Spens F. West A.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the requirement of a hydrogen-bonded carboxylate for histidine phosphorylation depends on context. In CheA, a carboxylate at position 67 is necessary to stabilize the His-45 Nδ1 tautomer in the chemical environment provided to the reactive His by the entire kinase.

The genetic lesions are translocations that lead to dramatic overexpression of TFE3 or TFEB protein sequences. Five different genetic loci have been identified as translocation partners for TFE3, which lead to the creation of a chimeric protein containing the translocation partner at the N terminus fused to the C-terminal portion of TFE3 which includes its DNA binding and multimerization domains (1Argani P.

Moreover, TFE3, and to a lesser extent, TFEB, have been implicated in several cytokine signaling pathways that control cell growth and differentiation, but the precise mechanisms by which their dysregulation contributes to renal oncogenesis are not clear. TFE3 and TFEB are closely related members of the Mi/TFE3 (MiT) transcription factor family that includes TFEC and the microphthalmia (mi) transcription factor Mitf (6Hershey C.L. Fisher D.E. Bone. 2004; 34: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). TFE3 or TFEB overexpression is predicted to sabotage proper regulation of MiT family target genes that control normal growth and differentiation. MiT proteins bind the same cognate μE3 DNA sequence (CANNTG) via nearly identical basic regions that requires homo- or heterodimer formation between MiT family members mediated by conserved helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper domains (7Rehli M.

Genet. 1996; 14: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and RCCs containing TFE3 fusion proteins do not always express melanocyte markers (1Argani P. Ladanyi M. Adv. Anat. Pathol. 2003; 10: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Moreover, much of the essential biology of TFE3 and TFEB remains to be elucidated. TFEB-deficient embryos die at embryonic day E10 because of a failure of placental vascularization (21Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Reid S.W. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Development. 1998; 125: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its role in the adult is not known, and in general the biological relationship of TFEB to pathways in which TFE3 and/or Mitf participates is not clear. In contrast, germ line TFE3-deficient mice are normal and fertile without any reported defects (14Steingrimsson E. Tessarollo L. Pathak B. Hou L. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4477-4482Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, given their extensive sequence similarities, there is likely functional redundancy between TFE3 and TFEB in some tissues where they are both expressed; if so, their contribution could only be revealed by inactivation of both genes. The goal of the present study was to determine whether additional and common activities of TFE3 and TFEB could be identified which might elucidate new aspects of their essential biology and consequently help an understanding of the basis for their common involvement in renal malignancy. Here, we show that TFE3 and TFEB are cell type-specific leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-responsive transcription factors that directly activate E-cadherin expression in fibroblasts. In contrast, E-cadherin expression in epithelial cell lines was not dependent on endogenous TFE3 or TFEB and was reduced by TFE3 or TFEB overexpression. When overexpressed in transformed 3T3 fibroblasts, TFE3 and TFEB also activated WT1 expression and decreased expression of the E-cadherin repressor Snail. These studies reveal the existence of a new, cell type-specific receptor-target gene pathway in which TFE3 and TFEB are involved and which may become perturbed by TFE3 and TFEB overexpression in malignancy. cDNA Construction and Expression Vectors—Cloning of full-length mouse TFEB, TFE3, and transdominant negative (TDN) cDNAs are described in Supplemental Data S1. A schematic illustration of these proteins is shown in Supplementary Data S2. cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic plasmid expression vector pEBB (22Mayer B. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and retroviral vector MIG (23Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S. Lee J.Y. Kadesch T.

Cell Culture, Transfections, and Infections Cell Culture—NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% donor calf serum. Wild-type (wt) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) (Dr. W. Gu, Columbia University), wt and TFE3-/- MEFs (Dr. K. Calame, Columbia University), human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum; mIMCD-3 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For LIF (Chemicon) treatment, infected or transfected MEFs were grown in serum-free medium for 12 h before adding LIF (50–100 ng/ml) and were incubated with LIF for 24–48 h before subsequent assay. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. 3T3, MEFs, mIMCD-3, and MDCK cells were transiently transfected with SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The E-pal wt and E-pal mut luciferase reporter plasmids were derived from pGL2 (24Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar); the μE3 wt and μE3 mut plasmids were derived from pGL3 (25Mansky K.C. Marfatia K. Purdom G.H. Luchin A. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar). Both plasmid sets contain the same E-cadherin promoter fragment (mouse -178 to +92) cloned upstream from the luciferase gene. Firefly luciferase (Luc) and Renilla reniformis luciferase (RLluc) activities were measured from cell extracts with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs) 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was always normalized to RLluc activity. In all experiments, the total amount of pEBB expression vector DNA was the same by balancing cDNA-containing pEBB with empty pEBB. For all luciferase data, n ≥ 3, and standard errors are shown. Retroviral Infection—Retroviral supernatants were prepared by recovering the medium from HEK293 cells 48–72 h after transfection with MIG viral constructs and the ecotropic helper plasmid pECO; cells were infected following Pui et al. (23Pui J.C. Allman D. Xu L. DeRocco S. Karnell F.G. Bakkour S. Lee J.Y. Kadesch T. Hardy R.R. Aster J.C. Pear W.S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and kept for 24–48 h before assay. Induction of E-cadherin after Replating Epithelial Cells—Subconfluent mIMCD-3 cells were infected with retroviruses as described above. Just prior to reaching confluence (at 48–72 h), cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA and harvested for replating. A small aliquot of cells was taken for the 0 time point, and 2 × 106, 1 × 106, and 0.5 × 106 collected cells were seeded onto 60-mm dishes for collection 4, 6, and 24 h later, respectively. Lysates were prepared and equal amounts of protein loaded onto each lane of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Cell Staining and Confocal Microscopy—The protocol of cell staining for immunofluorescence microscopy (BD Biosciences) was followed. Cells were incubated with 15 μg/ml biotinylated anti-mouse E-cadherin antibody (R&D Systems, BAF748) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) or streptavidin-rhodamine (gift of Dr. S. Mirra, SUNY-Downstate Medical Center), added with the Slow-Fade Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes) before processing with the MRC-1024 krypton/argon confocal imaging system (SUNY-Downstate Medical Center Confocal Facility). Cell Cycle Analysis—2 × 106 cells were harvested and washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were vortexed while ice-cold 70% ethanol was added and were left at 4 °C overnight to fix. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in propidium iodide staining solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 units/ml RNase in phosphate-buffered saline), and rocked for ≥30 min at room temperature before flow cytometry analysis (FACScan, BD Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analyses—ChIP analyses were performed with modifications of previously published methods (26Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nuclear lysate was prepared from 1 × 108 cells and then sonicated on ice to shear chromatin into an average length of 500–700 bp (Branson 450 digital sonifier). Chromatin was diluted with immunoprecipitation buffer (2% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture), precleared with protein A/G-agarose (Roche Applied Science), incubated with 2 μg of each antibody: anti-TFE3 (BD Biosciences), anti-TFEB (abcam), and control anti-IL7 receptor (BD Biosciences) with protease inhibitors at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with protein A/G-agarose for 1 h. DNA recovered from immunoprecipitates was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 μl of Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, for semiquantitative PCR. PCR conditions were within the linear range of product amplification (not shown). PCR products were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Each experiment was performed at least three times, and representative data are shown. Oligonucleotides for ChIP assays are descried in Supplemental Data S1. Stem-Loop RNA Interference (slRNAi)—TFE3 and TFEB mRNA target sequences for RNAi were based on published TFE3 and TFEB sequences and were designed by Qiagen (Supplemental Data S1). Double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the slRNAi were inserted into pLentiLox 3.7 plasmid (27Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Protein Detection—Cells were grown in plates until confluent and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS), supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P). The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: anti-mouse TFE3 (BD Biosciences), anti-TFE3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-TFEB (abcam), anti-E-cadherin (BD Biosciences), anti-GAPDH (Chemicon), anti-WT1 (Santa Cruz), Rabbit anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma), and goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Cells were grown on plates until confluent. Total RNA was extracted from 2–5 × 107 cells with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). RT was performed with the StrataScript First Strand Synthesis System (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Primers are listed in Supplemental Data S1. RT-PCR analyses were performed for at least three separate experiments, and representative data are shown in the figures. TFE3 and TFEB Activate E-cadherin Expression in 3T3 Cells—To understand better normal TFE3 and TFEB function and how their deregulated expression could contribute to malignancy, we sought to identify new cellular processes and target genes regulated by both TFE3 and TFEB in different cell types. The strategy was to focus on the short term consequences of overexpression of exogenous and inhibition of endogenous TFE3 and TFEB, rather than create stable cell lines, so as to avoid a prolonged selection period in which the more immediate effects of TFE3 and/or TFEB overexpression or inactivation could be lost. To accomplish this, TFE3 and TFEB were expressed by retroviruses that also expressed the marker green fluorescence protein (GFP) so that infected cells could be analyzed by microscopy and flow cytometry. For comparison, a truncated TFE3 allele ΔNTFE3 (28Roman C. Cohn L. Calame K. Science. 1991; 254: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was analyzed in parallel; ΔNTFE3 lacks a MAPK phosphorylation site necessary for transcription activation in certain contexts (29Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 30Price E.R. Ding H.F. Badalian T. Bhattacharya S. Takemoto C. Yao T.P.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar) and resembles the portion of TFE3 which remains in many of the TFE3 fusion proteins. Strikingly, 3T3 fibroblasts transduced with GFP-retroviruses that expressed TFE3, TFEB, or ΔNTFE3 underwent dramatic morphological changes within 24–48 h of infection (Fig. 1A). Cells became larger and multinucleated and had a ≥4N DNA content (Fig. 1A, DNA Content). At that time, retroviral expression increased TFE3 and TFEB levels between 20- and 40-fold above endogenous at 1–2 days postinfection (Fig. 1B), levels comparable with those reported in RCCs with TFE3 or TFEB translocations (1Argani P. Ladanyi M. Adv. Anat. Pathol. 2003; 10: 243-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, 3T3 cells infected with the control virus MIG expressing only GFP retained fibroblast morphology indistinguishable from uninfected cells. The change in morphology was reminiscent of terminal osteoclast differentiation, a Mitf- and TFE3-dependent process in which multinucleation via cell fusion depends on E-cadherin expression (25Mansky K.C. Marfatia K. Purdom G.H. Luchin A. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mbalaviele G. Chen H. Boyce B.F. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2757-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In cell culture, exogenous expression of wt Mitf was shown to induce E-cadherin in Mitf-defective mi/mi osteoclast precursors (25Mansky K.C. Marfatia K. Purdom G.H. Luchin A. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter gene studies showed that Mitf directly activated E-cadherin promoter via a cognate μE3 site (25Mansky K.C. Marfatia K. Purdom G.H. Luchin A. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar). Although TFE3 was not tested previously for this property, we reasoned that TFE3 and TFEB exhibited this property in 3T3 cells. Indeed, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that 3T3 cells infected with the TFE3, TFEB, or ΔNTFE3 virus expressed E-cadherin, whereas control infected cells did not (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis confirmed E-cadherin expression in these cells (Fig. 1C). We then used the E-cadherin reporter gene assay to determine whether exogenous TFE3 and TFEB were directly activating the E-cadherin promoter (24Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar, 25Mansky K.C. Marfatia K. Purdom G.H. Luchin A. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid carried a wt mouse E-cadherin promoter fragment (-178 to +92) containing critical positive (including the μE3 and WT1 sites) and negative (E-pal site) regulatory elements linked to luciferase and was cotransfected with TFE3, TFEB, or control expression plasmids. Using this strategy, exogenous TFE3, TFEB, and ΔNTFE3 were all shown to activate the E-cadherin promoter in a dose-dependent manner in 3T3 cells (Fig. 1D, panel 1). In the reporter assay, TFE3 and TFEB exhibited similar levels of activity, whereas the induction of endogenous E-cadherin was more responsive to exogenous TFE3 than TFEB (Fig. 1C); the basis for this difference remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the ability of both proteins to activate the promoter was attenuated by μE3 site point mutations known to abrogate Mitf binding and activation (25Mansky K.C. Marfatia K. Purdom G.H. Luchin A. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 295-303PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 1D, panel 2). In contrast, point mutation of the E-pal site that blocked repressor binding had no effect on the ability of TFE3 and TFEB proteins to activate the E-cadherin promoter (24Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I. Locascio A. Blanco M.J. del Barrio M.G. Portillo F. Nieto M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2891) Google Scholar; Fig. 1D, panel 3). These results demonstrate the independent ability of TFE3 to activate directly E-cadherin inferred from genetic studies of Mitf and reveal this as a new transcriptional activity of TFEB. In 3T3 Cells, TFE3 and TFEB Overexpression Also Induced WT1—Although the μE3 site mutation significantly reduced the degree of activation of the E-cadherin promoter by TFE3 and TFEB, some activity remained, albeit at lower levels. One possibility to account for this remaining activity was that, in addition to acting directly via the μE3 site, overexpressed TFE3 and/or TFEB also affected the expression of other E-cadherin regulators. These include WT1, an E-cadherin activator not expressed in 3T3 cells (34Hosono S. Gross I. English M.A. Hajra K.M. Fearon E.R. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and Snail, a repressor that is expressed in 3T3 cells (24Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I.

Because activation of GRK2 may involve phosphorylation of its N-terminal tyrosines by c-Src, we tested whether the PDGFRβ itself could tyrosine-phosphorylate and activate GRK2. To do so, we used wild type (WT) and Y857F mutant PDGFRβs in HEK cells, which lack endogenous PDGFRs. The Y857F PDGFRβ autophosphorylates normally but does not phosphorylate exogenous substrates. Although PDGF-stimulated Y857F and WT PDGFRβs activated c-Src equivalently, the WT PDGFRβ tyrosine-phosphorylated GKR2 60-fold more than the Y857F PDGFRβ in intact cells. With purified GRK2 and either WT or Y857F PDGFRβs immunoprecipitated from HEK cells, GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation was PDGF-dependent and required the WT PDGFRβ, even though the WT and Y857F PDGFRβs autophosphorylated equivalently. This PDGFRβ-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation enhanced GRK2 activity: GRK2-mediated seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ was 9-fold greater for the WT than for the Y857F in response to PDGF, but equivalent when GRK2 was activated by sequential stimulation of β2-adrenergic and PDGF-β receptors. Furthermore, both PDGFRβ-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ seryl phosphorylation were reduced ∼50% in intact cells by mutation to phenylalanine of three tyrosines in the N-terminal domain of GRK2. We conclude that the activated PDGFRβ itself phosphorylates GRK2 tyrosyl residues and thereby activates GRK2, which then serine-phosphorylates and desensitizes the PDGFRβ.

This GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ desensitization appears to involve dissociation of the PDGFRβ from the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, a PDZ domain-containing protein that potentiates PDGFRβ dimerization (13Hildreth K.L.

GRK2-mediated PDGFRβ desensitization may also involve enhancement of PDGFRβ ubiquitination (14Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol.

Allosteric activation of purified GRK2 by agonist-activated heptahelical receptors has been demonstrated repeatedly (18Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Like many heptahelical receptors, the PDGFRβ activates Gαi in smooth muscle cells (14Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol.

Activation of heterotrimeric Gi by the PDGFRβ also liberates Gβγ subunits, which recruit GRK2 to heptahelical receptor substrates (16Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) and which may enhance GRK2 catalytic activity (23Sarnago S. Roca R. de Blasi A. Valencia A. Mayor Jr., F. Murga C. Mol.

Another important mechanism for GRK2 activation involves tyrosyl phosphorylation of GRK2 in its N-terminal domain by c-Src (24Sarnago S. Elorza A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol.

In this work, we sought to determine whether the PDGFRβ could tyrosyl-phosphorylate and thereby activate GRK2.

The plasmid encoding FLAG™-tagged murine VASP was obtained from Dr. Michael D. Uhler (30Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bovine GRK2 mutant constructs were made by cassette PCR. For the Y13F mutant, the 5′-oligonucleotide comprised nucleotides 85-153 of the native sequence: 5′-cgcggggatatcaccatggcggacctggaggcggtgctggccgacgtgagcttcctgatggcgatggagaagagcaaggccacg-3′ (the EcoRV site is underlined; the Y13F mutation is boldface).

For both constructs, the 3′ primer comprised nucleotides 579-559 of the native GRK2 sequence. Bovine GRK2 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and the PCR fragments were subcloned into this construct after EcoRV/KpnI digestion (Y13F GRK2) or KpnI/BspE1 digestion (Y86F/Y92F GRK2). To generate the Y13/86/92F triple site mutant GRK2, the EcoRV/KpnI fragment of Y13F GRK2 was subcloned into the Y86F/Y92F GRK2/pCDNA3.1 construct. To create the Y857F PDGFRβ mutant, we used cassette PCR with a 5′-oligonucleotide comprising nucleotides 2899-2953 of the native sequence: 5′-gggcgcctcgagacatcatgcgggactcgaatttcatctccaaaggcagcacctttttgcc-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined; the Y857F mutation is in boldface). The 3′ primer comprised nucleotides 3302-3281 of the native PDGFRβ sequence. The PCR fragment was ligated into the PDGFRβ/pcDNAI construct after XhoI digestion. Fidelity of mutagenesis for all constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing. For stable transfections (see below), both WT and Y857F PDGFRβ constructs were excised with HindIII/XbaI, Klenow-blunted, and subcloned into EcoRV-cut pcDNA3.1. The Y740F/Y751F PDGFRβ was a gift from Dr. Andrius Kazlauskas (31Kashishian A. Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We subcloned the BspE1/BspH1 fragment (encompassing the Y740F/Y751F mutations) into our FLAG-tagged PDGFRβ/pcDNAI construct. Small Interfering RNA—Double-stranded siRNAs targeting human GRK2 or no known human sequence were chemically synthesized with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′-dTdT overhangs (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO), as described (32Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured and transfected as described (22Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For each transfection, cell surface PDGFRβ or β2-adrenergic receptor expression was measured by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, as described before (33Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and transfection efficiency typically ranged from 35 to 50%. Assays were performed 2 days after transfection. Target expression levels for GRK2 was 40-fold higher than endogenous levels in 293 cells, assessed by immunoblotting serially diluted cell extracts. Transfected 293 cell lines co-transfected with various plasmids typically demonstrated receptor expression levels within 30% of that measured in empty vector co-transfected control cells. Cell lines with receptor expression levels outside this range were not used. For transfection with siRNA, early passage 293 cells at 30-40% confluency were transfected with 1.0 μg of PDGFRβ/pcDNA I and 20 μg of the indicated siRNA by using the GeneSilencer Transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) as described (32Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were divided into plates for IP, IB, cell surface immunofluorescence/flow cytometry, and phosphoinositide hydrolysis. All assays were performed at least 3 days after siRNA transfection. Cells were serum-starved overnight before stimulation. To create 293 cells stably expressing the PDGFRβ WT or Y857F mutant, we transfected with pcDNA3.1-based constructs and selected clones resistant to Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml). WT and Y857F PDGFRβ expression was assessed by cell surface immunofluorescence for the N-terminal PDGFRβ FLAG™ epitope (33Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and comparisons were made among clones (n = 3 of each) with equivalent PDGFRβ expression. Immunoprecipitations—To assess PDGFRβ-mediated tyrosyl phosphorylation of GRK2 as well as GRK2-mediated seryl phosphorylation of the PDGFRβ, cells were serum-starved overnight, exposed to vehicle- or agonist-containing medium for the indicated times, and subjected to IP as described previously for the FLAG™-tagged PDGFRβ (14Freedman N.J.

In select experiments, 293 cells were exposed for 16 h (37 °C) to serum-free medium containing 100 ng of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Inc.) per milliliter, prior to PDGF stimulation. The PDGFRβ constructs and GRK2 constructs were immunoprecipitated from parallel aliquots of cell lysates. For GRK2 IP we used 10 μg of pY20 (for phosphotyrosine, BD Transduction Laboratories) or 5 μg of C5/1 (which recognizes a C-terminal epitope in GRK2 (34Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)), and 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Sigma). These conditions represented IgG and protein G excess: doubling the IP IgG and protein G-agarose quantities did not increase the amount of GRK2 immunoprecipitated. Immunoblotting—Cell surface PDGFRβ expression levels and/or cell lysate protein concentrations were used to load equivalent amounts of receptor or cell protein per lane for SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed as described before (14Freedman N.J.

In addition to IgGs used previously (14Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol.

Because anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphoserine IgGs fail to desorb from PDGFRβ bands (13Hildreth K.L. Wu J.H. Barak L.S. Exum S.T. Kim L.K. Peppel K. Freedman N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41775-41782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), these IgGs were used in sequential immunoblotting only after blotting for the PDGFRβ was performed. Chemiluminescence signals for phosphotyrosine or phosphoserine were normalized to cognate signals for either the PDGFRβ or GRK2, and relative band intensities were then compared among bands on the same nitrocellulose blot. Cellular PKA Activity Assays—HEK cells were transfected with plasmids encoding PDGFR constructs, the β2-adrenergic receptor (28Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and VASP (6, 1.2, and 0.1 μg of plasmid/per 100-mm dish, respectively). Cells were stimulated at 37 °C with 50 μm forskolin or 10 μm (-)isoproterenol for 10 or 5 min, respectively, as described (22Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and then lysed in 1 × SDS sample buffer. Cell extracts were immunoblotted for phospho-VASP and actin; band intensities for phospho-VASP were normalized to cognate band intensities for actin. Immune Complex Kinase Assays—Bovine GRK2 was produced in Sf9 cells by recombinant baculovirus-mediated expression and purified as described (14Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Kinase assays with immunoprecipitated PDGFRβ constructs were performed exactly as described (14Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but with only non-radiolabeled ATP. Although PDGFRβ constructs were immunoprecipitated with M2-agarose beads (Sigma), hemagglutinin-tagged constitutively active Src was immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 and protein G-agarose (22Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). For experiments with the c-Src-selective inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem), immune complexes were preincubated with the indicated PP2 concentration for 10 min (37 °C) before the addition of GRK2 and ATP. At the conclusion of kinase assays, 1 ml of solubilization buffer containing 5 mm EDTA was added to each tube. While GRK2 was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with C5/1, the PDGFRβ constructs were desorbed from the washed M2-agarose beads. Phosphorylation of GRK2 in Intact Cells—To detect the tyrosyl phosphorylation of endogenous GRK2 in intact cells, we inhibited cellular protein tyrosyl phosphatases with pervanadate, which was prepared by incubating 5 mm sodium ortho-vanadate in the presence of 50 mm H2O2 (10 min, room temperature) and then quenching excess H2O2 by adding 0.1 volume of catalase (Sigma, 200 μg/ml, 4-8 units/μg). The resulting pervanadate solution was added to cells at 50 μm (final), 5 min before the addition of PDGF. No pervanadate was used in experiments with cells overexpressing GRK2. Cells were solubilized and subjected to GRK2 and PDGFRβ IP as described above. Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—siRNA-transfected cells were labeled overnight with 1 μCi of [3H]inositol/ml in serum-free medium, stimulated with PDGF-BB or fluoroaluminate, and processed to obtain total inositol phosphates as described (13Hildreth K.L. Wu J.H. Barak L.S. Exum S.T. Kim L.K. Peppel K. Freedman N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41775-41782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cellular inositol phosphates were normalized to the [3H]inositol taken up by the cells, to obtain “percent conversion,” as described (33Freedman N.J. Ament A.S. Oppermann M. Stoffel R.H. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Independent means were compared with the Student's t test, curves were compared with two-way analysis of variance, and two-sided p values were calculated with Prism™ software (Graph-Pad, Inc.). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. in the text, and mean ± S.E. in the figures. The PDGFRβ Phosphorylates Purified GRK2 on Tyrosyl Residues—To determine whether the PDGFRβ can phosphorylate GRK2, we first used purified GRK2 along with PDGFRβs immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK cells, which lack endogenous PDGFRs (14Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because these immune complex kinase assays used non-denaturing conditions for PDGFRβ IP, potential tyrosyl phosphorylation of GRK2 could be effected not only by the PDGFRβ but also by other tyrosine kinases that could co-immunoprecipitate with the PDGFRβ, like c-Src. To control for this possibility, we used a Y857F PDGFRβ mutant, which autophosphorylates normally but fails to phosphorylate exogenous substrates (8Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whereas the WT PDGFRβ tyrosine-phosphorylated GRK2 in a PDGF-dependent manner, the Y857F PDGFRβ failed to do so, even when we used much more Y857F than WT PDGFRβ (Fig. 1). Despite this remarkable difference between WT and Y857F PDGFRβs with regard to GRK2 phosphorylation, both the WT and Y857F PDGFRβs autophosphorylated equivalently (Fig. 1). Thus, the WT PDGFRβ, and not a co-immunoprecipitating kinase, appeared to tyrosine-phosphorylate GRK2. A growing body of evidence suggests that c-Src can phosphorylate GRK2 on tyrosyl residues, and thereby increase GRK2 activity (24Sarnago S. Elorza A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34411-34416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Data regarding the ability of the Y857F PDGFRβ to activate c-Src are lacking, even though the Y857F PDGFRβ is equivalent to the WT PDGFRβ with regard to autophosphorylation and association with phospholipase Cγ, RasGAP, and p85 (8Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because the PDGFRβ activates c-Src through the SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (35Walter A.O. Peng Z.Y. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1911-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and because the autophosphorylated Y857F and WT PDGFRβs should bind Shp2 equivalently (8Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we expected that both PDGFRβ constructs would activate Src equivalently. To test this expectation, we stably expressed WT and Y857F PDGFRβ constructs at equivalent levels in 293 cells and found that PDGF did indeed activate c-Src via the two PDGFRβ constructs indistinguishably (Fig. 2). Consequently, differences between the WT and Y857F PDGFRβs with regard to tyrosyl phosphorylation of GRK2 cannot be attributed to differences in Src activation. To corroborate further our inferences that GRK2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated primarily by the PDGFRβ, and not c-Src, in our PDGFRβ assays (Fig. 1), we used purified GRK2 in immune complex kinase assays with the WT PDGFRβ or constitutively active (CA-) c-Src. To distinguish PDGFRβ-from CA-Src-mediated GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation, we used the Src-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, which is known to inhibit the PDGFRβ tyrosine kinase activity at higher concentrations (36Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although CA-Src and the PDGFRβ effected equivalent tyrosyl phosphorylation of purified GRK2, the CA-Src-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 was ∼50-fold more sensitive to PP2 than was that of the PDGFRβ, both in purified protein preparations (Fig. 3) and in PDGF-stimulated, intact cells (data not shown). Thus, differential sensitivity to PP2 distinguishes Src-from PDGFRβ-mediated tyrosyl phosphorylation of GRK2, and supports the conclusion that Src contributes little, if at all, to GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation observed in the PDGFRβ immune complex kinase assay or in PDGF-stimulated intact cells. PDGFRβ-mediated Phosphorylation of GRK2 Enhances GRK2 Activity—GRK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation by c-Src has been shown to increase the kinase activity of GRK2 on purified substrates (26Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether PDGFRβ-mediated phosphorylation of GRK2 affects GRK2 activity in intact cells, we compared GRK2 activity in cells expressing either the WT or the Y857F PDGFRβ construct (Fig. 4). Expression levels of the Y857F and WT PDGFRβs were equivalent, and PDGF-evoked"
https://openalex.org/W2120664009,"Germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) is an orphan nuclear receptor that plays important roles in development and reproduction, by repressing the expression of essential genes such as Oct4, GDF9, and BMP15, through binding to DR0 elements. Surprisingly, whereas recombinant GCNF binds to DR0 sequences as a homodimer, endogenous GCNF does not exist as a homodimer but rather as part of a large complex termed the transiently retinoid-induced factor (TRIF). Here, we use evolutionary trace (ET) analysis to design mutations and peptides that probe the molecular basis for the formation of this unusual complex. We find that GCNF homodimerization and TRIF complex formation are DNA-dependent, and ET suggests that dimerization involves key functional sites on both helix 3 and helix 11, which are located on opposing surfaces of the ligand binding domain. Targeted mutations in either helix of GCNF disrupt the formation of both the homodimer and the endogenous TRIF complex. Moreover, peptide mimetics of both of these ET-determined sites inhibit dimerization and TRIF complex formation. This suggests that a novel helix 3-helix 11 heterotypic interaction mediates GCNF interaction and would facilitate oligomerization. Indeed, it was determined that the endogenous TRIF complex is composed of a GCNF oligomer. These findings shed light on an evolutionarily selected mechanism that reveals the unusual DNA-binding, dimerization, and oligomerization properties of GCNF.

These findings shed light on an evolutionarily selected mechanism that reveals the unusual DNA-binding, dimerization, and oligomerization properties of GCNF. Evolutionary trace-based peptides identify a novel asymmetric interaction that mediates oligomerization in nuclear receptors.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 285Issue 20PreviewVOLUME 280 (2005) PAGES 31818–31829 Full-Text PDF Open Access Nuclear receptors are one of the most diverse families of ligand-activated transcriptional regulators in animals (metazoans), with a central role in regulating human metabolism, hormonal function, homeostasis, and development (1Robinson-Rechavi M.

Surprisingly, when it is translated in vitro, GCNF forms a homodimer that is postulated to be mediated by a helix 3/helix 3 interaction (20Greschik H. Wurtz J.M. Hublitz P. Kohler F. Moras D. Schule R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 690-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, in differentiated P19 cells and ES cells, endogenous GCNF does not exist as a homodimer but rather forms a large complex called the TRIF complex (23Heinzer C. Susens U. Schmitz T.P. Borgmeyer U. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J.

Acta. 1999; 1446: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The role of helix 3 (H3) in dimerization, and the unique presence of an unusual endogenous DNA binding complex, suggested that GCNF may further expand the known repertoire of interactions in the nuclear receptor superfamily, and motivated this study to identify the key amino acids and functional sites that mediate GCNF interactions. To identify these functional determinants, we turned to the Evolutionary Trace (ET) method. ET is an algorithm that probes the evolutionary record that resides in the divergent amino acid sequences of a large gene family and ranks the importance of each amino acid position by correlating their variations with evolutionary divergences (32Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 33Mihalek I. Res I. Lichtarge O. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1265-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Residues ranked in the top 30th percentile are known to cluster spatially in native structures (34Madabushi S. Yao H. Marsh M. Kristensen D.M. Philippi A. Sowa M.E. Lichtarge O. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) such that they significantly overlap functional sites (35Yao H. Kristensen D.M. Mihalek I. Sowa M.E. Shaw C. Kimmel M. Kavraki L. Lichtarge O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and predict functional specificity determinants (36Lichtarge O. Yamamoto K.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that can then be rationally mutated to reengineer function (37Madabushi S. Gross A.K. Philippi A. Meng E.C. Wensel T.G.

Hassan B.A. Development. 2004; 131: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, ET was applied to the LBD of the NR superfamily and revealed two distinct functional surfaces focused on helices 3 and 11. This led to the rational design of mutations in GCNF that demonstrated that both helix 3 and helix 11 are involved in GCNF homodimerization and TRIF complex formation. In a novel strategy, we used the ET predictions to engineer peptides that aimed to embody the activity of the sites on helix 3 and helix 11. Both were biologically active in inhibiting homodimerization and TRIF complex formation. These data point to a novel interaction mode in nuclear receptors through heterotypic helix 3-helix 11 binding. Heterotypic interactions are permissive to oligomerization, and we show that the TRIF complex is comprised of a GCNF oligomer. In the context of the NR superfamily, this reveals a new mechanism of interaction with implications for transcriptional regulation and cross-talk. Evolutionary Trace Analysis (ET)—Homologous sequences were obtained with BLASTp (39Altschul H. Madden T. Schaffer A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar) using the NCBI nonredundant data base and aligned with ClustalW (40Thompson J. Higgins D. Gibson T. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55997) Google Scholar). After removal of sequences with gaps and outliers of the sequence similarity tree, we obtained an alignment of 231 sequences of the nuclear receptor superfamily. ET analysis was carried out using a similarity matrix (BLOSUM) (62Chen Z.P. Iyer J. Bourguet W. Held P. Mioskowski C. Lebeau L. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to allow for substitution of similar amino acids. In the absence of an existing GCNF crystal structure, trace residues were mapped onto a human RXRα structure (Protein Data Bank code 1FBY) (41Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Peptide Design and Engineering—Functionally important helices H3 and H11 in the GCNF LBD were extracted from the LBD sequence in the form of soluble peptides whose helical propensities were calculated using AGADIR (43Munoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H3 showed a high helicity in the native form (P3L), whereas two different H11 peptides were generated: one with native sequence and low helical propensity (P11L) and a second with nonnative sequence and with a high predicted helicity (P11-2). Only nontrace residues were changed in the H11 engineered peptide to increase helicity (see Table V).

The point mutations were produced using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and performed according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Total proteins were extracted in extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The expression of HA-GCNF was detected by Western blot using anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-GCNF antibody (45Hummelke G.C. Meistrich M.L. Cooney A.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and visualized using the ECL detection system (Roche Applied Science). Limited Proteolytic Digestion of in Vitro Translated Protein—In vitro translated GCNF or hCOUP TF I was synthesized using a T7 or SP6 in vitro translation kit (Promega). An aliquot (2 μl) of in vitro translated 35S-labeled GCNF was digested with 0.5 μlof100 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min and denatured by boiling in SDS-loading buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and directly exposed to x-ray film. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—P19 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. CMV-HA-GCNF expression vector (200 ng) and Oct4-Luc reporter vector (400 ng) were co-transfected into P19 cells plated in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) for 24 h prior to transfection. The RL-Luc reporter (Promega) DNA was also co-transfected as an internal control to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The empty vector pCMV-HA was used as control. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was analyzed using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The Oct4-Luc luciferase reporter has been described previously (29Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was determined by dividing the activity of the corresponding luciferase reporter activity by that of the control, which was set at 1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Total protein extracts from COS1 or P19 cells were incubated with 32P-labeled DR0 DNA probe in the 0.5× extraction buffer supplemented with 67 ng/μl poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Roche Applied Science) and separated by 5% native polyacrylamide gel in the 0.5× TBE buffer. The sequence of the DR0 probe, and EMSA, were performed as previously described (29Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For the antibody supershift and peptide blocking experiments, 1 μl of antibody or 1 μl of peptide was preincubated with GCNF proteins and then incubated with 32P-labeled DNA probe. The final concentration of peptides in the binding reactions was 10 nm. EMSA-Western Blot Analysis—Increasing amounts of COS1 extracts and P19 extracts were incubated with the DR0 DNA probe and separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The native gel was duplicated. One gel, which was used to separate the radioactive labeled DNA-protein complexes, was dried for detection of the radioactive signal produced by the 32P-labeled DR0 DNA probe. The other gel, which was used to separate the proteins, was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for detection of GCNF protein by Western analysis. The radioactive signal produced by the bound DNA probe was measured by a PhosphorImager (Storm 860A; Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences); the amount of ECL signal produced by bound GCNF was determined by densitometry (Personal Densitometer SI; Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). Homodimerization and TRIF Complex Formation of GCNF Is DR0-dependent—To probe the impact of DNA binding on GCNF interactions, we compared the formation of the homodimer and the TRIF complex on the DR0 response element. Both the GCNF homodimer in COS1 cells and the TRIF complex in P19 cells bound to the Oct4 DR0 probe (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4). In addition, COUP TF I homodimers and SF1 monomers also bound to the DR0 probe (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 8) as previously shown (44Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 46Burbach J.P. Lopes da Silva S. Cox J.J. Adan R.A. Cooney A.J. Tsai M.J. Tsai S.Y. J. Biol.

(Noisy-Le-Grand). 1999; 45: 717-724PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with GCNF-specific antibodies showed that the DR0 probe detected GCNF at the same position as the homodimer in COS1 cells and the TRIF complex in P19 cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4), which confirms the presence of GCNF in the TRIF complex, as previously described (23Heinzer C. Susens U. Schmitz T.P. Borgmeyer U. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Strikingly, when the DR0 probe was withheld from the reaction mix, GCNF was not detected in the Western blots at these positions in either COS1 cells or P19 cells; rather, it remained in the well, presumably as a very large molecular weight complex (Fig. 1B, lane 3). This is in sharp contrast to COUP TF I and SF1, which, under the same conditions and using the appropriate antibodies, are homodimeric (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) (44Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 49Butler A.J. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4143-4150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and monomeric (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8) (50Ikeda Y. Acta Paediatr. Jpn. 1996; 38: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), respectively, independent of binding to the DR0 probe. Thus, in the absence of DNA binding, the GCNF LBD alone is insufficient to form a homodimer or the TRIF complex. Oligomerization of GCNF in the TRIF Complex—Since the TRIF complex is a high molecular weight assembly that contains GCNF but not the nuclear receptor co-regulators, NCoR or SMRT, which are known to interact with GCNF (29Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it is possible that a GCNF multimer is the major, or even perhaps the sole, component of the TRIF complex. To support this hypothesis, we determined the molecular weight of the TRIF complex (52Yasmin R. Yeung K.T. Chung R.H. Gaczynska M.E. Osmulski P.A. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Standard protein molecular weight markers were separated on the same native gel with COS1 and P19 extracts (Fig. 1C), and the relationship of molecular weight to the distance migrated was plotted (Fig. 1D). The distance migrated by the GCNF homodimer lies within the standard curve of the molecular weight markers, whereas the distance migrated by the TRIF complex lies outside of the standard curve. Its molecular weight was therefore estimated by extrapolation. From the standard curve, the estimated molecular weight of the homodimer is 157, and that of the TRIF complex is 373. According to the molecular weight of the DR0 DNA probe and GCNF or HA-GCNF, the calculated molecular weights of the DNA·GCNF complexes formed by different combinations of the DR0 probe and GCNF subunits are listed in Table I. When compared, the estimated and calculated molecular weights of the GCNF COS-1 homodimer are very similar. The estimated molecular weight of the TRIF complex is very similar to that predicted for a hexamer of GCNF but considerably different from that predicted for a homodimer or tetramer.Table IEstimation of molecular weight of different GCNF/DNA stoichiometriesComplexaBased on the number of GCNF molecules in a complexDR0·GCNFbMolecular ratio of DR0 DNA probe to GCNFCalculated molecular weight of the DRO·GCNF complexcCalculated molecular weight of DR0·HA-GCNF complex is shown in parenthesesDimer1:2144.5 (149.1)Tetramer1:4263.3 (272.5)2:4289.0 (298.2)Hexamer1:6382.1 (395.9)2:6407.8 (421.6)3:6433.5 (447.3)a Based on the number of GCNF molecules in a complexb Molecular ratio of DR0 DNA probe to GCNFc Calculated molecular weight of DR0·HA-GCNF complex is shown in parentheses Open table in a new tab To determine the stoichiometry of DR0 probe to GCNF in the TRIF complex, we designed an experiment to combine the EMSA and Western blot analyses. We mixed COS1 cell extracts, P19 cell extracts, and radiolabeled DNA probe. Each sample was divided in two; half was used for EMSA, and the rest was used for Western blot analysis. The probe-homodimer complex was separated from the probe-TRIF complex on the same native gel (Fig. 1, E and F). The amount of radioactive signal in the shifted complexes was determined by phosphor image analysis, and the amount of GCNF protein in the shifted bands was determined simultaneously from the ECL signal of the native gel subjected to Western blot. The combination of the two analyses measured the relative amounts of GCNF protein and DR0 DNA in each shifted complex. When the amount of bound probe versus the amount of GCNF in the COS1 cell homodimer and the P19 cell TRIF complex was plotted (Fig. 1, G and H), it was found that the ratio between the two was consistently 3 (Table II). Since the stoichiometry of GCNF homodimer to DR0 probe is 2:1, we estimated that the TRIF complex stoichiometry is 6:1, or 3 times larger. Thus we propose that the TRIF complex is a GCNF hexamer that binds a single DR0 probe.Table IIRatio of radioactive signal to ECL signal in GCNF binding complexesRatioAmount of proteinAverage12345678μlμlHomodimer336595407453437351377360415 ± 84TRIF133146136120143130123124132 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Evolutionary Trace Predicts Functional Surfaces on Helix 3 and Helix 11—The unique characteristics of GCNF DNA binding activity, and the formation of multimers in the TRIF complex, led us to mine the structural information hidden in the amino acid sequence of GCNF and the nuclear receptor family as a whole.

RAG-RSS complex assembly and activity in vitro is promoted by high mobility group proteins of the “HMG-box” family, exemplified by HMGB1. How HMGB1 stimulates the DNA binding and cleavage activity of the RAG complex remains unclear. HMGB1 contains two homologous HMG-box DNA binding domains, termed A and B, linked by a stretch of basic residues to a highly acidic C-terminal tail. To identify determinants of HMGB1 required for stimulation of RAG-mediated RSS binding and cleavage, we prepared an extensive panel of mutant HMGB1 proteins and tested their ability to augment RAG-mediated RSS binding and cleavage activity. Using a combination of mobility shift and in-gel cleavage assays, we find that HMGB1 promotes RAG-mediated cleavage largely through the activity of box B, but optimal stimulation requires a functional A box tethered in the correct orientation. Box A or B mutants fail to promote RAG synaptic complex formation, but this defect is alleviated when the acidic tail is removed from these mutants.

During lymphocyte development, antigen receptor genes undergo a series of DNA rearrangements to generate functional exons encoding the antigen binding domains of these receptors (1Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: S45-S55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). This rearrangement process, termed V(D)J recombination, is initiated when two lymphoid cell-specific proteins, called recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1The abbreviations used are: RAG, recombination-activating gene; DSB, double-strand break; RSS, recombination signal sequence; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; NHEJ, non-homologous end-joining; HMG, high mobility group; MBP, maltose-binding protein; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; LAR-PCR, ligation-assisted recombination polymerase chain reaction; IDA, iminodiacetate; IEC, ion exchange chromatography; WT, wild type; SB, sleeping beauty; PC, paired complex. 1The abbreviations used are: RAG, recombination-activating gene; DSB, double-strand break; RSS, recombination signal sequence; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit; NHEJ, non-homologous end-joining; HMG, high mobility group; MBP, maltose-binding protein; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; LAR-PCR, ligation-assisted recombination polymerase chain reaction; IDA, iminodiacetate; IEC, ion exchange chromatography; WT, wild type; SB, sleeping beauty; PC, paired complex.-1 and RAG-2, bring two gene segments into close proximity and then introduce a DNA double-strand break (DSB) at the end of each coding segment. Adjacent to each coding segment lies a recombination signal sequence (RSS) that serves as the binding site for the RAG-1/2 protein complex (hereafter termed the “RAG complex”) and directs the location of cleavage. The RSS contains a conserved heptamer and nonamer motif separated by either 12 or 23 bp of relatively nonconserved sequence (12-RSS and 23-RSS, respectively). Productive exon assembly is promoted by the 12/23 rule, a restriction that limits rearrangement to RSSs whose spacing between the heptamer and nonamer is different. RAG-mediated cleavage of RSS pairs produces four DNA ends: two blunt, 5′-phosphorylated signal ends and two coding ends terminating in DNA hairpin structures (2Roth D.B. Zhu C. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10788-10792Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Roth D.B. Menetski J.P. Nakajima P.B. Bosma M.J. Gellert M.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2520-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These reaction products originate from a two-step cleavage reaction in which the RSS is first nicked at its 5′-end, and then the resulting 3′-OH is covalently linked to the bottom strand by direct trans-esterification (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C.

Science. 1996; 271: 1592-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After DNA cleavage, signal ends are generally ligated together to form precise signal joints, but coding ends, being sealed as DNA hairpins, are first resolved and then processed and joined to create coding joints in which nucleotides are frequently gained or lost at the junction. DNA hairpin opening is most likely catalyzed by a complex containing Artemis and the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) (7Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Signal and coding joint formation is mediated by ubiquitously expressed proteins that comprise the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand break repair, including Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV (1Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: S45-S55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar).Early studies of RAG protein biochemistry demonstrated that both proteins were necessary and sufficient to cleave a DNA substrate containing a single RSS in vitro (5McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C. Ramsden D.A. Romeo C. Cuomo C.A. Gellert M. Oettinger M.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 387-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that RAG complex binding to isolated recombination signals (especially a 23-RSS), and RAG-mediated synapsis and cleavage of RSS pairs according to the 12/23 rule are promoted by “architectural” DNA-binding proteins of the HMG-box family of high mobility group (HMG) proteins (8van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this respect, the RAG complex is part of a growing group of recombinases and transcription factors that are known to associate with, and have their activity augmented by, HMG-box proteins (9Bustin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 10Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). How these proteins stimulate the DNA binding and cleavage activity of the RAG complex remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which a prototypical HMG-box protein, HMGB1, facilitates RAG-RSS complex assembly and activity.Mammalian members of the HMG-box family (including HMGB1 and HMGB2) contain tandem homologous DNA binding domains, termed HMG-box A and B, each of which consist of about 80 amino acids folded into three α-helices that adopt a characteristic L-shaped structure. The two HMG-box domains are followed by a short linker rich in basic amino acid residues and a C-terminal acidic tail comprised of about 30 consecutive aspartate and glutamate residues (10Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies of the individual HMG-box domains suggest both interact with the minor groove of DNA, but display different DNA binding properties: box A exhibits a preference for binding distorted DNA structures such as four-way junctions (11Webb M. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and DNA interstrand cross-links (12Kasparkova J. Delalande O. Stros M. Elizondo-Riojas M.A. Vojtiskova M. Kozelka J. Brabec V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1234-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas box B does not selectively bind such DNA structures, but can itself introduce a severe bend into linear DNA when flanking sequences are present (13Teo S.H. Grasser K.D. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 14Stros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (The A domain lacks this ability.) The acidic tail of HMG-box proteins has been shown to mediate interactions with the HMG-boxes (15Knapp S. Muller S. Digilio G. Bonaldi T. Bianchi M.E. Musco G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), as well as with core histones, thereby promoting association of the HMG-boxes with nucleosome linker DNA (16Ueda T. Chou H. Kawase T. Shirakawa H. Yoshida M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9901-9908Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, the acidic tail plays a role in stimulating nucleosome sliding by chromatin remodeling factors (17Bonaldi T. Langst G. Strohner R. Becker P.B. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The distinct functional properties of the HMG-boxes and the acidic tail cause us to speculate that these regions may play separable roles in the assembly and activity of RAG-RSS complexes.To explore this possibility, we prepared an extensive panel of truncated and mutant HMGB1 proteins and systematically tested their ability to promote RAG complex binding and cleavage of single and paired RSS substrates using a combination of mobility shift and in-gel cleavage assays. We find that, like full-length HMGB1, individual HMG-box domains supershift RAG-RSS complexes. Forms of full-length HMGB1 bearing alanine substitutions at residues thought to mediate important protein-DNA contacts in either or both HMG-boxes also supershift RAG-RSS complexes. Interestingly, however, despite being incorporated into RAG-RSS complexes, individual HMG-box domain proteins and full-length HMGB1 bearing mutations in box B fail to stimulate RAG-mediated DNA cleavage of single RSS substrates. Mutations in box A reduce, but do not eliminate the ability of full-length HMGB1 to enhance RAG-mediated cleavage. However, the box A mutant is less effective at promoting site-specific cleavage of a 23-RSS, and stimulates 12/23-regulated cleavage poorly. Removal of the basic linker and/or the acidic tail from HMGB1 do not appreciably reduce its ability to stimulate RAG-mediated cleavage, but increases the nonspecific DNA binding activity of HMGB1, and enables mutant forms of HMGB1 to promote assembly of RAG synaptic complexes, which otherwise is impaired when these mutants contain the acidic tail. Interestingly, a tailless form of HMGB1 in which the positions of HMG-box A and B are reversed stimulates RAG-mediated synapsis and cleavage only slightly less effectively than its normally oriented counterpart. Taken together, these data argue that box B, likely by promoting DNA bending through interactions with RAG-1, plays a critical role in promoting RAG-mediated cleavage, but is not sufficient by itself to correctly position the recombinase active site in a 23-RSS, which requires the activity of a functional tethered box A. Moreover, the acidic tail may help enforce the 12/23 rule by reducing nonspecific protein-DNA interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Vectors—Eukaryotic expression constructs encoding core RAG-1 or core RAG-2, each fused at the amino terminus to MBP without additional sequence tags (pcMR1 and pcMR2, respectively), have been described previously (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic expression construct pET11d-hHMGB1, encoding full-length human HMGB1 tagged at the amino terminus with polyhistidine, has been described elsewhere (19Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Derivatives of this construct encoding forms of hHMGB1 that are truncated or contain alanine substitutions, as depicted in Fig. 1, were generated as described under supplemental materials.Protein Expression and Purification—RAG-1 and RAG-2 fusion proteins were coexpressed in 293 cells and purified as described elsewhere (20Swanson P.C. Volkmer D. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4034-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Wild-type, truncated, and mutant forms of HMGB1 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and initially purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using iminodiacetate (IDA)-coupled Sepharose charged with Ni2+. Subsequent purification steps involved ion exchange chromatography (IEC) using strongly acidic (High S), weakly acidic (CM), or strongly basic (High Q) ion exchange supports as schematically diagrammed in Fig. 1. The purification procedures are described in detail under supplemental materials. We consistently observed lower overall yields of HMGB1 bearing alanine substitutions (either HMG-box, but particularly mtA), as these forms of HMGB1 are prone to degradation (not shown).Oligonucleotide Binding Assays—Intact 12- and 23-RSS substrates were assembled and purified as described previously (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Li W. Swanson P. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6932-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed under the same conditions as described previously (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The amounts of HMGB1 used in analytical EMSAs are noted in the figures or figure legends. Protein-DNA complexes were visualized from dried gels by autoradiography using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System.In-gel Cleavage Assays—Preparative scale binding reactions were assembled in the presence of Ca2+, fractionated by EMSA, and protein-DNA complexes assayed for cleavage activity using a previously described in-gel cleavage assay (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).RESULTSPreparation of Wild-type, Truncated, and Mutant Forms of HMGB1—In a previous study, the activities of HMGB1 and HMGB2 were directly compared in RAG-RSS binding and cleavage assays (24Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In that study, HMGB1 and HMGB2 were found to comparably supershift RAG-RSS complexes containing either a 12- or 23-RSS, and stimulate RAG-mediated cleavage of an isolated 23-RSS, but not a 12-RSS, using an in-gel cleavage assay. In a subsequent study, HMGB1 was found to be required for RAG-mediated synapsis and cleavage of intact RSS pairs according to the 12/23 rule, and 12/23-regulated cleavage of nicked RSS pairs, despite not being rigorously required for synapsis of nicked substrates (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, HMGB1 was found to promote formation of RAG complexes with cleaved signal ends, but once formed, the RAG proteins did not require HMGB1 to mediate transposition of signal ends into a plasmid target substrate (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To extend these studies, we wished to identify the structural features of HMGB1 responsible for stimulating RAG-mediated binding and cleavage of an isolated 23-RSS, and synapsis and 12/23-regulated cleavage of intact RSS pairs.Sequence, structural, and biochemical characterization of HMGB1 and related HMG-box proteins suggest that HMG box A, box B, the basic linker, and the acidic tail of HMGB1 are encompassed within the amino acid residues shown in Fig. 1A (10Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). To systematically test how the various regions of HMGB1 affect RAG binding and cleavage activity, we prepared an extensive panel of bacterially expressed truncated and mutant forms of HMGB1 (Fig. 1A, see supplemental materials). To disrupt the DNA binding activity of HMGB1, we elected to replace ten consecutive residues with alanine at comparable positions in helix 1 of either or both HMG-boxes, starting at residue 18 of box A and residue 102 of box B, using ligation-assisted recombination PCR mutagenesis (LAR-PCR, see supplemental materials and supplemental Fig. 1). These residues were targeted for mutagenesis based on sequence and structural analysis indicating that they comprise part of a “hydrophobic wedge” in their respective HMG-box domains that mediates contact with the minor groove of DNA (10Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Phenylalanine 103, for example, is thought to intercalate between DNA base pairs, promoting DNA bending; mutation of this residue impairs the DNA supercoiling activity of box B (25Stros M. Muselikova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35699-35707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis also replaces a highly conserved arginine residue present in both HMG-boxes (Arg24 in box A, and Arg110 in box B); substitution of this residue in either HMG-box reduces the DNA binding activity of the domain (25Stros M. Muselikova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35699-35707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Mitsouras K. Wong B. Arayata C. Johnson R.C. Carey M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4390-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether the orientation of the two HMG-box domains relative to one another is an important determinant for the ability of HMGB1 to stimulate RAG complex binding and cleavage activity, we also prepared a version of HMGB1 in which the positions of the two HMG-box domains are inverted or “shuffled.” Purifying the various HMGB1 proteins required different strategies, which are schematically diagrammed in Fig. 1B and described in detail under supplemental materials. Using these purification strategies, we obtained highly purified truncated and mutant HMGB1 proteins estimated to be between 90 and 95% pure (Fig. 1C).Truncated and Mutant Forms of HMGB1 Differentially Supershift RAG-RSS Complexes—HMGB1 and HMGB2 are known from previous studies to become incorporated into RAG-RSS complexes, causing the protein-DNA complex to migrate more slowly in an EMSA (24Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To compare the ability of full-length, truncated and mutant forms of HMGB1 to supershift RAG-RSS complexes, purified RAG proteins were incubated with a radiolabeled 23-RSS substrate in the presence of increasing concentrations of the various forms of HMGB1, and protein-DNA complex formation analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 2). All forms of HMGB1 tested, except B′, were found to supershift RAG-RSS complexes in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on these binding titrations, the concentration of each form of HMGB1 (except B′) needed to visibly supershift the RAG-RSS complexes was used in an EMSA to compare the mobility of supershifted protein-DNA complexes side-by-side, both in the absence and presence of the RAG proteins (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Truncated and mutant forms of HMGB1 exhibit differential capacity to supershift RAG-RSS complexes. Coexpressed MBP-RAG-1 and MBP-RAG-2 (RAG-1/2) was incubated with a radiolabeled intact 23-RSS substrate in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of the following forms of HMGB1 (as indicated above the gel): wild-type or tailless (A), tailless mtA or tailless mtB (B), basic (C), mtB (D), box A or shuffled (E), mtAB or mtA (F), box B′ (G), or box B (H). Protein-DNA complexes were fractionated by EMSA, and visualized from dried gels using a phosphorimager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Comparative binding of various HMGB1 proteins to a 23-RSS in the absence or presence of the RAG complex. Purified forms of HMGB1 were incubated with a radiolabeled intact 23-RSS substrate in the absence or presence of the RAG complex (as indicated above the gels), and protein-DNA complex formation was analyzed using EMSA. A, EMSA of individual HMG-boxes and full-length forms of HMGB1. B, EMSA of basic, tailless, and shuffled forms of HMGB1. Based on the titrations performed in Fig. 2, the following amounts of each form of HMGB1 were used in the binding reaction: 150 ng of wild type, mtA, mtB, or mtAB; 50 ng of box A, basic, tailless, tailless mtA, tailless mtB, or shuffled. Because B′ failed to supershift RAG-RSS complexes at the concentrations tested (see Fig. 2), we used 150 ng in this assay for comparison to other forms of HMGB1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of HMGB1, the RAG proteins form two distinct protein-DNA complexes when assembled on substrates containing a single RSS. We have previously shown that these two RAG-RSS complexes, called SC1 and SC2, both contain a RAG-1 dimer, but differ in the stoichiometry of RAG-2, with SC1 containing monomeric RAG-2 and SC2 containing two RAG-2 molecules (18Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both RAG-RSS complexes are supershifted in the presence WT HMGB1 and individual HMGB boxes A and B, but not box B′, presumably because the negative charge associated with the acidic tail interferes with DNA binding (Figs. 2 and 3). Mixing HMG box A with either form of box B promotes formation of supershifted RAG-RSS complexes that comigrate with those formed in the presence of box A alone (Fig. 3). HMGB1 bearing mutations in box B supershift RAG-RSS complexes comparably to WT HMGB1, regardless of the presence of the acidic tail (Fig. 2). However, slightly more (∼2-fold) mtA HMGB1 is required to reach a comparable shift in the mobility of the RAG-RSS complexes relative to WT or mtB HMGB1, although this difference is diminished if the acidic tail is removed (Fig. 2). Interestingly, mtAB HMGB1 exhibits a subtle and selective defect in its ability to supershift SC1, but supershifts SC2 comparably to mtA and mtB HMGB1 (Fig. 3). The observation that both mtA and mtB HMGB1 bind an isolated RSS and also supershift the SC1 and SC2 RAG complexes suggests that the introduced mutations do not severely disrupt the global folding of the protein, although some loss of α-helical content is observed in mtA and mtB HMGB1 compared with WT HMGB1, as indicated by circular dichroism spectroscopy (data not shown). Consistent with previous observations (27Lee K.B. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), tailless forms of HMGB1 exhibit greater DNA binding activity than full-length HMGB1, and are prone to forming higher order oligomeric complexes with DNA as a function of protein concentration, both in the absence and presence of the RAG proteins (Figs. 2 and 3). Notably, about 5-10-fold more full-length HMGB1 is required to visibly supershift the RAG-RSS complexes compared with its tailless counterparts (Fig. 2). This effect is largely attributed to the presence of the acidic tail, as similar concentrations of basic and tailless HMGB1 are required to supershift the RAG-RSS complexes (Fig. 2). Perhaps surprisingly, “shuffled” HMGB1 also supershifts SC1 and SC2, exhibiting a concentration dependence similar to that observed for tailless HMGB1.Separable Roles for the HMG-box Domains in Facilitating RAG-mediated Cleavage of an Intact 23-RSS—One limitation of the mobility shift experiments described in the previous section is that they do not provide information about the functional significance of HMGB1 protein association with the RAG-RSS complex. To address this issue, we evaluated the ability of the various HMGB1 proteins to stimulate RAG-mediated cleavage of an intact 23-RSS within the context of the supershifted SC1 RAG-RSS complex using a previously described in-gel cleavage assay that enables a direct comparison of cleavage activity between multiple, discrete RAG-RSS complexes fractionated on a single nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (23Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). As a negative control, the activity of a catalytically defective RAG complex (RAG-1 D600A) was analyzed in parallel with protein-DNA complexes assembled with WT RAG proteins. In these assays, we intentionally used the lowest concentration of the various forms of HMGB1 that yield a detectable supershift of the RAG complex to reduce the possibility of nonspecific binding by the HMGB1 proteins, while concomitantly retaining the ability to unambiguously determine whether the ability to supershift the RAG-RSS complex is the sole determinant for altering its activity.Fig. 4Stimulation of RAG-mediated 23-RSS cleavage by HMGB1 is primarily mediated by box B, but requires a tethered box A. A, in-gel cleavage assay of RAG-RSS complexes supershifted by different forms of HMGB1. A wild-type or inactive RAG complex (WT cMR1/cMR2 and D600A cMR1/cMR2, respectively) was incubated with radiolabeled intact 23-RSS either alone or with various forms of HMGB1 (indicated above the gel) in preparative binding reactions containing Ca2+ and protein-DNA complexes were fractionated by EMSA. After electrophoresis, gels were submerged in buffer containing Mg2+ for 1 h at 37 °C to initiate cleavage and then the DNA was transferred to DEAE cellulose paper. Reaction products recovered from complexes of interest (identified by autoradiography; see exposure at the top) were then analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (bottom). Positions of nicked, hairpin, and aberrantly nicked products are indicated at the left. Note that samples from lanes 1-9 and 10-15 were obtained from different in-gel cleavage assays (given space limitations for the EMSA), but all reaction products were fractionated on the same sequencing gel. B, quantification of reaction products. The abundance of aberrant nicks and hairpins (top bar graph) or correctly positioned nicks (bottom bar graph) are shown for each lane depicted in A and presented in the same order. The data are representative of independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consistent with previous results (24Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a RAG-RSS SC1 complex supershifted by wild-type, full-length HMGB1 catalyzes more site-specific nicking and hairpin formation, while exhibiting less aberrant nicking in the spacer region of the 23-RSS, than an unshifted SC1 complex. Despite its ability to supershift the SC1 complex, box A alone does not appreciably stimulate nicking or hairpin formation when present in this complex. Because box B′ containing the acidic tail does not supershift the SC1 complex, it is perhaps not surprising that the complex formed in the presence of this form of HMGB1 does not stimulate cleavage. Interestingly, the supershifted SC1 complex formed in the presence of both box A and box B′ proteins exhibits no more activity than the SC1 complex supershifted by box A alone. This observation holds true regardless of whether or not the acidic tail is present on box B (data not shown).When incorporated into the SC1 complex, mtA HMGB1 domain stimulates nicking and hairpin formation, albeit to lower levels than WT HMGB1. However, in contrast to WT HMGB1, there is a small increase in the abundance of the aberrantly nicked product. Perhaps more importantly, and in marked contrast with the mtA HMGB1, an SC1 complex supershifted with mtB HMGB1 is no more active than an unshifted SC1 complex in the catalysis of appropriately sited nicks and DNA hairpins. However, similarly to mtA HMGB1, a modest increase in aberrant nicks is reproducibly observed in this complex. This effect is also observed when both HMG-box domains"

The recent determination of the L. interrogans lipid A structure revealed an unprecedented O-methylation of its 1-phosphate group (Que-Gewirth, N. L. S., Ribeiro, A. A., Kalb, S. R., Cotter, R.

The enzymatic activity responsible for selective 1-phosphate methylation has not been previously explored. A membrane enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the 1-phosphate moiety of E. coli Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid A has now been discovered. The gene encoding this enzyme was identified based on the hypothesis that methylation of a phosphate group is chemically analogous to methylation of a carboxylate moiety at a membrane-water interface. Database searching revealed a candidate gene (renamed lmtA) in L. interrogans showing distant homology to the yeast isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase, encoded by sterile-14, which methylates the a-type mating factor. Orthologues of lmtA were not present in E. coli, the lipid A of which normally lacks the 1-phosphomethyl group, or in other spirochetes, which do not synthesize lipid A. Expression of the lmtA gene behind the lac promoter on a low copy plasmid resulted in the appearance of SAM-dependent methyltransferase activity in E. coli inner membranes and methylation of about 30% of the endogenous E. coli lipid A. Inactivation of the ABC transporter MsbA did not inhibit methylation of newly synthesized lipid A. Methylated E. coli lipid A was analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy to confirm the location of the phosphomethyl group at the 1-position. In human cells, engineered to express the individual TLR subtypes, 1-phosphomethyl-lipid A purified from lmtA-expressing E. coli potently activated TLR4 but not TLR2.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is an asymmetric lipid bilayer. The inner monolayer consists of glycerophospholipids, whereas the outer monolayer consists of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ICMT, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TLR, toll-like receptor; UDP-GlcNAc3N, UDP-2-acetamido-3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-glucose. LPS is composed of a saccharolipid anchor (1Fahy E. Subramaniam S. Brown H.A. Glass C.K. Merrill Jr., A.H. Murphy R.C. Raetz C.R.H. Russell D.W. Seyama Y. Shaw W. Shimizu T. Spener F. van Meer G.

The minimal LPS required for growth in Escherichia coli consists of lipid A and two 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residues, designated Kdo2-lipid A. Lipid A is a potent immunostimulant in animals that activates the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (2Beutler B. Hoebe K. Du X. Ulevitch R.J. J.

Additional modifying enzymes, not present in E. coli, are responsible for generating most of the structural diversity, and they generally function late in the biosynthetic pathway (8Brozek K.A.

One example of a bacterium with an unusual, modified lipid A is Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for causing leptospirosis in humans. This disease is a problem in highly populated, tropical urban centers, and its clinical presentations range from flu-like symptoms to fatal kidney, liver, or pulmonary damage (14Pereira M.M.

Rev. 2001; 14: 296-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Typical O-antigen gene clusters and orthologues of nearly all of the E. coli lpx genes are present in the genomes of various Leptospira (16Bulach D.M. Kalambaheti T. de la Pena-Moctezuma A. Adler B. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 375-380PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ren S.-X. Fu G. Jiang X.-G. Zeng R. Miao Y.-G. Xu H. Zhang Y.-X. Xiong H. Lu G. Lu L.-F. Jiang H.-Q. Jia J. Tu Y.-F.

The presence of LPS is a major distinguishing feature that sets L. interrogans apart from the other spirochetes (such as Treponema pallidum, Treponema denticola, and Borrelia burgdorferi), perhaps explaining why L. interrogans is easily cultivated outside of its host. The structure of L. interrogans lipid A has been elucidated recently using mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and biochemical analysis (18Que-Gewirth N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Bulach D.M. Adler B. Saint Girons I. Werts C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25420-25429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the key structural differences between E. coli and L. interrogans lipid A. E. coli lipid A is a β,1′-6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine that is phosphorylated at the 1- and 4′-positions and is acylated with (R)-3-hydroxymyristate at the 2-, 3-, 2′-, and 3′-positions (Fig. 1A) (5Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). The 2′- and 3′-linked fatty acyl chains are further esterified with secondary laurate and myristate chains, respectively. The structure of L. interrogans lipid A is a β,1′-6-linked disaccharide, consisting of the glucosamine analogue 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucopyranose (Fig. 1B) (18Que-Gewirth N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Bulach D.M. Adler B. Saint Girons I. Werts C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25420-25429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). L. interrogans lipid A is acylated with R-3-hydroxylaurate at the 3- and 3′-positions and with R-3-hydroxypalmitate at the 2- and 2′-positions. The secondary acyl chains most likely are 12 or 14 carbons in length, and each contains one double bond. As in many strains of Rhizobium and Francisella, the 4′-phosphate group is missing in L. interrogans lipid A. However, the most unusual property of L. interrogans lipid A is the presence of a methylated 1-phosphate moiety. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of L. interrogans Kdo2-lipid A is diagrammed in Fig. 2. For the most part, the pathway is catalyzed by orthologues of the E. coli lpx gene products. However, there are at least four additional genes that are required in the L. interrogans system. The first two, gnnA and gnnB, were originally discovered in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans because of their location between lpxA and lpxB (12Sweet C.R. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25400-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Together, these gene products function to synthesize the sugar nucleotide UDP-2-acetamido-3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-α-d-glucose (UDP-GlcNAc3N). GnnA catalyzes the oxidation of the glucosamine 3-OH of UDP-GlcNAc, and GnnB catalyzes the subsequent transamination to form UDP-GlcNAc3N. LpxA from L. interrogans is absolutely specific for UDP-GlcNAc3N versus UDP-GlcNAc (19Sweet C.R. Williams A.H. Karbarz M.J. Werts C. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25411-25419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). E. coli LpxA uses both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcNAc3N in vitro, but it cannot synthesize the latter, because it lacks the gnnA and gnnB genes. Consequently, L. interrogans lipid A contains four N-linked acyl chains, whereas E. coli has only two. The chemical structure of L. interrogans lipid A (Fig. 1B) implies that two additional lipid A-processing enzymes must be present in this organism. A 1-methyltransferase and a 4′-phosphatase are proposed to methylate the 1-phosphate group and dephosphorylate the 4′-position, respectively (Fig. 2). Methylated phosphate residues are relatively uncommon in biology (20Freeze H.H. Hindsgaul O. Ichikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4431-4439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shimba S. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12419-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is only one well characterized example of a methylated phospholipid, a methylated phosphatidylglycerophosphate analogue found in the halophile Halobacterium salinarium (22Kates M. Moldoveanu N. Stewart L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the field of lipid A biochemistry, a methylated phosphate moiety is without precedent (5Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3382) Google Scholar). The significance of the distinct lipid A structure seen in L. interrogans is unknown. A recent study suggested that leptospiral LPS might activate an alternative TLR as compared with the LPS from E. coli and most other Gram-negative bacteria (23Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.-H. Kravchenko V. Saint Girons I. Haake D.A. Godowski P.J. Hayashi F. Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Aderem A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In the case of E. coli (2Beutler B. Hoebe K. Du X. Ulevitch R.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 3Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), LPS first interacts with the LPS-binding protein, which delivers the LPS to the GPI-linked peripheral membrane protein, CD14. LPS is then brought into contact with the integral membrane protein, TLR4, and the accessory protein, MD-2. Upon activation, MyD88 is recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of TLR4, which in turn triggers a series of events that culminates in the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and the transcriptional activation of numerous cytokine genes. However, Werts et al. (23Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.-H. Kravchenko V. Saint Girons I. Haake D.A. Godowski P.J. Hayashi F. Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Aderem A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) reported that L. interrogans LPS instead activates TLR2. It is tempting to speculate that the apparent differences in TLR activation between L. interrogans and E. coli are due to the structural characteristics of their respective lipid A molecules. Identification of the L. interrogans genes and enzymes responsible for some of these structural variations should provide helpful tools for investigating this hypothesis. Here, it is reported that a novel L. interrogans membrane enzyme, designated LmtA, catalyzes the selective transfer of a methyl group in vitro from SAM to the 1-phosphate residue of Kdo2-lipid A. When LmtA is expressed in E. coli, a modified lipid A species is synthesized in vivo, which is shown to be the 1-phosphomethyl derivative of E. coli lipid A. Lipid A methylation probably occurs on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, since it is independent of MsbA function. The addition of the methyl group to E. coli lipid A does not alter its potent, TLR4-specific bioactivity.

Cloning of lmtA from L. interrogans Genomic DNA—The L. interrogans lmtA gene was cloned into pET23a (Novagen) behind the T7lac promoter to generate pMBH8. First, the gene was amplified by PCR from L. interrogans serovar icterohemeorrhagiae (strain Verdun) genomic DNA, kindly provided by Catherine Werts (Institut Pasteur). The primers were designed based on the DNA sequence of L. interrogans serovar lai (strain 56601), which is 99.7% identical to serovar icterohemeorrhagiae (strain Verdun) at the DNA level and 100% at the protein level for LmtA. The forward primer consisted of a clamp region and an NdeI site (underlined) that overlaps with the first 28 base pairs of the lmtA gene (start codon in boldface type). The reverse primer contained a clamp region, a BamHI site (underlined), and the last 24 base pairs of lmtA (stop codon in boldface type). Sequences of the forward and reverse primers were 5′-GGCCATATGGCTTTGATCGAAGAATTTGAATCTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGATCCTTAACGACCATCTACATGTAAAAG-3′, respectively. The PCR consisted of 100 ng of genomic DNA template, 250 ng of each primer, 200 μm each of dNTPs, 1× Pfu buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1% Triton X-100), and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C denaturation for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C (denaturation) for 1 min, 50 °C (annealing) for 1 min, and 72 °C (extension) for 1 min. This was followed by a 10-min run-off at 72 °C. The gel-purified PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into a NdeI/BamHI-digested and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pET23a vector. The resulting pMBH8 was transformed into XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene). The accession number for the lmtA DNA coding sequence is DQ097086. The lmtA gene was also cloned into the lac-inducible, low copy expression vector, pWSK29 (27Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Using XbaI and BamHI, the fragment containing lmtA and the upstream ribosome-binding site was excised. This fragment was ligated into XbaI/BamHI-digested and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pWSK29. This plasmid, pLmtA, was then transformed into E. coli W3110. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts and Washed Membranes—L. interrogans was provided as a frozen cell pellet. E. coli W3110 cells, harboring either pLmtA or pWSK29, were grown in 100-ml cultures that were harvested by centrifugation (3500 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. A small portion of the resulting supernatant (cell-free extract) was saved at -80 °C. Membranes were prepared from the remaining supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resulting high speed supernatant (cytosol) was saved at -80 °C. The membranes were washed in 8 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and subjected to an additional ultracentrifugation step. The final pellet was resuspended in 750 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and stored at -80 °C. The BCA assay was used to determine protein concentration. Preparation of Lipid Substrates—The radiolabeled substrates, [4′-32P]Kdo2-lipid A, [4′-32P]lipid IVA, and [4′-32P]-Kdo2-lipid IVA, were prepared in vitro following a published procedure (28Reynolds C.M.

Phosphatidyl-[U-14C]glycerophosphate was prepared by enzymatic synthesis using CDP-diacylglycerol and [glycerol-U-14C]-glycerol-3-phosphate (30Karbarz M.J. Biochemistry of Endotoxin in Rhizobium leguminosarum: Characterization of a Family of Lipid Phosphatases Specific for the 1-Position of Lipid A. Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC2004Google Scholar). Unlabeled Kdo2-lipid A was isolated from the heptose-deficient E. coli strain WBB06, as described (31Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unlabeled lipid IVA and Kdo2-lipid IVA were obtained following a published procedure (32Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methyltransferase Assay—The activity of LmtA in either cell-free extracts, cytosol, or membranes was assayed under optimized conditions in a 10-35-μl reaction volume with the substrates Kdo2-lipid A and SAM. Assays included 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm SAM, 500 cpm/μl [4′-32P]Kdo2-lipid A, and 1 μm unlabeled Kdo2-lipid A. Assays conducted with E. coli membranes did not include 5 mm EDTA in order to minimize the formation of the PagP product, palmitoyl-Kdo2-lipid A (33Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for varying times and terminated by spotting 4-μl portions onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates. Substrates and products were separated in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:4, v/v/v/v) and detected using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager system (STORM 840) equipped with ImageQuant software. Mild Acid Hydrolysis of Methyltransferase Products—The assay was performed as described above for varying times. However, to terminate the reaction, 10-μl aliquots were added to 170 μl of 12.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 1% SDS. The mixture was then boiled at 100 °C for 30 min to hydrolyze the Kdo residues. The resulting solution was converted into a two-phase Bligh/Dyer system by adding 200 μl each of chloroform and methanol, and it was centrifuged for 5 min. The lower phase (containing the free lipid A species) was removed, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The entire sample was spotted onto a TLC plate, and the lipid A molecules were resolved in chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v/v/v) and analyzed as described above. Preparation of Protein Samples for SDS-PAGE Analysis—Cell-free extracts or membrane samples (20 μg of protein) were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12.5% glycerol, 3% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. The samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 150 V for 60 min. Inner and Outer Membrane Separation—Membranes derived from either W3110/pLmtA or W3110/pWSK29 were separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation (34Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A 2-ml membrane suspension, containing 5 mg of protein, was layered on top of a seven-step gradient (30-60% sucrose, w/w) (35Guy-Caffey J.K. Rapoza M.P. Jolley K.A. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ultracentrifuged for 18 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40.1 rotor at 4 °C. A set of 22 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for protein concentration, NADH oxidase activity (inner membrane marker), and phospholipase A activity (outer membrane marker) (36Doerrler W.T.

In Vivo Labeling of E. coli Cells Expressing LmtA—Lipid A species were radiolabeled in 20-ml cultures of W3110/pLmtA or W3110/pWSK29 containing 5 μCi/ml 32Pi. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Next, the cells were resuspended in 3 ml of a single-phase Bligh/Dyer solution (chloroform/methanol/water, 1:2:0.8, v/v/v) and incubated at room temperature for 60 min in order to extract the phospholipids. The sample was centrifuged, and the pellet (containing the LPS, proteins, and DNA) was washed two times with 3 ml of a single-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture. Then the pellet was boiled at 100 °C in 3 ml of 12.5 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 1% SDS, for 30 min to release the lipid A from the LPS core residues. The lipid A molecules were extracted by conversion into a two-phase Bligh/Dyer system (chloroform/methanol/water, 2:2:1.8, v/v/v). The lower phase, containing the lipid A, was removed after centrifugation, and the remaining upper phase was washed once with preequilibrated lower phase. Lower phases were pooled and dried under a stream of N2. The dried lipid was redissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and 5000 counts were spotted onto a TLC plate. The lipid A species were separated in chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, water (50:50:16:5, v/v/v/v) and detected using a PhosphorImager system as described above. The labeling experiment performed with the temperature-sensitive mutant WD2 (36Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C."

In this study, it was discovered that AngII inhibits bTREK-1 by separate Ca2+- and ATP hydrolysis-dependent signaling pathways. When whole cell patch clamp recordings were made with pipette solutions that support activation of both Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways, AngII was significantly more potent and effective at inhibiting bTREK-1 and depolarizing adrenal zona fasciculata cells, than when either pathway is activated separately. External ATP also inhibited bTREK-1 through these two pathways, but ACTH displayed no Ca2+-dependent inhibition. AngII-mediated inhibition of bTREK-1 through the novel Ca2+-dependent pathway was blocked by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan, or by including guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) in the pipette solution. The Ca2+-dependent inhibition of bTREK-1 by AngII was blunted in the absence of external Ca2+ or by including the phospholipase C antagonist U73122, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist 2-amino-ethoxydiphenyl borate, or a calmodulin inhibitory peptide in the pipette solution. The activity of unitary bTREK-1 channels in inside-out patches from adrenal zona fasciculata cells was inhibited by application of Ca2+ (5 or 10 μm) to the cytoplasmic membrane surface. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also inhibited bTREK-1 currents through channels expressed in CHO-K1 cells. These results demonstrate that AngII and selected paracrine factors that act through phospholipase C inhibit bTREK-1 in adrenocortical cells through simultaneous activation of separate Ca2+- and ATP hydrolysis-dependent signaling pathways, providing for efficient membrane depolarization. The novel Ca2+-dependent pathway is distinctive in its lack of ATP dependence, and is clearly different from the calmodulin kinase-dependent mechanism by which AngII modulates T-type Ca2+ channels in these cells.

Other paracrine factors, including ATP, which stimulates cortisol secretion through a G protein-coupled P2Y3 receptor, also inhibit bTREK-1 and depolarize AZF cells with similar potency (13Hoey E.D.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that link the peptide hormones and paracrine factors to bTREK-1 inhibition are only partially understood. In particular, adrenocortical cells express two pharmacologically distinct types of AngII receptors (15Dudley D.T. Panek R.L. Major T.C. Lu G.H. Bruns R.F. Klinkefus B.A. Hodges J.C. Weishaar R.E.

Losartan-sensitive AT1 receptors are coupled to multiple signaling pathways (17De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger Th. Pharmacol.

Stern N. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 1763-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Most physiological responses, including AngII-stimulated corticosteroid secretion, are mediated through AT1 receptor-dependent activation of PLC, which catalyzes the synthesis of inositol trisphosphates (IP3) and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (17De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger Th. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar, 20Spat A. Hunyady L. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 489-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Adrenocortical cells also express losartan-insensitive AT2 receptors, which comprise about 20% of the AngII receptors in these cells (15Dudley D.T. Panek R.L. Major T.C. Lu G.H. Bruns R.F.

Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathways and function of these receptors in the physiology of corticosteroid-secreting cells is unknown. In whole cell patch clamp recordings from bovine AZF and AZG cells, AngII maximally inhibited bTREK-1 by 72–77% with an IC50 of ∼145 pm, provided that ATP was present in the recording pipette at millimolar concentrations (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Enyeart J.A. Danthi S.J. Enyeart J.J. Am. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20942-20951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). AngII-mediated inhibition of bTREK-1 was eliminated when ATP in the pipette solution was replaced by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, or UTP (12Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20942-20951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar). The kinase or ATPase that mediates AngII inhibition through this ATP hydrolysis-dependent pathway has not been identified. In these whole cell recording studies, [Ca2+]i was buffered to 22 nm with 11 mm BAPTA. In a separate study, we found that bTREK-1 in AZF cells was inhibited by raising the [Ca2+]i in the pipette solution from 22 nm to 2 μm (22Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1526-C1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). bTREK-1 was also inhibited by superfusing cells with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, provided that [Ca2+]i was buffered by 2 mm, rather than 11 mm BAPTA. At the single channel level, in excised inside-out patch recordings, the application of saline containing 35 μm Ca2+ to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane markedly inhibited bTREK-1 channel activity. In these experiments, 5 mm ATP was present at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Taken together, the results of these studies could suggest that AngII inhibits bTREK-1 through a single Ca2+- and ATP hydrolysis-dependent signaling pathway that requires the activation of a Ca2+-dependent kinase. In bovine AZG cells, AngII enhances the activity of T-type Ca2+ channels through the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (23Lu H.K. Fern R.J. Nee J.J. Barrett P.Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F183-F189PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chen X.L. Bayliss D.A. Fern R.J. Barrett P.Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F674-F683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wolfe J.T. Wang H. Perez-Reyes E. Barrett P.Q. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 538: 343-355Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the effective inhibition of bTREK-1 by AngII in whole cell recordings with [Ca2+]i strongly buffered to 22 nm using 11 mm BAPTA suggests that AngII may inhibit bTREK-1 by multiple signaling pathways, only one of which is Ca2+-dependent. In whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings from bovine adrenocortical cells, we discovered that AngII does inhibit bTREK-1 through separate Ca2+ and ATP hydrolysis-dependent signaling pathways. Simultaneous activation of both pathways by AngII leads to near complete inhibition of bTREK-1 current and pronounced depolarization of bovine adrenocortical cells. Molecular features of the new Ca2+-dependent mechanism were identified. Tissue culture media, antibiotics, fibronectin, and fetal bovine sera were obtained from Invitrogen. Coverslips were from Bellco (Vineland, NJ). Enzymes, BAPTA, MgATP, Na2ATP, GDPβS, ACTH-(1–24), AngII, 8-pcpt-cAMP, ionomycin, and EGTA were obtained from Sigma. U73122, U73343, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The calmodulin inhibitory peptide (CIP) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). AngII receptor antagonists, losartan and PD123319, were kindly provided by Dr. Ronald Smith (Merck Pharmaceutical Co.) and Dr. Joan Keiser (Parke-Davis), respectively. Isolation and Culture of AZF Cells—Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from steers (age 2–3 years) at a local slaughterhouse. Isolated AZF and AZG cells were obtained and prepared as previously described (26Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After isolation, cells were either resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and the antioxidants 1 μm tocopherol, 20 nm selenite, and 100 μm ascorbic acid (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12+) and plated for immediate use, or resuspended in fetal bovine serum, 5% Me2SO, divided into 1-ml aliquots, and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use. For patch clamp experiments, cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12+ in 35-mm dishes containing 9-mm2 glass coverslips. Coverslips were treated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min then rinsed with warm, sterile phosphate-buffered saline immediately before adding cells. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. Transient Transfection and Visual Identification of CHO-K1 or COS-7 Cells Expressing bTREK-1—For whole cell patch clamp recording of cloned bTREK-1 K+ currents, CHO-K1 or COS-7 cells were co-transfected with a mixture of pCR3.1 Uni-bTREK-1 and an expression plasmid (p3-CD8) for the α-subunit of the human CD8 lymphocyte surface antigen at a 5:1 ratio using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Cells were visualized 1–2 days post-transfection after a 15-min incubation with anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads (Dynal Biotech Inc., Lake Success, NY) as described (27Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used for patch clamping 24–48 h after transfection with bTREK-1. Transfected cells were plated on 9-mm glass coverslips as described above. Fifteen min before initiating a patch clamp experiment, anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads were added to the culture dish. Upon transferring coverslips to the recording chamber, transfected cells were identified based on decoration with the beads. Whole cell and single channel bTREK-1 currents were recorded from transfected cells as described below for AZF cells. Patch Clamp Experiments—Patch clamp recordings of K+ channel currents were made in the whole cell and inside-out patch configuration from bovine AZF cells. Although the results reported in this study were obtained by recording currents from AZF cells, preliminary recordings from AZG cells showed no difference in bTREK-1 currents with respect to modulation by AngII. For whole cell recordings, the standard external solution consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.3 using NaOH. The standard pipette solution consisted of (in mm): 120 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 0.2 GTP, with pH titrated to 6.8 using KOH. The buffering capacity of pipette solutions was varied by adding combinations of Ca2+ and BAPTA or EGTA using the Bound and Determined software program (28Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Low and high capacity Ca2+ buffering solutions contained 0.5 mm EGTA and 11 mm BAPTA, respectively. The low capacity Ca2+ buffering solution was normally Ca2+-free. [Ca2+]i was buffered to 22 nm in the high capacity buffering solution. Nucleotides, including MgATP, NaUTP, and AMP-PNP were added to pipette or bath solutions as noted in the text. For inside-out patch recordings, the standard external and pipette solutions used for whole cell recordings were switched. Patch clamp recordings of IT-Ca were made in the whole cell configuration. The standard pipette solution was in mm: 120 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 NaUTP, 0.5 EGTA, 0.2 GTP, 10 HEPES with pH titrated to 7.2 using CsOH. The external solution contained (in mm): 117 tetraethylammonium, 5 CsCl, 20 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.3 using tetraethylammonium-OH. All solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters. Recording Conditions and Electronics—AZF cells were used for patch clamp experiments 2–12 h after plating. Typically, cells with diameters <15 μm and capacitances of 10–15 pF were selected. Coverslips were transferred from 35-mm culture dishes to the recording chamber (volume: 1.5 ml) that was continuously perfused by gravity at a rate of 3–5 ml/min. For whole cell recordings, patch electrodes with resistances of 1.0–2.0 MΩ were fabricated from Corning 0010 glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). These electrodes routinely yielded access resistances of 1.5–4.0 MΩ and voltage-clamp time constants of <100 μs. For single channel recordings, patch electrodes with higher resistances (3–5 MΩ) were used. K+ currents were recorded at room temperature (22–25 °C) according to the procedure of Hamill et al. (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) using a List EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier. Pulse generation and data acquisition were done using a personal computer and PCLAMP software with TL-1 interface (Axon Instruments, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Currents were digitized at 2–10 KHz after filtering with an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Linear leak and capacity currents were subtracted from current records using summed scaled hyperpolarizing steps of ½ to ¼ pulse amplitude. Data were analyzed using PCLAMP (CLAMPFIT 9.2, FETCHAN 6.04, and PSAT 6.04) and SigmaPlot (version 8.0) software. Drugs were applied by bath perfusion, controlled manually by a six-way rotary valve. p values were calculated using Student's t test. AngII Inhibits bTREK-1 by Separate Ca2+ and ATP-dependent Mechanisms—Bovine AZF cells express two types of K+ channels, voltage gated, rapidly inactivating Kv1.4 channels, and leak-type bTREK-1 channels (2Enyeart J.J.

In whole cell recordings, bTREK-1 amplitude often increases spontaneously over a period of minutes, provided that the recording pipette contains ATP or other nucleotide triphosphates at millimolar concentrations (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Enyeart J.J. Xu L. Danthi S. Enyeart J.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The absence of time- and voltage-dependent bTREK-1 inactivation allows the corresponding membrane current to be easily isolated in whole cell recordings, using either of two voltage clamp protocols. When voltage steps of 300 ms duration are applied from a holding potential of –80 mV, bTREK-1 can be measured near the end of a voltage step when the transient Kv1.4 current has inactivated (Fig. 1, A–C, left traces). Alternatively, bTREK-1 can be selectively activated by an identical voltage step, after a 10-s prepulse to –20 mV has fully inactivated Kv1.4 channels (Fig. 1, A–C, right traces). Measurement of bTREK-1 by either method yielded nearly identical results. In previous whole cell recording studies on AZF cells using patch electrodes containing 2–5 mm MgATP and [Ca2+]i strongly buffered to 22 nm with 11 mm BAPTA, AngII inhibited bTREK-1 by a maximum of 77–82% with an IC50 of 145 pm. However, when MgATP in the pipette was replaced with UTP, which is not a substrate for kinases or ATPases, AngII was ineffective (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20942-20951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Xu L. Enyeart J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C199-C215Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study, AngII at a maximally effective concentration (10 nm), inhibited bTREK-1 by only 12.0 ± 4.5% (n = 11) when pipette solutions contained 2 mm UTP and 11 mm BAPTA (Fig. 1, A and D). However, when [Ca2+]i was weakly buffered by substituting 0.5 mm EGTA for 11 mm BAPTA, inhibition of bTREK-1 by AngII was restored, even in the presence of 2 mm UTP. With [Ca2+]i weakly buffered by 0.5 mm EGTA, AngII (2 or 10 nm) inhibited bTREK-1 by 67.4 ± 2.5% (n = 33) (Fig. 1, B and D). With weak [Ca2+]i buffering, AngII also inhibited bTREK-1 by 58.0 ± 7.5% (n = 8) when the pipette contained the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (2 mm) (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that AngII-mediated inhibition of bTREK-1 may occur through separate Ca2+ and ATP hydrolysis-dependent signaling pathways. If AngII modulates bTREK-1 by parallel mechanisms, each of which produces only partial inhibition, it is likely that simultaneous activation of both pathways would more effectively suppress this current. Accordingly, when bTREK-1 currents were recorded with a pipette solution whose composition supported activation of both ATP- and Ca2+-dependent pathways (0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP), AngII (2 nm) was significantly more effective, inhibiting bTREK-1 by 92.9 ± 0.7% (n = 8) (Fig. 1, C and D). Not only was AngII more effective at inhibiting bTREK-1 when both the Ca2+ and ATP pathways were available, it was also more potent. To compare the potency of AngII as an inhibitor of bTREK-1 through Ca2+ and combined pathways, AZF cells were superfused with AngII at various concentrations and bTREK-1 currents were recorded with pipette solutions containing 0.5 mm EGTA and either 2 nm NaUTP or 5 mm MgATP. Inhibition curves constructed from data obtained in these experiments clearly showed that AngII was more potent, as well as more effective, at inhibiting bTREK-1 when Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways were available (Fig. 2A, left). With both pathways available for activation, AngII inhibited bTREK-1 almost completely, with an IC50 of 63 pm. By comparison, with only the Ca2+ pathway available for activation, AngII inhibited bTREK-1 by a maximum of ∼70%, with an IC50 of 149 pm (Fig. 2A). The marked enhancement of bTREK-1 inhibition by AngII when both Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways were activated was most pronounced at lower AngII concentrations. At low AngII concentrations, bTREK-1 inhibition was partially reversible with washing (Fig. 2A). Activation of Ca2+- and ATP-dependent Pathways Correlate with Membrane Depolarization—bTREK-1 channels are largely responsible for setting the resting potential of bovine adrenocortical cells (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20942-20951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of a significant inward current, the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation predicts that a large fraction of the bTREK-1 channels would have to be inhibited to effectively depolarize these cells. The simultaneous activation of both the Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways should therefore provide a more efficient means of depolarizing adrenocortical cells. Accordingly, in combined current and voltage clamp experiments, AngII inhibited bTREK-1 and strongly depolarized AZF cells only when both the Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways were available for activation. When recordings were made with pipette solutions that sustained only activation of the Ca2+-dependent pathway, AngII (2 nm) inhibited bTREK-1 current by 62.2 ± 5.7%, whereas these cells were depolarized by an average of 11.9 ± 2.4 mV (n = 5) from their resting potential of –68.8 ± 4.4 mV (Fig. 2B). By comparison, when recordings were made with pipette solutions that allowed activation of both Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways, AngII (2 nm) inhibited bTREK-1 almost completely by 96.8 ± 1.0%, and depolarized AZF cells by an average of 44.3 ± 4.3 mV (n = 4) from their resting potential of –63.3 ± 3.2 mV (Fig. 2C). ATP, but Not ACTH or cAMP, Inhibits bTREK-1 through Both Ca2+- and ATP-dependent Pathways—Previously, we demonstrated that externally applied ATP and UTP inhibited bTREK-1 channels through activation of a G protein-coupled purinergic receptor with a P2Y3 agonist profile (32Xu L. Enyeart J.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 81-97Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In that study where [Ca2+]i was strongly buffered with 11 mm BAPTA, ATP (100 μm) inhibited bTREK-1 by a maximum of 71.3 ± 3.2% and this inhibition was eliminated by substituting AMP-PNP for MgATP in the pipette solution. Thus, similar to AngII, externally applied ATP inhibits bTREK-1 through a ATP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. P2Y3 receptors are coupled to PLC activation and the release of [Ca2+]i (33Webb T.E. Henderson D. King B.F. Wang S. Simon J. Bateson A.N. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 258-265PubMed Google Scholar, 34Williams M. Burnstock G. Jacobson K.A. Jarvis M.F. Purinergic Approaches in Experimental Therapeutics. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1997: 3-26Google Scholar). To determine whether externally applied ATP also inhibited bTREK-1 through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, inhibition was studied with a pipette solution designed to permit activation of the Ca2+, but not the ATP-dependent pathway. With [Ca2+]i weakly buffered by 0.5 mm EGTA, ATP at 10 and 100 μm inhibited bTREK-1 by 26.2 ± 9.3 (n = 7) and 42.8 ± 4.4% (n = 6), respectively (Fig. 3, A and D). When considered in conjunction with the previously mentioned study (32Xu L. Enyeart J.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 521: 81-97Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), these results indicate that similar to AngII, external ATP inhibits bTREK-1 through separate Ca2+- and ATP hydrolysis-dependent mechanisms. Accordingly, when AZF cells were superfused with ATP under conditions where Ca2+- and ATP-dependent pathways could be activated, bTREK-1 was inhibited by 85.6 ± 5.8% (n = 4) (Fig. 3D). ACTH also potently inhibits bTREK-1 in bovine AZF cells with an IC50 of ∼5pm (1Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the signaling pathways are only partially understood, inhibition likely involves both protein kinase A-dependent and -independent actions of cAMP (5Patel A.J. Honore E. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 339-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 35Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Inhibition by ACTH or cAMP is eliminated when AMP-PNP or UTP is substituted for ATP in the pipette solution with [Ca2+]i strongly buffered by 11 mm BAPTA (26Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L.

https://openalex.org/W2122159737,"Defective antitumor immune responses are frequent consequences of defects in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules. We demonstrated that statins, inhibitors of HMGCoA reductase, enhance mIFN-gamma induced expression of MHC class I antigens on murine B16F10 melanoma. GGTI-298, a geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor, but not FTI-277, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, mimics this effect of statins. This effect is related to peptide transporter protein TAP1 up-regulation. Simultaneously, GGTI-298 induces the expression of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules. C3 exoenzyme, which selectively inactivates Rho proteins, phenocopies the effects of GGTI-298, indicating a role for Rho proteins in these events. Furthermore, the treatment of B16F10 cells with GGTI-298 or C3 exoenzyme associated with mIFN-gamma induces in vivo tumor growth slowing down in immunocompetent but not in nu/nu syngeneic mice. Both in vivo injections and in vitro restimulation of splenocytes with GGTI-298- and mIFN-gamma-treated B16F10 cells induces an enhancement of specific CD8 T lymphocytes labeled by TRP-2/H-2K(b) tetramers. Finally, these effects are not limited to mouse models since they were also reproduced in two human melanoma cell lines. These observations indicate that protein geranylgeranylation as well as Rho protein are critical for costimulatory and IFN-gamma-dependent MHC class I molecule expression in melanoma."

Controlled degradation of intracellular proteins is performed in the majority of species initially by proteasomes and subsequently by associated peptidases. This protein degradation machinery of the model organism Thermoplasma acidophilum has been intensively studied and characterized by x-ray structures, such as the 20 S proteasome that breaks down unfolded proteins (1Lowe J.

Recent investigations of tricorn structure and function have extended the picture of cage-like proteases and shifted the focus on processive peptidolysis (4Brandstetter H. Kim J.S. Groll M. Huber R. Nature. 2001; 414: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Among the three known tricorn-interacting factors of T. acidophilum, F1 is responsible for the cleavage of hydrophobic peptides, which are generated by the tricorn protease (5Tamura T. Tamura N.

F2 and F3 possess a complementary specificity spectrum because they prefer small charged and polar oligopeptides as substrates (13Tamura N. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. Tamura T.

Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The aminopeptidase F1 prefers peptides with two to four amino acid residues (5Tamura T. Tamura N. Cejka Z. Hegerl R. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W.

Moreover, the orientation of the inhibitor that was covalently bound to the catalytic Ser-105 suggested the location of the S1′ site, a second hydrophobic pocket close to the major entrance E1. A hydrogen-bonded network of two glutamates and a tyrosine along with the carbonyl oxygen of Gly-37 binds the amino group of the inhibitor. Furthermore, the backbone amides of Tyr-106 and Gly-37 form an oxyanion hole for the P1 carbonyl oxygen. In the two ligand-bound structures of F1 an additional opening (E2) from the S1 site to the protein surface was discovered that most likely serves as a product exit for single amino acids (15Goettig P. Groll M. Kim J.S. Huber R. Brandstetter H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5343-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The current work is focused on the mutational analysis of the active site residues of F1 and the interaction with tricorn by means of functional assays, crystallography, and small angle x-ray scattering. Preparation of Mutant F1 Protein—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with PCR using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) on the expression plasmid pRset6c (16Schoepfer R.

After DpnI (New England Biolabs) digest of the original plasmid, Escherichia coli DH5α cells were transformed with standard techniques (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

MIDI preparations of the plasmids (Qiagen) were used for DNA sequencing and direct transformation of BL21(DE3)RIL cells for expression (Stratagene).

Oxidized insulin B-chain (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with each recombinant tricorn protease and F1 protein samples of wild type and mutants at 50 °C in a buffer composed of 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. For control reactions, an aliquot was taken immediately after substrates and the proteases were mixed. At different times, further aliquots were taken. Degradation products of insulin B-chain were analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on an X-Terra-MS C8 reverse phase column and detected by UV absorption at 210 nm. The column was equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile (AcCN) and 95% of 2% H3PO4 and eluted with a linear gradient of 5 to 90% of AcCN and 95 to 10% of 2% H3PO4 in 20 min at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Biacore Measurements—Binding of tricorn, WT-F1, and F1 mutants was investigated with a Biacore 1000 device. Proteins were coupled in 100 mm NaOAc buffer (pH 4.0) with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide to CM5 chips. Protein binding was analyzed at 25 °C with flow rates of 20 μl/min and for controls on blank chips. All running buffers contained 0.05% of the detergent P20 (Tween 20). F1-G37A was coupled at 0.4–2.4 mg/ml and tricorn solution added at concentrations from 0.12 mg/ml (1 μm) up to 2.4 mg/ml (20 μm) in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Samples with 2 μm tricorn and 5 mm Phe-Leu-Gly-Gly (PLGG) were measured under the same conditions. In another test series, tricorn was coupled to the chip matrix at 0.2 mg/ml and F1-G37A added at 0.34 and 0.68 mg/l (10 and 20 μm). Moreover, F1-G37A and S105A were added in 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.0, and 100 mm NaCl at 10 and 20 μm concentrations; S105A was added at 50, 75, and 100 μm and PLGG at 5 mm PLGG.

Tricorn solutions were measured in 100-μl cuvettes at concentrations of 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 10.0 mg/ml and those of F1-tricorn mixtures (1.1:1.0 molar ratio of F1 to tricorn monomer) at several concentrations ranging from 1.9 to 7.1 mg/ml. To check for radiation damage the data were collected in 10 successive 1-min frames that were averaged after normalization to the beam intensity, corrected for the detector response and the background scattering of the buffer with the program package PRIMUS (21Konarev P.V.

Parameters for forward scattering I(0) and the radius of gyration Rg were evaluated using both the Guinier approximation (23Guinier A. Ann. Phys.

The effective molecular masses of the solutes were evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). For a quantitative description the experimental scattering intensity Iexp(s) was represented as shown in Equation 1I(s)=∑j=1kVj·Ij(s)(Eq. 1) where K is the number of components in the mixture and 0 ≤νj ≤ 1 and Ij(s) are the volume fraction and the scattering intensity from the j-th component, respectively. The volume fractions were determined by the program OLIGOMER (21Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl.

For the mixtures of tricorn monomers and hexamers (K = 2 in Equation 1), the scattering patterns Ij(s) from the crystallographic models of monomeric and hexameric tricorn (Protein Data Bank entry 1K32) were calculated by the program CRYSOL (25Svergun D.I.

The corresponding calculations for tricorn-F1 mixtures were performed with a model of F1 (Protein Data Bank entry 1MTZ). A tentative model of the tricorn-F1 complex was built containing three F1 molecules/tricorn hexamer bound to the three supposed docking sites, namely the β-6 propeller domains. The underlying 1:1 complex model was built manually in MAIN (26Turk D.

Crystallization of F1 Mutants—The concentration for F1 mutants was 30 mg/ml mixed with equal volumes of 100 mm bis-Tris/HCl, pH 6.0, with 7–14% polyethylene glycol 6000 and yielded orthorhombic crystals of space group P212121. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Peptides Phe-Leu, Pro-Pro, Pro-Leu-Gly-Gly, and the inhibitor phenyl chloromethyl ketone (Bachem) were dissolved at 10–100 mm final concentration in reservoir buffers. Crystals were soaked prior to measurements for 1–10 min with 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant and flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. Data Collection, Model Refinement, and Graphic Representation— Data sets were measured with synchrotron radiation for wavelengths 0.9795 and 1.0500 Å at the BW6 beamline at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron in Hamburg, using a MAR CCD detector. The images were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar); data reduction and further optimization were performed with TRUNCATE, CAD, and SCALEIT of the CCP4i software. Preliminary refinements were attempted with REFMAC5 (see www.ccp4.ac.ik/) against the F1 model (Protein Data Bank code 1MTZ) without water molecules, and a first inspection of the calculated electron density maps was done with the program O. Additionally, data were collected with Cu-Kα radiation generated by a rotating anode generator on a MAR 345 image plate system and processed with MOSFLM (30Leslie A.G.W. Moras D. Pordjany A.D.

The refinement of the investigated mutants and their complexes resulted in models with R-factors less than Rcryst = 25% and Rfree = 30% for data at resolutions better than 2.8 Å (TABLE ONE).

Remarkably, the exchange of the P1 binding residue Gly-37 to alanine generated a mutant that was completely inactive against these substrates (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the removal of the O-γ nucleophile of the catalytic serine in the S105A mutant resulted in a residual activity of ∼9% against AAF-AMC. S105A cleaved Phe-AMC with ∼6% and Pro-AMC with ∼3% of WT-F1 activity (Fig. 2, A and B). Mutations of the hydrogen-bonded network that binds the N terminus of substrates affected the activity in a differentiated pattern. The loss of the tyrosine OH group in the mutant Y205F reduced the activity against Pro-AMC to 40%, whereas the cleavage of Phe-AMC and AAF-AMC had the same rate as in WT-F1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The importance of the negatively charged glutamate Glu-213 in cleavage of proline in P1 position is emphasized by the strong reduction of Pro-AMC cleavage to ∼2% and of Phe-AMC cleavage to 8% in the glutamine mutant E213Q (Fig. 2B). In E245Q, the activity against test substrates followed the same order, but the effect was smaller than in E213Q. Interestingly, the cleavage rate of AAF-AMC in both mutants remained relatively high with 43 and 58% of WT-F1 activity (Fig. 2B). The least active F1 mutants were chosen to compare their influence on the functional interaction of F1 and the tricorn protease. Proteolytic Assay of Tricorn Combined with WT-F1 and Mutants S105A and G37A—Based on previous studies of tricorn-interacting factors (13Tamura N. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. Tamura T. Cell. 1998; 95: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a protein degradation assay with oxidized insulin-B as test substrate was performed with tricorn and the above mentioned mutants of F1. Subsequently, cleavage products were analyzed with reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The product patterns of tricorn protease alone and combined with WT-F1 are very similar when compared 20 and 40 min after the reaction was started. The peak intensity of the tricorn-F1 degradation products appears to be slightly smaller than for tricorn alone, most likely because F1 cleaved a certain amount of N-terminal residues from the tricorn products (Fig. 2C, a and b). In contrast to the wild type proteins, which degrade insulin-B completely within 40 min, neither of the mutant mixtures with tricorn is capable of significantly breaking down the substrate. Furthermore, the combined activity of tricorn and S105A is obviously retarded, and even after 40 min the product peaks reach only ∼30% of the tricorn/WT-F1 reaction (Fig. 2C, c). In the case of the G37A-F1 mutant together with tricorn only traces of products could be detected (Fig. 2C, d). As estimated by the area under the curve of the cleavage product peaks, the tricorn/S105A-F1 activity is reduced to ∼10%, whereas the tricorn/G37A-F1 activity is ∼1% of the tricorn/WT-F1 reaction (Fig. 2C). Apparently, the total reaction depends mostly on the activity of F1 and its mutants. These results hint of a physical interaction between tricorn and F1, which is examined below. Solution Studies on F1 Tricorn Interaction—We chose small angle x-ray scattering to investigate the size and shape of solute tricorn, F1, and possible complex particles. Tricorn itself appeared to be a multifaceted system in solution, which complicated analysis of the mixtures with F1. The processed scattering intensity from tricorn (Fig. 3A) yielded the radius of gyration (Rg) 59 ± 2 Å and a maximum size of Dmax 190 ± 10 Å, which was in good agreement with values from the crystal structure of hexameric tricorn (Rg = 59.5 Å and Dmax = 190 Å). However, the scattering pattern computed from the tricorn hexamer failed to fit the experimental data with a discrepancy χ = 7.15 (see Fig. 3A, curve 2). Moreover, the estimated average molecular mass of the particles (380 ± 40 kDa) was significantly lower than the theoretical value of 720 kDa, suggesting partial dissociation of the tricorn hexamers in solution. To evaluate this hypothesis, the experimental data were fitted by a linear combination of the scattering from tricorn monomers and hexamers. A good fit to the experimental data with a discrepancy of χ = 1.25 (Fig. 3A, curve 3) was obtained from a mixture that was composed of 35% monomers and 65% hexamers. The scattering patterns from tricorn displayed a pronounced dependence on the solute concentration. In contrast to samples at lower concentrations, such as c = 2.0 and 4.0 mg/ml, the higher concentration samples exhibit distinct oscillations as depicted for the low angle portions of the scattering patterns (Fig. 3A, insert, curves 1 and 2). These wiggling curves may be explained by the presence of large isometric particles as illustrated by curve 3 computed for a hollow spherical particle with outer and inner diameters of 500 and 320 Å, respectively. Interestingly, the size of this particle corresponds well to the overall size of the icosahedral super molecules observed earlier by cryoelectron microscopy (36Walz J. Tamura T. Tamura N. Grimm R. Baumeister W. Koster A.J. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, our results indicate that monomeric, hexameric, and icosameric tricorn are in a concentration-dependent equilibrium in solution. Mixtures of tricorn protease with wild type F1, G37A, and S105A mutants were measured with and without addition of peptides and inhibitors and at different solute concentrations. In most cases, the radius of gyration of the solute increased to 62 or even 65 Å. As the computed Rg value of the tentative tricorn-F1 complex (67.8 Å) is larger than that of tricorn alone (59 Å), such an increase pointed to the complex formation between tricorn and F1. To quantitatively assess this process, experimental data were fitted assuming mixtures of monomeric and hexameric tricorn, monomeric F1, and, optionally, hexamer complexes with three F1 monomers. In solutions with low tricorn concentrations (2.0 mg/ml), accounting for the complex formation with wild type F1 allowed noticeable improvement in the fit to the experimental data (Fig. 3B, curve 1, χ reduction from 1.69 to 1.49) and with the G37A mutant (curve 2, χ reduction from 1.89 to 1.67). In both cases, the improvement of the fit was achieved by transforming ∼70% of tricorn hexamers into complexes with F1. Surprisingly, an even stronger effect was observed for the mixture with the G37A mutant after addition of the F1 inhibitor PCK, where all hexamers were transformed into complexes (Fig. 3B, curve 3) to yield χ reduction from 3.83 to 3.19, whereas the volume fraction of tricorn monomers remained between 30 and 40%. A second approach to confirm F1-tricorn interaction in solution with the Biacore method largely failed. According to these measurements the binding constants of tricorn and F1 appear to be higher than 100 μm. Thus, only transient complexes between tricorn and F1 may account for the functional interaction behavior of the two peptidases that apparently requires the presence of tricorn products, which are suitable substrates of F1. In the following sections details of the F1 peptidase activity are revealed by a series of x-ray structures that were solved for mutants mostly in complex with ligands. Crystallographic Snapshots of Peptides Entering the Cavities of F1—The structural basis of the F1 peptidase mechanism, in particular, was investigated by soaking peptide substrates or inhibitor with hydrophobic side chains into crystals of F1 mutants. S105A crystals soaked with the dipeptide Phe-Leu (FL) diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution and displayed strong additional electron densities in the active site region and at the supposed entrance tunnel E1 to the cavity system. In both positions the uncleaved dipeptide FL was modeled. The FL molecule that is located in a groove near E1 points with its N terminus directly toward the active site (Fig. 4A). Apparently,"

Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mRNA degradation is now widely recognized as an important regulatory step in controlling gene expression, and this is particularly true for short lived mRNAs such as those encoding cytokine and chemokine proteins (6Saklatvala J.

More than 1000 ARE-containing mRNAs have been defined within the human genome (17Bakheet T. Williams B.R. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 421-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, these exhibit marked structural heterogeneity, and at least three broad classes have been identified (18Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Class I AREs contain multiple independent repeats of the AUUUA pentamer. Class II AREs are defined on the basis of their content of multiple overlapping or closely juxtaposed AUUUA motifs. Class III AREs contain no pentamer motifs but do contain stretches of AU or U rich sequence. A number of recent reports suggest that there is substantial functional heterogeneity among ARE-containing mRNAs (19Tebo J. Der S. Frevel M. Khabar K.S. Williams B.R. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol.

Certainly such mRNAs exhibit a broad range of decay rates and likewise show considerable variability with respect to their sensitivity for modulation of decay in response to extracellular stimulation. The functional activity of ARE sequences reflects their interaction with proteins exhibiting appropriate sequence recognition specificity. A number of ARE-binding proteins have been identified over the last 15 years, and these have been correlated with either altered decay or translation of target mRNAs (24Brennan C. Steitz J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 25Carrick D.M. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Arthritis Res.

Despite much interest, however, clear cause and effect relationships between individual ARE-binding proteins and the behavior of specific target mRNAs have been established in only a few cases (29Levy N.S.

In light of the number of ARE-containing mRNAs, the structural heterogeneity they exhibit, and the number of RNA-binding proteins showing preference for AU-rich sequences, it is likely that ARE sequences confer a broad array of behaviors and provide significant diversity to the regulation of gene expression. In the present study, we have evaluated the functional heterogeneity of sequences within the mRNA encoding the mouse chemokine CXCL1 or KC. The KC gene (scyb1) encodes a potent neutrophil chemoattractant and serves as a functional homologue of human IL-8 in the mouse (1Baggiolini M. J. Intern.

This mRNA is highly unstable in leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells and can be stabilized very effectively in response to several pro-inflammatory stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-1α (34Tebo J.

Although we have previously reported that a clustered set of four overlapping AUUUA pentamers is a critical determinant of this behavior, the 3′-UTR of KC contains three isolated pentamer motifs as well as additional AU-rich sequence (37Oquendo P. Albertas J. Wen D. Graycan J.L. Derynk R. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional dissection of the full 3′-UTR of KC mRNA reveals two independent determinants that confer mechanistically different post-transcriptional regulation of KC gene expression. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and antibiotics were obtained from Central Cell Services of the Lerner Research Institute. Neomycin sulfate (G418), puromycin, formamide, dextran sulfate, MOPS, diethylpyrocarbonate, actinomycin D, protease inhibitor mixture, and lipopolysaccharide (prepared from the Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4) were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MA). Doxycycline (Dox) and the vector pTRE2 were obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Random priming kits were purchased from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). RNase-free DNase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).

Maxiscript In Vitro Transcription kit, cap analogue (7meGpppG), and salmon sperm DNA were obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Recombinant human IL-1α and KC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PerkinElmer Life Sciences was the source of [α-32P]UTP and [α-32P]dCTP. Protogel, Sequagel (acrylamide, N,N-methylenebisacrylamide, urea) and related buffers were obtained from National Diagnostics Inc. (Atlanta, GA). Protein assay reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. Plasmids—Radiolabeled cDNA probes for use in Northern hybridization analysis were prepared from plasmids containing fragments of GAPDH and KC in the Bluescript vector. Plasmids used to drive expression of different versions of KC were prepared in pTRE2 (Clontech Inc.). The parent clone was created by insertion of the full KC 5′-UTR and coding region (residues 1 through 359) into the BamH1/NotI sites of pTRE2, and the 3′-UTR was provided from the rabbit β-globin gene. Additional constructs were created by excising the rabbit β-globin region with XbaI and Sap1, and different versions of the KC 3′-UTR sequence were inserted in the remaining EcoRV site. The full-length KC 3′-UTR (designated FL) contained residues 360–952. The cluster only (CLU) clone contained residues 406–483 and 868–950, and the Δ1 clone contained residues 467–950. The sequential deletions of the Δ1 fragment were made at residues 538 (Δ2), 634 (Δ3), 807 (Δ4), and 868 (Δ5) and extended to residue 950. Mutant versions of CLU and FL were prepared by PCR or oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (34Tebo J. Datta S. Kishore R. Kolosov M. Major J.A. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J.

The FL(CLUmt) was prepared by substitution of the sequence TATTCGATCGAGATATCTCC for residues 445–470 in the wild-type sequence eliminating the clustered AUUUA motifs. The CLUmt contained residues 406–483 with the same mutation in the cluster of AUUUA pentamers described above. The Δ1 mutant substituted CG for UU residues in the three remaining AUUUA pentamers (see Fig. 1). The 5× κB luciferase construct was described previously (39Datta S. Novotny M. Li X. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2755-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 C6 cells stably expressing human IL-1R1 were prepared as described previously (40Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2. HEK293 C6 cells stably expressing the tetR-VP-16 fusion protein (293tetoff) were prepared as previously described and maintained in G418 and puromycin (39Datta S. Novotny M. Li X. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2755-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HEK293 C6 cells stably expressing TLR4 and MD2 were prepared as described previously (39Datta S. Novotny M. Li X. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2755-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and served as the parent line for development of the 293-TLR4/MD2-tet-off cells by transfection with the tetR-VP-16 fusion protein and selecting with puromycin. 293tet-off cells were also used to prepare lines stably expressing versions of KC mRNA containing the CLU or Δ1 fragments by selection with hygromycin. Transfections were done using SuperFect transfection reagent. Measurements of RNA Stability—Pools of 293tet-off cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three hours after transfection, the cultures were subdivided into 60-mm dishes and rested for 24 h prior to individual treatments. KC mRNA transcription was terminated by the addition of Dox, and total RNA was prepared at the indicated times using Tri reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA preparations were digested with RNase-free DNase to eliminate residual plasmid DNA prior to analysis of specific mRNA content by Northern blot hybridization as described previously (19Tebo J.

Post-transcriptional KC Protein Secretion—mRNA decay was estimated by measuring the secretion of KC protein before and after the termination of reporter gene transcription with doxycycline as described previously (39Datta S. Novotny M. Li X. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2755-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Pools of 293tet-off cells were transiently transfected as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the supernatants were removed and replaced by fresh medium. After 3-h incubation, the supernatants were harvested and saved for later determination of KC protein secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay prior to the termination of transcription. The plates were washed, and fresh medium containing Dox with or without IL-1α or LPS was added for 3 h to allow mRNA decay to occur in the absence of transcription. The supernatants were discarded, and cultures were washed extensively prior to addition of fresh medium containing Dox with or without stimuli for a final 3 h, and supernatants were harvested again for determination of KC protein. The ratio of protein secretion before and after the addition of Dox provides a quantitative estimate of residual RNA. Cell-free RNA Decay—Cell-free mRNA decay assays were adapted from Mukherjee et al. (41Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) as described previously (38Biswas R. Datta S. Gupta J.D. Novotny M. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6202-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The substrates were generated using either the Δ1 or the CLU fragments in pBS by in vitro transcription in the presence of cap analogue (7meGpppG) following linearization with XbaI to produce a 5′-capped RNA substrate internally labeled with 32P. The RNA was purified from a 6% polyacrylamide urea gel, and a poly(A) tail was added with the poly(A) tail-labeling kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific activity of the substrate was ∼0.2 × 106 cpm/ng. For the in vitro decay assay, 32P-labeled RNA (1 × 104 cpm) was incubated with S100 extract (10 μg of protein) in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm ATP, 1.5 μg of poly(A), and 15 mm creatine phosphate for the indicated times. The decay of RNA substrates in this cell-free system was quantified by determining residual trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity as described previously (38Biswas R. Datta S. Gupta J.D. Novotny M. Tebo J. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6202-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). UV Cross-linking—S100 extracts were prepared according to Ford and Wilusz (42Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215477) Google Scholar). The extracts were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Plasmids containing either the CLU or Δ1 fragments (see Fig. 1) (or their corresponding mutant versions) were used for in vitro transcription of RNA probes. pBS containing the Δ1 fragment was cut with BamH1 and transcribed using T3 polymerase, whereas pBS containing the CLU fragment was linearized with XhoI and transcribed with the T7 polymerase in the presence of cap analogue as described above and isolated following 6% urea-PAGE. The specific activity of the RNA probe was 0.5–1.0 × 106 cpm/ng. UV cross-linking was carried out as described before (44Chen C.Y. You Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each reaction (20 μl) contained 20 μg of S100 protein, 1 × 104 cpm RNA probe in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) for 20 min at 4 °C. Heparin (30 μg/ml) and yeast tRNA (50 μg/ml) were added, and the mixture was incubated further for 10 min at 4 °C. Each reaction was subjected to UV irradiation with a hand-held UV lamp (254 nm) for 20 min on ice, digested with a mixture of RNase A/T1 at room temperature for 30 min, and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. The 3′-UTR of KC contains 7 AUUUA pentamers, including a cluster composed of two juxtaposed overlapping AUUUA pairs and 3 isolated AUUUAs (see Fig. 1) (34Tebo J. Datta S. Kishore R. Kolosov M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4133-4137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full 3′-UTR sequence is responsible for both constitutive instability and sensitivity to stabilization in response to pro-inflammatory agents such as IL-1. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 2 where a KC cDNA transgene containing the full 3′-UTR was placed under control of a tetracycline regulated promoter allowing Dox-mediated suppression of transcription. Using 293C6 cells stably expressing both the type I IL-1R and a tetR-VP-16 fusion protein (293tet-off), transient transfection of the KC cDNA resulted in high level expression of specific mRNA. Following the addition of Dox to terminate transcription, KC mRNA was observed to decay rapidly. In cells that were stimulated with IL-1α at the time of Dox addition, the mRNA was stabilized (Fig. 2A). A separate construct was prepared by deleting all 7 AUUUA pentamers from KC cDNA (construct Δ5 in Fig. 1); when examined under the same conditions, this mRNA, containing only a truncated version of the 3′-UTR, was stable and insensitive to stimulation. These results were confirmed by measuring the amount of KC protein produced before and after the addition of Dox (Fig. 2B). The role of clustered AUUUA pentameric sequence motifs in determining both mRNA instability as well as sensitivity for stabilization in response to extracellular stimulation has been demonstrated in multiple prior studies (13Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Shyu A.B.

J. 2004; 377: 629-639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the pair of overlapping AUUUA-containing clusters located in the 3′-UTR of the mouse KC mRNA are important for both instability and stimulus-induced stabilization or destabilization in mouse macrophages (34Tebo J. Datta S. Kishore R. Kolosov M. Major J.A. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12987-12993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Kishore R. Tebo J.M. Kolosov M. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2457-2461PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we address the role of the residual three isolated pentamer elements located downstream of the cluster. Two different experimental strategies were employed. In the first, we prepared a KC cDNA plasmid construct containing the full 3′-UTR with mutations destroying the 4 clustered AUUUAs (FL(CLUmt)). Surprisingly, KC mRNA derived from this construct remained highly unstable and exhibited comparable or greater sensitivity to IL-1α (Fig. 3A). In the second strategy, a construct was prepared in which the region of the KC 3′-UTR containing the cluster was deleted (this construct is termed “Δ1,” see Fig. 1). Consistent with the behavior of the FL(CLUmt), this deletion mutant also retained both instability and IL-1 sensitivity. Decay rates from these experiments are shown graphically in Fig. 3B. The quantitative estimate of mRNA stability provided by measurement of the residual secretion of KC protein after Dox-mediated inhibition of transcription (Fig. 3C) confirms the RNA behavior. In these assays both the FL(CLUmt) and Δ1 fragments of KC appear to exhibit comparable instability and even enhanced sensitivity to IL-1α for stabilization as compared with the full-length wild type control. These finding strongly suggest that the KC 3′-UTR contains two independent sequence determinants controlling post-transcriptional mRNA behavior: the clustered AUUUA pentamers located in the 5′-end and the remaining 3 isolated pentamers (including AU-rich regions) in the more 3′ region. To further document the separate function of the CLU and Δ1 fragments, the CLU fragment was placed independently in a construct terminated by the polyadenylation signal (Δ5 fragment) and compared with that of the Δ1 fragment following stable transfection into 293tet-off cells. As expected, each construct exhibited constitutive instability and sensitivity for enhanced stability in response to IL-1α (Fig. 4, A and B). Surprisingly, however, we noted that there was a significant quantitative difference in the half-lives of mRNAs derived from the two constructs; whereas the Δ1 fragment was highly unstable, as seen in Fig. 3, the CLU fragment was more stable. Moreover, whereas the Δ1 fragment exhibited strong stabilization in response to IL-1α stimulation, the stabilization of the CLU-derived message was more modest, in keeping with its more limited rate of decay. Of interest, however, was the finding that IL-1 stimulated a comparable increase in post-Dox KC protein secretion from both constructs. This finding suggests that IL-1α may regulate the translation of CLU-containing mRNA, a possibility consistent with prior reports demonstrating that some ARE motifs possess such activity (14Kruys V. Marinx O. Shaw G. Deschamps J. Huez G. Science. 1989; 245: 852-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 15Han J. Beutler B. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1990; 1: 71-75PubMed Google Scholar, 16Piecyk M.

Because both the CLU and the Δ1 fragments contain multiple repeats of the AUUUA motif, we assessed the importance of the pentamers in each fragment for their contribution to instability and/or stimulus sensitivity.

https://openalex.org/W2010542524,"Previous works have indicated promiscuous transcription from the zygotic genome immediately after fertilization. The mouse Rnf35 gene is bi-exonic in structure and is transcribed in the preimplantation embryo until it is permanently silenced at the blastocyst stage of development. We have previously shown that Rnf35 transcription is positively regulated by the nuclear factor Y. Using the uniquely permissive Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cell line in transient transfection assays, we demonstrate in this work that the Rnf35 promoter was negatively modulated by a cis-cognate repressor element, designated as the downstream exon 1 repressor, or DER, residing between +72 and +95 in the untranslated exon 1 of the Rnf35 gene. Simultaneous mutagenesis of the two half-sections, DER1 and DER2, of the DER sequence was required for derepression suggesting participation of multiple proteins in the DER-dependent transcriptional repression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the 3′-half of DER (DER2) was targeted by the repressor CCAAT-displacement protein (CDP)/Cux. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments further demonstrated in vivo CDP-DER association in the blastocyst and the 8.5 day embryo. Furthermore, the DER-dependent repression was partially relieved in vivo in co-transfection with an antisense CDP construct. Transcription of the Cdp gene was shown to first occur between the eight-cell and the blastocyst stages, correlating and possibly explaining the onset of Rnf35 silencing at the blastocyst stage. Taken together, our results suggest that the evolutionarily acquired exon 1 of Rnf35, and possibly exon 1 of other similarly structured bi-exonic early embryonic genes, contributes to transcriptional modulation and silencing in the developing mouse embryo.

Aacgregor A.B. Green D.P.L. Reproduction. 2003; 125: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression profiles of some of these genes in the mouse embryo have been examined and found to be highly dynamic and complex throughout the preimplantation stages of the development (1Ko M.S. Kitchen J.R. Wang X. Threat T.A. Wang X. Hasegawa A. Sun T. Grahovac M.J. Kargul G.J. Lim M.K. Cui Y. Sano Y. Tanaka T. Liang Y. Mason S. Paonessa P.D. Sauls A.D. DePalma G.E. Sharara R. Rowe L.B.

Upon fertilization, maternal transcripts in the one- and two-cell embryos are rapidly replaced by a new set of zygotic genome-derived transcripts that serve to support further development. Hence, appropriate zygotic genome activation is an important event that drives the initial phase of embryo development. An overview on possible mechanisms that control the first bursts of transcription from the newly constituted zygotic genome in the late one-cell embryo is beginning to emerge (reviewed in Refs. 4Schultz R.M. Human Reprod. Update. 2002; 8: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 5Schultz R.M. Davis Jr., W. Stein P. Svoboda P. J. Exp. Zool. 1999; 285: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The initial phase of zygotic transcription is thought to be global and promiscuous: a considerable fraction of transcripts in the two-cell stage embryo is derived from repetitive sequences (1Ko M.S. Kitchen J.R. Wang X. Threat T.A. Wang X. Hasegawa A. Sun T. Grahovac M.J. Kargul G.J. Lim M.K. Cui Y. Sano Y. Tanaka T. Liang Y. Mason S. Paonessa P.D. Sauls A.D. DePalma G.E. Sharara R. Rowe L.B.

Reprod. 2001; 64: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One way of achieving some order in transcriptional regulation at and soon after the two-cell stage is the participation of specific transcriptional activators or repressors. Typically, the Hsp70 gene is transcribed both maternally and from the zygotic genome (6Christians E. Campion E. Thompson E.M. Renard J.P. Development. 1995; 121: 113-122PubMed Google Scholar, 7Manejwala F.M. Logan C.Y. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At the one- and two-cell stages, Hsp70 transcription is dependent on a TATA-box promoter using Sp1 as an activator as evidenced by increases in Sp1 concentration in the embryonic nucleus between the one- and two-cell stages (8Bevilacqua A. Fiorenza M.T. Mangia F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Bevilacqua A. Fiorenza M.T. Mangia F. Development. 2000; 127: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Worrad D.M. Schult R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A maternally derived GAGA-box-binding factor may be another contributor to Hsp70 transcriptional regulation (9Bevilacqua A. Fiorenza M.T. Mangia F. Development. 2000; 127: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent work, we have shown that the ubiquitous Y-box protein, the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), 1The abbreviations used are: NF-Y, nuclear factor Y; AS-CDP, antisense CDP; CDP, CCAAT-displacement protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DER, downstream exon 1 repressor; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; EMSA; electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Inr, initiator; SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase; UCE, uninterrupted coding exon; 5′-URR, 5′-upstream regulatory region; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HD, homeodomain. is a positive transcriptional activator of the preimplantation embryo-restricted Rnf35 gene; Rnf35 transcription is driven by an initiator (Inr) core promoter element without the support of a TATA-box (11Huang C.-J. Wu S.-C. Choo K.-B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The NF-Y acts on a Y-box sequence residing at –85 in the 5′-upstream regulatory region (5′-URR) of the Rnf35 gene. It is noteworthy that Sp1 and the NF-YA and NF-YC subunits of the NF-Y complex are structurally similar in carrying glutamine- and hydrophobic residue-rich activation domains (12de Silvio A. Imbriano C. Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous NF-Y and Sp1 may, therefore, be recruited as alternative activators in transcriptional control in the preimplantation development. Other transcription factors that may be involved are actively being pursued by different study groups. To investigate transcriptional regulation in the preimplantation development, we have been using the Rnf35 gene as a working model. Rnf35 is temporally transcribed in the unfertilized egg and in the preimplantation embryo up to the eight-cell stage; the gene is permanently silenced between the eight-cell and blastocyst embryonic stages (14Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Li H. Choo K.-B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Cheng W.T. Chang H.-S. Wang M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rnf35 encodes a putative RING-finger protein with uncharacterized function. The Rnf35 gene is bi-exonic in structure in comprising a short and untranslated 133-bp exon 1, a 3.6-kb solitary intron, and an exon 2 containing the uninterrupted coding sequence and the rest of the gene (14Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Li H. Choo K.-B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the Rnf35 exon 1 also doubles as the first exon of a minor population of transcript of a homologous and preimplantation embryo-restricted gene, Rnf33, that is located downstream of Rnf35 (Fig. 1A) (14Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Li H. Choo K.-B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the course of the analysis of other preimplantation embryo-restricted genes uncovered in our other laboratories, we have noted that numerous members of this family of genes are similarly bi-exonic and carry an uninterrupted coding exon (UCE) (14–18 and a list of other genes in Ref. 15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have previously proposed that the bi-exonic and UCE structure was most likely acquired in multiple retrotransposition events in the course of evolution of the genes (15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The UCE configuration of the gene confers obvious advantages in gene expression in circumventing splicing errors in the coding region and in expending less metabolic energies. The solitary intron in the bi-exonic structure could have contributed a further advantage to the expression of Rnf35: Matsumoto et al. (19Matsumoto K. Wassarman K.M. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2107-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have unequivocally demonstrated that transcription of intron-less mRNA leads to translational silencing, an event alleviated by the presence of an intron at the 5′-end of the transcript. Hence, 5′-introns are important for regulating the coupled transcription-translation machinery required for efficient translation (20Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 21Proudfoot N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 290-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The first indication that the noncoding exon 1 may be biologically significant comes from the finding that Rnf35 uses an initiator (Inr) as the sole core promoter element in transcription (11Huang C.-J. Wu S.-C. Choo K.-B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Inr overlaps with the 5′ terminus of the exon 1 sequence and within which resides the transcription start site. In the absence of an upstream TATA-box, other general or specific regulatory factors of the transcriptional machinery bind to Inr and flanking sequences to properly initiate transcription (reviewed in Refs. 22Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 23Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2503-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Smale S.T. Jain A. Kaufmann J. Emami K.H. Lo K. Garraway I.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that the 133-bp exon 1 of the Rnf35 gene harbors a cis-cognate repressor element that is targeted by the ubiquitous transcription repressor CCAAT-displacement protein, CDP, also called Cux. Our data further suggest that CDP/Cux contributes to the initial phase of silencing of the Rnf35 gene in early mouse development. Plasmid Construction, Site-directed Mutagenesis, Transient Transfection, and SEAP Assay–For construction of the SEAP reporter plasmids used in this work, various segments of the Rnf35 5′-URR and exon 1 sequences were PCR-derived and cloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of the promoter and enhancer-free pSEAP2-Basic vector as described in previous works (11Huang C.-J. Wu S.-C. Choo K.-B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Liu T.Y. Chen H.-H. Lee K.-H. Choo K.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2003; 64: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For site-directed mutagenesis, oligonucleotide primers encompassing the mutations and containing appropriate restriction cloning sites were used in the PCR amplification reactions. The CDP antisense construct was generated by inverting the human CDP gene harbored in the pMX139-MCH plasmid provided by Dr. A. Nepveu (McGill University, Quebec, Canada). This was done by first excising the full-length CDP gene from pMX139-MCH using NotI and XhoI, reversing these restriction recognition sites in the insert-free pMX139 vector using appropriate double-stranded oligonucleotides, and re-inserting the NotI-XhoI CDP sequence into the modified vector. The CDP expression plasmid was similarly constructed by inserting the gene into the expression plasmid pMX139-MCH under the control of the promoter of the adenovirus major late gene. All plasmid constructs generated were confirmed by sequence analysis. Transient transfection and SEAP assays were performed as previously described (11Huang C.-J. Wu S.-C. Choo K.-B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Liu T.Y. Chen H.-H. Lee K.-H. Choo K.-B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2003; 64: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In short, the transfection experiments were done in duplicates or triplicates in 24-well culture dishes using a fixed total amount of plasmid DNA in the presence of the Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, culture medium from each transfection sample was harvested and subjected to SEAP assay in duplicate using the Great EscAPe SEAP Reporter System 3 (DB Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection experiment included triplicate samples of the pSEAP-Basic plasmid to determine the background SEAP value. Sample variations were normalization using the EGFP fluorescence values derived from the co-transfecting pEGFP-N2 control plasmid. All the transfection data presented in this work were derived from three or more independent transfection experiments. Preparation of Recombinant CDP Polypeptides from E. coli–The plasmids encoding the CDP(CR1–CR2) and CDP(CR3-HD) subfragment polypeptides of the CCAAT-displacement protein (CDP) were kindly provided by Dr. A. Nepveu. The expression plasmids were introduced into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. When the bacterial culture reached an A600 value of 0.6, induction was typically performed with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) for homogenization with glass beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and the His-tagged polypeptides were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding was carried out at 4 °C overnight, and the polypeptide-bound beads were washed four times with a wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) followed by elution using the elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Supershift Assays—The probes used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were generated by annealing complementary strands of oligonucleotides and labeled by standard Klenow fill-in reactions of the staggered ends in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. For binding reactions using the bacteria-derived CDP polypeptides, 1-μg aliquots of the polypeptides were first incubated in 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 30 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 5 min followed by the addition of probe and a further 20-min incubation at 30 °C. For supershift assays of the His-tagged CDP polypeptides, 2 μg/μl anti-His antibody (catalog no. MCA 1396, Serotec, Raleigh, NC) was added to the CDP polypeptide binding reactions as described above and the incubation was performed at room temperature for 15 min. Probe was then added, and the incubation was extended for 20 min at 30 °C. Binding complexes were displayed on 6% polyacrylamide gels with a running time of 3.5 h for the CDP(CR3-HD) polypeptide or 5 h when CDP(CR1–CR2) was incubated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Mouse blastocysts and 8.5-day post-coitus embryos were collected from ICR mice and washed briefly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before being frozen at–70 °C until use. ChIP experiments were performed using pools of 56–60 blastocysts or ten 8.5-day embryos essentially as previously described (26Zhou T. Chiang C.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4145-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with a few modifications to accommodate fewer cells available in the embryos. In brief, protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and the reaction was terminated by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Upon cell lysis, sonication was performed using an XL2020 sonicator (Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY) using a tapered tip with an output setting of 4.5 for six 10-s bursts on ice. For each ChIP sample, 100 μlof the sheared chromatin was diluted to 1 ml with an immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). After preclearance in the PASDT solution (50% v/v of packed protein A-Sepharose beads, 240 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 240 μg/ml tRNA), lysate was collected and incubated with 5 μl of an anti-CDP antiserum (a gift from Dr. Ellis J. Neufeld, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (27Goebel P. Montalbano A. Ayers N. Kompfner E. Dickinson L. Webb C.F. Feeney A.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18440-18452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For controls, a mock sample without antiserum treatment and a sample treated with a preimmune serum were also included in each experiment. The pulleddown immune complexes were washed and eluted; reversal of the cross-links and subsequent digestions with RNase and proteinase K were performed as described previously (26Zhou T. Chiang C.-M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4145-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The DNA pellet was finally dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA). Three microliters of each DNA sample was used in PCR analysis in the presence of 40 pmol each of the DER-specific primers in 15-μl PCR reaction volumes. Due to scarcity of the embryonic cells, two rounds of nested PCR were performed. The first round of PCR was performed for 42 cycles using the primers 2406F (5′-AAGGCCCAGAGAACAAAGATTC-3′) and 2877R (5′-AAAACAATTCATCTCAACCCAG-3′). One microliter of the first-round PCR products was used in a second-round amplification step using the nested primers 2465F (5′-TGAAAACGGCCATTCTAAACG-3′) and 2746R (5′-TTCCTGCTGTGGCTGGTCCTG3′) for 36 cycles of amplification. The amplification product (282 bp in size) was analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining. Western Blot Analysis—CHO-K1 cells transfected with the CDP expression plasmid were harvested 36 h after transfection and lysed in 1x SDS-sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 100 mm dithiothreitol; 2% SDS; 0.1% bromphenol blue; 10% glycerol). The lysate was incubated at 95 °C for 15 min before being subjected to electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the membrane filter was blocked in 5% skimmed milk in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 150 mm NaCl) at room temperature for 1 h. The anti-CDP antibody (as described above, in 1,000x dilution), or the control anti-NF-Ya subunit antibody (Rockland, Gilbersville, PA, catalog no. 100-401-100, in 1,000x dilution), was applied at room temperature for 1 h before filter was washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. An anti-guinea pig-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, in 20,000x dilution) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h after which the filter was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence after treating the blot with a SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PCR Detection of the Cdp Sequence in cDNA Libraries—DNA preparations from plate-amplified bacterial cultures of mouse cDNA libraries were used as templates for PCR detection of mouse Cdp sequences as previously described (15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Cheng W.T. Chang H.-S. Wang M. Mol. Reprod.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1190-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Cdp primer sequences were 5′-CAGGACAGGACGACGGTGAAGACG-3′ and 5′-GAACTCCCATTCGATGGGCTCCTC-3′. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles using an annealing temperature of 61 °C and an extension time of 1 min for each cycle. The PCR product was 386-bp long covering nucleotides 4179–4565 of the 3′-untranslated sequence of the mouse Cdp gene (GenBank™ accession number AY037807). For control, mouse β-actin primers were used. The PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. Identification of a cis-Cognate Downstream Repressor Element, DER, in the Rnf35 Exon 1 Sequence—A schematic representation of the bi-exonic Rnf35 and a downstream homologue, Rnf33, is shown in Fig. 1A. It is noted here that the exon 1 of Rnf35 also serves as the exon 1 of a minor population (<10%) of the Rnf33 transcript; the major promoter of Rnf33 is shown in Fig. 1A (14Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Li H. Choo K.-B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we demonstrated that a segment of the 5′-upstream regulatory region (5′-URR) of the Rnf35 gene up to nucleotide —210 in the plasmid construct N6–51 was sufficient in activating transcription of the SEAP reporter gene in the uniquely permissive cell line, CHO-K1 (11Huang C.-J. Wu S.-C. Choo K.-B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1B). A shorter 5′-URR segment terminating at —13 in construct N10g1 was also transcriptionally active albeit with a slight decrease in transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). Deleting the previously identified Inr core promoter sequence in construct N10–141ΔI resulted in a 5-fold depreciation in SEAP activity. The Rnf35 exon 1 is 133 bp long (Fig. 1A) (14Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Li H. Choo K.-B. Genomics. 2002; 80: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Choo K.-B. Chen H.-H. Liu T.Y. Chang C.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4836-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The three abovementioned constructs carried only the 5′-half of the Rnf35 exon 1 sequence up to +71. To explore if the 3′-half of the exon 1 sequence between +72 and +133 contributes to Rnf35 transcription, new constructs carrying the full-length exon 1 sequence and various lengths of the 5′-URR were generated (Fig. 1B). Transient transfection assays in the CHO-K1 cells indicate that when the exon 1 sequence was extended to its full length to +133 in construct N6–52, promoter activity was depreciated 4-fold relative to that of the truncated N6–51 (Fig. 1B). Likewise, in the N10g1/N10g2 and N10–141ΔI/N10–142ΔI pairs of constructs that shared similar 5′ sequences but dissimilar 3′ termini, about a 4-fold suppression of promoter activity was similarly observed. These data suggest the presence of a cis-acting repressor element located between +72 and +133 of the Rnf35 exon 1. We designate this cis-acting repressor as the downstream exon 1 repressor, or DER. When constructs N6–51 and N6–52 were tested in five other cell lines derived from different cell types besides CHO-K1, only the hamster kidney cells, BHK-21, showed an appreciable permissiveness for the Rnf35 promoter but at a level 5-fold lower than that found in the CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 1C). Nonetheless, the DER-dependent transcriptional repression conferred by construct N6–52 was clearly evident in BHK-21. Taken together, the repressive characteristic of DER in N6–52 was most prominent in the CHO-K1 cells, correlating well with the restricted permissiveness of CHO-K1 cells in supporting Rnf35 promoter function as previously described (11Huang C.-J. Wu S.-C. Choo K.-B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To further verify the cis-repressor function of the DER sequence, a Rnf35 exon 1 sequence between +4 and +133 devoid of the Inr but retaining DER was inserted downstream of the SV40 promoter/enhancer in the plasmid pSEAP-Control (GenBank™ accession number U89938) generating construct pSEAP-Ex1 (Fig. 1D). Upon transfection, a 3-fold repression in the expression of the SEAP reporter gene was observed. When the Inr-less +4 to +71 sequence that is also devoid of the DER sequence (construct pSEAP-Ex1ΔR) was similarly tested, repression was abolished further supporting the presence of a cis-acting repressor element in the +72 to +133 exon 1 segment. The data further indicate that the cis-cognate repressor is also functional on a TATA-box promoter. To further delineate the repressor sequence, we generated a series of deletion mutants, N10gA, N10gB, and N10gC, retaining increasing sequence lengths between +72 to +133 (Fig. 1E). N10g1 carrying the shorter but transcriptionally active 5′-URR sequence up to –13 was used to avoid interference that might arise from a longer 5′-URR sequence. All the three constructs showed approximately similar promoter activity on transient transfection indicating that the first increment between +72 and +95 in N10gA was sufficient to confer the observed repressor activity. We conclude that the DER sequence is contained within a 24-bp region between +72 and +95. The DER Sequence Is Functionally Partitioned into DER1 and DER2—In a transcription factor binding sequence data base search, we found that the best match for the 5′-half of the DER sequence, 5′-TGGCCCACGTAG-3′, was that of a binding site for a yeast PHO4-like protein (30Barbaric S.
