https://openalex.org/W2154232712,The electrochemical reaction of layered titanium disulfide with lithium giving the intercalation compound lithium titanium disulfide is the basis of a new battery system. This reaction occurs very rapidly and in a highly reversible manner at ambient temperatures as a result of structural retention. Titanium disulfide is one of a new generation of solid cathode materials.
https://openalex.org/W2006948846,"Results from two types of experiments show that intergranular pore pressures fluctuated dynamically during rapid, steady shear deformation of water-saturated granular materials. During some fluctuations, the pore water locally supported all normal and shear stresses, while grain-contact stresses transiently fell to zero. Fluctuations also propagated outward from the shear zone; this process modifies grain-contact stresses in adjacent areas and potentially instigates shear-zone growth."

Analogs among the CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites exist for some of these asteroids, suggesting that these absorptions are due to iron oxides in phyllosilicates formed on the asteroidal surfaces by aqueous alteration processes. Spectra of ten additional asteroids, located beyond the outer edge of the main belt, show no discernible absorption features, suggesting that aqueous alteration did not always operate at these heliocentric distances."
https://openalex.org/W1981853689,"Conversion of inorganic and organic selenium compounds to volatile selenium compounds (dimethyl selenide, dimethyl diselenide, and an unknown compound) by microorganisms in lake sediment has been observed. This conversion could also be effected by pure cultures of bacteria and fungi. Such transformations are significant in the transportation and cycling of elements in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2069464029,"It is suggested that the plates along the arched back and tail of Stegosaurus served an important thermoregulatory function as forced convection ""fins."" Wind tunnel experiments on finned models, internal heat conduction calculations, and direct observations of the morphology and internal structure of stegosaur plates support this hypothesis, demonstrating the comparative effectiveness of the plates as heat dissipaters, controllable through input blood flow rate, temperature, and body orientation (with respect to wind)."
https://openalex.org/W2014277397,Estimates are given of the raw data that are the basis for the claims of excess power production by the electrochemical charging of palladium in deuterium oxide (D(2)O). Calorimetric results are also presented that show no anomalous power production in either 0.1M LiOD/D(2)O or 0.1M LiOH/H(2)O (LiOH is lithium hydroxide). Several possible sources of error in open-system calorimetry are discussed that can confound interpretation of temperature changes in terms of anomalous power production.
https://openalex.org/W1973438521,"Superconductivity is related to the presence of a narrow forbidden gap in the spectrum of the possible energies for the electrons in the material. These ""superconductivity gaps"" have traditionally been studied with tunneling and infrared absorption experiments. A third, powerful technique has been made possible by the discovery of hightransition temperature materials: the direct observation of the gap in photoemission spectra. The data analysis requires a careful reconsideration of the standard Einstein-Fermi model of the photoelectric effect. The conclusions are surprisingly simple and offer an alternate way to measure superconductivity gaps. This approach can also be used to study the directional properties of the gap, phenomena related to the coherence length, and possible departures from Fermi-liquid behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2067596796,"The June 1975 meteoroid storm detected on the moon by the Apollo seismometers was the largest ever observed. Reexamination of radio data taken at that time showed that the storm also produced pronounced disturbances on Earth, which were recorded as unique phase anomalies on very low frequency (VLF) radio propagation paths in the low terrestrial ionosphere. Persistent effects were observed for the major storm period (20 to 30 June 1975), including reductions in the diurnal phase variation, advances in the nighttime and daytime phase levels, and reductions in the sunset phase delay rate. Large nighttime phase advances, lasting a few hours, were detected on some days at all VLF transmissions, and for the shorter propagation path they were comparable to solar Lyman alpha daytime ionization. Ion production rates attributable to the meteor storm were estimated to be about 0.6 to 3.0 ions per centimeter cubed per second at the E and D regions, respectively. The storm was a sporadic one with a radiant (that is, the point of apparent origin in the sky) located in the Southern Hemisphere, with a right ascension 1 to 2 hours larger than the sun's right ascension."
https://openalex.org/W2083568124,"A single specimen of Pentremites rusticus (Echinodermata, Blastoidea) from the Early Pennsylvanian of Oklahoma has hundreds of apparent eggs in one of its abnormal anal hydrospire groups. This rare occurrence suggests that female blastoids in this sexually dimorphic species had modified their anal hydrospiresfor brooding eggs instead of for normal respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2021026763,"It is widely believed that an arms control limit on nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles would be nearly impossible to verify. Among the reasons usually given are: these weapons are small, built in nondistinctive industrial facilities, deployed on a variety of ships and submarines, and difficult to distinguish from their conventionally armed counterparts. In this article, it is argued that the covert production and deployment of nuclear-armed sealaunched cruise missiles would not be so straightforward. A specific arms control proposal is described, namely a total ban on nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles. This proposal is used to illustrate how an effective verification scheme might be constructed."

It is not possible to fit the coefficient of the free oscillation in the longitude of Ganymede, whose argument is l(3) - omega(4) (the mean longitude of Ganymede referred to the proper apse of Callisto), and the mass of Callisto derived from the path of Pioneer 10."
