https://openalex.org/W2018183560,"The transforming growth factor βs (TGF-βs) are a group of multifunctional growth factors that inhibit cell cycle progression in many cell types. The TGF-β-induced cell cycle arrest has been partially attributed to the regulatory effects of TGF-β on both the levels and activities of the G1 cyclins and their cyclin-dependent kinase partners. The ability of TGF-β to inhibit the activity of these kinase complexes derives in part from its regulatory effects on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21/WAF1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p15. Upon treatment of cells with TGF-β, these three inhibitors bind to and block the activities of specific cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes to cause cell cycle arrest. Little is known, however, on the mechanism through which TGF-β activates these cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. In the case of p21, TGF-β treatment leads to an increase in p21 mRNA. This increase in p21 mRNA is partly due to transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by TGF-β. To further define the signaling pathways through which TGF-β induces p21, we have performed a detailed functional analysis on the p21 promoter. Through both deletion and mutation analysis of the p21 promoter, we have defined a 10-base pair sequence that is required for the activation of the p21 promoter by TGF-β. In addition, this sequence is sufficient to drive TGF-β-mediated transcription from a previously nonresponsive promoter. Preliminary gel shift assays demonstrate that this TGF-β responsive element binds specifically to several proteins in vitro. Two of these proteins are the transcription factors Sp-1 and Sp-3. These studies represent the initial steps toward defining the signaling pathways involved in TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation of p21.

The inhibition of G1 cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity by TGF-β is mediated in part through several members of a recently described family of low molecular weight cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. These cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which include p21/WAF1/Cip1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2, p18, p16, and p15, physically associate with their target cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, or cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes to inhibit their activities (reviewed in (10Peter M.

The increase in p21 seen on TGF-β treatment is mediated, in part, through a transcriptional activation of the p21 promoter by TGF-β via a p53-independent mechanism(22Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F.

Although great strides have been made in understanding the mechanisms through which TGF-β inhibits the G1 cyclincyclin-dependent kinase complexes, the signaling pathways between the TGF-β receptor complex and these downstream targets remain unknown. The finding that TGF-β transcriptionally activates the p21 promoter opens an opportunity to study these signaling pathways. We describe here a detailed functional analysis of the p21 promoter as a first step in defining the pathway through which TGF-β activates p21 expression and causes cell cycle arrest. HaCaT cells were the gift of Dr. Baukamp and Dr. Fusenig(25Baukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). HaCaT were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in α-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The human p21 promoter construct, WWP-luc, was a gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein(15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). The 2.4-kilobase pair genomic fragment containing the p21 cDNA start site at its 3′ end was subcloned into the HindIII site of the luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-basic (Promega), to create p21P. To create p21PΔp53, p21P was digested with SacI and religated to remove approximately 250 bases from the 5′ end of the p21 promoter, including a p53 consensus site(15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T.

The deletion panel p21PΔ400 to p21PΔ2.3 was created using the exonuclease III based system, Erase-a-Base (Promega). The extent of 5′ deletion was determined by restriction site and sequence analysis. p21PSmaΔ1 was created by digesting p21P with SmaI and religation. p21PSma was created by cloning the 50-base pair SmaI fragment of the p21 promoter into p21PSmaΔ1, as shown in Fig. 1. p21PsmaΔ2 was created by performing a SmaI partial digest of p21P and religating. To created p21P 93-S, complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence between -49 and -93 of the p21 promoter, relative to the transcriptional initiation site(15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into the EcoRV site in the cloning vector pBSK+ (Stratagene). The resulting construct was digested with SmaI, and the 50-base pair SmaI fragment was then subcloned into p21PsmaΔ1. Mutagenesis of p21P 93-S was performed using the Muta-Gene M13 In Vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The oligonucleotides used in the mutagenesis reactions are as follows: p21P 93-S mut#1, CCTCAAGGAGGCGGGGTTTCTAGATATCGAATTCCTG; p21P 93-S mut#2, CCCGGGCCCGCCTCAGTTCTAGATAACCCGCGCTC; p21P 93-S mut#3, CCGCCCGCCCGGATTTCTAGAGAGGAGGCGGG; p21P 93-S mut#4, CCTGATATACAACCGTATTCTAGAAGCCCGCCTCAAGGCGGG; p21P 93-S mut#5, CAGCGCGGCCCTGACGCGTCTAGACCCCGCCCGG; p21P 93-S mut#6, GCTGGCGCAGCTCAGCATCTAGACAATATACAACCGCC; p21P 93-S mut#2.2, CCCGCCTCAAGGATCCGGGACCCGC; p21P 93-S mut#2.3, CCCGCCTCAAGCCGGCGGGACCCGCGCTC. The presence of the desired mutations was determined by sequence analysis. The DNA construct P1634, which contains a consensus TATA box and initiator sequence, was a gift from Dr. S. Smale(26Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The consensus TATA and INR sequences contained on a BglII-HindIII fragment were subcloned into pGL2-basic to create pGL2 T+I. pGL2 T+1 1 × TβRE, 2 × TβRE, and 4 × TβRE were created by first synthesizing complementary oligonucleotides representing the sequences in the p21 promoter between bases -71 and -86. These oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the EcoRV site of P1634. The BglII-HindIII fragment of the resulting construct was subcloned into pGL2-basic. The number and orientation of the inserts was determined by sequence analysis. HaCaT cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well in α-MEM and 10% fetal bovine serum and grown overnight. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of plasmid reporter construct using a standard DEAE-dextran transfection protocol(22Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). 4 h after transfection cells were incubated in α-MEM and 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 100 pM TGF-β1 for 20 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity in the lysates was assayed by integrating total light emission over 30 s using a Berthold luminometer. The luciferase activities were normalized based on protein concentrations. Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to bases -71 through -86 in the wild type p21 promoter and the mutant promoter constructs p21P93-S mut#2.2 and p21P93-S mut#2.3 were synthesized (71-86 wt, GGTCCCGCCTCCTTGA and TCAAGGAGGCGGGACC; 71-86 mut#2.2, GGTCCCGGATCCTTGA and TCAAGGATCCGGGACC; 71-86 mut#2.3, GGTCCCGCCGGCTTGA and TCAAGCCGGCGGGACC). 200 ng of these oligos were end-labeled with 200 μCi of γ-32P-labeled ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The resulting end-labeled oligos were then annealed and gel purified. Approximately 0.1 ng or 40,000 cpm of probe was used in each gel shift analysis. To prepare nuclear extracts, HaCaT cells were plated in 15-cm plates and grown to 50-75% confluency. Cells were then incubated in the presence or the absence of 100 pM TGF-β1 for 6 h. Cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanidate, and protease inhibitors). After 10 min, nuclei were spun down and incubated in 0.5-1.0 ml of nuclear extraction buffer for 20 min on ice (hypotonic lysis buffer and 500 mM NaCl). Supernatants were then clarified, and protein concentrations were determined. Binding reactions were performed at 4°C. 3 μl of nuclear extract (3-6 μg of protein) was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 11 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer to give a final salt concentration of 100 mM NaCl. Nonlabeled specific competitors were then added, and after a 5-min incubation, 40,000 cpm of radiolabeled probe was added. Binding reactions were resolved on a 0.5 × TBE, 5.5% acrylamide gel at 200 volts for 2 h at 4°C. The gels were subsequently dried, and autoradiography was performed. For Sp-1 and Sp-3 supershift assays, 2 μl of Sp-1 or Sp-3 specific polyclonal antibody (27Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) was added to the binding reaction prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. The first step in defining the signaling pathway through which TGF-β induces the expression of p21 is to determine the regions of the p21 promoter responsible for the transcriptional activation by TGF-β. To this end, a series of processive 5′ promoter deletion mutants, spaced at 300-400 base pairs, of the p21 promoter were created (Fig. 1). One additional deletion construct was created, p21PsmaΔ1, which contains only 61 base pairs proximal to the transcriptional initiation site. These constructs were transfected into HaCaT, a human kerotinocyte cell line that up-regulates p21 and is growth inhibited in response to TGF-β(22Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), and TGF-β-induced luciferase activity was measured. The full-length promoter construct, p21P, was activated 10-fold by TGF-β, whereas the minimal promoter construct, p21PsmaΔ1, was not induced by TGF-β. When the panel of deletion mutants were assayed, the region of the promoter responsible for induction by TGF-β was determined to be in a 150-base pair region near the transcriptional initiation site (Fig. 1). Using two convenient SmaI sites in this region, the deletion construct p21Psma was created, which contains the p21 promoter sequences from base -111 through the transcriptional initiation site (15El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). This construct was activated by TGF-β to a level similar to that of the full-length p21P, further defining the TGF-β responsive element to a 50-base pair region between -62 and -111. In addition to decreasing TGF-β-mediated activation of transcription, removal of this 50 base pair region also decreases basal promoter activity. When this 50-base pair region was removed from the full-length p21 promoter, the TGF-β-induced luciferase activity of the resulting construct, p21PSmaΔ2, was significantly less than that of the wild type promoter (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the 2.3-kilobase pair 5′ end of the p21 promoter proximal to the SmaI site at -111 is not required nor sufficient for induction of the promoter by TGF-β. Finally, the construct p21P 93-S, which contains the promoter sequences between -62 and -93, was activated by TGF-β to a level similar to that of the wild type promoter (Fig. 2). Thus, the TGF-β responsive element is harbored in a 32-base pair region between -93 and -62. To precisely define the regions of the p21 promoter necessary for induction by TGF-β, a serial site-directed mutagenesis of the p21 promoter between bases -93 and -34 was performed. Six mutant promoter constructs were created, each containing 10 consecutive mutated bases (Fig. 2). These mutants, which spanned the 60-base pair stretch between -93 and -34 in the promoter construct p21P 93-S (Fig. 2), were transfected into HaCaT, and TGF-β-induced luciferase was activity measured. All the mutant constructs p21P 93-S mut#2-6 had a decreased basal promoter activity in the absence of TGF-β. p21P 93-S mut#3, mut#5, and mut#6, however, retained the ability to be induced by TGF-β in a manner similar to that of the wild type promoter construct p21P 93-S. Only one of these constructs, p21P 93-S mut#2, had completely lost the ability to be activated by TGF-β (Fig. 2). p21P 93-S mut#4 had a reduced ability to be activated by TGF-β, but it was consistently induced 2.5-3.5-fold on TGF-β treatment. From these studies we concluded that the sequences of the p21 promoter between -74 and -83 are essential for activation by TGF-β. The promoter sequence between -54 and -63 may also play an important role in induction by TGF-β, because mutation of this region decreases both the ability of the promoter to be induced by TGF-β and basal promoter activity. The effect of mutations in this region, however, is less dramatic than mutation of the sequences between -74 and -83. For this reason, further studies were performed on the sequences between -74 and -83. To more precisely map this specific region of the p21 promoter, two additional mutant constructs were created. p21P 93-S mut#2.2 has a mutation of bases -78 and -79 from CC to AG, and p21P 93-S mut#2.3 has a mutation of bases -76 and -77 from CT to GG (Fig. 2). These two mutant constructs have a significantly reduced ability to be activated by TGF-β (Fig. 2). Not only do these mutations provide insight into the bases that are essential in binding the factors driving TGF-β-mediated transcription, but they serve as a useful control in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) studies described below. To determine if the region of p21 promoter defined above is sufficient for induction by TGF-β, the sequences between -71 and -86 were used in an attempt to confer TGF-β inducibility to a nonresponsive promoter. A luciferase construct containing a consensus TATA box and initiator sequence, pGL2 T+I, was nonresponsive to TGF-β (Fig. 3A). However, when one, two, or four copies of the p21 promoter sequence between -71 and -86 were inserted 5′ of the TATA box, this promoter became responsive to TGF-β (Fig. 3B). Thus, the sequence of this region of the p21 promoter is sufficient to confer TGF-β responsiveness to a previously nonresponsive promoter. This region has been termed a TGF-β responsive element (TβRE). Notably, the presence of this element also significantly increase the basal transcription activity, further supporting the conclusion from mutational analysis of the p21 promoter that the transcription factor(s) binding to this site may be involved in both TGF-β-mediated transcription and basal promoter activity (Fig. 2). To determine if any proteins could be detected that specifically interact with the TβRE sequence, EMSAs were performed with the wild type TβRE sequence and the mutant TβREs created in p21P 93-S mut2.2 and p21P 93-S mut2.3. Nuclear extracts were prepared from both TGF-β-treated and untreated HaCaT cells. Gel shift assays performed with these extracts and 32P end-labeled wild type TβRE probe revealed three specific bands of retarded mobility, TβRE-1, TβRE-2, and TβRE-3 (Fig. 4A). The binding of these retarded proteins could be competed away by an excess of unlabeled TβRE DNA (Fig. 4A). EMSA was next performed with mutant TβREs, which have dramatically reduced ability of being activated by TGF-β. A competition analysis of labeled wild type TβRE with an excess of unlabeled mutant TβREs revealed that the mutant TβREs were unable to compete for the binding of the retarded proteins (Fig. 4A). In addition, when the mutant TβREs were labeled and used in a gel shift analysis, no specific bands were seen (Fig. 4B). These analyses also revealed no change in the pattern or the intensity of the retarded bands when nuclear extract from either TGF-β-treated or untreated cells was used. As shown in Fig. 2, the region of the p21 promoter that is necessary and sufficient for induction of the p21 promoter by TGF-β contains a nearly consensus binding site for the transcription factor, Sp-1. To determine if any of the retarded bands on EMSA represent the binding of Sp-1 or Sp-3, a member of the Sp-1 family, gel shift assays were performed in the presence of specific anti-Sp-1 or anti-Sp-3 antibodies. These studies revealed that the retarded band, TβRE-1, consists of two distinct shifted complexes and is represented by the binding of Sp-1 and Sp-3, respectively. In the presence of Sp-1-specific antibodies, the top band in the TβRE-1 complex is supershifted, whereas the lower band is supershifted in the presence of Sp-3-specific antibodies (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, Sp-3-specific antibodies eliminated the binding of the TβRE-2 complex (Fig. 4C). This suggests that the lower bands of the TβRE-1 complex and the TβRE-2 complex represent the binding of proteins antigenically related to Sp-3. These possibly represent Sp-3 and a recently described alternatively translated product of the full-length Sp-3(28Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The TβRE-3 complex was not affected by Sp-1- or Sp-3-specific antibodies. To investigate the mechanism through which TGF-β induces the expression of p21, we have performed a detailed functional analysis of the p21 promoter. Through both deletion and mutation analysis, we have defined the sequences required for TGF-β-activated transcription and demonstrated that the sequences could confer TGF-β inducibility to a minimal basal promoter. We have termed this sequence a TβRE, TGF-β responsive element. EMSA with the wild type and mutant TβRE sequences and nuclear extracts from HaCaT revealed three specific bands of retarded mobility. The presence of these three retarded bands is correlated functionally with the ability of the TβRE to drive TGF-β-mediated transcription. No change in the pattern or intensity of the retarded bands was observed when nuclear extract from TGF-β-treated HaCaT was used. Thus, TGF-β is not activating transcription by increasing the binding of these proteins to the TβRE sequence. Consistent with this observation, the induction of p21 mRNA by TGF-β was not blocked by pretreatment of cells with cyclohexamide, a protein synthesis inhibitor (data not shown). Therefore, the factors responsible for the induction of p21 by TGF-β are likely to be pre-existing. These factors may become phosphorylated or interact with proteins that are modified or phosphorylated upon TGF-β treatment to activate transcription. Because the TGF-β-responsive site in the p21 promoter contains a nearly consensus Sp-1 binding site, we investigated whether the retarded bands on EMSA represent the binding of the transcription factor Sp-1 or other Sp-1 family members. Using Sp-1- and Sp-3-specific polyclonal antibodies, we were able to show that both Sp-1 and Sp-3 are capable of binding to the p21 TβRE sequence. This result alone does not demonstrate that Sp-1 and its family members are involved in TGF-β-mediated signal transduction. Other unidentified proteins, capable of binding to this sequence, may be responsible for TGF-β-activated transcription. An important role for Sp-1, however, is supported by our recent finding that TGF-β activates transcription from the promoter of the p15 gene, another TGF-β-activated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, through a consensus Sp-1 site(36Li J.-M.

Wang, submitted for publication.) In a previous study of the mouse α2 collagen promoter, an Sp-1 site was also found to be a critical component of the TGF-β-inducible element(29Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that a subset of TGF-β-inducible genes may contain a similar TGF-β responsive element that may be activated by TGF-β through Sp-1 or Sp-1-like factors capable of recognizing an Sp-1 consensus site. Although the functionally defined TβRE is capable of activating transcription by itself, the region of the p21 promoter between bases -54 and -63, which contains an Sp-1 binding site, also appears to play an important role in TGF-β-activated transcription. Mutations in this site reduce the TGF-β-mediated induction of the p21 promoter by half, in contrast to mutations in the TβRE Sp-1 site, which eliminates TGF-β-mediated induction. This suggests that these Sp-1 sites are functionally different. This may be due to differences in their spacing from the transcriptional initiation site or due to subtle base pair differences in their sequence. Sp-1 binding sites have been described in many promoters, and consequently Sp-1 has fallen into the stereotype of being a “house keeping” transcription factor, whose activity is necessary solely for the basal transcription of many genes. This simple model for Sp-1 was complicated by the identification of a number of Sp-1-related proteins (28Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 30Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

All of these Sp-1 family members are capable of interacting with a consensus Sp-1 site. Several family members are expressed in a cell type-specific manner(31Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I.

These findings suggest that the presence of an Sp-1 binding site is not simply to ensure adequate basal transcription but may serve as a site for the interplay of several differentially expressed transcription factors. Perhaps the most suggestive work demonstrating that Sp-1 may play an important role in regulated transcription is the demonstration that Sp-1 is a critical factor in regulating transcription mediated by the retinoblastoma protein, Rb. Several groups have shown that Rb overexpression can lead to the activation of a number of genes including c-Fos and TGF-β1(27Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34Kim S.-J. Lee H.-D. Robbins P.D. Busam K. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Proc.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The Rb control elements (RCEs) in these promoters have been defined and found to interact with Sp-1(27Udvadia A.J. Rogers K.T. Higgins P.D.R. Murata Y. Martin K.H. Humphrey P.A. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34Kim S.-J. Lee H.-D. Robbins P.D.

Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although no direct association between Rb and Sp-1 could be detected and no specific regulation through protein association or phosphorylation has been observed, the effect of Rb overexpression on this element is believed to be through Sp-1. Experiments have shown that the binding of Sp-1 alone is both necessary and sufficient for the ability of these Rb-responsive promoters to be activated by Rb(35Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A potential connection may be made between the TGF-β-responsive element defined here and the previously described RCE. Like the RCE, the p21 TβRE is capable of binding Sp-1. The p21 TβRE, therefore, may represent an RCE. By maintaining Rb in an hypophosphorylated state, TGF-β may be exerting its effects on the p21 promoter through Rb. Induction of p21 would in turn lead to a further increase in the hypophosphorylated form of Rb, thus establishing a positive feedback loop between p21 and Rb, ensuring an effective G1 cell cycle arrest. It should be noted that although the model of positive feedback is attractive, it remains to be determined if the TβRE in the p21 promoter can function as the previously described RCEs.

Purified human β2 adrenergic receptor was covalently labeled with the cysteine-reactive, fluorescent probe N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′ - (7 - nitrobenz -2 - oxa -1,3diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD). IANBD is characterized by a fluorescence which is highly sensitive to the polarity of its environment. We found that the full agonist, isoproterenol, elicited a stereoselective and dose-dependent decrease in fluorescence from IANBD-labeled β2 receptor. The change in fluorescence could be plotted against the concentration of isoproterenol as a simple hyperbolic binding isotherm demonstrating interaction with a single binding site in the receptor. The ability of several adrenergic antagonists to reverse the response confirmed that this binding site is identical to the well described binding site in the β2 receptor. Comparison of the response to isoproterenol with a series of adrenergic agonists, having different biological efficacies, revealed a linear correlation between biological efficacy and the change in fluorescence. This suggests that the agonist-mediated decrease in fluorescence from IANBD-labeled β2 receptor is due to the same conformational change as involved in receptor activation and G protein coupling. In contrast to agonists, negative antagonists induced a small but significant increase in base-line fluorescence. Despite the small amplitude of this response, it supports the notion that antagonists by themselves may alter receptor structure. In conclusion, our data provide the first direct evidence for ligand-specific conformational changes occurring in a G protein-coupled receptor. Furthermore, the data demonstrate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool for further delineating the molecular mechanisms of drug action at G protein-coupled receptors.

Furthermore, the data demonstrate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool for further delineating the molecular mechanisms of drug action at G protein-coupled receptors. The β2 adrenergic receptor is a prototype member of the G protein-coupled receptor family(1Hein L. Kobilka B.K. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The receptor family constitutes the largest group of plasma membrane receptors, which are characterized by a remarkable diversity in the chemical structure of their endogenous ligands(1Hein L. Kobilka B.K. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,2Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem.

The receptors are all believed to share a common topology with seven α-helical, transmembrane segments; however, the helical arrangement and actual three-dimensional structure of the receptors remain unknown(1Hein L. Kobilka B.K. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,2Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem.

Mutagenesis studies in the β2 adrenergic receptor as well as in many other G protein-coupled receptors have been able to assign distinct receptor functions, such as ligand binding and G protein coupling, to specific receptor domains(1Hein L. Kobilka B.K. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,2Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem.

Several molecular models of these receptors have also been generated based on the structure of bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin for which more detailed structural information is available(3Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,4Hibert M.F. Trumppkallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoffman J.I.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar,5Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, very little is known about the molecular events and structural changes in the receptor that provide the important link between ligand binding and transmission of the signal across the membrane. Drugs acting at G protein-coupled receptors are traditionally classified in biological assays as either full agonists, which elicit the maximal response, as partial agonists, which only elicit a fractional response, or as antagonists, which block the response induced by agonists(6Jasper J.R. Insel P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,7Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, recent data have suggested that antagonists should be subclassified into at least two categories: neutral antagonists, which have no effect on basal receptor activity, and negative antagonists (also referred to as inverse agonists), which inhibit basal receptor activity occurring in the absence of agonist (7Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 10-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,8Schutz W. Freissmuth M. Trends Pharmacol.

Johnson T.D. Milano C.A. Rockman H.A. McMinn T.R. Apparsundaram S. Hyek M.F. Kenakin T.P. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J.

However, the structural basis for the biological classification of drug action at G protein-coupled receptors is not yet known. Any direct evidence for the existence of discrete ligand-specific conformational states of G protein-coupled receptors has not been obtained. To date, the conformational state of G protein-coupled receptors has been assessed only by indirect methods, such as the effect of receptor conformation on G protein GTPase activity or on the activity of the effector enzymes. In the present study we have developed a fluorescence spectroscopy approach to directly monitor ligand-induced conformational changes in a G protein-coupled receptor. Our approach takes advantage of the sensitivity of many fluorescent molecules to the polarity of their molecular environment(14Cerione R.A. Method. Enzymol. 1994; 237: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,15Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Dunn S.M.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fluorescent labels incorporated into proteins can therefore often be used as sensitive indicators of conformational changes and of protein-protein interactions that cause changes in polarity of the environment surrounding the probe(14Cerione R.A. Method. Enzymol. 1994; 237: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,15Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Dunn S.M.J. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8608-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,17Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To accomplish these experiments, we expressed the human β2 adrenergic receptor in SF-9 insect cells and established a purification procedure, which allowed us to obtain the required amount of pure protein for the spectroscopy analysis. The purified receptor was labeled with the cysteine-specific and environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD).( (1)The abbreviations used are: IANBDN,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamineDβMn-dodecyl β-D-maltoside.) We found that binding of full agonists and strong partial agonists to the fluorescently labeled β2 adrenergic receptor produced a stereospecific, dose-dependent, and reversible decrease in fluorescence emission, which is not observed in response to weaker partial agonists or in response to neutral or negative antagonists. The magnitude of the response correlated with agonist efficacy, suggesting that this change in fluorescence emission is due to the same conformational change as involved in agonist activation of the receptor. N,N′-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside. DNA sequences encoding the human β2 adrenergic receptor, epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with the cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal-sequence followed by the “FLAG”-epitope (IBI, New Haven, CT), and tagged at the carboxyl terminus with six histidines, were cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and expressed in SF-9 insect cells according to previously described methods(18Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification, the cells were grown in 1000-ml cultures in SF 900 II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum (Gemini, Calabasas, CA) and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were routinely infected with a 1:30-40 dilution of a high titer virus stock at a density of 6-8 × 106 cells/ml and harvested after 48 h. Cell pellets were kept at -70°C until used for purification. The receptor was purified to homogeneity using a three-step purification procedure as described elsewhere(19Kobilka B.K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lysed cell membranes were solubilized in 0.8% n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DβM) (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA) followed by Ni-column chromatography using chelating Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The eluate from the Ni-column was further purified on an M1 anti-FLAG antibody column (IBI) and finally by alprenolol-affinity chromatography. This procedure ensured that only noncleaved and functional protein was purified. Approximately 5 nmol of pure protein generally could be obtained from a 1000-1500-ml culture. Purified β2 receptor (1-1.5 nmol) was labeled with 10-15-fold molar excess of IANBD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (150 μM) in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer (20 mM Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.05% DβM). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and was quenched by addition of 1 mM cysteine. Cysteine-reacted dye was removed by desalting on a Sephadex G50 gel filtration column (0.5 cm × 9 cm) followed by concentrating the resulting sample to 100 μl using a Centricon-30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The labeled protein was diluted approximately 100-fold in buffer for the fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence in control samples without receptor or with receptor incubated with cysteine-reacted IANBD was negligible (Fig. 1b). The stoichiometry of the labeling was determined by measuring absorption at 481 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 21,000 M-1 cm-1 for IANBD and a molecular mass of 50,000 Da for the β2 receptor. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The labeling procedure resulted in incorporation of 1.2 ± 0.16 mol of IANBD per mol of receptor (mean ± S.E., n = 7). Binding assays on solubilized and purified β2 receptor were performed using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as radioligand (Amersham Corp.). To routinely assess total amount of receptor, solubilized and purified β2 receptor was incubated with 10 nM [3H]dihydroalprenolol in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer (20 mM Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.05% DβM) for 1 h. In competition binding assays, unlabeled or IANBD-labeled purified receptor was incubated with 1.2 nM [3H]dihydroalprenolol in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer and indicated concentrations of alprenolol or isoproterenol for 1 h. The binding assay was stopped and free [3H]dihydroalprenolol separated from bound by desalting on Sephadex G50 columns (4 cm × 0.5 cm) using ice-cold buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in presence of 10 μM alprenolol. IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using Inplot 4.0 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Purified β2 receptor labeled with IANBD was analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204272) Google Scholar). Incorporated fluorophore was visualized by photographing the gel under UV light. The protein was visualized by standard Coomassie Blue staining. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed at room temperature on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer with photon counting mode using an excitation and emission bandpass of 4.2 nm. In emission scan experiments, 30-60 pmol of IANBD-labeled β2 receptor in 400 μl of buffer (20 mM Tris-buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.05% DβM) were used. Excitation was 481 nm, and emission measured from 490 to 625 nm with an integration time at 0.3 s/nm. Time course experiments were performed with 30-60 pmol of IANBD-labeled β2 receptor in 500 μl of buffer under constant stirring. Excitation was 481 nm, and emission was 523 nm. The volume of the ligands (or water) was always 1% of total volume, and fluorescence was corrected for this dilution in all experiments shown. Fluorescence quenching experiments were performed by sequential addition to the cuvette of potassium iodide (KI) from a freshly made 1 M stock containing 10 mM of Na2S2O3. The experiments were done with 50-60 pmol of receptor in an initial volume of 400 μl. After each addition of KI, the sample was thoroughly mixed, and fluorescence was recorded at 523 nm (excitation at 481 nm). To correct for dilution/ionic strength effects on fluorescence changes, 1 M KCl was added to control samples as described above for KI. The corrected data were plotted according to Stern-Volmer equation(21Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 131-135Google Scholar), Fo/F = 1 + KSV[KI], where Fo/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensity in the absence and presence of KI, and KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. All of the compounds tested had an absorbance of less than 0.01 at 481 and 523 nm in the concentrations used excluding any “inner filter” effect in the fluorescence experiments (data not shown). Membranes were prepared from SF-9 cells (30-ml cultures at a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml) infected with β2 receptor baculovirus for 24 h to obtain low receptor density (approximately 1.2 pmol/mg of protein) and 48 h to obtain high receptor density (approximately 7 pmol/mg of protein). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using 25 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml benzamidin. The lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 12.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM EDTA). Protein was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Adenylate cyclase in membranes was measured as described elsewhere(22Suryanarayana S. Kobilka B.K. Methods. 1991; 3: 193-204Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). IANBD is a highly fluorescent, cysteine-selective reagent(16Dunn S.M.J. Raftery M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8608-8615Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,17Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of IANBD increased as the polarity of the solvent decreased and was more than 10-fold stronger in 1-butanol and n-hexane than in aqueous buffer (Fig. 1a). There was a parallel blue-shift in the emission maximum from 540 nm in aqueous buffer to 530 nm in 1-butanol and 510 nm in n-hexane (Fig. 1a). Labeling of the β2 adrenergic receptor, purified from SF-9 insect cells, with IANBD at a stoichiometry of about 1.2 mol of IANBD per mol of receptor revealed a strong fluorescence signal with an emission maximum at 523 nm (Fig. 1b). The blue-shift in emission maximum, as compared to cysteine-reacted IANBD in aqueous buffer, indicated that the modified cysteine(s) are located in an environment that, on the average, is of lower polarity than 1-butanol but higher than n-hexane (Fig. 1b). This would likely involve labeling of one or more of the five cysteine residues that are located in the transmembrane, hydrophobic core of the receptor. This was also supported by the observation that denaturation of the labeled receptor with guanidinium chloride dramatically reduced emission around 80% and caused a 2-3-nm red-shift in the emission maximum (data not shown). The covalent modification of the receptor was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the labeled receptor, and the specificity of the labeling was verified by blocking the incorporation of IANBD with the cysteine-specific, nonfluorescent reagents, iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 1b, inset). The fluorescent labeling did not perturb the pharmacological properties of the receptor as illustrated inFig. 2. Thus, the agonist, isoproterenol, and the antagonist, alprenolol, inhibited [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to IANBD-labeled β2 receptor with IC50 values of 1.3 ± 0.5 μM (n = 3, mean ± S.E.) and 2.8 ± 0.6 nM (n = 3, mean ± S.E.), respectively, as compared to 0.8 ± 0.2 μM (n = 3, mean ± S.E.) and 2.9 ± 0.9 nM (n = 3, mean ± S.E.) for the unlabeled receptor. These data are in agreement with previous binding data on purified β2 receptor(23Benovic J.L. Shorr R.G.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Labeling of the β2 receptor with IANBD did not affect the total number of binding sites as assessed from binding assays using a saturating concentration of [3H]dihydroalprenolol (10 nM) (data not shown). Binding of the full agonist, isoproterenol, to IANBD-labeled β2 receptor caused a decrease in fluorescence intensity without detectable change in the wavelength at which maximal emission occurred (Fig. 3). The decrease was stereospecific as illustrated inFig. 3 by comparing the effect of 30 μM of the (-)-isomer of isoproterenol with 30 μM of the less active (+)-isomer. In addition, no response to isoproterenol was observed with IANBD-labeled receptor denatured in guanidinium chloride (data not shown). To investigate the kinetics of this agonist-mediated change, the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of time (Figure 4, Figure 5). Prior to adding ligand we observed a slight but constant decline in base-line fluorescence (Figure 4, Figure 5). This loss of fluorescence over time is likely due to factors such as bleaching and hydrolysis of the probe during the experiments. It is unlikely that this decline in fluorescence is due to denaturation of the protein, since a similar loss of fluorescence also was observed with labeled receptor that was intentionally denatured in guanidinium chloride (seeFig. 7d). It should also be noted that the decrease over time was unaffected by addition of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, or phospholipids to the cuvette (data not shown). The time course analysis showed that the response to isoproterenol was dose-dependent and reached a maximum amplitude below the extrapolated base line after 10-15 min (Fig. 4a). The relative change in fluorescence at t = 15 min following addition of isoproterenol could be plotted against the isoproterenol concentration and fitted to a simple hyperbolic function, describing a single binding site with a Kd of 29 μM (Fig. 4b). Similarly, the fluorescent change could be plotted against the logarithm of the isoproterenol concentration showing the best fit to a one-site sigmoid curve with an EC50 of 19 μM (Fig. 4c). The Kd value of 29 μM and the EC50 value of 19 μM for isoproterenol are higher than the binding constants observed using conventional radioligand binding techniques as shown inFig. 2(~1 μM). One explanation for this apparent discrepancy could be technical differences in the methods by which the binding constants were obtained (the fluorescence studies were done with more than 100-fold higher receptor concentrations (100 nM receptor) for 15 min). Although apparent maximal change in fluorescence was observed already after 15 min, full equilibrium may not have been reached. Unfortunately, the fluorescent change upon ligand binding cannot be reliably determined after 1 h of incubation due to magnification of base-line differences over a longer period of time. Another potential explanation for the difference in apparent KD values could be the incomplete labeling of the cysteine in the β2 receptor that is responsible for the agonist-induced response. The fraction of labeled receptors may exhibit a lowered agonist affinity in contrast to the fraction of receptors labeled at other sites. However, this explanation is inconsistent with our radioligand binding data, which detect only one agonist affinity site (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we do not observe a change in the total number of binding sites following labeling with IANBD. We also investigated whether the response seen following stimulation with isoproterenol could be reversed by addition of antagonist. As shown inFig. 5, the response to isoproterenol could be readily reversed by the active(-)-isomer of the antagonist propranolol but not by the less active (+)-isomer. The response to isoproterenol was similarly reversed by several other antagonists, including alprenolol, ICI 118,551, pindolol, and dichloroisoproterenol (data not shown). A series of adrenergic agonists were tested for their ability to affect fluorescence of IANBD-labeled β2 receptor. The efficacy of these compounds was determined by measuring adenylate cyclase activity in membranes from SF-9 cells expressing the β2 adrenergic receptor (Fig. 6b) and was found to be in agreement with previous studies(6Jasper J.R. Insel P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,11Chidiac P. Hebert T.E. Valiquette M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 490-499PubMed Google Scholar,24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full agonists, epinephrine and isoproterenol, which produced the largest increase in adenylate cyclase activity (Fig. 6b), also caused the largest decrease in fluorescence (5-6%) (Fig. 6a); whereas the relatively strong partial agonist salbutamol decreased fluorescence about 2.6% in agreement with a lower intrinsic activity in the adenylyl cyclase assay (Fig. 6b)(24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The weaker partial agonists, dobutamine and ephedrine, did not cause a decrease in fluorescence relative to the extrapolated base line but rather produced a slight increase (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, plotting percent change in base-line fluorescence induced by this series of adrenergic agonists versus percent change in basal adenylate cyclase activity revealed a linear correlation (squared correlation coefficient, r2 = 0.98) (Fig. 6c). We also examined the effect of a series of adrenergic antagonists on fluorescence intensity from IANBD-labeled receptor over time. Propranolol and ICI 118,551, which both have been described as negative antagonists(10Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 390-394PubMed Google Scholar,11Chidiac P. Hebert T.E. Valiquette M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 490-499PubMed Google Scholar,13Bond R.A. Leff P. Johnson T.D. Milano C.A. Rockman H.A. McMinn T.R. Apparsundaram S. Hyek M.F. Kenakin T.P. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), caused a relative increase in fluorescence intensity from IANBD-labeled β2 receptor followed by apparent stabilization of the rate at which fluorescence decreased over time (Fig. 7, a and b, and 8a). We did not observe any parallel change in the wavelength at which maximal emission occurred (data not shown). The response to propranolol was stereoselective since it was not elicited by the less active (+)-propranolol, indicating that the change must involve binding of propranolol to the receptor (Fig. 7a). This was also supported by the absence of response to propranolol and ICI 118,551 when they were exposed to denatured receptor (Fig. 7d). Alprenolol, pindolol, and dichloroproterenol, which in biological assays have been shown to exhibit either weak partial agonism, neutral antagonism or sometimes negative antagonism(6Jasper J.R. Insel P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,10Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol.

Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), induced a smaller but nevertheless reproducible increase in fluorescence (Fig. 7, b and c, and 8a). The fluorescent changes were compared with the ability of the antagonists to affect basal adenylate cyclase activity in SF-9 cell membranes. The effect of the antagonists on basal adenylate cyclase activity was evaluated in SF-9 cells expressing a high level of β2 receptor (approximately 7 pmol/mg of protein) which leads to an elevated receptor-mediated basal level of adenylate cyclase activity (Fig. 8b). In contrast, partial agonists were evaluated at a lower receptor density (approximately 1.2 pmol/mg of protein) (Fig. 6b), as partial agonists are difficult to differentiate from full agonists in the presence of a large receptor reserve(25Adham N. Ellerbrock B. Hartig P.H. Weinshank R.L. Branchek T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar). Alprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, dichloroisoproterenol, or ICI 118,551 did not affect basal adenylate cyclase activity at the low receptor density (data not shown). However, ICI 118,551 and propranolol, which induced the largest increase in fluorescence, potently decreased basal adenylate cyclase activity 40-60% at the high receptor density (Fig. 8b). Alprenolol and pindolol induced an approximately 30% decrease in basal activity, whereas dichloroisoproterenol revealed weak agonist activity at this high receptor density by increasing activity about 30%. The agonist-induced decrease in fluorescence of IANBD-labeled β2 receptor could be due to changes in the receptor structure that increase the exposure of one or more labeled cysteines to the aqueous solvent. Therefore, we investigated whether the fluorescent change was accompanied by greater accessibility of the aqueous quencher potassium iodide to the incorporated probe. Importantly, KI did not affect ligand binding to the receptor in a concentration up to 250 mM (data not shown). A strong quenching of fluorescence from IANBD-labeled β2 receptor was observed following addition of increasing concentrations of KI (Fig. 9). Stern-Volmer plots showed that the negative antagonists ICI 118,551 did not affect this quenching with the quenching constant KSV = 4.477 ± 0.074 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) in absence of any ligand and KSV = 4.436 ± 0.073 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) in presence of ICI 118,551 (Fig. 9). However, the presence of isoproterenol unexpectedly caused slightly less quenching as compared to buffer and ICI 118,551 (KSV = 4.209 ± 0.036, mean ± S.E., n = 3). The difference was significant with p < 0.05 both when comparing isoproterenol with buffer and isoproterenol with ICI 118,551 (unpaired t test). In the present study we have been able to directly monitor conformational changes in a G protein-coupled receptor. As a molecular reporter we have used the cysteine-selective and environmentally sensitive, fluorescent probe, IANBD, which can be covalently incorporated into the purified, human β2 adrenergic receptor without perturbing the pharmacological properties of the receptor. Using the IANBD-labeled protein we were able to detect an agonist specific and reversible decrease in fluorescence emission from the labeled receptor protein. The response to the full agonist, isoproterenol, was shown to be dose-dependent and could be plotted as a simple, hyperbolic binding isotherm demonstrating interaction with a single binding site in the receptor. The ability of several adrenergic antagonists to reverse the isoproterenol-induced response confirmed that this binding site must be identical to the well described ligand binding site in the β2 receptor. These data provide structural evidence in a pure system for the existence of ligand-specific conformational states of a G protein-coupled receptor. The agonist induced change most likely represents changes in the polarity of the environment surrounding one of more labeled cysteines in the hydrophobic core of the protein. Two possible mechanisms that could account for these changes are outlined inFig. 10. According to the first model, a change in the environment around the indicated fluorophore (F) could be the result of a ligand induced movement of a transmembrane segment perpendicular to the plane of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 10a). This could result in the exposure of the fluorophore to the solvent causing quenching of the fluorescence and thus a decrease in the net fluorescence from the labeled receptor. Alternatively, it could be imagined that the agonist could induce a rotation of the membrane spanning domain resulting in movement of the fluorophore into the core of the protein, which is predicted to be more polar (Fig. 10b)(3Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,4Hibert M.F. Trumppkallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoffman J.I.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar,5Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). According to the first model, the fluorophore should be more accessible to an aqueous quencher like potassium iodide following agonist binding. However, we observed that the agonist isoproterenol caused a slight decrease in quenching of the fluorescence from the IANBD-labeled receptor (Fig. 9). This would favor the latter model in which the fluorophore is moved to a more hydrophilic pocket in the core of the protein following agonist binding. In this model aqueous quenchers might be expected to have a more limited access to the fluorophore. It should be noted that at this point we can only speculate on the molecular mechanism behind the ligand-induced changes in fluorescence. With a stoichiometry of labeling at 1.2 mol of IANBD per mol of receptor at least two sites are being labeled in the receptor. Thus, the isoproterenol-mediated decrease in fluorescence may involve a different labeled cysteine than that responsible for the isoproterenol-induced effect on KI quenching. The observed changes may therefore be due to a more complex mechanism than that illustrated inFig. 10. Our fluorescence data suggest that the β2 receptor can exist in at least two conformational states, an unliganded state and an agonist-bound state. It is therefore tempting to consider these data in the context of the prevailing two-state model for activation of G protein-coupled receptors. This model predicts that the receptors exist in a dynamic equilibrium between two states, an inactive (R) and active conformation (R*); and that the biological response to a given ligand is governed by its intrinsic ability to change the overall equilibrium between the two states(8Schutz W.

According to this model the fluorescence properties of the unoccupied IANBD-labeled receptor would be expected to represent the average fluorescence properties of the population of β2 receptors in the inactive state (R) and the active state (R*). The fluorescent properties of the R state alone should be observed in the presence of a negative antagonist, while those of the R* state alone should be observed in the presence of a full agonist(8Schutz W.

Using our fluorescence assay we compared a series of adrenergic agonists, which exhibited distinct efficacies in a biological assay (Fig. 5b). We found an apparent linear correlation between the functional efficacy of these compounds and their ability to promote a change in fluorescence from the labeled receptor (Fig. 5c). These data can be interpreted in agreement with the two-state model. Hence, the different functional efficacies may result from differences in the ability of the different agonists to pull the equilibrium toward R* and thus decrease the fluorescence signal. Alternatively, the data also could support a multistate model in which the biological efficacy of an agonist may be a consequence of the magnitude of conformational change that it induces in the receptor, rather than just affecting the equilibrium between only two states. We should note, however, that without analyzing the fluorescently labeled receptor in a reconstituted system together with the corresponding G protein, we cannot exclude the possibility that the agonist-mediated change in fluorescence does not describe the structural changes of direct importance for G protein activation. Nevertheless, the correlation between intrinsic activity of the agonists and change in fluorescence suggests that the change is actually describing the conformational change in the receptor that leads to G protein activation. It has been suggested, but never structurally verified, that antagonists may stabilize a conformation of the receptor that is distinct from unliganded receptor, and thus from the R state in the two-state model(11Chidiac P.

For example, this has been proposed to explain the unexpected observation that non-peptide antagonists of G protein-coupled peptide receptors can act as competitive antagonists for agonist peptides without sharing apparent binding sites in the receptor(28Gether U.

In other words, agonists and antagonists may be able to mutually exclude each others binding to the receptor by stabilizing different receptor conformations(28Gether U. Johansen T.E. Snider R.M. Lowe J.A. Nakanishi S. Schwartz T.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,29Schambye H.T. Hjorth S.A. Bergsma D. Sathe G. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was therefore intriguing to observe that a series of adrenergic antagonists produced small but very reproducible increases in base-line fluorescence from the IANBD-labeled β2 receptor (Figure 7, Figure 8). Except in the case of dichloroisoproterenol, the changes showed a correlation with the negative intrinsic activity of the tested compounds. Thus, propranolol and ICI 188,551, which exhibited the strongest negative intrinsic activity, caused the largest increase in base-line fluorescence, whereas alprenolol and pindolol with a smaller negative intrinsic activity also caused a smaller increase in fluorescence. However, given the small size of responses observed following stimulation with this group of compounds, it is difficult to assess the molecular significance of the fluorescence changes at the present stage. Nevertheless, the data are still of interest as they suggest that antagonists by themselves may alter receptor structure. The findings are also consistent with previous proteolysis studies on membrane bound receptor which show that agonists and antagonists are equivalent in protecting the β2 receptor from proteolysis(33Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would not be expected if antagonists only changed the conformation of the small percentage of the receptor population which, in the absence of ligand, would be predicted to be in R* according to the two-state model. Summarized, our data demonstrate the sensitivity of using fluorescence techniques for studying ligand-receptor interactions and their potential for delineating ligand-induced structural changes in G protein-coupled receptors. Importantly, if site-specific fluorescent labeling of the β2 receptor can be achieved, the approach may be useful for mapping conformational changes in the receptor structure to specific subdomains. In this way it should be possible to more precisely define the molecular mechanism of transmembrane signal transduction in G protein-coupled receptors. We thank Drs. Tae R.

In addition to their roles in inflammatory and pathological processes, increasing evidence suggests that ROS may function as second messengers in cytokine (interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor α) and some growth factor signal transduction pathways that regulate transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1 (5Pahl H.L.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is released by activated platelets and is thought to be responsible for much of the activity in serum that promotes cell growth and adhesion(7Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R.

LPA elicits its biological responses through a putative receptor that is coupled to heterotrimeric G-proteins(9van der Bend R.L. Brunner J. Jalink K van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Several proximal signaling events are known to be evoked by LPA, including phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization, release of arachidonic acid, inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation(10van Corven E.J.

LPA rapidly activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway(11Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol.

MAP kinases are serine/threonine-protein kinases regulated by dual tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation.

The 42-kDa MAP kinase (p42mapk) also called extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)) and 44-kDa MAP kinase (p44mapk, ERK1) are phosphorylated and activated by highly specific MAP kinase kinase 1 and MAP kinase kinase 2 (MKK1/2) (18Wu J.

For simplicity, p42mapk and p44mapk will be referred to as MAP kinase in this report. MAP kinase has been shown to play a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation(19Cowly S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the LPA-induced MAP kinase activation is sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition, indicating a critical role of a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi-protein(11Hordijk P.L.

However, these data did not exclude the contribution of other signaling events to the LPA-induced MAP kinase activation. LPA triggers a biphasic arachidonic acid release in HeLa cells. ( 2Q. Chen and J. Wu, unpublished data.) The first phase of the LPA-induced arachidonic acid release precedes the activation of MAP kinase kinase.2 Arachidonic acid is known to give rise to ROS through its subsequent metabolism (20Coyle J.T. Puttfarcken P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar) and activation of NADPH oxidase(21Rubinek T. Levy R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), prompting us to investigate the possible involvement of ROS in the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase activation pathway. We present evidence here that demonstrates the involvement of ROS in the LPA-induced MAP kinase signaling pathway. N-Acetylcysteine was from Fluka. H2O2 was from Fisher Scientific. Lysophosphatidic acid (1-oleoyl), aminotriazole, and fatty acid- and globulin-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from Sigma. Dihydrorhodamine 123 was from Molecular Probes. The kinase-defective mutant of p42mapk (K52R) was prepared as described previously (22Wu J. Rossomando A.J. Her J.-H. Del Vecchio R. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9508-9512Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 7% CO2. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 18-20 h in phenol red-free DMEM containing 25 mM Hepes and 0.1% BSA (fatty acid- and globulin-free). Serum-starved cells were washed twice with DMEM (phenol red-free, plus 25 mM Hepes) and incubated in DMEM (phenol red-free, plus 25 mM Hepes) for 90 min before use. Total activity of MAP kinase kinase 1 and MAP kinase kinase 2 (MKK1/2) was determined by the following procedure, modified from that described previously(23Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). After stimulation, cells were chilled on ice and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Each 6-cm plate of cells was lysed in 0.6 ml of cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris acetate, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mM sodium orthovanade, 20 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5 at 25°C). Cell lysates were centrifuged (4°C) at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations of cell lysate supernatants were determined. Equal portions (2 μg of protein) of cell lysate supernatants were mixed with KR kinase assay mixture (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 40 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol), and 2.5 μg of K52R). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 12 min or as indicated in the figure legends. The kinase reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and heat denaturation. Phosphorylation of K52R was analyzed by autoradiography and phosphoimaging after electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Intracellular levels of H2O2 were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using dihydrorhodamine 123 as a probe(6Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 24Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed under dim light. Confluent, serum-deprived HeLa cells were incubated in DMEM (phenol red-free, plus 25 mM Hepes) containing 10 μM dihydrorhodamine 123 for 20 min. Cells were treated with aminotriazole (50 mM), LPA (40 μM), or BSA, then chilled on ice and washed with cold PBS. Washed cells were detached from culture plates by trypsin digestion. The activity of trypsin was quenched with 0.05% BSA (fatty acid- and globulin-free) in PBS. Following PBS wash, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. The fluorescence intensities of rhodamine 123 of 10,000 cells from each sample were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer equipped with an air-cooled argon laser (Becton Dickinson). In all cell types examined, p42mapk is specifically phosphorylated and activated by dual specificity MKK1 and MKK2 (MKK1/2). Total activity of MKK1/2 in the cells represents a valid measurement for the activation state of the MAP kinase pathway in the rapid activation phase(14Wu J. Spiegel S Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, LPA and EGF markedly stimulated the MKK1/2 activity in HeLa cells. To test for the possible involvement of ROS in MKK1/2 activation induced by LPA, we examined the effect of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine on MKK1/2 activation. N-Acetylcysteine directly scavenges ROS and also increases the intracellular levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH is a hydroxyl radical scavenger and a substrate of glutathione peroxidase which degrades H2O2. N-Acetylcysteine has been used extensively to study the role of ROS in signaling pathways(6Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 25Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). An inhibition by N-acetylcysteine can be taken as an indication of the involvement of ROS. The LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity was inhibited by 82 ± 4% (average of two experiments ± range) in cells pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (30 mM), suggesting that ROS are involved in the LPA-induced MKK1/2 activation (Fig. 1). A similar result was obtained in Rat-1 cells. A lesser, but statistically significant, attenuation (38 ± 8% in two experiments) by N-acetylcysteine of the EGF-stimulated MKK1/2 activity was also observed (Fig. 1), but was not investigated further in the current study. To verify that the inhibitory effect of N-acetylcysteine is attributable to its ability to scavenge ROS, we examined the effects of two other ROS scavengers, dimethyl sulfoxide and ascorbic acid, on the LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity. Dimethyl sulfoxide is an effective hydroxyl radical scavenger(28Basu-Modak S. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4505-4510PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbic acid blocks free radical chain reaction, but may also directly remove hydroxyl radical(29Gotz M.E. Kunig G. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 63: 37-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were pretreated with ascorbic acid (100 μM, 60 min) or dimethyl sulfoxide (4%, 20 min) and stimulated with LPA (10 μM, 5 min). The LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity was inhibited by 88 ± 7% by dimethyl sulfoxide and 38 ± 1% by ascorbic acid. If ROS are the signaling molecules that mediate the LPA-induced MKK1/2 activation, then an increase in intracellular concentrations of ROS would be expected to mimic the effect of LPA on MKK1/2 activation. H2O2 is the product of superoxide dismutases and several oxidases in the cells. Thus, cells that produce superoxide would also generate H2O2. In contrast to superoxide, H2O2 can diffuse across the membrane and give rise to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. H2O2 has been widely used to assess the role of ROS in cells. To test whether H2O2 directly added to the cells can activate MKK1/2, HeLa cells were treated with 0.1-4 mM H2O2 for 5 min or with 1 mM H2O2 for 2.5-30 min, and the MKK1/2 activity was determined. Fig. 2 shows that H2O2 caused a concentration- and time-dependent activation of MKK1/2 in HeLa cells. Thus, H2O2 alone is sufficient to induce MKK1/2 activation. The maximal activity of MKK1/2 induced by H2O2 in HeLa cells was detected approximately 5 min after treatment. Thus, the kinetics of H2O2 induction is similar to that of MKK1/2 activation induced by phospholipids and growth factors(13Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30Wu J. Lau L. Sturgill T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, 2 mM H2O2, a concentration of H2O2 that cannot be achieved in HeLa cells by LPA (data not shown), is required to induce MKK1/2 activation to a similar magnitude (approximately 20-fold) as 20 μM LPA. Several possibilities exist that may account for the requirement of high concentrations of H2O2. First, the LPA-induced ROS may be generated at a site that is more proximal to the target, whereas the external added H2O2 diffuses indiscriminately. Second, HeLa cells may contain relatively high catalase activity, and, thus, high concentrations of H2O2 are required to offset the catalase activity. In fact, inhibition of catalase by preincubation of HeLa cells with catalase inhibitor aminotriazole (26Fialkow L. Chan C.K Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prior to the addition of H2O2 resulted in a marked shift of the H2O2 dose-response curve to the left (Fig. 2A). However, even in the presence of aminotriazole, greater than 0.5 mM H2O2 was still required to activate MKK1/2 to a similar extent as that induced by 20 μM LPA. Finally, it is likely that one or more signaling events besides production of ROS are critical for the induction of MKK1/2 activation by LPA, and ROS may function as only one of the parallel signaling intermediates. Thus, although H2O2 alone at low concentrations (<0.5 mM) has a marginal effect on MKK1/2 activation, H2O2 and the derived radicals may have a greater effect in the presence of other LPA-induced signaling intermediates because of synergism. To further confirm the involvement of ROS, we treated HeLa cells with or without the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole prior to LPA stimulation. If ROS participate in the LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activation pathway, inhibition of catalase would potentially augment the response to LPA. A 4.5-fold increase in H2O2-induced MKK1/2 activity was observed when HeLa cells were pretreated with aminotriazole (50 mM, 60 min), demonstrating the effectiveness of the catalase inhibitor (Fig. 3, see also Fig. 2A). In cells pretreated with aminotriazole, the LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity was 1.9-fold that of cells without aminotriazole pretreatment (36.3- and 18.8-fold above basal, respectively) (Fig. 3). Thus, decreasing the catalase activity effectively enhances the cellular response to LPA, indicating the involvement of ROS. For ROS to fulfill the role of signaling intermediates for LPA, LPA must be able to induce the production of ROS. As described above, LPA rapidly liberates arachidonic acid in HeLa cells. Arachidonic acid is known to generate ROS. Tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1, both of which are known to utilize ROS as signaling intermediates, also stimulate the release of arachidonic acid(31Rizzo M.T. Boswell H.S. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar). However, other routes of ROS generation are not excluded. We measured the relative concentrations of H2O2 in HeLa cells using dihydrorhodamine 123 and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)(6Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 24Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Dihydrorhodamine 123 is oxidized to membrane-impermeable, fluorescent rhodamine 123 in the presence of H2O2 and possibly ROS derived from it(24Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). To minimize the loss of H2O2, aminotriazole was also added to the media. Incubation of HeLa cells with aminotriazole resulted in a time-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4 and data not shown). A small increase of the fluorescence intensity induced by LPA was detectable at the earliest time (5 min) examined, but more consistent data were obtained if cells were stimulated for 10 min. In two duplicated experiments, cells treated for 10 min with aminotriazole (50 mM) plus BSA had an average 25% increase in mean fluorescence intensity of rhodamine 123 compared with BSA-treated cells (Fig. 4). An additional 22% increase in mean fluorescence intensity was detected in cells treated for 10 min with LPA (30 μM) plus aminotriazole (50 mM) (Fig. 4). Thus, LPA is capable of generating ROS in HeLa cells. In summary, data presented in this study show that ROS are involved in the LPA-induced MAP kinase kinase activation and LPA can stimulate the production of ROS in HeLa cells. Additional experiments using a p42mapk immune complex kinase assay (14Wu J. Spiegel S Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) showed that N-acetylcysteine partially inhibited the LPA-stimulated p42mapk activation, H2O2 stimulated p42mapk activity in HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells, and aminotriazole enhanced the effect of LPA on p42mapk activation (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that ROS are involved in the tumor necrosis factor α-stimulated NF-κB activity (5Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and the basic fibroblast growth factor-induced c-fos expression(6Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Other data that we have obtained showed that N-acetylcysteine also inhibited the LPA-stimulated NF-κB and AP-1 DNA binding activities in HeLa cells. ( 3N. Olashaw and J. Wu, unpublished data.) Thus, ROS appear to function as signaling intermediates of LPA and mediate a branch of the LPA signaling pathways. Our findings lend support to the emerging concept that ROS can function as physiological signaling intermediates. It will be interesting to examine whether ROS also participate in the signaling pathways of other phospholipids, such as platelet-activating factor (32Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoch Y. Nishida E. Ito N. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sphingosine 1-phosphate(33Spiegel S. Olivera A. Carlson R.O. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 105-129PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, further investigation of the mechanisms by which LPA increases the intracellular levels of ROS and ROS relay the cellular regulatory signals is warranted. We thank Christine O'Connell for the FACS analysis and Drs. Warren J. Pledger and W. Douglas Cress for critical reading of the manuscript."

In vitro, interleukin-1β and interferon-γ increased osteopontin mRNA levels in CMEC as well as NOS2 expression in both CMEC and cardiac myocytes. However, osteopontin mRNA levels in heart muscle in vivo, and in cardiac myocytes and CMEC in vitro, also are increased 10-30-fold by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, an agent that suppresses cytokine induction of NOS2 in both cell types. The hexapeptide GRGDSP, which interrupts binding of RGD-containing proteins to cell surface integrins, increased NOS2 mRNA, while a synthetic osteopontin peptide analogue decreased NOS2 mRNA and protein levels in both cytokine-pretreated cardiac myocytes and CMEC cultures. Also, transfection with a full-length antisense-osteopontin cDNA in cytokine-pretreated CMEC decreased endogenous osteopontin mRNA and increased NOS2 mRNA levels.

Unless the expression and activity of NOS2 are spatially and temporally regulated, NO and other highly reactive nitrogen oxide radicals can induce nonspecific cellular toxicity that may contribute to the death of the organism(11Schmidt H.H.H.

The regulation of NOS2 activity in most tissues is primarily at the transcriptional level, although post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms have been described(12Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar,14Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to interrupting selected components of the immune response that trigger NOS2 induction, glucocorticoids have been shown to suppress NOS2 activity. In ventricular myocytes and CMEC exposed to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), for example, pretreatment with dexamethasone decreases NOS2 mRNA and protein abundance(4Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Kobzik L. Lowenstein C.J. Lamas S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1293-H1303PubMed Google Scholar,5Balligand J.-L.

Other agents have also been shown to regulate the extent of induction of NOS2 by inflammatory mediators. Among these is osteopontin, a relatively ubiquitous extracellular matrix phosphoprotein that contains an RGD integrin-binding motif. Its function appears to be determined by the specific tissue and cell type from which it is secreted(15Butter W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar,16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Hwang et al.(17Hwang S. Lopez C.A. Heck D.E. Gardner C.R. Laskin D.L. Laskin J.D. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol.

It was unclear, however, what regulated endogenous production and secretion of osteopontin in these cells. Within the heart, it is not known which cell types express osteopontin nor what role, if any, osteopontin could have in the regulation of NOS2 expression in cardiac cells. In this report, we demonstrate that CMEC and ventricular myocytes constitutively express osteopontin mRNA in vivo and in primary culture, and that dexamethasone markedly increases osteopontin mRNA and secretion by both cell types. The data suggest that the suppression of NOS2 by glucocorticoids in both ventricular myocytes and in CMEC could be mediated in part by this multifunctional extracellular matrix phosphoprotein. Calcium-tolerant ventricular myocytes were isolated from hearts of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-200 g) as described previously (19Ellingsen O. Davidoff A.J. Prasad S.K. Berger H.-J. Springhorn J.P. Marsh J.D. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H747-H754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM, Sigma), supplemented with albumin (2 mg/ml), L-carnitine (2 mM), creatine (5 mM), taurine (5 mM), L-glutamine (1.3 mM), and 0.1% penicillin-streptomycin, on laminin-coated (10 μg/ml) plates. This modified DMEM is the medium termed “ACCT” in Berger et al.(20Berger H.-J. Prasad S.K. Davidoff A.J. Pimental D. Ellingsen O. Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H341-H349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is referred to here as “defined medium.” The cells were washed twice following 1 h of plating and incubated in defined medium for another 3 h. These primary isolates typically contained 94-96% adult ventricular myocytes(20Berger H.-J. Prasad S.K. Davidoff A.J. Pimental D. Ellingsen O. Marsh J.D. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H341-H349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CMEC from adult rat hearts were isolated as described by Nishida et al.(21Nishida M. Carley W.W. Gerritsen M.E. Ellingsen O. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H639-H652PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after removing the atrial and valvular tissue, and right ventricle, the left ventricle was immersed in 70% ethanol for 10 s to devitalize epicardial mesothelial and endocardial endothelial cells. After peeling off the outer to of the ventricular wall, the remaining tissue was minced finely and treated with collagenase and trypsin in Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Dissociated cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and plated on laminin (10 μg/ml)-coated dishes at a density of 2,500 cells/cm2. After 1 h of plating, the cells were washed twice with DMEM to remove loosely adherent cells. These primary isolates have been documented to contain >90% endothelial cells, with a phenotype at low passage number consistent with their microvascular origin, as described previously(21Nishida M. Carley W.W. Gerritsen M.E. Ellingsen O. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H639-H652PubMed Google Scholar). In some studies, cardiac myocytes and non-myocyte cell fractions were isolated from 300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been injected intraperitoneally with LPS (from Salmonella typhimurium, 4 mg/kg; Sigma) and/or dexamethasone (1.2 mg/kg), while control animals received only phosphate-buffered saline injections. When animals received both reagents, the LPS was injected 1 h after dexamethasone. Animals were sacrificed 8 or 16 h following injection(s), and ventricular myocytes and the non-myocyte fractions were obtained after density gradient sedimentation as described above. Freshly isolated myocytes or confluent serum-starved CMEC cells were treated in 5 ml of medium with 3 μM dexamethasone in serum-free DMEM. Conditioned media were collected and adjusted with 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Media were centrifuged at 3,000 × g to remove cells and cellular debris and concentrated using Centricon 10 filters (Amicon, Inc.). Twelve μg of protein from each sample were resolved by 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad). Proteins from the gel were electrophorectically blotted to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleischer & Schuell). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading of the samples. After destaining, the membrane was incubated overnight in the blocking buffer TBST (25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.2% Tween-20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was then incubated with monoclonal anti-osteopontin antibody MPIIIB10 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) diluted (1:20) in TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Following washings with TBST, the membrane was incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated mouse antigoat IgG. The immune complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence kit (NEN DuPont). Freshly isolated myocytes or confluent serum-starved CMEC cells were treated with a combination of cytokines (IL-1β and IFN-γ) for 16 h, with or without a 1-h preincubation in medium containing 20 nM synthetic osteopontin peptide (OPP). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with an immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM sodium vanadate, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Sixty and 90 μg of proteins obtained from CMEC and myocytes, respectively, were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-NOS2 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) as described above. Total RNA was extracted from treated or untreated cardiac myocytes and CMEC by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA was size-fractionated on 1.0% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Gene Screen Plus; NEN DuPont) by using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) in 10 × SSC (SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M citrate). Blots were hybridized overnight to radiolabeled probes in the presence of 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 1 mM NaCl, and 50% formamide at 42°C. Full-length rat osteopontin (23Singh K. Mukherjee A.B. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23847-23851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and partial-length type 2 NOS (5Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNAs were labeled using a random prime labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). After hybridization, membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC for 5 min each at room temperature, twice with 2 × SSC containing 1% SDS (for osteopontin) or 0.1% SDS (for NOS2) at 60°C for 30 min, and twice with 0.05 × SSC at room temperature for 15 min prior to autoradiography. The same blots were then hybridized with an 18 S oligonucleotide (30 mer) end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase to normalize for loading differences(24Perrella M.A. Maki T. Prasad S. Pimental D. Singh K. Takahashi N. Yoshizumi M. Alali A. Higashiyama S. Kelly R.A. Lee M.-E. Smith T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27045-27050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in mRNA signal intensity were calculated using a 2202 Ultroscan densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from intact adult rat ventricular muscle using a kit (Invitrogen) exactly as described by the manufacturer. Five μg of poly(A)+ mRNA were analyzed by Northern blotting using the rat osteopontin cDNA probe as described above. A hexapeptide with the amino acid sequence N-methyl-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP) was purchased from Sigma. A synthetic OPP with amino acid sequence Ac-Pro-Thr-Val-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Ser-Lys-NH2(17Hwang S. Lopez C.A. Heck D.E. Gardner C.R. Laskin D.L. Laskin J.D. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 711-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized by Tana Research Laboratories (Houston, TX). A full-length rat osteopontin cDNA, isolated and characterized as described previously(23Singh K. Mukherjee A.B. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23847-23851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into the NotI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The orientation of resulting clones was checked by restriction analysis and the plasmid containing the cDNA insert in antisense orientation was used to transfect primary cultures of microvascular endothelial cells that had attained approximately 50% confluency (i.e. 4-5 days after isolation and plating in DMEM + 20% fetal calf serum). The cells were washed twice with serum-free OPTI-MEM medium (without antibiotics; Life Technologies, Inc.), and then transfected with 60 μg of Lipofectin and 40 μg of the antisense osteopontin cDNA in 3 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM medium, according to the vendor's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Control cells were mock-transfected with Lipofectin alone in OPTI-MEM medium using the same protocol. The cells were incubated for 6 h before the medium was supplemented with DMEM and 20% fetal calf serum. After 48 h of transfection, CMEC were serum-starved for 3 h and then treated with cytokines for a further 16 h before analysis of osteopontin and NOS2 mRNA abundance. Although several groups have reported data from tissue screens for osteopontin mRNA, only Giachelli et al.(18Giachelli C. Bae N. Lombardi D. Majesky M. Schwartz S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have reported detecting osteopontin in normal rat myocardium, but at a level 50-60-fold lower than in normal rat aorta or carotid artery. To determine whether we could confirm this observation, poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from ventricular muscle of two rat hearts. As shown inFig. 1A, osteopontin mRNA could be detected readily by Northern blot in both samples. Osteopontin mRNA abundance also was examined in fresh primary isolates of adult rat ventricular myocytes and confluent primary cultures of CMEC by Northern blot. As shown inFig. 1B, in the absence of inflammatory cytokines or dexamethasone, a 1.5-kilobase band consistent with osteopontin transcripts was readily detectable in RNA from CMEC, but only a faint band was observed in Northern blots of RNA from ventricular myocytes after much longer exposures of the autoradiogram. The regulation of osteopontin expression is tissue-specific and complex in those cell types in which it has been examined(15Butter W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 23: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar,16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). In osteoblasts, agents that induce bone resorption including inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β and LPS, also induce osteopontin expression and secretion(26Jin C. Miyaura C. Ishini I. Hong M. Sato T. Abe E. Suda T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 74: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether osteopontin expression could be enhanced in cardiac myocytes and CMEC, respectively, cells were exposed to a combination of cytokines (rhIL-1β and rmIFN-γ) for 16 h. As shown inFig. 2A, incubation with this combination of cytokines approximately doubled CMEC osteopontin mRNA abundance compared to control CMEC cultures, whereas osteopontin mRNA remained low and unchanged as analyzed by Northern blot in cytokine-pretreated adult ventricular myocyte primary isolates at 16 h (Fig. 2B). Since glucocorticoids are known to suppress the induction of inflammatory cytokine-induced gene expression in many cell types, including cardiac myocytes(5Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytokine-treated CMEC and ventricular myocytes were also pretreated with dexamethasone, which we presumed would suppress any cytokine-induced expression of osteopontin mRNA as has been shown, for example, in rat osteoblast cells(27Yoon K. Buenaga R. Rodan G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, as shown inFig. 2, dexamethasone markedly enhanced osteopontin mRNA abundance in both CMEC and adult ventricular myocytes, regardless of whether IL-1β and IFN-γ were present in the incubation medium. Cells treated with a combination of dexamethasone with cytokines tended to have lower levels of osteopontin mRNA than cells treated with dexamethasone alone, although cultures treated with both classes of reagents still expressed osteopontin mRNA at levels that were 10-15-fold higher than base line. To determine whether similar changes in osteopontin mRNA abundance could be detected in vivo, adult rats were injected intraperitoneally with either LPS or dexamethasone (or both). Myocyte and non-myocyte fractions were obtained, and total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot. A faint band of the appropriate size for osteopontin mRNA was detected in both myocyte and non-myocyte fractions from normal hearts. This signal could be increased severalfold at 16 h following injection of dexamethasone or of LPS, or with a combination of these agents (Fig. 3). A detectable increase above base-line osteopontin mRNA levels could be detected within 8 h of injection of LPS, with or without dexamethasone (data not shown). To verify that these changes in mRNA abundance were paralleled by similar directional changes in osteopontin synthesis and secretion, the media conditioned by control or dexamethasone-treated cells were concentrated and analyzed by Western blot using a monoclonal anti-osteopontin antibody. As shown inFig. 4A, a band corresponding to osteopontin (approximately 62 kDa) was detected in medium conditioned by CMEC. The intensity of this band was increased significantly in conditioned medium from dexamethasone-treated CMEC. In myocyte-conditioned medium, a slightly higher molecular mass band (approximately 69 kDa) was detected by the same antibody by Western blot. This band is within the range of sizes that has been reported for this glycosylated phosphoprotein (i.e. 44-75 kDa)(16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). As in CMEC, dexamethasone increased by approximately 3-fold the intensity of this 69-kDa band in proteins from ventricular myocytes (Fig. 4B). Similar data were obtained by immunoprecipitation of conditioned media from both cell types following metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, using a polyclonal anti-peptide osteopontin antiserum prepared as described previously (23Singh K. Mukherjee A.B. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23847-23851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Earlier studies (27Yoon K. Buenaga R. Rodan G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) reporting suppression of osteopontin gene expression by dexamethasone in a rat osteoblast cell line (ROS 17/2.8) used lower dexamethasone concentrations (in the range of 30-100 nM) than were used to generate the data inFig. 2(i.e. 3 μM). To determine whether CMEC and cardiac myocytes also exhibited evidence of decreased osteopontin mRNA abundance at lower concentrations of dexamethasone, concentration-effect curves were performed that bracketed the concentrations used in these earlier studies and those used to generate the data inFig. 2(i.e. 30 nM to 15 μM). As shown inFig. 5A, there was an increase in osteopontin mRNA levels above those observed in CMEC treated with vehicle alone at 30 nM, and this response increased with higher dexamethasone concentrations. An osteopontin mRNA hybridization signal was easily detected in adult cardiac myocytes at 30 nM and was maximal at 100 nM (Fig. 5B). At 3 μM dexamethasone, an increase in osteopontin transcript levels was apparent in microvascular endothelial cells within 1 h and continued to increase throughout the 16-h incubation period of the experiment (Fig. 6A). After addition of 3 μM dexamethasone, no increase in osteopontin transcript was detected by Northern blot until a 5-h time point in freshly isolated adult ventricular myocytes, and levels continued to increase through 16 h (Fig. 6B).Figure 6:Time course of increase in osteopontin mRNA levels by dexamethasone. Confluent serum-starved CMEC (A) or ventricular myocyte primary isolates (B) were treated with dexamethasone (3 μM) for the time periods indicated. Total RNA was extracted and 15 μg of the RNA was analyzed by Northern blot using 32P-labeled osteopontin and 18 S probes. The signal density of osteopontin mRNA was divided by that of 18 S rRNA, and the data are expressed as a percentage of the normalized osteopontin hybridization signal at 0 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the effect of dexamethasone on osteopontin mRNA stability, confluent serum-starved CMEC were treated with actinomycin D (10 μg/ml; Sigma) after 16 h of dexamethasone pretreatment. The results inFig. 7 show that the half-life of osteopontin mRNA in control CMEC is approximately 11 h and is similar to that reported for ROS 17/2.8 cells by Noda et al.(28Noda M. Yoon K. Prince C.W. Butler W.T. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13916-13921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was a trend toward a slightly longer half-life for osteopontin in dexamethasone-pretreated cells, although this was not statistically significant. Thus, the principal mechanism by which glucocorticoids regulate osteopontin mRNA abundance appears to be at the transcriptional level. Both microvascular endothelial cells and ventricular myocytes express NOS2 in situ in intact rat hearts and in vitro following exposure to soluble inflammatory mediators. To test the hypothesis that osteopontin secretion by one or both cell types in vitro could modulate NOS2 mRNA abundance, we first determined whether interruption of matrix protein-integrin binding affected NOS2 transcript levels. As shown inFig. 8A, confluent serum-starved CMEC pretreated for 1 h with the synthetic hexapeptide GRGDSP (10 nM), which acts as an inhibitor of matrix ligand-integrin binding(29Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1986; 231: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), increased NOS2 mRNA abundance by 50% after a subsequent 16-h incubation in the presence of IL-1β and IFN-γ over that of cells incubated in the absence of the hexapeptide. No NOS2 mRNA could be detected under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of cytokines) or in cells incubated in the presence of the GRGDSP peptide alone. Higher concentrations of this synthetic hexapeptide did not result in any further increase in NO synthase transcript levels (data not shown) and led to some cell detachment from the plate. Similarly, in adult ventricular myocytes, as shown inFig. 8B, GRGDSP (10-50 nM) enhanced NOS2 transcript levels by about 20-60% over those observed in myocytes treated with cytokines alone. These cells tolerated higher concentrations of the peptide without observable cellular detachment. These data suggested that some matrix protein attachments, possibly involving endogenous osteopontin, could suppress the extent of NOS2 expression in both cell types. To determine whether osteopontin did affect the extent of induction of this NO synthase isoform, microvascular endothelial cells and ventricular myocytes were treated with a 20-mer synthetic peptide analogue (OPP) based on the rat osteopontin sequence that spans the RGD integrin-binding motif. OPP has been shown to be functional for osteopontin signaling and mimics recombinant human osteopontin in renal tubular epithelial cells(17Hwang S. Lopez C.A. Heck D.E. Gardner C.R. Laskin D.L. Laskin J.D. Denhardt D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 711-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown inFig. 9, 20 nM OPP decreased NOS2 transcript levels by approximately 50% in cytokine-pretreated microvascular endothelial cells. In cytokine-treated primary isolates of adult ventricular myocytes, there was about a 40% decline in NOS2 mRNA abundance at 20 nM and 50 nM OPP. This decline in NOS2 transcript with OPP also was accompanied by a reduction in NOS2 protein by approximately 20 and 50% in CMEC and adult ventricular myocytes, respectively, as detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-NOS2 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). To determine whether inhibition of endogenous osteopontin expression in microvascular endothelial cells could affect NOS2 mRNA abundance in cytokine-treated microvascular endothelial cells, primary cultures were transiently transfected with a rat osteopontin antisense cDNA construct using Lipofectin. The cells were treated with cytokines following 48 h of transfection. Lipofectin alone did not affect osteopontin or NOS2 mRNA levels in cytokine-treated CMEC. Transfection with an antisense osteopontin cDNA reduced osteopontin mRNA by approximately 50% as compared to osteopontin mRNA levels in cells treated with cytokines alone or with Lipofectin alone (Fig. 10). However, NOS2 mRNA abundance was enhanced more than 2-fold in plates transfected with the antisense osteopontin cDNA construct (Fig. 10). Osteopontin, originally identified in its role of facilitating resorption of bone hydroxylapatite by osteoclasts, is now known to be synthesized in many different cell types including luminal epithelial cells in many organs and by smooth muscle in a number of tissues including the vasculature(27Yoon K.

Pathol. 1994; 145: 1450-1462PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that osteopontin expression was markedly increased in a subset of infiltrating macrophages around and within zones of myocardial injury induced by a transdiaphragmatic freeze-thaw technique. Similarly, Williams et al.(36Williams E.B. Halpert I. Wickline S. Davison G. Parks W.C. Rottman J.N. Circulation. 1995; 92: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have recently reported that osteopontin mRNA is increased markedly in hearts of hamsters with a heritable cardiomyopathy, which they attributed to infiltrating tissue macrophages. Osteopontin may play an important role in several cardiovascular disease processes, including atherosclerosis, aortic valve calcification, as well as repair of myocardial injury as reviewed by Giachelli et al.(37Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Liaw L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1995; 5: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An increase in osteopontin levels was observed in rat carotid arteries following vascular injury induced by experimental balloon angioplasty(18Giachelli C. Bae N. Lombardi D. Majesky M. Schwartz S.

Indeed, this extracellular matrix phosphoprotein may play a more general role in the immune response than mediating chemotaxis of phagocytic cells; for example, the early T-cell activation gene 1 (Eta1) that is expressed following nonspecific activation of several lymphocyte subclasses has been identified as being osteopontin(38Patarca R. Freeman G.J. Singh R.P. Wei F.Y. Durfee T. Blattner F. Regnier D.C. Kozak C.A. Mock B.A. Morse III, H.C. Jerrells T.R. Cantor H. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Osteopontin also can stimulate lymphocyte immunoglobulin production, suggesting that it may function as a cytokine in some circumstances(16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Murry et al.(35Murry C.E. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Vracko R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1450-1462PubMed Google Scholar) also demonstrated that osteopontin expression could be detected in other tissues and cell types following injury, including regenerating skeletal muscle cells. Within the heart, osteopontin mRNA and protein has been detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry only within macrophages in injured muscle, but not in the extracellular matrix or other cell types (35Murry C.E. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Vracko R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1450-1462PubMed Google Scholar,36Williams E.B. Halpert I. Wickline S. Davison G. Parks W.C. Rottman J.N. Circulation. 1995; 92: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since the only known functions of osteopontin are related to its role as an extracellular matrix phosphoprotein, Murry et al.(35Murry C.E. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Vracko R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1450-1462PubMed Google Scholar) speculated that extracellular osteopontin protein levels and presumably levels in otherwise normal heart muscle were below the level of detection by the immunohistochemical techniques they employed. Denhardt and Guo(16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), in a recent review, have emphasized the cell type specificity of the regulation of osteopontin gene expression. Osteopontin is expressed constitutively in arterial vascular smooth muscle cells and osteoblasts and its expression is increased by peptide growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-β and by phorbol esters (16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar) and decreased by glucocorticoids, at least in the osteoblast cell line ROS 17/2.8(27Yoon K. Buenaga R. Rodan G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that glucocorticoids increase osteopontin expression and protein secretion in ventricular myocytes and CMEC in primary culture. This differential responsiveness to glucocorticoids may be due to the fact that the osteopontin promoter is known to contain two glucocorticoid response elements, as well as two AP-1 sites (16Denhardt D.T. Guo X. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar,39Zhang Q. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. Eur. J.

Glucocorticoids, by binding to steroid hormone receptors, can directly repress AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation(41Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). In addition to increasing osteopontin mRNA levels and protein content in ventricular myocytes and CMEC, dexamethasone also decreases NOS2 mRNA abundance and activity in both cell types(4Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Kobzik L. Lowenstein C.J. Lamas S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H1293-H1303PubMed Google Scholar,5Balligand J.-L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which glucocorticoids regulate cytokine-induced gene expression are complex and differ among specific cell types(42Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the temporal association between osteopontin expression and decreased NOS2 mRNA levels suggests that endogenous osteopontin in the extracellular matrix could regulate NOS2 activity in these cells. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the synthetic 20-mer osteopontin peptide analogue (OPP) decreased NOS2 mRNA and protein levels in both cell types and that transfection of CMEC with an antisense osteopontin cDNA decreased endogenous osteopontin mRNA levels while increasing NOS2 mRNA abundance in response to IL-1β and IFN-γ. The specific intracellular signaling pathways initiated by osteopontin binding to αvβ3 (or other) integrins that result in decreased NOS2 mRNA abundance are not known. Integrin recruited and autophosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, which can subsequently activate either ras or protein kinase C-dependent pathways, has been shown to synergistically enhance some cellular responses to cytokines(43Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar). It is possible that osteopontin acts to interrupt downstream signaling by other extracellular matrix proteins (such as fibronectin, with which osteopontin is known to interact)(25Singh K. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18696-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Nemir M. DeVouge M.W. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1993; 114: 702-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Regardless of the specific mechanisms, it is likely that the increased expression, synthesis, and secretion of osteopontin induced by specific cytokines or glucocorticoids contributes to the spatial and temporal regulation of nitric oxide production by NOS2 in cardiac muscle.

We report here a novel K+ channel β-subunit cloned from human heart, hKvβ1.3, that has 74-83% overall identity with previously cloned β-subunits. Comparison of hKvβ1.3 with the previously cloned hKvβ3 and rKvβ1 proteins indicates that the carboxyl-terminal 328 amino acids are identical, while unique variable length amino termini exist. Analysis of human β-subunit cDNA and genomic nucleotide sequences confirm that these three β-subunits are alternatively spliced from a common β-subunit gene. Co-expression of hKvβ1.3 in Xenopus oocytes with the delayed rectifier hKv1.5 indicated that hKvβ1.3 has unique functional effects. This novel β-subunit induced a time-dependent inactivation during membrane voltage steps to positive potentials, induced a 13-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation curve, and slowed deactivation (τ = 13 ± 0.5 ms versus 35 ± 1.7 ms at -40 mV).

However, assigning specific K+ channel clones to a native current often is difficult since most heterologously expressed Kv channels display either a fast inactivating or a delayed rectifier type current, often with similar pharmacology. While possible factors contributing to this diversity may include Kv channel glycosylation, phosphorylation, and heterotetrameric α-subunit formation within a gene subfamily(16Ruppersberg J.P.

Biophys.

The fourth distinct β-subunit clone, also termed Kvβ3, was isolated from human and ferret heart(23Majumder K. De Biasi M. Wang Z.

Identity of this Kvβ3 to previously cloned β-subunits is greatest in the carboxyl-terminal region with complete identity of hKvβ3 and rKvβ1 in the carboxyl 329 amino acids and 85% identity to rKvβ2. However, the first 79 amino acids of hKvβ3 share only ∼25% identity with rKvβ1 and do not align with rKvβ2. Fast inactivation of Kv1.4 was accelerated when expressed with hKvβ3 (23Majumder K.

Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), although these channels have been postulated to associate with accessory subunits(28Rehm H. Lazdunski M. Proc.

The complete amino acid identity between rKvβ1 and hKvβ3 in the carboxyl terminus suggests that Kv channel β-subunit isoforms are encoded by a single β-subunit gene. Alternative splicing was suggested previously (21Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 26England S.K. Uebele V.N. Shear H. Kodali J. Bennett P.B. Tamkun M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) since the point of divergence between rKvβ1 and hKvβ3 cDNA contained a potential splice junction and the nucleotide sequence identity in the carboxyl terminus was >90%. Calcium channel β-subunits are encoded by four different genes with alternative splicing of the β1 and β2 genes giving rise to multiple β-subunits within these subfamilies(31Powers P.A. Liu S. Hogan K. Gregg R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22967-22972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1183-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Cell-specific alternative splicing of Kv β-subunits may be one mechanism responsible for the diversity of Kv channel current among cell types. We report here the cloning and characterization of a cDNA from human heart that encodes a unique K+ channel β-subunit designated hKvβ1.3. The hKvβ1.3 subunit uniquely alters the functional properties of hKv1.5, converting it from a delayed rectifier to a channel with rapid, but partial, inactivation. In addition, this current activates at lower voltages, rectifies at depolarized potentials, and has slowed deactivation. Nucleotide sequence comparison of cDNA and genomic DNA encoding human Kvβ1.3, Kvβ3, and Kvβ1 indicate that these subunits are encoded by a common β-subunit gene, here designated the Kvβ1 subfamily gene. We suggest that the nomenclature be changed to reflect that the Kvβ1 subunit family members are generated through alternative mRNA splicing (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab PCR-generated cDNA fragments corresponding to nucleotides 435 to 1089 of rKvβ2.1 were used to screen 3.5 × 105 amplified recombinants from a λgt10 cardiomyopathic human heart ventricular cDNA library using previously described conditions (33Tamkun M.M. Knoth K. Walbridge J.A. Kroemer H. Roden D. Glover D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The primary screening yielded a partial clone (8-82, ∼3.0 kb) which was subcloned into pBluescript (KS+) via NotI and sequenced using double-stranded templates and appropriate oligonucleotide primers (Sequenase 2.0, United States Biochemical Corp.). This clone lacked an in-frame stop codon 5′ to the first ATG, suggesting it did not represent a full-length coding sequence. Repeated efforts to isolate additional 5′ sequence from a cDNA library were unsuccessful. To clone the 5′ end of 8-82, PCR-generated 260-nucleotide fragments unique to the 5′ end of 8-82 were used to screen 4.2 × 105 amplified recombinants from a λEMBL-3 human genomic library (Clontech). The primary screening yielded one clone that was isolated using Wizard Magic Lambda Preps per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). This ∼14-kb clone was digested by SacI/EcoRI, electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized at high stringency(4Roberds S.L. Tamkun M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1798-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A ∼4-kb fragment that hybridized to the 260-nucleotide probe was subcloned into pGEM and sequenced. This genomic fragment contained the 26 coding nucleotides missing from the 5′ end of 8-82 and contained in-frame stop codons 5′ to the ATG. The clone was assembled by linearizing clone 8-82 in pBluescript (KS) with BglII and ligating in a 43-bp fragment containing the 5′ end of 8-82. The completed clone was verified by sequencing and referred to as hKvβ1.3. PCR-generated cDNA fragments of Kvβ1.2 (nucleotides -74 to 348) were used to screen 4.2 × 105 amplified recombinants from a λEMBL-3 human genomic library (Clontech). The primary screening yielded an ∼13-kb clone that was isolated as described above. This clone was digested with Sau3AI, and fragments of multiple sizes were ligated into the BamHI site of pGEM. A plasmid containing a 1-kb genomic fragment positive for Kvβ1.2 was selected by colony hybridization and sequenced using appropriate oligonucleotide primers. Isolation of hKvβ1.1 cDNA was completed by generating PCR fragments corresponding to nucleotides 1-216 of rKvβ1 and screening 2.8 × 105 unamplified recombinants from a newly constructed λZAPII (Stratagene) cDNA library made from human cerebral cortex mRNA (Clontech). A 4-kb clone was isolated, and plaque-purified clones were recovered by in vivo excision yielding hKvβ1.1 in pBluescript (SK-). Nucleotide sequence in various regions was determined as described above. Templates for in vitro cRNA synthesis were prepared by isolating a XbaI/AccI fragment of hKvβ1.3 (nucleotides -20 to 1520) from pBluescript (KS), blunting the DNA ends with Klenow and ligating into the SmaI site of the modified pSP64T vector (34White M.M. Chen L. Kleinfield R. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 604-608PubMed Google Scholar). This construct was linearized with EcoRI prior to cRNA synthesis. The hKv1.5 cRNA template was prepared as described previously(35Po S.S. Snyders D.J. Baker R. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Human Kvβ1.3 and hKv1.5 cRNAs were synthesized using the SP6 mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Defolliculated Xenopus oocytes were prepared as described previously (19Po S.S. Roberds S.L. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and injected with approximately 40 nl (4-20 ng) of in vitro transcribed cRNA. These dilutions resulted in peak currents of 1-10 μA. Electrophysiological recordings have been described in detail previously(19Po S.S. Roberds S.L. Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. Circ.

Oocytes were bathed in an extracellular solution containing 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.5 with NaOH).

Res. 1993; 72: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), other possibilities include association of one or more function-altering β-subunits. β-Subunits have been shown to modulate inactivation kinetics, voltage dependence, and current amplitudes of voltage-gated K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels (20, 21, 24-26, 32, 36-41), and the voltage and calcium sensitivity of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels (42McManus O.B.

In order to understand the relationship between Kv cardiac clones and native currents, it is necessary to identify the possible α- and β-subunit interactions. Screening an amplified human heart cDNA library at low stringency with a PCR-generated cDNA probe corresponding to nucleotides 435-1089 of rKvβ2.1 yielded two partial cDNA clones as determined by nucleotide sequencing. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of these clones (hβ2-1) was found to be nearly identical with rKvβ2.1 and likely represents the human homologue of this previously cloned rat subunit(21Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The other cDNA (hβ8-82) was most similar to rKvβ1.1 but exhibited little amino acid identity within the postulated amino terminus and lacked a likely translation start site. Additional screens of cDNA libraries did not yield a full-length clone. Screening a human genomic library produced the 26 nucleotides missing from the 5′ end and an obvious translation start site. The initiating methionine was assigned because it represents the first in-frame ATG positioned 3′ of termination codons in an open reading frame encoding a 419-amino acid protein (47 kDa). Hydropathy analysis did not reveal a hydrophobic domain, suggesting that similar to other β-subunits, hKvβ1.3 is likely a cytoplasmic protein. An amino acid sequence comparison between hKvβ1.3, hKvβ1.2, rKvβ1.1, and rKvβ2.1 is illustrated in Fig. 1. The carboxyl-terminal 328 amino acids of hKvβ1.3 are 100% identical with rKvβ1.1 and hKvβ1.2 and share 85% identity with rKvβ2. However, the first 91 amino acids of hKvβ1.3 share <10% identity with hKvβ1.2, rKvβ1.1, and rKvβ2.1. To determine whether hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2 represent splice variants of the same gene, 3′-untranslated regions were compared. Alignments of this 1800-base pair region showed 99% nucleotide identity between clones isolated from separate individuals, suggesting that hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2 represent splice variants with minor allelic differences. To confirm that Kvβ1.1 is also derived from this gene, Kvβ1.1 was cloned from a human cerebral cortex cDNA library. Three different regions from the 3′-untranslated region corresponding to ∼250, ∼750, and ∼1500 bp 3′ of the translation stop codon were sequenced and showed complete identity with Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ1.3 in this 3′-untranslated region suggesting that all three β-subunits are encoded by this gene. To confirm the splice junction, we attempted to clone the entire Kvβ1 gene from a human genomic library by screening with a probe corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 328 amino acids of Kvβ1.1. Although several clones were 10-20 kb in length, a full-length gene was not isolated based on the finding that no single clone hybridized to either hKvβ1.2 or hKvβ1.3 amino-terminal specific probes. Likewise, when the unique amino termini of hKvβ1.3 and hKvβ1.2 were used to isolate additional genomic clones, these clones did not hybridize to the carboxyl-terminal probe. The complete gene encoding the hKvβ1 subfamily likely exceeds 40 kb. Fig. 2 illustrates the genomic sequences of Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ1.3 surrounding the predicted splice site. Both Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ1.3 genomic sequences correspond to their respective cDNA in the region marked exon. Both genomic clones contain a consensus sequence for donor/acceptor splice sites as shown by the underlined sequence(43Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2783) Google Scholar). These data provide further evidence that at least three β-subunits result from alternative splicing. Therefore, differential regulation of Kv β-subunit expression and alternative splicing are likely to be two mechanisms regulating Kv channel diversity. Further in situ analysis and antibody-based immunohistochemical localization of the Kv β-subunits will further our understanding of Kv channel α- and β-subunit association. Fig. 3 illustrates the effects of Kvβ1.3 on hKv1.5 currents. Current tracings were obtained during voltage clamp steps to depolarizing membrane potentials where outward current is activated and tail currents are measured during channel deactivation upon steps to -40 mV. Human Kv1.5 normally displays a modest degree of outward rectification and begins to activate at a membrane potential of about -30 mV (Fig. 3A)(44Snyders D.J. Tamkun M.M. Bennett P.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 101: 513-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the presence of Kvβ1.3, Kv1.5 current displays a time-dependent decay or partial inactivation at large depolarizing steps (Fig. 3B) that occurs only at membrane potentials greater than approximately 0 mV. Fig. 3B illustrates also the slower rate of channel deactivation seen in the presence of Kvβ1.3 relative to the Kv1.5 alone. These deactivating tail currents were best fit by one exponential with time constants of 13.2 ± 0.5 ms for wild-type Kv1.5 and time constants of 34.9 ± 1.7 ms in the presence of Kvβ1.3 at -40 mV (p < 0.05). Due to the effect of the hKvβ1.3 which decreases current at larger membrane potentials, the magnitude of the tails may be underestimated. Time constants for the apparent inactivation induced by Kvβ1.3 were 8.9 ± 0.3 ms at +50 mV and 9.2 ± 0.45 ms at +30 mV (n = 12) (p > 0.1, not significant). Fits of the decay at less positive potentials were less reliable and were not done. An additional effect observed during co-expression of Kv1.5 with Kvβ1.3 was that the threshold for Kv1.5 channel activation occurred at more negative potentials. The shift in the activation curve toward more negative potentials is illustrated in Fig. 3C where the amplitude of the tail currents is plotted as a function of the membrane potential. Since the driving force is constant during this measurement, the curve reflects the fraction of channels open at each membrane potential. The average midpoint of the activation curve for the hKv1.5 was -7.1 ± 0.5 mV (n = 6) whereas in the presence of the hKvβ1.3 it was -20 ± 0.5 mV (n = 6). Fig. 3D shows steady state outward current measured during depolarizing steps. Note that hKv1.5 current is observed at more negative potentials when hKvβ1.3 is present, even at potentials that do not show apparent inactivation (i.e. -20 mV). At membrane potentials greater than approximately 0 mV, hKv1.5 current in the presence of hKvβ1.3 is suppressed relative to the Kv1.5 alone, thereby converting this apparent outwardly rectifying current voltage relationship to one that shows inward rectification. Future detailed analysis of these interactions will elucidate the underlying effects of hKvβ1.3. Discovery of the novel Kvβ1.3 subunit and that alternative mRNA splicing generates multiple function altering β-subunits further complicates determination of the relationship between cardiac clones and native currents. Future cell-specific localization and co-purification studies using Kv β-antibodies will enable us to understand both the pattern of Kv β-subunit isoform expression and the Kv channels with which these subunits associate. In addition, analysis of the mechanisms by which Kvβ1.3 alters the voltage sensitivity, inactivation, and rectification of Kv1.5 will advance our understanding of Kv channel function."

IL-2 also activates PI 3-kinase, but it is not clear whether this substrate binds to the IL-2 receptor. In contrast, it is clear that the IL-4 receptor can recruit PI 3-kinase via the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytosolic docking protein IRS-1 or the newly cloned IRS-2 (4PS) molecule(15Wang L.M.

Indeed, 32D cells expressing an IL-4 receptor mutant that does not phosphorylate IRS-1 will not proliferate in response to IL-4(24Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that IRS-1 and perhaps IRS-2 play an important role in the signaling response to growth factors such as insulin and IL-4. More recently, other cytokines and growth factors such as IFNα, IFNγ, IL-9, and leukocyte inhibitory factor have also been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1(25Yin T. Tsang M.L.-S.

These reports suggest that IRS-1 may be an important signaling component utilized by many growth factors. Although IL-2 signal transduction has been investigated extensively, IL-2 has not been reported to induce phosphorylation of IRS-1 or IRS-2. Therefore, it was important to assess whether IL-2 could induce phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and thus provide a means of explaining PI 3-kinase recruitment in response to IL-2. We report here that IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, as well as IL-4, rapidly stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in human T cells. In addition, we show that the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 can associate with and tyrosine-phosphorylate IRS-1 and IRS-2. Moreover, we demonstrate a rapid IL-2-induced association of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1. These results suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 may have significant roles in T lymphocyte activation in response to not only IL-4 but also IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. Human T lymphocytes were obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation from normal donors, following informed consent. The purity of the T cell population was 93-96%. Peripheral blood T lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Advanced Biotechnology, Inc., Columbia, MD) containing 100 μg/ml gentamycin, 2 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). T cells were activated in RPMI 10% serum and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (1 μg/ml) for 72 h, washed in CO2-acidified medium, and rested in 0.5% human serum for 4 h in order to optimize IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 signaling. Recombinant human IL-2 was kindly provided by Cetus Oncology Corp. IL-4 and IL-7 were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). IL-12 was received from Dr. Stanley Wolf (Genetics Institute, Cambridge MA). IL-15 was obtained from Immunex (Seattle, WA) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). IFNα was obtained from Hoffman-La Roche Inc. Monoclonal anti-JAK1 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-JAK1, JAK2 antibodies, and monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine, 4G10, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Industries (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal rabbit anti-JAK3 was made in our laboratory(30Kawamura M. McVicar D.W. Johnston J.A. Blake T.B. Chen Y.Q. Lal B.K. Lloyd A.R. Kelvin D.J. Staples J.E. Ortaldo J.R. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl.

A. 1994; 91: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 sera were made against recombinant baculovirus-purified IRS-1 protein and against a unique COOH-terminal murine IRS-2(23Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). After stimulation with the indicated cytokines, T lymphocytes were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 0.5% Brij 96, 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, with 2.5 Mp-nitrophenyl guanidinobenzoate, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml both leupeptin and aprotinin (Sigma). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, anti-JAK1 (UBI), anti-JAK3 (as above), or antiphosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology Industries. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp.) at 100 V at 4°C for 3 h in 25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS. For immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine, the filters were first blocked with 1% gelatin and sequentially incubated with antiphosphotyrosine (1:2000), biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Oncogene Science). Signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ECL (Amersham). Filters that were subsequently reprobed were stripped with 2% SDS, 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8, and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol at 70°C for 30 min. Cos-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 5% fetal calf serum. These cells were transfected at 50-60% confluence using the DEAE-dextran method(31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Harvard Medical School, John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 97-99Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, expression of a total of 4 μg of cDNA for IRS-2 and IL-2 receptor γchain (γc), JAK3 or JAK1 were transfected into Cos-7 cells. Whereas IL-4 stimulation induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, IL-2 has not been shown to induce phosphorylation of IRS-1 or the newly described IRS-2 protein. To determine whether IRS-1 became tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to both IL-2 and IL-4, human peripheral blood T cells were activated with PHA for 3 days, acid-washed, and incubated for 4 h in serum-deprived conditions. The cells were then washed and stimulated with IL-2 (1000 units/ml), IL-4 (100 units/ml), or IL-12 (100 units/ml) for 15 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine. There was no basal tyrosine phosphorylation under conditions of factor deprivation (Fig. 1A, lane 1), but, as expected, IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected after a 15-min stimulation (Fig. 1A, lane 4). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was also observed in T cells after 5- and 15-min stimulation with IL-2 (Fig. 1A). Of note, the levels of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation detected in response to IL-2 in peripheral blood T cells were not as high as those observed with IL-4. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was transient with maximum stimulation in response to IL-2 being observed at 15 min and declining thereafter (results not shown). We did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to IL-12 in T cells (Fig. 1A, lane 5). This is of interest since IL-2 and IL-12 activate distinct Janus kinases(32Bacon C.M. McVicar D.W. Ortaldo J.R. Rees R.C. O'Shea J.J. Johnston J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 occurs in response to IL-2 treatment of activated human T cells. Recently, the IRS-1 homologue, IRS-2 (4PS), has been cloned from myeloid cells(17Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhanf Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). IRS-1 and IRS-2 exhibit considerable overall sequence identity and can be used interchangeably by both insulin and IL-4 to mediate mitogenesis in the 32D cell system(17Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhanf Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 23Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether IL-2 could also induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2. Fig. 1B shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 was detected in response to IL-2 and IL-4 in human T cells. The antibodies used to identify IRS-1 and IRS-2 are specific for each of the molecules; this is confirmed since these two proteins can be distinguished by their migration on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B, consistent with the predicted molecular masses, IRS-2 (180 kDa) migrates slower than IRS-1 (165 kDa) (17Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhanf Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). To confirm that equivalent levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 were immunoprecipitated, the filter was reblotted with the respective antibodies, and the levels were identical in each lane (results not shown). IL-2 is an important regulator of Natural Killer (NK) cell and B cell function. We therefore examined whether IL-2-dependent IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected in human peripheral blood NK cells or B cells. Increased IRS-1 phosphorylation was readily observed in response to IL-2 and IL-4 in NK cells, but again IL-12 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in these cells (Fig. 1C). Marked increases in the levels of IRS-1 phosphotyrosine were also observed in the NK cell line, NK 3.3, in response to IL-2 and IL-4 treatment (Fig. 1D). IL-2-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation was also observed in an Epstein Barr virus-transformed B cell line from a normal donor and, in the T cell line, Kit 225 (results not shown). These data further suggest that IL-2-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 may be an important signaling event in all human lymphocyte subpopulations. IL-7 and IL-15 also bind the IL-2 receptor γc subunit and activate JAK1 and JAK3 in T cells(12Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.A. Chen Y. Rees R. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 33Grabstein K. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Rauch C. Srinivasan S. Fung V. Beers C. Richardson J. Schoenborn M.A. Ahdieh M. Johnson L. Alderson M. Watson J.D. Anderson D. Giri G.G. Science. 1994; 264: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 would occur in response to IL-7 and IL-15. T cells were treated with IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 (100 units/ml), and IL-15 (5000 units/ml), lysed, and immunoprecipitated as above. As with IL-2 and IL-4, tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected in response to IL-7 and IL-15 in T cells (Fig. 1E). These findings establish that tyrosine phosphorylation IRS-1 occurs in T cells in response not only to IL-4 but also to IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to insulin is thought to result from the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. Unlike the insulin receptor, the IL-2 and IL-4 receptors do not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity but have been demonstrated to be coupled to the Janus protein-tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3(5Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 6Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We speculated that the IL-2- and IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 might result from Janus kinase activity. To investigate this possibility, we examined whether these Janus kinases could associate with IRS-1. Following IL-2 stimulation of T cells, an additional tyrosyl phosphoprotein was detected in the anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A, upper panel). This protein migrated with a molecular mass of ~125 kDa, identical with that of JAK3. We therefore speculated that this protein might be JAK3 and confirmed this by reprobing the filter with JAK3 antiserum (Fig. 2A, lower panel). We also detected JAK1 protein-tyrosine kinase in both IRS-1 and IRS-2 immunoprecipitates from T cell lysates (Fig. 2B). These results strongly suggest that the Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 associate with IRS-1 and IRS-2 in T cells. To determine if JAK1 or JAK3 could interact directly with the IRS molecules and to examine whether these Janus kinases could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, we co-expressed IRS-2 with the Janus family kinases in Cos cells and analyzed the IRS-2 immunoprecipitates. IRS-2 did not exhibit basal tyrosine phosphorylation when expressed alone or with the IL-2 receptor chain γc (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). In contrast, IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was readily detected in cells expressing IRS-2 in combination with JAK1 or JAK3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK1 and JAK3 were detected in the IRS-2 immunoprecipitates from these cells indicating again that these kinases associate with IRS-2 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in cells expressing JAK1, higher levels of IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation were observed than in cells expressing JAK3, even though JAK1 and JAK3 were expressed at comparable levels (data not shown). Likewise, higher levels of JAK1 protein were observed in the IRS-2 immunoprecipitates. Taken together, these data indicate that IRS-1 and IRS-2 can interact directly with the JAKs and may be substrates for these kinases, suggesting that JAK/IRS association may be important for IRS-1 and IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-2 and IL-4. The 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase binds to IRS-1 following insulin, IL-4, and growth hormone stimulation(16White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 27Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Yip R. Lobo R.B. Tai L.R. Goodman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30085-30088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While it has been demonstrated that PI 3-kinase is activated in response to IL-2(13Merida I. Diez E. Gaulton G. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2202-2207PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which PI 3-kinase is recruited is unclear. To determine whether IL-2 and IL-4 induce association of the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1, lysates from IL-2- and IL-4-stimulated human peripheral blood T cell blasts were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 and immunoblotted with anti-p85. Low basal levels of p85-associated IRS-1 were detected (Fig. 3, lane 1). However, an IL-2- and IL-4-dependent co-precipitation of the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase with IRS-1 was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3, lanes 2-5). These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to IL-2 in T cells leads to the rapid recruitment of the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase and suggests a possible mechanism for IL-2-induced activation of PI 3-kinase. The recent identification and cloning of the IRS-1-like molecule, IRS-2, has confirmed that both proteins exhibit substantial structural homology and indicates that they may have similar functional roles (17Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhanf Y. Yenush L. Myers M.G. Glasheen E. Wolf G. Shoelson S.E. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Although, mice lacking IRS-1 have a reduced ability to uptake glucose and are diminished in size, they are otherwise normal(22Tamemoto H. Kadowaki T. Tobe K. Yagi T. Sakara H. Hayakawa T. Terauchi Y. Ueki K. Kaburagi Y. Satoh S. Sekihara H. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Furuta Y. Ikawa Y. Kasuge M. Yazaki Y. Aizawa S. Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 37Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), suggesting that IRS-2 may compensate for the absence of IRS-1 in many signaling pathways. Also, data reported from 32D cells showing that IRS-1 and IRS-2 can be used interchangeably by IL-4 and insulin indicate that they have similar roles in mediating a mitogenic response (35Wang L.M. Keegan A. Frankel M. Paul W.P. Pierce J.H. Stem Cells. 1995; 13: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our data establish that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are both tyrosine-phosphorylated by IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15 in primary human lymphocytes. This suggests that IRS-1 and IRS-2 may have similar functions; that they both are utilized for cytokine signaling and that they may have important roles in the IL-2- and IL-4-induced response. The functional importance of IL-2-induced IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation has yet to be defined. However, IRS-1 has been shown to be important for mediating insulin and IL-4-induced proliferative effects(23Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). IRS-1 phosphorylation has been shown to enhance insulin-stimulated MAP kinase activation. It has also been suggested that the binding of IRS-1 to Grb-2 may enhance insulin-stimulated mitogenesis via the activation of the Ras/Raf pathway(16White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as the adaptor molecule Shc is recruited by IL-2 in T cells(8Zhu X. Suen K.L. Barbacid M. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5518-5522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and as Shc•Grb-2 complexes are known to form(16White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that Shc and IRS-1 have synergistic roles in the IL-2 response. Therefore, IRS-1 phosphorylation is likely to represent an alternative pathway for IL-2-induced proliferation in T cells. In addition, as the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by cytokines such as growth hormone (GH), IL-9, IFNα, insulin, and now IL-2 induce association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase, this may be a commonly used mechanism for PI 3-kinase activation. In summary, IRS-1 probably acts conjointly with other pathways of IL-2-mediated signaling, thereby amplifying the IL-2 proliferative response. The mechanism by which cytokines that bind hematopoietin family receptors (i.e. IL-2 and IL-4) induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been unclear(34Myers M.A. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that JAK1 and JAK3 can bind to and phosphorylate IRS-1. In addition, it is clear that growth hormone, which activates JAK2(36Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), also phosphorylates IRS-1(27Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Yip R. Lobo R.B. Tai L.R. Goodman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30085-30088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that a number of cytokines, such as IFNα, IFNγ, and IL-13 phosphorylate IRS-1 but do not activate JAK3 (26Ridderstrale M. Degerman E. Tornqvist H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 3471-3474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Souza S.C. Frick G.P. Yip R. Lobo R.B. Tai L.R. Goodman H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30085-30088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, while the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 may result from Janus kinase activity, it appears to be independent of the particular JAK activated. However, the finding that the JAKs can directly phosphorylate and are physically associated with the IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins suggests that the activation of JAK kinases may be a common mechanism by which many growth factors phosphorylate IRS-1 and IRS-2. Although IL-4-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation has been reported previously(23Wang L.M. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), IL-2-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation has not. This is surprising since IL-2 signal transduction is an intensively investigated area. A possible explanation for this is that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not expressed in certain T cell lines commonly used to examine IL-2 signaling. ( 2J. A. Johnston, unpublished observation.) However, it should be re-emphasized that the present study employed normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, thus reinforcing the physiological relevance of the observations. The findings described in this paper strongly suggest that IRS-1 and IRS-2 may be important docking molecules recruited in response to IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15 in human T cells. The results further indicate that the JAKs associate with and phosphorylate IRS-1 and IRS-2, and that IL-2 and IL-4 induce association of PI 3-kinase with these docking molecules and thus provide a means of amplifying the cytokine-dependent signal in a manner that may not rely on recruitment of the signaling molecules to the phosphorylated receptor. Therefore, IL-2-dependent IRS-1 and IRS-2 phosphorylation is likely to have an important role in T lymphocyte activation.

Two unique but homologous receptors for IL-8 have been cloned (IL-8RA and -B), each of which binds the IL-8 ligand with high affinity. PMN stimulated by cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibit changes in IL-8R mRNA and 125I-IL-8 binding. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment of PMN enhances, and LPS inhibits, IL-8R mRNA expression. Similarly, 125I-IL-8 ligand binding to PMN is increased by G-CSF and decreased by LPS treatment. The stimulatory effect of G-CSF on IL-8R expression is transcriptional as it is inhibited by actinomycin D and is evident in nuclear run-on analyses. In contrast, LPS down-regulates IL-8R by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The alterations in IL-8R expression are associated with similar changes in the IL-8-induced chemotactic responses of PMN. In conclusion, the two types of IL-8 receptor differ in their cellular distribution and are regulated in response to cytokines and LPS.

INTRODUCTIONThe recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes is the hallmark of acute inflammation. Chemotactic factors produced at an inflammatory site regulate vascular adhesion, transendothelial migration, and the movement of leukocytes through the extracellular matrix. Interleukin 8 is the prototype of a family of chemoattractant cytokines known as chemokines(1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar), which regulate these migratory processes and determine the cellular composition of the inflammatory response by their target cell specificity (reviewed in Refs. 1 to 3). In particular, several members of the chemokine α subfamily: IL-8,( (1)The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin 8IL-8Rinterleukin 8 receptorPMNhuman polymorphonuclear leukocytesTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αLPSlipopolysaccharide(s)fMLPformylmethionylleucylphenylalanineG-CSFgranulocyte-colony stimulating factorGM-CSFgranulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase.) GRO/melanoma growth-stimulating activity, neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2), and ENA-78 are neutrophil chemoattractants(4Yoshimura T. Matsushima K. Tanaka S. Robinson E.A. Appella E.

Med. 1991; 174: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These chemokines are produced by a wide range of cell types, notably macrophages, in response to a diverse array of stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF, as well as LPS(1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar,2Schall T.J. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar).Two receptors exhibiting high affinity binding (Kd≈2 nM) for IL-8 have been cloned, and hence have been designated as type A and B IL-8 receptors. The type A IL-8 receptor was cloned by direct expression from a PMN library (8Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and binds IL-8(9Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 10542-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, the type B receptor was identified from HL60 myelomonocytic cells (11Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been demonstrated to also bind GRO-α/melanoma growth-stimulating activity with high affinity (Kd ≈ 2 nM), and NAP-2 and ENA-78 with lower affinity(9Lee J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10542-10546Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The IL-8R proteins are members of the rhodopsin superfamily of seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptors. They share 77% overall amino acid identity, including two matching regions of 105 and 64 amino acids, and their genes co-localize to chromosome 2q35 (12Lloyd A.R. Modi W. Sprenger H. Cevario S. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 63: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The chemokine receptors, including the IL-8R and the recently cloned β chemokine receptors(13Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar,14Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar), form a new subfamily of the rhodopsin receptor superfamily. IL-8RA is strongly expressed only in PMN, although the mRNA is detectable in differentiated HL60 cells (15Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-8RB is prominently expressed in PMN, and the mRNA is also widely distributed in myelomonocytic cell lines (U937, THP-1, and HL60), the Jurkat T cell line, as well as melanoma and fibroblast lines(15Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently obtained evidence that the IL-8R mRNAs are expressed in freshly prepared peripheral blood T cells, but are progressively diminished by incubation with or without anti-CD3 stimulation(16Xu L. Kelvin D.J. Ye G.Q. Ben-Baruch A. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.-M. J. Leuk. Biol. 1994; 57: 335-342Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar).In order to better understand the physiological control of IL-8-mediated events in acute inflammation we have investigated the in vitro regulation of the IL-8 receptors A and B in human PMN.MATERIALS AND METHODSReceptor cDNAsA 1050-base pair sequence of the IL-8RA cDNA (nucleotides -20-1030 of the published cDNA) was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction with two synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′-ttgctgaaactgaagaa-3′, 5′-gacattgacagacgaaga-3′, from human genomic DNA using a thermocycler oven (Bios Corp., New Haven, CT). The reaction conditions consisted of three cycles of 96°C × 1 min, 65°C × 1 min, 72°C × 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C × 30 s, 65°C × 45 s, 72°C × 30 s, and a final extension step of 72°C × 10 min. For Northern analyses, cDNAs encoding regions of divergence between IL-8RA and -B were prepared. A 245-base pair AccI fragment (nucleotides 1-245) of this IL-8RA cDNA and a 552-base pair HhaI-HindIII fragment of an IL-8RB clone previously isolated from a U937 myelomonocytic cell library (Invitrogen) (12Lloyd A.R. Modi W. Sprenger H. Cevario S. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 63: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) consisting of nucleotides 698-1250 of the published cDNA were chosen. These regions share only approximately 60% nucleotide homology with the analogous region of the other IL-8R.CellsPeripheral blood leukocytes enriched for mononuclear cells or for granulocytes were obtained from normal donors by leukapheresis. Granulocytes were purified by dextran sedimentation, followed by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and hypotonic lysis of red blood cells. PMN were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 2-5 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The purity of the PMN preparations was judged to be greater than 90-95% by morphological criteria; the remaining cells were typically lymphocytes.Cell StimulationPurified PMN were incubated in tissue culture flasks (Costar) in the presence or absence of various cytokines or LPS. Prior to harvesting for RNA preparation, binding or chemotaxis assays cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The recombinant human cytokines used in these studies were obtained from the following sources: IL-8 was provided by Dr. M. Yamada of Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). TNF-α, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and GRO-α were provided by Dr. Craig Reynolds of the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). The recombinant G-CSF was originally obtained from Amgen (Thousand Oaks, CA). Purified LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) was purchased from Difco Laboratories. Actinomycin D and fMLP were purchased from Sigma. Purified peripheral blood T cells were activated for 8 h on anti-CD3 (OKT3, Becton Dickinson) coated plates prior to harvesting for RNA.Northern Blot AnalysesTotal RNA was prepared from guanidinium thiocyanate-treated cell lysates using CsCl ultracentrifugation(17Maniatis T. Fritsch D.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was electrophoresed through 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels. The samples were transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell), fixed by UV cross-linking, and hybridized overnight in Hybrisol I (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) at 42°C with 1-3 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA probe. Filters were washed at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS and then exposed to Kodak XAR5 film for 1-7 days. Bands on the autoradiograms were integrated with a densitometer (LKB Ultroscan), and values were normalized to the signal of a control β-actin cDNA.Nuclear Run-on AssaysNuclear run-on analyses were performed as described previously (18Marucha P.T. Zeff R.A. Krentzer D.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2603-2608PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Nuclei were prepared from 2-5 × 108 PMN per variable by hypotonic and Nonidet P-40 lysis followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Each labeling reaction included 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham) in a buffer containing 139 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.8 mM each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP. After two rounds of ethanol precipitation, the RNA pellets were resuspended in TES buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.2% SDS) before estimation of the percentage of incorporation into the RNA (usually 70-80%). 10 μg of denatured plasmid cDNAs were slot-blotted onto nylon membranes, including full-length cDNAs for the IL-8RA and -B, β-actin (as above), and pGEM-3 as a negative control. Hybridization was performed for 48-72 h at 42°C in a freshly prepared solution (50% deionized formamide, 4 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 mM Na2PO4, pH 7.0) containing 1-2 × 105cpm/ml of labeled RNA. The membrane strips were washed three times for 20 min at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.2% SDS, followed by three washes for 30 min at 56°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR5 film for 1-2 weeks after which the autoradiographs were scanned by densitometer.Receptor Binding Assays125I-IL-8 binding was performed as described previously(19Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In brief, 2 × 106 PMN were washed twice in chilled phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in chilled RPMI 1640 with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 25 mM HEPES, and then incubated in duplicate with 0.1 ng of 125I-IL-8 (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) in a total volume of 200 μl. The degree of nonspecific binding was determined by parallel incubation in the presence of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled IL-8. After incubation at 4°C for 2 h, the cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation and then washed twice with excess binding medium (as above). The tips of the tubes were cut, and radioactivity was counted in a γ counter. The nonspecifically bound radioactivity was subtracted from the total bound activity to establish specific binding.Chemotaxis AssaysCell migration was evaluated using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber technique (20Falk W.R. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) with polycarbonate filters (5 μm pore size, Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, CA). PMN were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and 50 μl per well was applied to the upper chamber. Chemoattractants were resuspended in the same medium and applied to the lower chamber. All responses were assayed in triplicate. Migration was allowed to continue at 37°C for 30 min in a 5% CO2, moist atmosphere. After the nonmigrating cells were washed from the upper surface of the filters, migrating cells were fixed in methanol and stained with Diff-Quik. The number of migrating cells in five high-powered fields were counted for each well.RESULTSThe IL-8RA and -B mRNA TranscriptsIn Northern analyses of total RNA prepared from PMN, the specific probes showed that the mRNA transcript for the IL-8RA was 2.4 kilobases and for IL-8RB was 3.1 kilobases. In addition, in some experiments, the IL-8RA probe hybridized at high stringency to an additional band at 2.2 kilobases, which may represent a transcript from the IL-8R pseudogene (designated IL-8RAP; (21Ahuja S.K. Ozcelik T. Milatovitch A. Francke U. Murphy P.M. Nature Genet. 1992; 2: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)).Regulation of IL-8R mRNA Expression by Cytokines and LPSIn initial experiments, purified human PMN were incubated for 6 h with a panel of different cytokines known to be present in acute inflammatory states, as well as the neutrophil chemoattractant fMLP, or with LPS. After each treatment, the viability of the cells was confirmed to be greater than 95% by Trypan Blue exclusion before harvesting for RNA. The Northern blots containing these RNAs were hybridized sequentially with the IL-8R probes, followed by the β-actin probe to assess the relative amounts of RNA loaded. This analysis demonstrated a substantial increase in specific mRNA for both IL-8R after treatment with G-CSF at 50 ng/ml and a dramatic reduction in the steady state IL-8R mRNA after PMN were treated with LPS at 10 ng/ml. A less marked down-regulation was found after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor α (Fig. 1). The G-CSF and LPS effects were chosen for further study.G-CSF and LPS Regulate IL-8R mRNA via Transcriptional MechanismsChanges in the steady-state level of RNA expression of a gene result from alterations in either the rate of transcription, the rate of degradation of the message, or a combination of both. After establishing the optimal doses of G-CSF and LPS (data not shown), the kinetics of the alterations in the steady state levels of IL-8R expression in PMN were investigated further. The mRNA expression of IL-8RA and -B was regulated in parallel in all experiments. Treatment of PMN with G-CSF for periods up to 18 h produced a dramatic increase (2-10-fold in four separate experiments) in steady-state IL-8R mRNA with a plateau reached at approximately 6-18 h. This contrasted with a slow but steady decline in the mRNA levels in untreated PMN (Fig. 2A). LPS treatment induced a significantly more rapid decline in the steady-state mRNA, evident after 1-2 h of treatment. Actinomycin D at a final concentration of 10 μM was added to PMN incubations in order to inhibit transcription. This treatment abrogated the up-regulation of IL-8R mRNA induced by G-CSF (Fig. 2B), whereas the addition of actinomycin D to untreated PMN induced a further decline in steady state mRNA levels. Nuclear run-on analyses confirmed the impression that G-CSF regulates IL-8R expression by enhancing transcription. The nuclear RNA signals for IL-8RA and -B in PMN were enhanced 4-6-fold in three separate experiments after 3-6 h of G-CSF treatment (Fig. 3). These data suggest that IL-8R mRNA expression in PMN is dependent on continuous transcription of the IL-8R genes, and, further, that the G-CSF effect is dependent upon enhanced transcriptional activity of the IL-8R genes.Figure 2A, kinetics of IL-8R regulation in peripheral blood PMN induced by G-CSF and LPS. RNA samples (5 μg/lane) were prepared from purified peripheral blood PMN incubated for 1-18 h in the presence or absence of G-CSF (50 ng/ml) or LPS (10 ng/ml). The autoradiographic signals were measured by densitometry and normalized to β-actin. The figure represents quantitative data from one of three replicate experiments.

The effect of actinomycin D on IL-8R mRNA regulation by LPS is shown inFig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Nuclear run-on analysis of the IL-8R mRNA in PMN treated with G-CSF or LPS. Nuclei were prepared from 2-5 × 108 purified peripheral blood PMN immediately after incubation for 3 or 6 h in medium alone (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum), or with G-CSF (50 ng/ml) or LPS (10 ng/ml), or a combination of both stimuli. The labeled nuclear RNA was hybridized with denatured plasmid cDNAs of IL-8RA and -B, β-actin, and pGEM-1. The autoradiographic signals were measured by densitometry. For quantitative analyses, the signals from nonspecific hybridization (with pGEM-1) were subtracted from those of IL-8RA and -B and then normalized to the signals of β-actin. The figure represents one of three replicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)LPS De-stabilizes IL-8R mRNAThe half-life (t½) of the IL-8R mRNA was determined by treatment of PMN in the presence or absence LPS after prior incubation with actinomycin D. Least squares regression analysis of the normalized autoradiographic data was used to calculate the numerical value of the t½. In untreated PMN, the IL-8R mRNA t½ was 3.6 h (S.E. 0.6 h; n = 3), whereas in the presence of LPS the half-life was reduced to approximately 2.2 h (S.E. 0.4 h, n = 3;Fig. 4). The estimated half-lives for the IL-8RA and -B mRNAs in these experiments were not significantly different. The nuclear run-on analyses also suggested that LPS inhibited IL-8R transcription within 3 h of treatment (2-3-fold in three separate experiments;Fig. 3). Furthermore, the addition of LPS, in combination with G-CSF treatment of PMN, abrogated the up-regulation associated with G-CSF, resulting in a similar down-regulation of transcriptional activity to that seen with LPS treatment alone (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data suggest that LPS inhibits IL-8R expression by a combination of transcriptional inhibition and decreasing mRNA stability.Figure 4Half-life of the IL-8R mRNA in PMN treated with LPS. RNA samples (5 μg/lane) were prepared from purified peripheral blood PMN incubated for 1-18 h: with medium alone, with actinomycin D (10 μM), with LPS (10 ng/ml), or preincubated with actinomycin D (10 μM) for 30 min followed by the addition of LPS (10 ng/ml). The autoradiographic signals were measured by densitometry and normalized to those of β-actin. The upper panel is quantitative data from three replicate experiments (mean ± S.E.). A set of Northern blots from a representative experiment are included in the lower panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)G-CSF and LPS Also Regulate IL-8 Receptor Binding on PMNThe expression of IL-8R on the surface of PMN was estimated by measurement of 125I-IL-8 binding. As both IL-8R demonstrate similar high affinity for the IL-8 ligand, these data are likely to reflect the combined binding capacity of both IL-8R types on the PMN surface.Fig. 5A shows that G-CSF treatment produced a sustained increase in IL-8 binding which was approximately 2-fold greater after 20 h in treated PMN in comparison with untreated cells. In contrast, LPS treatment rapidly reduced IL-8 binding on PMN.Figure 5Regulation of IL-8 binding and IL-8-induced chemotaxis on peripheral blood PMN by G-CSF or LPS. Purified peripheral blood PMN were incubated for 1-20 h in the presence or absence of G-CSF (50 ng/ml) or LPS (10 ng/ml) before being included in standard 125I-IL-8 binding assays performed at 4°C in the presence or absence of excess unlabeled ligand (A). Specific counts were determined by subtracting the counts from binding in the presence of excess unlabeled ligand from the total bound radioactivity by chemotaxis assays, utilizing a modified Boyden chamber technique, and various doses of IL-8 or medium alone (B). The data represent the mean number of cells per high power field (±S.D.) detected in 5 fields for the optimal chemotactic dose of IL-8 (50 ng/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)G-CSF and LPS Regulate IL-8 Chemotactic Responses in PMNThe ability of PMN to migrate in response to IL-8 in a standard chemotaxis assay was studied in order to examine the possible functional consequences of the alterations in IL-8R expression. G-CSF treatment produced a significant increase in the number of PMN migrating in response to an IL-8 chemotactic gradient (Fig. 5B). LPS treatment was associated with a rapid reduction in the IL-8 chemotactic response. Similar results were obtained when GRO-α was used as the chemotactic stimulus (data not shown), confirming that the expression and functional response of IL-8RB (which binds GRO) is regulated in this system.DISCUSSIONThe IL-8RA and -B are abundantly expressed on human PMN. The IL-8R mRNAs are reciprocally regulated in response to stimuli such as G-CSF and LPS, which are likely to be present in sites of acute inflammation.Responses to chemoattractant cytokines, including IL-8, may be desensitized by continued stimulation(22Samanta A.K. Oppenheim J.J. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 265: 183-189Google Scholar), confirming that the chemokine receptors are regulated via agonist-dependent mechanisms as has been shown for other rhodopsin family members (reviewed in (23Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar)). In the present work, we have demonstrated that the two IL-8R also exhibit regulation in response to exogenous stimuli. Treatment of PMN with G-CSF resulted in increased IL-8R mRNA expression, as well as IL-8 binding and chemotactic responsiveness. G-CSF has been shown to enhance PMN survival in vitro by inhibition of apoptosis(24Colotta F. Re F. Polentarutti N. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Blood. 1992; 80: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the up-regulation of IL-8R expression we have demonstrated is not explicable simply on the basis of improved PMN survival, as the IL-8R mRNA and chemotactic response to IL-8 are significantly increased above baseline levels in G-CSF-treated PMN (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). G-CSF enhances IL-8R expression by a transcriptional mechanism, as actinomycin D treatment blocked its effect, and nuclear run-on studies showed increased IL-8R signals after G-CSF treatment of PMN. This regulatory pathway, if direct, may indicate a novel G-CSF-responsive transcriptional regulatory element in the IL-8R genes. Indeed, we have recently isolated, sequenced, and characterized the genomic structure of the IL-8RB gene(25Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Lautens L. Bonner T.I. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8RB promoter region-CAT constructs demonstrated enhanced expression in HL60 cells after treatment with G-CSF, thus providing evidence for a direct transcriptional effect of G-CSF on the IL-8RB gene. Comparison of the promoter region of this gene with that of another PMN chemoattractant receptor, the fMLP receptor, has demonstrated the presence of several novel, but highly conserved, sequence motifs, which may represent tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory elements(25Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Lautens L. Bonner T.I. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these motifs were not detected in the promoter region of the IL-8RA gene(26Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Meyer R.G. Johnston J.A. Kelvin D.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2524-2532PubMed Google Scholar).Down-regulation of IL-8R expression and IL-8 responsiveness was demonstrated when PMN were incubated with LPS. This treatment induced a significant decrease in the half-life of the IL-8R mRNA, consistent with an effect on the stability of the message. In addition, IL-8R transcriptional activity appeared to be inhibited in nuclear run-on studies. LPS also has been shown to enhance the survival of PMN in vitro(24Colotta F. Re F. Polentarutti N. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Blood. 1992; 80: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to induce the expression of several genes including IL-1β (27Lord P.C.W. Wilmoth L.M.G. McCall C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1312-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and TNF-α(28Dubravec D.B. Spriggs D.R. Mannick J.A. Rodrick M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6758-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Hence, the inhibitory effect of LPS on IL-8R expression contrasts with these findings and is not related to reduced PMN survival. Hormone-induced reduction in mRNA stability has been documented for several G-protein-coupled receptors including the β2-adrenergic receptor and thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor(23Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of this altered RNA stability are not yet clear, the 3′-untranslated region of the mRNA for the β2-adrenergic receptor, as well as several other rhodopsin family members, contain AU-rich elements correlated with highly regulated, short-lived mRNAs(23Collins S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,29Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar). We have identified multiple regions of AU-rich sequence in the 3′-untranslated region of the IL-8RB gene(25Sprenger H. Lloyd A.R. Lautens L. Bonner T.I. Kelvin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The inhibitory effect of LPS on the chemotactic response of PMN to IL-8 was detected earlier than expected from the alteration in the mRNA. This may have been attributable in part to clumping and adhesion of PMN to the upper side of the polycarbonate filter. We have observed similar clumping effects with fMLP, yet LPS treatment enhances fMLP receptor mRNA expression in PMN and augments the PMN chemotactic response to fMLP.( (2)J. Johnston, submitted for publication.) Similarly, the stimulatory effect of G-CSF on chemotactic responses to IL-8 was more rapid than would be expected from the transcriptional regulation. These apparent discrepancies may relate to differences in assay sensitivity or to independent effects of these stimuli on receptor turnover. Nevertheless, our data suggest that regulation of the IL-8R after some hours of PMN exposure to G-CSF or LPS is correlated with the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms defined here.Our findings suggest that stimuli occurring in vivo in acute inflammation may alter the expression of IL-8R on PMN. We have provided preliminary evidence for the functional significance of this regulation in PMN chemotaxis. The capacity of G-CSF to stimulate PMN functions, including phagocytosis and superoxide generation, may be mediated in part by enhanced responsiveness to IL-8. Interestingly, exposure of PMN to LPS may result not only in the synthesis and release of a secondary cascade of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8(30Lloyd A.R. Oppenheim J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 169-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), but also in anti-inflammatory effects leading to decreased PMN responsiveness such as IL-1RA production (30Lloyd A.R. Oppenheim J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 169-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and down-regulation of IL-8R as we have documented here. Perhaps these immunomodulatory effects of LPS may preferentially direct PMN toward bacterially derived chemoattractants, such as fMLP. The kinetics and magnitude of these respective PMN responses may be important determinants of the outcome of acute neutrophilic inflammation. INTRODUCTIONThe recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes is the hallmark of acute inflammation. Chemotactic factors produced at an inflammatory site regulate vascular adhesion, transendothelial migration, and the movement of leukocytes through the extracellular matrix. Interleukin 8 is the prototype of a family of chemoattractant cytokines known as chemokines(1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar), which regulate these migratory processes and determine the cellular composition of the inflammatory response by their target cell specificity (reviewed in Refs. 1 to 3). In particular, several members of the chemokine α subfamily: IL-8,( (1)The abbreviations used are: IL-8interleukin 8IL-8Rinterleukin 8 receptorPMNhuman polymorphonuclear leukocytesTNF-αtumor necrosis factor αLPSlipopolysaccharide(s)fMLPformylmethionylleucylphenylalanineG-CSFgranulocyte-colony stimulating factorGM-CSFgranulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase.) GRO/melanoma growth-stimulating activity, neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2), and ENA-78 are neutrophil chemoattractants(4Yoshimura T. Matsushima K. Tanaka S. Robinson E.A. Appella E.

Med. 1991; 174: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). These chemokines are produced by a wide range of cell types, notably macrophages, in response to a diverse array of stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF, as well as LPS(1Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar,2Schall T.J. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar).Two receptors exhibiting high affinity binding (Kd≈2 nM) for IL-8 have been cloned, and hence have been designated as type A and B IL-8 receptors. The type A IL-8 receptor was cloned by direct expression from a PMN library (8Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and binds IL-8(9Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been demonstrated to also bind GRO-α/melanoma growth-stimulating activity with high affinity (Kd ≈ 2 nM), and NAP-2 and ENA-78 with lower affinity(9Lee J.

The IL-8R proteins are members of the rhodopsin superfamily of seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptors. They share 77% overall amino acid identity, including two matching regions of 105 and 64 amino acids, and their genes co-localize to chromosome 2q35 (12Lloyd A.R. Modi W. Sprenger H. Cevario S. Oppenheim J.J. Kelvin D. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 63: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The chemokine receptors, including the IL-8R and the recently cloned β chemokine receptors(13Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J.

IL-8RA is strongly expressed only in PMN, although the mRNA is detectable in differentiated HL60 cells (15Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-8RB is prominently expressed in PMN, and the mRNA is also widely distributed in myelomonocytic cell lines (U937, THP-1, and HL60), the Jurkat T cell line, as well as melanoma and fibroblast lines(15Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently obtained evidence that the IL-8R mRNAs are expressed in freshly prepared peripheral blood T cells, but are progressively diminished by incubation with or without anti-CD3 stimulation(16Xu L.

Although, at steady state, furin is predominantly found in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), it also cycles between the TGN and the cell surface. Recently, the cytoplasmic tail of furin has been shown to be sufficient for its localization to the TGN. Within the cytoplasmic domain, there are Ser residues, which we now show are sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase II in vitro, and a Tyr-containing sequence, both of which have been shown to be important for other TGN proteins to localize to this compartment. In the present study, we show by site-directed mutagenesis that these residues are important for TGN localization and recycling of furin. Mutation of the Ser residues abrogated the TGN localization. By contrast, mutation of the Tyr residue did not affect the TGN localization but impaired the internalization from the plasma membrane. These observations suggest that distinct cytoplasmic determinants are responsible for retention in the TGN and retrieval from the cell surface of furin.

A novel family of mammalian processing endoproteases homologous to the yeast Kex2 protease has been shown to play a pivotal role in the production of a wide variety of biologically active peptides and proteins. These include furin, PC1/3, PC2, PC4, PACE4, and PC5/6 (for review, see Seidah et al.(1991), Steiner et al. (1992), and Halban and Irminger(1994)). Furin is a membrane-associated protease that catalyzes cleavage of a wide variety of precursor proteins at sites marked mainly by the Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg sequence (Bresnahan et al., 1990; Hosaka et al., 1991; Misumi et al., 1991). At steady state, furin is predominantly found in the trans-Golgi network (TGN),( (1)The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkMPRmannose 6-phosphate receptorCK-IIcasein kinase IIPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.) where it undergoes endoproteolysis (Misumi et al., 1991; Molloy et al., 1994). In addition, lines of evidence have suggested that a fraction of furin is present on the cell surface (Klimpel et al., 1992; Tsuneoka et al., 1993). Recent observations indicate that furin cycles between the cell surface and the TGN (Molloy et al., 1994). Furthermore, analyses using deletion mutants and chimeric proteins have indicated that targeting to the TGN and retrieval from the cell surface of furin require its cytoplasmic tail (Molloy et al., 1994; Chapman and Munro, 1994; Bosshart et al., 1994). trans-Golgi network mannose 6-phosphate receptor casein kinase II polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The TGN is a compartment that appears as a tubuloreticular network extending from the trans-Golgi cisterna and plays a pivotal role in sorting of proteins within the exocytic pathway (Mellman and Simons, 1992; Ladinsky et al., 1994). Newly synthesized proteins delivered through the Golgi stacks to the TGN are packaged into different transport vesicles, which are directed to the plasma membrane, lysosomes, regulated secretory granules, and so on (Mellman and Simons, 1992; Bauerfeind and Huttner, 1993). Signals required for localization of membrane proteins to the TGN have been extensively investigated for TGN38 and cation-dependent and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs). In all cases, the cytoplasmic domain is responsible for the TGN localization (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Kornfeld, 1992; Luzio and Banting, 1993; Stanley and Howell, 1993; Conibear and Pearse, 1994; Mauxion et al., 1995) and is capable of interacting with cytosolic transport proteins (Glickman et al., 1989; Le Borgne et al., 1993; Jones et al., 1993). Like furin, TGN38 is predominantly localized to the TGN and cycles between this compartment and the cell surface (Luzio et al., 1990; Ladinsky and Howell, 1992; Reaves et al., 1993). By mutagenesis, a Tyr-containing sequence, YQRL, in TGN38 has been shown to function as the TGN localization signal (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993). MPRs are mainly localized to the TGN and endosomes and recycle between these compartments and the plasma membrane (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Kornfeld, 1992). Signals within the cytoplasmic tail involved in targeting and recycling of MPRs appear to be somewhat different from those of TGN38. A Tyr-containing sequence is capable of interacting with the coat protein complex in the plasma membrane (HA-II/AP-2 clathrin adaptor) but not that in the TGN (HA-I/AP-1 clathrin adaptor) (Glickman et al., 1989) and is responsible for internalization from the cell surface rather than retention in the TGN (Johnson et al., 1990; Canfield et al., 1991; Conibear and Pearse, 1994; Mauxion et al., 1995). On the other hand, a Ser residue in the MPR cytoplasmic tail, which can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CK-II), is involved in interaction with the HA-I/AP-1 adaptor complex and is closely associated with exit from the TGN (Méresse et al., 1990; Le Borgne et al., 1993; Méresse and Hoflack, 1993; Körner et al., 1994). In the case of furin, there is a Ser-containing sequence, which fits the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by CK-II (Kennelly and Krebs, 1991), and a Tyr-containing sequence, YKGL, which is reminiscent of those of TGN38 and MPRs, within the cytoplasmic domain. In the present study, we therefore examined the roles of the Ser and Tyr residues in the localization of furin to the TGN and its retrieval from the cell surface. A BamHI site was introduced at the start of the cytoplasmic domain and a XhoI site after the stop codon of mouse furin cDNA (Hatsuzawa et al., 1990) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. This BamHI-XhoI fragment was cloned into a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector, pGEX-4T-2 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). A HindIII-ApaLI fragment covering the extracellular domain of human CD4 and an ApaLI-XhoI fragment covering the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse furin, which were both made by PCR-based techniques, were cloned together between the HindIII and XhoI sites of a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). YA and SA mutants of the furin cytoplasmic tail were constructed by PCR of the cDNA fragment in pGEX-4T-2 using 5′ primers, which modified the sequence. The sequences of all the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli JM109 cells carrying the vector for the GST-furin tail fusion protein were cultured to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 in 5 ml of L broth and then treated with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside for 3 h. The cells were sedimented, resuspended in 2.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using a sonicator. The cell lysate was centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Approximately 20 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added to 200 μl of the supernatant and mixed gently for 1-2 h at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were sedimented, washed five times with CK-II buffer (20 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.9, 130 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 4.8 mM dithiothreitol), and resuspended in 50 μl of CK-II buffer. The suspension was then incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and 0.1 milliunit of recombinant CK-II (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) at 37°C for 1 h. The beads were then washed five times with CK-II buffer and resuspended in SDS-gel sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged. The supernatant was electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. The expression vector for the chimera of CD4 and furin was transfected into HepG2 or COS-7 cells by using a CellPhect transfection kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For HepG2 cells, stable transfectants were then selected in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Pools of G418-resistant HepG2 cells and COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection were trypsinized, plated onto wells of eight-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and cultured for 12 h. The cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described previously (Torii et al., 1995). In some cases, the permeabilization step was omitted. The cells were then incubated sequentially with monoclonal mouse anti-CD4 antibody (Leu-3a; Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). In antibody uptake experiments, cells were exposed to Leu-3a antibody (5 μg/ml) in culture for 1 h. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, blocked, and treated with secondary antibody. In some cases, the permeabilization step was omitted. The stained cells were observed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS4D, Leica Lasertechnik, GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). As described in the Introduction, within the furin cytoplasmic domain there is a unique Tyr residue (Tyr-758) and two Ser residues (Ser-772 and Ser-774), which lie within potential CK-II phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1). In order to examine whether the Tyr and Ser residues are important for localization and recycling of furin, these residues were changed into Ala residues (Fig. 1). At first, we examined whether the Ser residues were indeed phosphorylated by CK-II. The cytoplasmic tail sequence with or without the mutation was fused with GST. The GST-furin tail fusion protein was then expressed in E. coli, purified using glutathione-Sepharose, and incubated with recombinant CK-II in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown inFig. 2, the fusion proteins with the wild type furin tail and with the tail having the mutation of Tyr to Ala (YA mutant) were phosphorylated by CK-II. Although the identity of a minor band that migrated a little faster than the GST-fusion protein in the SDS gel is not known, it is most likely to be a degradation product of the GST-furin tail fusion protein. By contrast, the fusion protein with mutation of the two Ser residues to Ala (SA mutant) was not phosphorylated. These results indicate that either or both of the two Ser residues (Ser-772 and Ser-774) can be phosphorylated by CK-II in vitro.Figure 2Phosphorylation by CK-II. GST(-) or GST-fusion protein with wild type (WT) furin tail or with the tail having SA or YA mutation was incubated with CK-II and [γ-32P]ATP, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The position of GST-furin tail fusion protein is indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the effects of these mutations on steady state localization of furin, the furin sequence containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with or without the mutations was fused with the extracellular domain of CD4. The expression vector was stably transfected into human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody revealed that strong perinuclear staining characteristic of the Golgi was observed for the CD4 fusion protein with the wild type furin sequence (Fig. 3, WT) when the cells were permeabilized after fixation (P). When the permeabilization step was omitted (NP), no staining was observed. Essentially identical results were obtained using another chimeric construct in which the cytoplasmic domain of furin was attached to the ecto- and transmembrane domains of CD4 (data not shown). These observations are in agreement with those of others (Bosshart et al., 1994; Chapman and Munro, 1994) and indicate that the cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to confer the TGN localization. In a very small fraction of cells with most intense Golgi-like staining, some punctate staining was also observed throughout the cytoplasm under permeabilized conditions, and very weak cell surface staining was observed under non-permeabilized conditions (data not shown). These observations were similar to those reported by others (Bosshart et al., 1994) and suggest a saturable mechanism for the TGN localization of furin as proposed in the case of TGN38 (Wong and Hong, 1993; Reaves and Banting, 1994). Steady state localization of the CD4-furin tail fusion protein with the YA mutation appeared not to be significantly different from that of wild type (Fig. 3, YA). By contrast, in HepG2 cells stably transfected with the construct having the SA mutation (Fig. 3, SA), perinuclear Golgi-like staining was no longer observed under permeabilized conditions. Instead, punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm were predominant. These cytoplasmic vesicles probably correspond to endosomes as reported by others (Bosshart et al., 1994; Chapman and Munro, 1994). Under non-permeabilized conditions, moderate cell surface staining was observed. In cells transfected with the construct having mutations at both Tyr and Ser residues (Fig. 3, YA/SA), more intense cell surface staining as well as punctate cytoplasmic staining was observed. We also transiently transfected the fusion constructs with or without the mutations into monkey kidney COS-7 cells and observed essentially the same staining pattern for each construct (Fig. 4).Figure 4Steady state localization of CD4-furin tail chimeras in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells transiently expressing CD4-fusion protein with the wild type or mutant furin tail were stained using anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. Details and abbreviations are similar to those in the legend toFig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the effects of the above mutations on recycling of the fusion protein from the cell surface, we then performed antibody uptake experiments. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the fusion construct were incubated with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody in culture, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown inFig. 5, cells transfected with the CD4-wild type furin tail construct internalized the antibody and localized it predominantly to a perinuclear Golgi region. This result was in good agreement with that reported by others (Molloy et al., 1994; Chapman and Munro, 1994). In cells expressing the fusion protein with the YA mutation, the antibody uptake was inefficient. Non-permeabilized cells showed intense cell surface staining. Furthermore, many endosome-like vesicles were stained, although a perinuclear region was also significantly stained. These results suggest that the YA mutation causes retardation in endocytosis of the fusion protein from the plasma membrane. By contrast, in cells expressing the fusion protein with the SA mutation, cell surface staining was barely detectable. However, no Golgi-like staining was observed, and endosome-like staining was prominent. These observations suggest that although the SA mutant is indeed endocytosed from the plasma membrane to endosomes, it is unable to move from endosomes to the TGN. The staining pattern observed in cells expressing the chimera with both YA and SA mutations appeared to be most different from that in wild type-expressing cells. Intense cell surface staining and no Golgi-like staining were observed. Furin was first found to be predominantly localized to the TGN, but more recent studies have shown that it also cycles between the TGN and the cell surface (Molloy et al., 1994) and that its cytoplasmic tail is necessary and sufficient to confer the correct localization and recycling (Molloy et al., 1994; Chapman and Munro, 1994; Bosshart et al., 1994). We noted that the cytoplasmic domain of furin contains (i) a unique Tyr residue within a sequence reminiscent of previously described Tyr-containing TGN localization motifs and (ii) two Ser residues that lie within consensus CK-II sites. In the present study, we examined if these residues were important for TGN localization and recycling by expressing chimeras of the CD4 ectodomain and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of furin. When the Tyr was mutated to Ala, retention of the fusion protein in the TGN appeared not to be impaired. However, its retrieval from the plasma membrane to the TGN was significantly retarded (Fig. 5). A similar phenomenon has been reported in the case of MPRs, which are also present in the TGN and cycle between this compartment and the cell surface (Conibear and Pearse, 1994; Mauxion et al., 1995). Previous studies have established that there are internalization signals containing unique Tyr residues within the cytoplasmic domains of constitutively recycling receptors (for review, see Trowbridge (1991), Luzio and Banting(1993), and Sandoval and Bakke(1994)). When receptors such as low density lipoprotein and transferrin receptors bind their ligands at the plasma membrane, they undergo rapid internalization and are delivered to endosomes. Here they release their bound ligands and recycle back to the cell surface. Thus, the Tyr-containing sequence is a signal for delivery of these receptors from the cell surface to endosomes. The data we presented here show that this is also true for furin. We confirmed that the Ser residues can be phosphorylated by CK-II in vitro. The data presented here indicate that the Ser residues are important for the TGN localization of furin, although it is unknown whether these residues are phosphorylated in vivo. When the Ser residues were mutated to Ala, the CD4-furin chimera was no longer retained in the TGN; instead it was predominantly found in endosome-like structures and at the plasma membrane. An antibody uptake experiment showed that the SA mutant chimera was indeed internalized from the cell surface but did not reach to the TGN. The delivery of the chimera from the cell surface appeared to be blocked in an endosomal compartment. That furin passes through endosomes on its way from the cell surface to the TGN has been demonstrated by the recent data of Chapman and Munro(1994). They have shown that internalization of a furin chimera is blocked at endosomes when cells expressing the chimera are treated with chloroquine, which neutralizes acidic organelles. In this concern, the data of Bosshart et al.(1994) are also noteworthy. They have provided evidence that a fraction of furin molecules is delivered to a lysosomal compartment for degradation, although it is unclear whether routing of furin to lysosomes occurs directly from an internal site or involves a round of transport through the cell surface. Taken together, we postulate either or both of the following possibilities for the role of the Ser residues. One is that the Ser residues are essential for retention of furin molecules in the TGN. This is supported by the data that the SA mutant is localized to endosomes and the plasma membrane at steady state. The other possibility is that the Ser residues are involved in retrieval from endosomes to the TGN of furin molecules, which have gone out of the TGN to endosomes or are internalized from the plasma membrane to endosomes. The observations for the YA/SA mutant support the above mentioned roles of the Tyr and Ser residues. Both retention in the TGN and internalization from the cell surface of the YA/SA chimera were severely impaired.Fig. 6 illustrates the models for trafficking of furin and its mutants on the basis of the observations presented here and the data of others (Chapman and Munro, 1994; Bosshart et al., 1994). Basically, the majority of furin molecules are retained in the TGN. A saturable mechanism may underlie the retention as proposed in the case of TGN38 (Hong and Wong, 1993; Reaves and Banting, 1994). A fraction of the molecules released from the TGN retention may be delivered to the plasma membrane and cycle back to the TGN via endosomes and/or may be directly delivered to endosomes. Then, the molecules in endosomes may return to the TGN. Our data indicate that, to confer correct TGN localization, the cytoplasmic tail of furin contains at least two signals: the Tyr residue that is involved in internalization from the cell surface to endosomes and the Ser residues that can be phosphorylated by CK-II in vitro and are involved in retention in and retrieval from endosomes to the TGN. However, whether phosphorylation of these residues regulates localization of furin in vivo is yet to be determined. In MPRs, HA-II/AP-2 plasma membrane adaptor has been shown to interact with a Tyr-containing sequence (Glickman et al., 1989), and HA-I/AP-1 Golgi adaptor has been suggested to recognize another region of the cytoplasmic tail, probably the Ser residues of the consensus CK-II sites (Glickman et al., 1989; Le Borgne et al., 1993). Furthermore, Méresse et al.(1990) have shown that the Ser residues are phosphorylated by a CK-II-like activity associated with the HA-I/AP-1 adaptor. These data are compatible with the notion that the Tyr and Ser residues are involved in retrieval from the plasma membrane and retention in the TGN, respectively, of MPRs. Taken together with the data presented here, we think that similar mechanisms underlie localization to the TGN and recycling of furin. By contrast, in the case of another TGN-resident protein, TGN38, the Tyr-containing motif appears to be responsible for both retention in the TGN and retrieval from the cell surface (Bos et al., 1993). However, there is a report showing that a Ser residue, which is positioned two residues upstream of the Tyr, is also important for the TGN retention (Hong and Wong, 1993). Furthermore, Ponnambalam et al.(1994) have shown that not only the cytoplasmic tail but also the transmembrane domain of TGN38 is implicated in its correct localization. Thus, the localization mechanisms of TGN38 may be somewhat different from those of furin and MPRs. Recently, a protein complex including an unidentified protein of 62 kDa and Rab6 has been reported to be capable of binding the TGN38 cytoplasmic tail (Jones et al., 1993). However, it has not been examined if the cytoplasmic tail can interact with the clathrin adaptor complexes. Further analyses on interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of the TGN membrane proteins and cytosolic factors will be required to understand the mechanisms underlying retention in the TGN and recycling of these proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2013000529,"In Aspergillus nidulans, the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in ambient pH is mediated by the PacC zinc finger transcriptional regulator. At alkaline ambient pH, PacC is proteolytically processed to a functional form serving as an activator of alkaline-expressed genes and a repressor of acid-expressed genes. This activation of PacC occurs in response to a signal mediated by the products of the pal genes. Thus, the products of the palA, -B, -C, -F, -H, and -I genes constitute an alkaline ambient pH signal transduction pathway. How the pal signal transduction pathway senses ambient pH and transduces a signal to trigger PacC processing is a fascinating unresolved problem. We have cloned and sequenced the palB gene. The predicted palB gene product has similarity to the catalytic domain of the calpain family of calcium-activated cysteine proteases. We have shown, however, that the PalB protein does not catalyze the final step of proteolytic processing of PacC."

Gel shift analysis with purified recombinant NS1 confirmed the binding of the viral protein to a specific region of the viral 5′-UTRs. A model describing the possible role of these cellular and viral RNA-binding proteins in regulating influenza virus mRNA translation will be discussed."

In MDCK cells, a similar effect of wortmannin on basolateral to apical transcytosis of ricin was found, whereas apical to basolateral transcytosis was inhibited to a lesser degree. Transcytosis of dimeric IgA in MDCK cells expressing the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor was also reduced to 50% of controls, suggesting that wortmannin inhibits membrane translocation rather than sorting of specific proteins in the transcytotic pathway. This effect of wortmannin is selective, however, in that endocytosis at the basolateral domain and recycling at both the basolateral and apical membrane domains are unaffected, and apical endocytosis and apical secretion are only moderately reduced. We have shown previously that cAMP stimulates a late stage in basolateral to apical transcytosis in MDCK cells through activation of protein kinase A (Hansen, S. H., and Casanova, J. E.(1994) J. Cell Biol. 126, 677-687). Elevation of cellular cAMP still induced a 100% increase in transcytosis in wortmannin-treated cells, but transcytosis was no longer increased when compared to cells which received no drugs. In contrast, in experiments using a 17°C block to accumulate ricin internalized from the basolateral surface in the apical compartment of MDCK cells, wortmannin had little effect on the stimulation of transcytosis by activators of protein kinase A observed under these conditions. The data thus suggest the existence of a wortmannin-sensitive step in the transcytotic pathway, positioned after endocytosis but prior to translocation into the protein kinase A-sensitive apical compartment, implying a role for phosphoinositide 3-kinase in an intermediate step in transcytosis in polarized epithelial cells.

In this report we examine how interactions between these residues and agonists activate inositol phosphate production in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. [Sar1] angiotensin (Ang II) II and [Sar1]Ang II-amide stimulated a 5-fold inositol phosphate response from wild-type AT1 receptor. The peptide antagonist [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II and the non-peptide agonist L-162,313 produced a partial but saturating response. Stimulation of wild-type receptor by [Sar1]Ang II-amide and the mutant K199Q and K199A receptors by [Sar1]Ang II demonstrates that AT1 receptor activation is not critically dependent on the ion-pairing of the α-COOH group of Ang II with Lys199. The mutation of His256 produced diminished inositol phosphate response without commensurate change in binding affinity of ligands. The His256 side chain is critical for maximal activation of the AT1 receptor, although isosteric Gln substitution is sufficient for preserving the affinity for Phe8-substituted analogues of [Sar1]Ang II. Therefore, AT1 receptor activation requires interaction of Phe8 side chain of Ang II with His256, which is achieved by docking the α-COOH group of Phe8 to Lys199.

https://openalex.org/W2069540105,"Cyclin B1 mRNA expression varies through the cell cycle with its peak in G2/M. In cycling mammalian cells, its lowest level is in G1 with a steady increase in S until a level 50-fold greater than that in G1 is reached. In order to characterize the transcriptional component to this variation in expression, we cloned the upstream region 872 base pairs upstream from the start site of the cyclin B1 gene and have demonstrated that it confers cell cycle-dependent regulation onto two reporter genes, both chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and luciferase. Its activity was 25-fold greater in G2/M than in G1 in HeLa cells with intermediate activity in S. This cyclical activity could be seen with sequences encompassing only 90 base pairs upstream from the start site. Protein binding to this region was demonstrated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and the binding profiles appeared to vary depending upon the phase of the cycle in which the extracts are made. Thus, transcriptional control plays an important role in determining cyclin B1 mRNA levels, and cell cycle-dependent activity is regulated through interactions with the region 90 bases upstream from the start site.

Cyclin B1 expression is required for the activation of mitosis or maturation promoting factor. This activation, which triggers the progression into mitosis is dependent both upon the binding of Cdk-1 (synonymous with p34cdc2) to cyclin B1 as well as a series of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events(1Hatakeyama M.

Cyclin B1 was first identified as a protein whose level oscillated during the sea urchin oocyte cell cycle(6Evans T. Rosenthal E.T. Youngblom J. Distel D. Hunt T. Cell. 1983; 33: 389-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that cyclin B1 was expressed ubiquitously in all eukaryotes examined and that the level of cyclin B1 was minimal in G1, began to rise in S phase, and peaked at the G2/M transition(5Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The increase in cyclin B1 protein in somatic cycling mammalian cells is mirrored by oscillations in the expression of the cyclin B1 mRNA which increases by over 50-fold as cells progress through G1 and S into G2/M (7Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar,8Markiewicz D. Flick M. Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. Int. J. Rad. Oncol. Biol.

Thus, the increase in cyclin B1 protein that is required to activate maturation promoting factor is likely to depend upon its mRNA level. The importance of the fluctuations of cyclin B1 mRNA in controlling the cell cycle raises the question of how cyclin B1 mRNA level is regulated. Understanding cyclin B1 mRNA regulation could be important in understanding the mechanisms leading to cell cycle control in G2/M. Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls are likely to be involved. Pines and Hunter(7Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), using nuclear run-on assays, suggested that the transcription of cyclin B1 was increased in cells synchronized by thymidine-aphidicolin treatment in G2/M as compared to cells in G1. Maity et al.(9Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) showed that the stability of cyclin B1 mRNA also fluctuated through the cell cycle with a half-life of 1-2 h in G1, 8 h in S, and 13 h in G2/M. While changes in the cyclin B1 mRNA stability are clearly significant, they alone are not of sufficient magnitude to account for the variation in level of 50-fold that is seen in many cycling cells. To further investigate the role of transcription in the cell cycle regulation of the human cyclin B1 gene, we have cloned its 5′ upstream regulatory region and in this report describe its cell cycle-regulated promoter activity. We have also defined a short region of the promoter that can confer cell cycle-regulated transcription and that shows variation in protein binding through the cell cycle as evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A human placental genomic library cloned in the Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene) was screened using a full-length (1.4-kilobase) human cyclin B1 cDNA as a radiolabeled probe. We obtained a positive insert of approximately 20 kilobases. From this clone, we polymerase chain reaction-amplified a 949-bp( (1)The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase.) clone using 5′ upstream and coding sequences of the human cyclin B1 gene as primers. This 949-bp clone was sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). It includes 872 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site identified by Pines and Hunter(7Pines J. Hunter T.

The 949-bp fragment was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) using TA cloning(13Mead D.A. Pey N.K. Herrnstadt C. Marcil R.A. Smith L.M.

The 949-bp clone was subcloned into pCAT-BASIC (Promega) upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene at the 5′ HindIII and 3′ XbaI sites. To delete part of the 5′ region, the 949-bp clone was digested with PstI to generate a fragment including 207 bp of upstream sequence and part of the upstream untranslated region of the cyclin B1 gene. This fragment was subcloned into pCAT-BASIC at the PstI site. Two shorter constructs of 140 bp and 90 bp were generated with polymerase chain reaction using sequences at -140 and -90 as upstream primers and a sequence at +72 as the downstream primer. The amplified fragments were then subcloned into pCATBASIC at the 5′ HindIII and 3′ PstI sites. The 949-bp clone was also subcloned into pGL2-BASIC (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene at the 5′ SacI and 3′ KpnI sites. The cyclin D1-CAT and DNA polymerase α-CAT plasmids were obtained from Bruno Calabretta (Thomas Jefferson University)(14Sala A. Nicolaides N.C. Engelhard A. Bellon T. Lawe D.C. Arnold A. Grana X. Giordano A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1402-1406PubMed Google Scholar). The hTK-CAT and histone H3.2-CAT plasmids were obtained from Amy S. Lee (University of Southern California)(15Li L.

HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were grown to 50-70% confluence and then transfected using the calcium phosphate method(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μg (for 100-mm dishes) or 18 μg (for 60-mm dishes) of DNA in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) and 250 mM CaCl2 was added dropwise to 2 × HEPES-buffered saline (280 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, 12 mM dextrose, 50 mM HEPES). The calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitate was allowed to form for 30 min before being added dropwise to cells. The following day, the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitate was removed, and the cells were washed twice with serum-free media followed by treatment with one of the following drugs: nocodazole, 0.04 μg/ml for 24 h, mimosine, 400 μM for 24 h; thymidine, 2 mM for 16 h; or aphidicolin, 1 μg/ml for 16 h. Cells were then harvested using Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). For β-galactosidase assays, equal amounts of cell lysate and assay buffer (120 mM Na2HPO4, 80 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactopyranoside) were mixed and incubated for 30 min before absorbance readings were taken at 420 nm. CAT assays were performed using a liquid scintillation counting method(16Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with [3H]chloramphenicol (50 mCi/mmol) and n-butyryl coenzyme A (5 mg/ml) for 2-3 h. The reactions were terminated with mixed xylenes, and the organic phase was back-extracted twice and then counted in a scintillation counter. For luciferase assays, cell lysates were mixed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and light intensity was measured for 10 s on a Berthold LB9501 luminometer. Cells were collected and resuspended in 40 mM citrate buffer and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and frozen at -80°C until analysis. Prior to analysis, cells were thawed and stained with propidium iodide as described previously (17Vindelov L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) and analyzed on the Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Data were interpreted using the CellFIT cell cycle analysis program. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schreiber et al.(18Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) from HeLa cells that were treated with thymidine-aphidicolin, mimosine, or nocodazole. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the minimal 90-bp cyclin B1 promoter were annealed and 32P-end-labeled with T4 kinase. DNA-protein complexes were formed in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 ng (40 fmol) of the labeled oligonucleotide, 3 μg of extract, and 300 ng of salmon sperm DNA (nonspecific competitor) for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were run on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in TGE buffer (25 mM Tris, 200 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA). The gels were then dried, and autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen. To isolate the 5′ upstream sequences of the human cyclin B1 gene, we screened a human placental genomic library with the human cyclin B1 cDNA as a probe. From this clone we subcloned a 949-bp fragment that comprised 872 bases upstream of the 5′ start site and extended into the transcribed portion of the cyclin B1 gene.Fig. 1 shows the sequence of this clone. Several consensus sequences characteristic of eukaryotic promoter elements are present. At -25 upstream from the transcriptional start site published by Pines and Hunter(7Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), there is a “TATA-like” element and at -60 there is a CAAT box. Further upstream at -135 there is an Sp1 consensus element. In order to test the upstream sequences for promoter activity, we placed the 5′ upstream region of the cyclin B1 gene into a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter vector, pCAT-BASIC, a plasmid that has no promoter or enhancer sequences. The plasmid containing the 5′ upstream sequences, pCAT-upcB, was then transfected into HeLa cells using the calcium phosphate method. The transfected cells were treated with various drugs to arrest them in different phases of the cell cycle: nocodazole to block in G2/M phase, mimosine to block in late G1 phase, or thymidine to block in S phase.Fig. 2 shows representative flow cytometry profiles of cell cycle position as determined by DNA content after treatment with these drugs. After a 24-h treatment with nocodazole, 85-90% of the cells were arrested at the G2/M boundary. Mimosine, a plant amino acid that has been shown to arrest cells in late G1(19Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,20Mosca P. Dijkwel P. Hamlin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), blocked 65-75% of the cells in G1 after 24 h of treatment. Thymidine blocked 55-65% of the cells in S phase as determined by flow cytometry after a 16-h treatment. Those cells blocked in G1 at the G1/S interface will appear as G1 cells by this type of analysis. Following cell cycle arrest for 16 or 24 h, the cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity. A representative experiment is shown inFig. 3. The transfected cells arrested in G2/M by nocodazole had 11-26-fold greater CAT activity than cells arrested in late G1 by mimosine. Cells arrested in S phase by thymidine had an intermediate level. pCAT-BASIC had essentially no activity in the transfected cells in any phase. A CAT vector with the SV40 early promoter and enhancer sequences (pCAT-CONTROL) was similarly transfected into HeLa cells which were then blocked in different phases of the cell cycle and showed no variation in activity with the cell cycle. The activity of pCAT-upcB in nocodazole-arrested cells was essentially equivalent to that of pCAT-CONTROL indicating that cyclin B1 promoter activity at that phase of the cycle was strong.Figure 3Promoter activity of the upstream sequences of cyclin B1. HeLa cells were transfected with one of the following CAT plasmids: the SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences (pCAT-CONTROL), no promoter or enhancer sequences (pCAT-BASIC), or the 949-bp upstream region of cyclin B1 (pCAT-upcB) upstream from CAT. A β-galactosidase plasmid (pSVβ-gal) was included in the transfection as an internal control for transfection efficiency. 18 h after transfection, the cells were treated with either mimosine to block in G1, thymidine to block in S, or nocodazole to block in G2/M. Cells were then harvested and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activity. After normalization to β-galactosidase values, the ratios of CAT activity in different phases of the cell cycle were the same as the ratios when comparing absolute CAT activity levels. CAT activity shown here has not been normalized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To be sure that the cell cycle differences we observed were specific for the cyclin B1 upstream sequences and not an artifact of the experimental assay, we tested several other promoters in the same system. We transfected plasmids containing the human DNA polymerase α, the human cyclin D1, the human thymidine kinase, or the hamster histone H3.2 promoters (14Sala A. Nicolaides N.C. Engelhard A. Bellon T.

Since HeLa cells are effectively deficient for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) due to the binding of pRb to the E7 protein of human papilloma virus(25Munger K. Werness B. Dyson N. Phelps W. Harlow E. Howley P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4099-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), and the regulation of E2F transactivation is affected by its interaction with pRb, these cells may not regulate E2F-activated genes in the same way as cells having normal pRb activity(26Lukas J. Muller H. Bartkova J. Spitkovsky D. Kjerulff A. Jansen-Durr P. Strauss M. Bartek J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cells deficient in pRb, for example, bypass the requirement for cyclin D1 in G1(26Lukas J. Muller H. Bartkova J. Spitkovsky D. Kjerulff A. Jansen-Durr P. Strauss M. Bartek J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In evaluating these experiments, it should also be noted that the CAT protein has a half-life of about 50 h (27Thompson J. Hayes L. Lloyd D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The long half-life can affect the interpretation of experiments because once a cell has synthesized the CAT protein, CAT activity would be detectable for the duration of the experiment. Since the majority of the cells in an exponentially growing population of HeLa cells are in either G1 or S phase, the cells in S would lead to considerable synthesis of the CAT protein by an S phase-specific promoter. The CAT protein because of its long half-life would remain detectable as cells progressed into G1. In contrast, few cells would be in G2/M and spend little time at that point since it is the shortest component of the HeLa cell cycle. Thus, this method should clearly distinguish transcription in G2/M from that in G1 or S, but would not be expected to clearly separate transcription in G1 from S phase. After transient transfection and cell cycle blockade, the S phase-specific promoters showed 1.3-3.4 times more CAT activity in S phase than in G1 and slightly more CAT activity in S than in G2/M, as shown inFig. 4. In contrast, however, the cyclin B1 upstream region vector had markedly higher CAT activity in G2/M compared to other phases of the cell cycle. Thus, it is unlikely that the cell cycle-regulated activity of the cyclin B1 promoter is an artifact of our experimental assay or of the drugs used to induce blockage in the cell cycle. These experiments indicate that the upstream region of the human cyclin B1 gene has promoter activity that is low in G1, higher in S, and maximal at G2/M. To further confirm the cell cycle-regulated activity of the cyclin B1 promoter, we subcloned the cyclin B1 promoter upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL2-BASIC vector (pGL2-upcB). While the CAT mRNA has a short half-life, its protein has a long half-life of 50 h. In contrast, both the luciferase mRNA and protein have short half-lives. The half-life of the luciferase protein is approximately 3 h(27Thompson J. Hayes L. Lloyd D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, we could transfect a luciferase expression vector driven by the cyclin B1 promoter, follow the cells as they cycled, and assess the activity of the cyclin B1 promoter throughout the cell cycle by monitoring luciferase activity. These experiments did not depend upon pharmacological blockade of the cell cycle. HeLa cells were cotransfected with pGL2-upcB and pSVβ-gal (as an internal control for transfection efficiency) and treated with aphidicolin for 16 h. After the cells were released from the aphidicolin block, cells were harvested every 3 h for a 24-h period. Cell lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity and by flow cytometry for DNA content. As shown inFig. 5A, the cells were predominantly in G1 at the start of the experiment. At this point, the level of luciferase activity was low. As the cells entered S phase, luciferase activity rose. Luciferase activity peaked (at 9 times greater than the level at the time of release) 10 h after release when the majority of cells were in G2/M. Once the cells exited mitosis and re-entered G1, luciferase activity began to drop. At 21 h after release, only 11% of the cells remained in G2/M while 62% were in G1. At this point, the luciferase activity had fallen to a level only twice that of the level at the time of release from the aphidicolin block. This decline in luciferase activity was not a result simply of activity declining with time after transfection, but was a result of cell cycle progression. This can be seen from the experiment shown inFig. 5B. Some of the transfected synchronized cells from the experiment shown inFig. 5A were also treated with nocodazole. By blocking the cells in G2/M and following them with time, we could assess the effect that increasing time after transfection had on the luciferase activity. As shown inFig. 5B, nocodazole blocked the cells in G2/M, yet luciferase activity remained high throughout the remainder of the experiment. Thus, the cyclin B1 promoter conferred cell cycle variation to the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. It resulted in the lowest level of luciferase activity in G1, an increasing level in S phase, and the maximal level in G2/M corresponding to a pattern paralleling the level of cyclin B1 mRNA in cycling cells. To map the sequences responsible for conferring the cell cycle-regulated transcription of cyclin B1, we generated a series of plasmids containing smaller fragments of the cyclin B1 promoter. The full-length upcB construct was further truncated to generate fragments that are 207, 140, and 90 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. All of these constructs included the putative TATA element and the CAAT box. The -207 and -140 constructs include the Sp1 consensus site, whereas the -90 construct does not. These constructs were then subcloned into pCAT-BASIC and used in transient transfection assays as described inFig. 3. As shown inFig. 6, the -207 construct was found to have 7-fold greater CAT activity in transfected cells blocked in G2/M compared to transfected cells blocked in late G1. The -140 and -90 constructs were found to have 16-fold greater CAT activity in transfected cells blocked in G2/M compared to transfected cells blocked in late G1. These results indicate that a fragment as small as 90 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the human cyclin B1 gene is sufficient for cell cycle-regulated promoter activity. In order to search for proteins that may be important for the cell cycle-regulated transcription of the human cyclin B1 gene, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the cyclin B1 promoter as the DNA probe. The 90-bp region of the cyclin B1 promoter that was found to be sufficient for conferring cell cycle-regulated activity was 32P-end-labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells that were synchronized and harvested when the majority of cells had exited from mitosis into G1 (early G1), cells that were blocked in G1 with mimosine (late G1), or blocked in G2/M with nocodazole. As shown inFig. 7, four bands were seen when the 90-bp fragment of the cyclin B1 promoter was incubated with G1 extracts. The arrow indicates the position of a fainter, but reproducible band that was seen when extracts were made from late G1 cells, but not from extracts of early G1 cells. When the assay was performed using extracts from nocodazole-blocked cells, only three faint bands were seen. This suggests that there may be inhibitory protein(s) present during G1 that down-regulate transcription of cyclin B1. In this study, we have described the isolation of the 5′ upstream sequences of the human cyclin B1 gene, and, using two different experimental assay systems, we have shown that these sequences show promoter activity that is strongly cell cycle-regulated. Its activity was lowest in G1, rose to an intermediate level in S phase, and reached a peak in G2/M. This activity parallels the pattern of expression of the cyclin B1 mRNA. We found that the cyclin B1 promoter was 11-26 times more active in G2/M than in G1. Previous studies have shown that the level of cyclin B1 mRNA present during G2/M is up to 50-fold greater than the amount of mRNA present in G1. Data from our laboratory have shown that variations in cyclin B1 mRNA stability during the cell cycle contribute to the vast differences in the cyclin B1 mRNA level(9Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The half-life of the cyclin B1 message is 13 h in G2 and 2 h in G1. The cyclical activity of the cyclin B1 promoter, along with the differences in the cyclin B1 half-life, suggest that both changes in the rate of transcription and changes in mRNA stability are responsible for the cell cycle-regulated expression of this gene. Piaggio et al.(11Piaggio G. Farina A. Perrotti D. Manni I. Fuschi P. Sacchi A. Gaetano C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have recently cloned the upstream region of the human cyclin B1 gene. They found that the upstream region had promoter activity that was minimal in quiescent or G0 cells, but increased in activity gradually after serum stimulation. However, they were unable to show any cell cycle-specific regulation of activity. In their experiments, the activity of the cyclin B1 promoter did not fall following mitosis and entry into G1. This may have been due to their use of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as their reporter gene, since CAT has a half-life that is considerably longer than the cell cycle time of about 24 h in the cells they used. High levels of CAT protein present during mitosis would still be present once cells cycled back into G1. Cogswell et al.(12Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have also reported the isolation of a cyclin B1 promoter element using the upstream sequences from the cyclin B1 gene. They found that the activity of the cyclin B1 promoter was enhanced in vivo during G2/M as compared to S. Their experiments also use CAT as the reporter gene and hence do not show cyclical activity of the cyclin B1 promoter. In this study, Cogswell et al.(12Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) identified a region as being important for cell cycle regulation that is distal to the -90 region that we studied. This region contained a binding site for the upstream stimulatory factor and is required for in vitro transcription of the cyclin B1 gene. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, they were able to identify upstream stimulatory factor binding to this region. This binding was greater in extracts from G2/M phase cells than in S phase cells, suggesting that upstream stimulatory factor stimulates transcription of cyclin B1 during G2/M. This is in contrast to our finding that suggests the presence of inhibitory protein(s) that repress cyclin B1 transcription during G1. Together these experiments suggest that regulation of the cyclical activity of the cyclin B1 promoter may be controlled by several regions and that their action may be redundant. The isolation of the cyclin B1 promoter and its further characterization will provide us with a better understanding of how the cyclin B1 gene is regulated and thus how transcription may be triggered in a cell cycle-specific fashion. The cdc25C promoter has been identified as being specific for G2/M transcription(28Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cdc25C dephosphorylates the inhibitory phosphorylations on p34cdc2(cdk-1) and is required for activation of maturation promoting factor and for transition into M and G1(3Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar,5Norbury C. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 441-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its mRNA cycles with the highest levels in G2/M and the lowest in G1, yet in spite of the cyclical expression of the mRNA, the protein itself appears to be present in constant amounts through the cell cycle making the physiological significance of the cell cycle regulation of cdc25C mRNA difficult to understand(29Sadhu K. Reed S.I. Richardson H. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5139-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar,30Millar J. Blevitt J. Gerace L. Sadhu K. Featherstone C. Russell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10500-10504Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The cdc25C promoter lacks a canonical TATA element(28Lucibello F.C. Truss M. Zwicker J. Ehlert F. Beato M. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An element termed the cycle-dependent element was identified to act as a cis-acting repressor element that is responsible for the low level of expression of cdc25C during G0 and G1. This cycle-dependent element contains the sequence GGCGG that when mutated resulted in increased expression of the promoter in G1. The cyclin B1 gene contains in the 5′-untranslated region of its mRNA a GGCGG sequence. However, the adjacent bases are not homologous to the cycle-dependent element of cdc25C. Furthermore, the GGCGG sequence that was identified as important in the cycle-dependent element is located downstream of the transcriptional start site of cyclin B1 making it less likely to play a role in the regulation of cyclin B1, but not excluding that possibility. The finding of promoters that are actively transcribed during G2/M raises another interesting question with respect to cell cycle-dependent transcription. Generally, transcription is turned off during mitosis at which point the chromosomes are condensed(31Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1984; 37: 731-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,32Prescott D. Bender M. Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 26: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Since the cyclin B1 gene is maximally active during this phase of the cell cycle, there must be novel mechanisms that allow transcription of this gene to occur under conditions in which transcription generally is repressed. Further study of this promoter should reveal important insights into transcriptional control during chromosome condensation and perhaps will reveal regions protected from chromosome condensation. Currently, the B-type cyclins are a well-characterized class of proteins, but the mechanisms underlying their transcriptional regulation are poorly understood. Although genes have been identified in yeast that regulate the transcription of cyclin B1, their mammalian homologs are unknown(33Amon A. Tyers M. Futcher B. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1993; 74: 993-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,34Maher M. Cong F. Kindelberger D. Nasmyth K. Dalton S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3129-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A trans-acting factor that acts positively during the G2/M transition or negatively during G1 has yet to be identified in mammalian cells. The existence of such proteins is likely given that the cyclin B1 promoter is maximally active during G2/M and given the differential patterns of gel retardation found through the cell cycle using portions of the cyclin B1 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W1658389211,"Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) is one of a member of related polypeptides that are important in bone formation and other developmental processes. We isolated the BMP-4 gene from a mouse genomic library and characterized the exon-intron structure and one of the candidate promoters. Two alternative 5′-noncoding exons, 1A and 1B, were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction using Exon 1A, Exon 1B, and Exon 3 primers indicate the 1A-containing transcript is the primary BMP-4 mRNA expressed in bone cell cultures. Primer extension analysis supports that 1A is the major promoter utilized in bone cell cultures as well as in 9.5-day mouse embryos. 1A promoter activity indicate selective DNA regions functional in bone cells. We found potential regulatory response regions in the 1A 5′-flanking region of the BMP-4 gene for the chicken ovalbumin upstream-transcription factor I (COUP-TFI). Specific binding to the COUP-TFI response regions in the BMP-4 1A promoter was demonstrated. By co-transfection of a COUP-TFI expression plasmid with the BMP-4 1A promoter in fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts, we demonstrated that COUP-TFI inhibits the BMP-4 promoter activity. This suggests that COUP-TFI could act as a silencer for BMP-4 transcription in vivo.

This suggests that COUP-TFI could act as a silencer for BMP-4 transcription in vivo. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)1 family comprises a group of closely related polypeptides in the transforming growth factor β superfamily, which were identified initially by their capacity to stimulate ectopic bone formation in vivo (Wozney et al., 1988; Celeste et al., 1990). Recently, we have found that mRNAs for BMP-2 and BMP-4 are expressed in FRC osteoblasts as they differentiate in primary culture prior to forming mineralized bone nodules (Harris et al., 1994a). Expression of BMP-2 and BMP-4 mRNA coincides with expression of several osteoblast differentiation markers by these cells, including osteocalcin, osteopontin, and alkaline phosphatase (Harris et al., 1994a). BMP-4 is synthesized as a large precursor, as are other transforming growth factor β members, and is processed to a mature dimer form, which is then secreted into the extracellular matrix (Suzuki et al., 1993). Recombinant BMP-4 stimulates new cartilage and bone formation when implanted near long bones (Shimizu et al., 1994). Expression patterns of BMP-4 mRNA in the apical ectodermal ridge and limb suggest important roles during limb development (Wozney, 1992). BMP-4 has also been shown to be an important factor in dorsal region specification in mouse embryos and high levels of BMP-4 expression are seen at the gastrula stage of Xenopus embryos (Nishimatsu et al., 1993; Jones et al., 1992). The physiological factors regulating BMP-4 gene expression and function are still largely unknown. Recently, we and others have found that there are at least two different BMP-4 noncoding first exons (Exon 1A and 1B) (Chen et al., 1993; Kurihara et al., 1993). This suggests the BMP-4 gene may have at least two promoters. Analysis of the BMP-4 gene structure and functional studies in bone and other cells should provide a foundation for understanding the environmental and cellular factors which regulate BMP-4 gene transcription and alternate promoter usage. In this study, we have isolated the mouse BMP-4 gene and determined its primary DNA sequence. We have demonstrated, with the limits of the constructs tested, that the promoter 1A is active in bone cells by transfection studies. With Exon 1A and 1B probes and poly(A+) RNA from primary FRC cell cultures, Northern analysis supports this conclusion. These data were confirmed by quantitative competitive RT-PCR using Exon 1A or 1B primers and an Exon 3 primer with a common competitor containing Exon 1A, Exon 1B, and Exon 3 priming sites. We have also demonstrated that COUP-TFI, a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, negatively modulates BMP-4 gene transcription in transient transfection assays using primary fetal rat calvariae cells. We have shown that two elements in the 1A promoter bind to the COUP-TFI protein and that COUP-TFI mRNA is expressed in these cultures during bone cell differentiation. A mouse genomic λ Fix II spleen library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened with a mouse embryo BMP-4 cDNA probe (1.6 kb) kindly provided by Dr. B. Hogan (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit from Boehringer Mannheim. Plaque lift filters were hybridized overnight in hydridization buffer containing 6 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm, 10 μg/ml poly(A+), and 10 μg/ml tRNA at 68°C. The filters were washed at 55°C for 20 min, twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer, once in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer. The isolated phage DNA clones were mapped according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). Fragments from positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced in both directions using Sequenase and a sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of FRC cell poly(A+) RNA with an 18 mer dT primer using Superscript(TM) reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume of 20 μl. The cDNA was then used as a template for PCR with two sets of synthesized primers as discussed below. The primer 1 (5′-GAAGGCAAGAGCGCGAGG-3′), corresponding to a region of Exon 1A and primer 3 (5′-CCCGGTCTCAGGTATCA-3′) corresponding to a 5′ region of Exon 3 were used to generate Exon 1A-2-3 spliced PCR product. Primer 2 (5′-CAGGCCGAAAGCTGTTC-3′), corresponding to a region of Exon 1B, and the same primer 3 were used to generate Exon 1B-2-3 spliced PCR products. The positions of primer 1, 2, and 3 are indicated onFig. 1B. GeneAmp PCR kit was used according to the manufacturer's procedure (Perkin-Elmer). Each cycle consisted of a denaturation step (94°C for 1 min), an annealing step (56°C for 2 min), and an elongation step (72°C for 1 min). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for size determination. The products were subcloned into pCR(TM) II vector using TA cloning kit (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA). The inserts were sequenced in both directions with a sequencing kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. To generate a BMP-4 competitor for both A and B transcripts (Fig. 1A), a deer BMP-4B cDNA which was isolated in our laboratory (Feng et al., 1995) was used as the template for the PCR reaction. This deer BMP-4B cDNA has an extended 1B exon due to an alternate 5′ splice site, spliced to Exon 2. The upper priming site of the competitor contains the complement sequences of primer 1 and primer 2, corresponding to 18 nucleotides of Exon 1A and 18 nucleotides of of Exon 1B. The lower priming site corresponds to the 5′ region of Exon 3 (primer 3,Fig. 1B). The final PCR products of the BMP-4 competitor are 952 bp for Exon 1A and 935 bp for Exon 1B. Thus, the BMP-4 competitor contains both priming sites for Exon 1A and Exon 1B next to each other on the 5′ end and a 3′ priming site for Exon 3 on the 3′ end (Fig. 4A). The concentration of BMP-4 competitor is determined by spectrophotometry after purification with Magic PCR purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR reaction conditions used for the quantitative PCR are as described above. 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP was added into each PCR reaction. Reverse-transcribed FRC cell cDNA, 2 mM MgCl2, 10-fold serial dilutions of the BMP-4 competitor (0.025-250 pg), 0.25 mM dNTP, Taq polymerase, primer 1 or primer 2, and primer 3 (thus, the same lower primer for transcripts A and B) were placed into a master mixture. Primer 1 was used for BMP-4 A transcript quantification, and primer 2 was used for BMP-4 B transcript quantification. After amplification, a 10-μl sample from each 50-μl reaction was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide (50 μg/ml), photographed, dried, and scanned with the AMBIS Image Acquisition and Analysis System (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). The logarithm of the ratio of rat BMP-4 products (containing Exon 1A or Exon 1B) to BMP-4 competitor PCR products was graphed as a function of the logarithm of the amount of BMP-4 competitor added after correction for the size difference between the rat BMP-4 PCR products and BMP-4 competitor PCR products. Three BMP-4 1A promoter/plasmids were constructed by excising fragments from the 5′-flanking region of mouse BMP-4 gene and were then cloned into the pBL3CAT expression vector (Luckow and Schutz, 1987). The pCAT-2.6 plasmid consisted of pBL3CAT vector with a 2.6-kb EcoRI and XbaI fragment (-2372/+258) of the BMP-4 gene. The pCAT-1.3 plasmid was similarly generated from a 1.3-kb PstI fragment (-1144/+212). The pCAT-0.5 plasmid was made from a 0.5-kb SphI and PstI fragment (-260/+212). The pCAT-2.6, the pCAT-1.3 and the pCAT-0.5 plasmids all contain part of Exon 1A noncoding region. An additional promoter/plasmid was created from a PCR amplified product, corresponding to the 0.24-kb sequence between nucleotides -25 and +212, and referred to as the pCAT-0.24. The amplified fragment was first cloned into pCRII(TM) vector using TA cloning kit (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA) and then released with HindIII and XhoI, and recloned into pBL3CAT vector. Correct orientation of all inserts with respect to the pBL3CAT vector was verified by DNA sequencing. The isolated FRC cells, enriched for the osteoblast phenotype, were used as recipient cells for transient transfection assays. The technique of electroporation was used for DNA transfection (Potter, 1988; van den Hoff et al., 1992). After electroporation, the cells were divided into aliquots, replated in 100-mm diameter culture dishes and cultured for 48 h in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. The cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity according to the method described by Gorman (1988), and CAT activity was normalized by β-galactosidase assay from a co-transfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase at one-tenth the concentration of the CAT plasmids, according to the method of Rouet et al.(1992). Preparation of antibodies against COUP-TFI and gel retardation and supershift assays were carried out as described previously (Cooney et al., 1992). COUP-TFI protein was prepared by transcription from a SP6 promoter-COUP-TFI plasmid and the RNA was then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative amounts of the translated COUP-TFI protein were determined by [35S]methionine-labeled protein analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Cooney et al., 1992). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to consensus COUP RE (AAGTCA A AAGTCA) (Cooney et al., 1992) was prepared and used in competition assays. BMP-4 DR-1A Proximal (-865 to -878) (GGGCCA A AGGGCA) or BMP-4 DR-1A Distal (-2095 to -2108) (GGGCCA A AGGTCA) binding sites were labeled with [α-32P]dATP to specific activities of 2 to 8 × 108 cpm/μg. 0.1-0.2 ng of labeled DNA probe was incubated with 1-4 μl of in vitro translated COUP-TFI for 15 min at room temperature under the following conditions: 60 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2-2 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The reactions were resolved by electrophoresis in a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA running buffer. The gels were dried and then autoradiographed at -70°C with a DuPont Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens with Kodak X-Omat x-ray film. For antibody supershift analysis, the COUP-TFI antiserum was preincubated with the in vitro translation products at room temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of the labeled DNA probes. The transcriptional start sites were mapped by primer extension using the synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-CGGATGCCGAACTCACCTA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides +114 to +96 (Primer A,Fig. 1C) in the Exon 1A sequence and an oligonucleotide 5′-CTACAAACCCGAGAACAG-3′, corresponding to nucleotides +29 to +12 of Exon 1B sequences (Primer B1,Fig. 1B). The numbering for Exon 1B is based on the longest 5′-noncoding cDNA of BMP 4 with a 1B exon (Chen et al., 1993). The transcription start site(s) for 1B promoter have not been determined. Total RNA from FRC cells and 9.5-day mouse embryos (gift of B. Hogan, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) was used with both primers. The primer extension assay was carried out using the primer extension kit from Promega (Madison, WI). The annealing reactions were carried out at 60°C in water bath for 1 h. The products were then electrophoresed on 8% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. One other Exon 1B sequence, +50 to +67 (Primer B2,Fig. 1B), was also tested in primer extension reactions with FRC cell and mouse embryo RNAs. The primer sequences chosen are identical in both rat and mouse gene.2 The total FRC osteoblast RNA was extracted by the RNAzol B method using the protocol supplied by Cinna Biotecx (Houston, TX). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated using small oligo(dT) cellulose PUSH columns (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). 0.1% SDS was added in all buffers. The Northern blot analysis was as described previously (Harris et al., 1994b). Hamster COUP-TFI cDNA probe is a 1.5-kb fragment. The mouse BMP 4 cDNA probe is a 1.6-kb fragment. The filter was later reprobed with a 0.6-kb chicken glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe. BMP-4 and COUP-TFI mRNA levels were normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level. Confluent FRC osteoblast cultures, before medium change, was defined as Day 0 and the relative level of mRNA detected with a given probe to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was set at 1.0 for Day 0 (Harris et al., 1994b). Three clones were isolated from 2 × 106 plaques of mouse spleen 129 genomic library using full-length coding region mouse embryo BMP-4 cDNA probe (B. Hogan, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). One 19-kb clone contained 5 exons and an ~6-kb 5′-flanking region and an ~7-kb 3′-flanking region was utilized for characterization of the BMP-4 gene. A diagram of part of that clone with exons indicated is shown inFig. 1A. The 7-kb transcription unit and part of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse BMP-4 gene were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of mouse BMP-4 and deduced amino acid sequence of coding exons (408 residues) are shown inFig. 1B. Primers used in the quantitative competitive RT-PCR experiments described below are indicated in this figure.Fig. 1C shows the DNA sequence of 2372 bp of the 5′-flanking region and candidate DNA response elements upstream of the Exon 1A. Primers used in primer extension experiments are also shown inFig. 1(B and C). We have sequenced a variety of BMP-4 cDNAs from several sources including human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 and primary FRC cells. Four independent FRC cell BMP-4 cDNAs all contained Exon 1A sequences spliced to Exon 2. However, the human prostate PC-3 BMP-4 cDNA contained an apparently unique Exon 1, which we refer to as Exon 1B, spliced to Exon 2 (Chen et al., 1993). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (70 bp) to Exon 1B was synthesized based on the human PC-3 Exon 1B sequence. This Exon 1B probe was then used to identify the Exon 1B region in the mouse genomic BMP-4 clone (data not shown). The candidate Exon 1B is 1696 bp downstream from the 3′ end of Exon 1A. Primer extension analysis was performed to map the mouse BMP-4 gene transcription start sites. We used an oligonucleotide from Exon 1A, primer A (Fig. 1C), and two oligonucleotides from Exon 1B, primer B1 and B2 (Fig. 1B). Total RNA was utilized from 9.5-day mouse embryo and FRC cells grown in vitro. As shown inFig. 2, a major extended fragment from the primer A (Fig. 1C andFig. 2) was obtained in both mouse embryo and FRC cell total RNAs, which migrates at 115 bp. The extended 5′ end of the 115-bp fragment represents the major transcription start site for 1A-containing transcripts. The size of this 5′-noncoding Exon 1A is 306 bp. The 67-bp product may represent an alternate transcription start site or incomplete extension. No detectable extended fragment using primer B1 or B2 (Fig. 1B) (Exon 1B) was detected using either mouse embryo or FRC cell total RNAs. This suggests that 1B-containing transcripts are less abundant than 1A-containing transcripts in these mouse embryos and FRC bone cells. As stated, four FRC BMP-4 cDNAs were sequenced and found to contain Exon 1A sequences spliced to Exon 2. The human U2-0S BMP-4 cDNA sequence also contains Exon 1A (Wozney et al., 1988). This suggests that BMP-4 gene sequences upstream of Exon 1A may contain regulatory sequences utilized in bone cells and 9.5-day mouse embryos. To test whether the BMP-4 1B exon is expressed in FRC cells, we designed oligonucleotide primers to ascertain whether spliced 1B-2-3 exon products and 1A-2-3 exon products (control) could be obtained by RT-PCR from FRC poly(A+) RNA. The 3′ primer was in Exon 3 (primer 3) and the 5′ primers were either in Exon 1A (primer 1) or 1B (primer 2) (seeFig. 1B). The RT-PCR products were cloned and sequenced. A photograph and diagram of the products obtained are presented inFig. 3. Both 1A-2-3 and 1B-2-3 products were obtained. The results indicate that FRC osteoblasts produce transcripts with either a 1A exon or a 1B exon, but not both. This suggests that the intron region between 1A and 1B exon may contain regulatory response elements under certain cellular contexts, resulting in BMP-4 B transcripts. Of the 1B-2-3 RT-PCR products obtained from FRC osteoblasts, we obtained two products with different 3′ splice sites for Exon 1B. By comparison with the genomic DNA, both 3′ ends of the two Exon 1Bs have reasonable 5′ splice consensus sequences, consistent with an alternate splicing pattern obtained for the 1B-2-3 RT-PCR products. Most importantly, no 1A-1B-2-3 RT-PCR-spliced products of the BMP-4 gene were obtained. Thus, 1B does not appear to be an alternatively spliced 5′-noncoding exon and suggests the BMP-4 gene may have at least two promoters. Northern analysis demonstrated that a single 1.8-kb BMP-4 transcript can be detected in FRC cells during bone cell differentiation and the 1.8-kb band hybridized to both a 1A exon probe or a 2-4 exons probe. No 1.8-kb BMP-4 transcript was detected with 1B exon probe (data not shown). We then designed a 952 bp competitor with both a priming site for 1A and 1B next to each other on the 5′ end and a 3′ priming site for Exon 3 on the 3′ end. A diagram of construction of the BMP 4 competitor is shown inFig. 4A. Our single competitor template could then be used for quantitating both 1A and 1B-containing transcripts.Fig. 4B shows the results using increasing concentrations of BMP-4 competitor with the Exon 1A primer and Exon 3 primer pair and a constant amount of reverse transcribed FRC cDNA. We estimate that in the FRC cDNA (~10 ng), there is 2.6 pg of BMP-4 1A-2-3 transcripts.Fig. 4C shows the results using increasing concentrations of the BMP-4 competitor with the Exon 1B primer and Exon 3 primer pair and the same constant amount of FRC reverse transcribed cDNA used above. We estimate that in the FRC cDNA (10 ng), there is a total of 0.2 pg of BMP-4 1B-2-3 transcripts (combined 1B and 1B′ ofFig. 4C). Therefore, there are over 10 times more 1A-2-3 transcripts than total 1B-2-3 transcripts in FRC cells (summation of B plus B′ signals inFig. 4C). Detailed analysis during differentiation has not been carried out. Primary FRC cells were selected for analysis of mouse BMP-4 promoter activity. BMP-4 mRNA is modulated in a transient fashion during prolonged culture in these cells (Harris et al., 1994b). After 48 h of transfection with various BMP-4-CAT reporter gene constructs, the cells were harvested and the CAT activity was determined. As indicated inFig. 5(A and B), pCAT-0.24 plasmid (-25/+212) has measurable CAT activity. The CAT activity of this pCAT-0.24 plasmid was 3-fold lower than that the background parent pBL3CAT plasmid. This suggests the -25 to +212 has transcriptional or translational inhibitory activity. The pCAT-0.5 (-260/+212), pCAT-1.3 (-1144/+212), and pCAT-2.6 (-2372/+258) showed progressive increasing promoter activity when transfected into primary FRC cells. These data are shown inFig. 5B. With pCAT-0.5 (-260/+212) there is a 10-fold increase in CAT activity relative to pCAT-0.24 (-25/+212). pCAT-1.3 (-1144/+212) shows an additional 6-fold increase in CAT activity over pCAT-0.5, and pCAT-2.6 (-2372/+258) shows an additional 2-fold increase in CAT activity over pCAT-1.3 (-1144/+212). Thus the net increase in CAT activity between the pCAT-0.24 (-25/+212) and the pCAT-2.6 (-2372/+258) in FRC cells is approximately 100-fold. We initially searched the 5′-flanking regions of the Exon 1A and found potential response elements for SP1, p53, Fos-Jun (AP-1), AP-2, SP-1, COUP-TF (DR-1A), and Zif 268. The 1A 5′-flanking region contains several direct repeats (DR-1 and DR-5, direct repeats with 1 or 5 base pair spacing between repeats of 1/2 sites of A/GA/GT/GCA) that potentially might respond to retinoic acid RXR-receptor family members. The DR-1 repeats may also be modulated by the transcriptional factor, COUP-TFI. Since COUP-TFI has been shown to be an important modulator of transcription of a variety of genes (Ladias and Karathanasis, 1991; Lehmann et al., 1991; Tran et al., 1992; Kliewer et al., 1992a, 1992b), and BMP-4 mRNA is transiently expressed during bone cell differentiation, we examined these potential DR-1 COUP-TFI response region in the 1A promoter. COUP-TFI has the ability to homodimerize with itself and heterodimerize with RXR and negatively modulate transcription from direct repeats with the canonical 1/2 site sequence AGGTCA spaced by 1 nucleotide (Cooney et al., 1992; Kliewer et al., 1992a, 1992b; Tran et al., 1992). Two candidate BMP-4 DR-1 (DR-1A) repeats were tested for specific COUP-TFI binding by gel shift assays(Cooney et al., 1992). The BMP-4 DR-1A Distal sequence at -2095 bp has the sequence GGGCCA A AGGTCA. The DR-1A Proximal sequence at -865 bp has the sequence GGGCCA A AGGGCA. A consensus COUP-TFI binding oligonucleotide (AGGTCA A AGGTCA), referred to as COUP RE, was used as positive control. The result inFig. 6A shows that in vitro transcribed/translated COUP-TFI binds both the proximal and distal BMP-4 DR-1A elements (lanes 6 and 11). Non-radioactive COUP-TFI RE oligonucleotide competes the binding of labeled BMP-4 DR-1A oligonucleotides to the COUP-TFI produced in vitro (lanes 7 and 12). In a supershift assay, COUP-TFI antibodies further retarded the COUP-TFI/α-32P-labeled BMP-4 distal and proximal BMP-4 DR-1A elements (lanes 9 and 14). The COUP-TFI thus forms a high affinity stable complex with the distal and proximal DR-1A BMP-4 elements. An oligonucleotide containing a progesterone response element (PRE) at 25-fold excess over the labeled BMP-4 DR-1A elements could not compete the binding to the COUP-TFI protein (Fig. 6A, lanes 8 and 13). As shown inFig. 6B, the proximal DR-1A-COUP-TF interaction required more non-radioactive consensus COUP-TF oligonucleotide to compete the COUP-TFI binding. This suggests the proximal BMP-4 DR-1A binds to COUP-TFI with higher affinity than the distal BMP-4 DR-1A element (Fig. 6B). Co-transfection of various ratios of a cytomegalovirus enhancer (CMV)-driven human COUP-TFI expression vector with pCAT-2.6 (-2372/+258) BMP-4 1A promoter CAT constructs into primary FRC osteoblasts was performed. A ratio of pCMV-COUP-TFI to pCAT 2.6 (-2372/+258) plasmids of 0.1 is sufficient to suppress the BMP-4 1A promoter by 65%. On the other hand, pCMV-COUP-TFI at equivalent ratios had little effect on the pBL2CAT (tk-CAT) promoter in these primary FRC osteoblasts (Luckow and Schutz, 1987). The pBL2CAT contains no COUP-TF response elements, and thus indicates the effect of pCMV-COUP-TF on the BMP-4 promoter is not due to general squelching. The results are presented inFig. 7. Fig. 8 shows that COUP-TFI mRNA and BMP-4 mRNA levels change during long term cultures of FRC osteoblasts in which bone nodules are formed. Both COUP-TFI and BMP4 mRNA expressions are transient in FRC osteoblasts as they differentiate in culture. COUP-TFI is most likely involved in regulating a variety of genes in bone cells as well as in many other tissues (Tsai et al., unpublished). We would not expect a direct correlation of mRNA levels of BMP-4 and COUP-TFI. The net 2-fold change in COUP-TFI mRNA levels, however, does suggest that in vitro differentiating bone cells can modulate COUP-TF mRNA. Whether this change is directly or indirectly related to BMP-4 expression is unknown. In this study, we have isolated the murine BMP-4 gene transcription unit and flanking regions and examined its DNA sequence in order to lay the foundation for understanding factors and signaling pathways that may regulate transcription of the BMP 4 gene in the context of primary cultures of rat bone cells and other tissues. Over 6 kb of 5′-flanking region have been isolated, and the exon and intron structure has been defined by DNA sequence analysis. The transcription unit comprises 7030 bp with three 5′-noncoding exons. These results are similar and extend those reported by Kurihara et al.(1993). The first noncoding exon, Exon 1A, defines a transcription start site utilized in bone cells and the 9.5-day mouse embryo. The candidate 1B promoter has not been extensively investigated and the transcription start site is not known. However, by quantitative RT-PCR we demonstrate that 1B transcript are present in bone cells but at a 10-fold lower concentration than 1A transcripts. A 2360-bp 5′-flanking region of Exon 1A has been sequenced, and several potential regulatory elements have been identified by their sequence homology to known transcription factor binding sites. Four BMP-4 1A 5′-flanking CAT reporter gene plasmid constructs with different size deletions were transfected into primary FRC osteoblasts to establish regions of the BMP-4 1A promoter that are important for transcriptional regulation in bone cells. A region between -23 and -260 shows over a 10-fold stimulation of transcription. Between -23 and -1144 there is over a 60-fold stimulation of transcription. Two direct repeat elements (DR-1 sites) similar to RXR-COUP-TFI binding sites were found to bind the transcription factor COUP-TFI, and by transfection studies in primary osteoblast cultures, we demonstrated that COUP-TFI is a negative regulator of the BMP-4 1A promoter in vitro. We have also demonstrated that COUP-TFI mRNA is expressed in primary cultures of FRC osteoblasts and undergoes marginal (~2-fold) changes in level during differentiation, in parallel with BMP 4 expression. Mammalian BMP 4 gene structure is very similar to the fruit fly homologous gene, decapentaplegic or dpp (St. Johnston et al., 1990). The dpp gene has two coding exons and at least three 5′-noncoding exons, which define three alternate promoters. In the dpp gene there are other promoters further upstream and regulatory DNA region in the 3′-flanking area (St. Johnston et al., 1990). The dpp mature coding regions share over 75% identity to BMP 4 mature coding region. The position of the splice site between the two coding exons is also conserved (St. Johnston et al., 1990). The dpp gene is critical for dorsal-ventral specification during embryogenesis and imaginal disc differentiation during pupation (Shimell et al., 1991). What is of interest for this study is that different promoters for the dpp gene are used at different developmental stages and in different tissues, presumable with unique sets or combinations of transcription factors for each promoter. This supports the hypothesis that the mammalian BMP 4 gene will utilize different promoters in different developmental context. We believe we have identified at least two BMP 4 promoters and have shown that both are utilized in heterogeneous primary bone cell cultures, which contain isolated areas of rapid bone formation (mineralizing nodules) between areas that do not differentiate (Harris et al., 1994a, 1994b). We are now in a position to identify differential utilization of the 1B and 1A exons using in situ RT-PCR during different stages of our in vitro bone cultures. This analysis is being extended, using mouse embryo sections at different developmental stages. Deer antler tissue and prostate tissue express much higher 1B transcripts and should allow us to develop more specific probes and map the transcription start sites for the 1B promoter (Chen et al., 1993; Feng et al., 1995). In situ hybridization analysis of BMP 4 expression has shown a wide but selective expression pattern during embryogenesis (Jones et al., 1991). BMP 4 mRNA is detectable in Xenopus oocytes (Nishimatsu et al., 1992). The BMP 4 mRNA expression greatly increases between blastula and gastrulae and subsequently declines in Xenopus during later embryogenesis (Nishimatsu et al., 1992). BMP 4 mRNA expression domains in chick and mammalian embryos are highly focal and specific (compared to BMP 2) during limb bud/limb formation (Francis et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1991; Jones et al., 1992;Wozney et al. 1992). BMP 4 is expressed at high levels in select regions of the developing nervous system, in the developing branchial arches and later, during tooth development (Jones et al., 1991; Vainio et al., 1993). BMP 4 is selectively expressed in rhombomere 3 and 5 at stage 5 in the chick embryo (Graham et al., 1994). In two of the above studies, the biologically active BMP 4 protein was shown to 1) stimulate differentiation of dental mesenchyme and autoregulate BMP 4 mRNA expression, and 2) selectively control apoptosis of neural crest cells in rhombomere 3 and 5 of the developing hindbrain (Vainio et al., 1993; Graham et al., 1994). Thus we propose, that with the large variety of developmental contexts in which BMP 4 is expressed, the use of alternate BMP 4 promoters will allow selected tissue and developmental specific gene networks to operate within a given cell on the BMP 4 gene. The consequence of having BMP 4 transcripts in a cell with alternate 5′-noncoding exons could result in controlling where the BMP 4 mRNA is localized in the cell and selective rates of translation of BMP 4 1B mRNA versus BMP 4 1A mRNA transcripts in these different cellular contexts (for review, see Curtis et al.(1995)). Our analysis of 1B and 1A expression patterns in embryos will help in developing more extensive models. Analysis of predicted secondary structures of Exon 1A and 1B indicates dramatic differences using the M FOLD program in GCG. The ΔG levels for all structures were between -92 and -95 kcal/mol. These predicted secondary structures in the 5′-noncoding region could play important roles in BMP 4 cellular localization and translation by binding select sets of RNA binding proteins in different cells or tissues (Curtis et al., 1995). COUP-TFI negatively modulate RXR-dependent pathways (Cooney et al., 1992; Kliewer et al., 1992a, 1992b). RXR heterodimerizes with thyroid, retinoid, and vitamin D receptors, and the early response gene, NUR77 or NGF 1B (Cooney et al., 1992; Perlmann and Jansson, 1995). Thus COUP-TFI levels to RXR levels in a given cell may allow the balancing of diverse hormonal and growth factor signals during embryogenesis and homeostasis (Lu et al., 1994). The potential in vivo significance of COUP-TFI levels and expression on the BMP 4 gene can be addressed by first analyzing areas of overlapping expression of COUP-TFI and BMP 4 expression. Several areas in mouse embryos indicate a strong correlation between BMP 4 expression and COUP-TFI expression in both spatial and temporal aspects. First, in 10.5 post coitus embryos, there are high levels of both COUP-TFI and BMP-4 mRNAs in nasal pits and facial processes, and in the otic vesicles (Jones et al., 1991; Jonk et al., 1994; Lu et al., 1994). Several areas of the diencephalon and rhombomeres overlap in expression domains for both genes that may be relevant to the control of brain development and selected apoptosis of neural crest cells by BMP 4 in rhombomere 3 and 5 (Lu et al., 1994; Graham et al., 1994). There are high levels of both COUP-TFI and BMP 4 mRNA in the mesenchyme surrounding whisker follicles (Jones et al., 1991; Jonk et al., 1994). Targeted overexpression of BMP 4 using a cytokeratin promoter to whisker follicles and other tissues results in some of the surviving mice with a large number of developmental defects, including craniofacial malformations, fusion of dentary and maxillary bones, growth retardation, cleft palate, absence of whiskers, and defects in hair regeneration (Blessing et al., 1993). This indicates that controlling the level and spatial and temporal aspects of BMP 4 expression are extremely important for proper differentiation in a variety of tissues. COUP-TFI could play a role in regulating the level of BMP 4 expression from the 1A promoter. Finally, both BMP 4 and COUP-TFI expression patterns overlap in an interesting ways in the developing limb bud. In 10.5-day post coitus embryos, there is a distal-to-proximal gradient of BMP 4 expression. COUP-TFI expression shows a proximal-to-distal gradient (Jones et al., 1991; Lu et al., 1994). This type of reciprocal expression pattern would be ideal for controlling the level of BMP 4 expression. In the limbs of later 14.5-day post coitus embryos, there is an overlap in BMP 4 expression and COUP-TFI expression in the mesenchyme surrounding the chondrogenic region of the long bones as well as in the apoptotic region between the developing digits (Jones et al., 1991; Lu et al., 1994). Thus there are now two direct associations between BMP 4 expression and COUP-TFI expression in cell death associated with limb/digit development and in neural crest apoptosis in rhombomeres 3 and 5. Further analysis of BMP 4 expression pattern in which the COUP-TFI gene has been inactivated may help unravel the relationship between COUP-TFI and the BMP 4 gene. In summary, we have characterized the BMP-4 gene and one of the promoters in the context of primary cultures of fetal rat osteoblasts. Bone cells utilize primarily the upstream 1A promoter. Mouse embryos (9.5 days) also appear to utilize predominantly the 1A promoter. Analysis of the 1A promoter indicates the transcription factor COUP-TFI could modulate BMP-4 gene transcription in vivo.

Genetic studies have shown nick formation to be dependent on both the traI and traY genes.

To explore possible interactions occurring at oriT, highly purified TraIp, TraYp, and IHF were incubated with a supercoiled oriT-containing DNA substrate. A marked enhancement of the nicking reaction catalyzed by TraIp was observed in a reaction that required both TraYp and IHF. In addition, TraIp was able to nick a linear oriT-containing double-stranded DNA substrate when IHF and TraYp were present in the reaction; such a substrate is not nicked by TraIp alone. Individual protein concentration requirements for the supercoiled and linear nicking reactions were similar, and the reactions occurred at equal velocity, suggesting that they are biochemically identical. Concentrations of TraYp and IHF that yield half-maximal activity in the nicking assays compare well with the reported KD values for the IHF and TraYp binding sites in oriT. These data, coupled with data presented in the accompanying report, suggest that TraYp and IHF bind independent of one another, forming a nucleo-protein complex with oriT that can be recognized and nicked by TraIp.

https://openalex.org/W1988818065,"We recently reported that gastrin and glycine-extended progastrin processing intermediates (G-Gly) exert growth-promoting effects on AR4-2J cells (derived from rat pancreas) via interaction with distinct receptors. In this study we sought to investigate the mechanisms by which gastrin and G-Gly stimulate cell proliferation. While gastrin increased [Ca2+]i in AR4-2J cells, G-Gly had no effect. Similarly, G-Gly had no effect either on basal and 10-7M vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-stimulated cAMP generation, although gastrin is known to inhibit cAMP generation. Gastrin dose dependently stimulated AR4-2J cell mRNA content of both c-fos and c-jun, two genes known to function in regulating cell proliferation, but G-Gly had no effect. Gastrin also induced the expression of luciferase in AR4-2J cells transfected with a construct consisting of a luciferase reporter gene coupled to the serum response element of the c-fos gene promoter. In similar fashion, gastrin stimulated the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, an enzyme known to mediate the induction of the c-fos serum response element in response to growth factor stimulation. Although G-Gly had none of these effects of gastrin in AR4-2J cells, it stimulated activity of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, an enzyme known to phosphorylate and transcriptionally activate c-Jun. These data support the notion that gastrin stimulates cell proliferation by inducing c-fos and c-jun gene expression, while G-Gly acts by post-translationally regulating early gene transcriptional activation. Our studies represent a novel model in which both the precursor and the product of a key processing reaction, peptide α-amidation, act cooperatively to stimulate cell proliferation via distinct receptors linked to different signal transduction pathways.

Gastrin dose dependently stimulated AR4-2J cell mRNA content of both c-fos and c-jun, two genes known to function in regulating cell proliferation, but G-Gly had no effect. Gastrin also induced the expression of luciferase in AR4-2J cells transfected with a construct consisting of a luciferase reporter gene coupled to the serum response element of the c-fos gene promoter. In similar fashion, gastrin stimulated the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase, an enzyme known to mediate the induction of the c-fos serum response element in response to growth factor stimulation. Although G-Gly had none of these effects of gastrin in AR4-2J cells, it stimulated activity of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, an enzyme known to phosphorylate and transcriptionally activate c-Jun. These data support the notion that gastrin stimulates cell proliferation by inducing c-fos and c-jun gene expression, while G-Gly acts by post-translationally regulating early gene transcriptional activation. Our studies represent a novel model in which both the precursor and the product of a key processing reaction, peptide α-amidation, act cooperatively to stimulate cell proliferation via distinct receptors linked to different signal transduction pathways."

Because the tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a central role in determining genetic stability and cell proliferation, we have examined the effects of 17β-estradiol, the synthetic progestin R5020, and the antiprogestin RU486 on the levels of this protein in T47D cells. Western blot analysis of cellular extracts, performed with a monoclonal antibody capable of quantitatively supershifting a specific p53-p53 response element complex in a gel mobility shift assay, detected a single immunoreactive band representing p53. When cells were grown for 4-5 days in culture medium containing charcoal-treated fetal calf serum, p53 levels declined to 10% of the level seen in the control (no charcoal treatment) group. Supplementation of culture medium containing charcoal-treated calf serum with 0.1-1 nM 17β-estradiol restored p53 to its normal levels. A 4-day treatment of cells with R5020 or RU486 lowered the p53 levels in cells grown in normal culturing conditions to 15 and 30% of control levels, respectively. R5020 and RU486 treatments also caused down-regulation and/or hyperphosphorylation of the progesterone receptor, which correlated with the down-regulation of p53. These observations indicate that in T47D cells, p53 is up-regulated by estradiol while R5020 down-regulates this protein. Since estradiol is known to promote cell proliferation, the induction of p53 observed in this study leads us to propose that estradiol stimulates p53 to regulate proliferation of T47D cells in culture.

https://openalex.org/W1543180201,"Type II topoisomerases are essential for faithful cell division in all organisms. In human cells, the α isozyme of topoisomerase II has been implicated in catalyzing mitotic chromosome segregation via its action as a DNA unlinking enzyme. Here, we have shown that the enzymatic activity of topoisomerase IIα protein purified from HeLa cell nuclei was strongly enhanced following phosphorylation by protein kinase C. We have investigated the possibility that this kinase is involved in cell cycle phase-specific phosphorylation of topoisomerase IIα in HeLa cells. Two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping revealed that topoisomerase IIα protein immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled HeLa cells was differentially phosphorylated during the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. To identify sites of phosphorylation and the kinase(s) responsible for this modification, oligohistidine-tagged recombinant domains of topoisomerase IIα protein were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Phosphorylation of a short fragment of the N-terminal ATPase domain of topoisomerase IIα by protein kinase C in vitro generated two phosphopeptides that co-migrated with prominent G2/M phase-specific phosphopeptides from the HeLa cell-derived topoisomerase IIα protein. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that phosphorylation of serine 29 generated both of these phosphopeptides. Our results implicate protein kinase C in the cell cycle phase-dependent modulation of topoisomerase IIα enzymatic activity in human cells."

Immunoprecipitation of p125FAK from Ang II-activated GN4 cells demonstrated a doubling of p125FAK kinase activity.

Cytochalasin D pretreatment blocks G-protein receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells. While cytochalasin D decreased the Tyr(P) content of 65-75-kDa substrates in Ang II-treated GN4 cells, it did not diminish tyrosine phosphorylation of 115-130-kDa substrates, again suggesting activation of at least two tyrosine kinase pathways in GN4 cells. To search for additional Ang II-activated enzymes, we used molecular techniques to identify 20 tyrosine kinase sequences in these cell lines. None was the major cytosolic enzyme activated by Ang II.

Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15501-15507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter group appeared to be phosphorylated in part due to activation of a second process (e.g. a downstream tyrosine kinase)(2Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we identified several of the same substrates in Ang II, vasopressin, or epinephrine-treated cells, and determined that these G-protein-coupled receptors stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in a calcium-dependent, protein kinase C-independent manner(2Huckle W.R.

Since virtually all tyrosine kinases autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues, immune complex tyrosine kinase activity could be assessed in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates from control and Ang II-treated cells. Ang II increased tyrosine kinase activity within 15-30 s; maximal activation was seen within 1 to 2 min. Activation was abrogated by intracellular chelators that blunt the Ang II-induced calcium signal(3Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which calcium increases tyrosine kinase activity remains unclear, but the schema is presumably indirect because tyrosine kinase activity can not be stimulated by adding calcium to cell-free extracts of these cells. Thus, our previous work showed that G-protein-coupled receptors generating a calcium signal rapidly, but indirectly, activate one or more tyrosine kinase(s)(2Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B.

Many of the hormones noted above that activate tyrosine phosphorylation also stimulate cell proliferation and the immediate-early gene expression that accompanies growth factor action. The latter is likely to occur by activation of the MAP kinase (ERK 1 and ERK 2) pathway(33Crews C.M. Erikson R.L.

In addition, our laboratory has shown recently that Ang II treatment of rat liver epithelial cells produces a 200-fold activation of JNK through a calcium- and tyrosine kinase-dependent process.2 In summary, data from several cell types suggest that the selected Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors as well as other agonists (e.g. integrin stimulation) can activate p125FAK, MAPK, and JNK. The potential stimulation of several pathways thought to be controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation led us to ask whether Ang II stimulated p125FAK or another tyrosine kinase(s) or both. We report that Ang II stimulates at least two cytosolic tyrosine kinases. The first, pp125FAK, is tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated in these cells in an Ang II-dependent manner; however, greater than 80% of the tyrosine kinase activity resides in another molecule that can be distinguished from p125FAK. Molecular means were used to identify 20 tyrosine kinases in the cells, but none appear to be the calcium-dependent cytosolic tyrosine kinase. In contrast, we have partially purified an autophosphorylating kinase from Ang II-treated cells by sequential affinity chromatography. This activity migrates as a 115-120-kDa Tyr(P) protein that can be separated electrophoretically and distinguished from pp125FAK. The possibility is raised that distinct Ang II-dependent intracellular signaling pathways are activated through separate tyrosine kinases. EGF was purified from mouse salivary glands as described previously(40Savage Jr., C.R. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7609-7611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human Ang II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) was obtained from Sigma. Ang II was prepared in 50 mM acetic acid. EGF was prepared as 100-fold-concentrated solutions in 10 mM NaPi (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cytochalasin D (Calbiochem) was prepared as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration ≤ 0.1%, v/v). Anti-p125FAK, monoclonal antibody 2A7, and polyclonal antibody BC-2 were generously provided by Tom Parson, University of Virginia. Antibodies to JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 were generously provided by Dr. James Ihle, St. Jude's. Monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody, PT66, and PT66-agarose were purchased from Sigma. WB and GN4 cell were maintained at 37°C in Richter's improved minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1 μM insulin in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere as described previously(3Huckle W.R. Dy R.C. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Seven to 10 days before each experiment, WB cells of passages 19-26 or GN4 cell passages 5-15 were seeded onto plastic culture dishes (Costar) and used when they reached confluence. Cell treatments and anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously(2Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cell lysates of WB or GN4 cells grown in 35-mm diameter culture dishes, subcellular fractions, PT66 immunoprecipitates, or affinity resin fractions were probed in a similar fashion. Briefly, in some experiments treatment incubations were terminated by rapid aspiration of the medium and addition of 250 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer. Cell extracts were scraped from culture dishes and solubilized by addition of 125 μl of 3-fold-concentrated sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer and heating to 100°C for 3 min. For experiments in which homogenate, cytosol, and membrane fractions were separated, four 60-mm plates preincubated with 200 μM vanadate for 15 min and were then treated with vehicle or Ang II for 1 min. Cells were scraped into vanadate-containing immunoprecipitation buffer (see below) and homogenized in a 2-ml Teflon glass homogenizer with motor driven pestle on ice (30 strokes). One-ml aliquots were ultracentrifuged in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge at 105,000 × g for 45 min. Proteins from cell lysates, subcellular fraction, or affinity procedures were separated by electrophoresis on 7, 8, or 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed by sequential incubation with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies and 125I-protein A (2-10 μCi/μg; DuPont NEN) or using ECL reagent. Molecular weights were estimated by using prestained standards (Sigma). Confluent cultures of WB or GN4 cells in 60-mm dishes, subcellular fractions or affinity column fractions, were immunoprecipitated in ice-cold lysis buffer, referred to as NLB (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.3) containing 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin per ml). Lysates were clarified prior to immunoprecipitation by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were precipitated by incubation with monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) antibody PT66, 5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and 10 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem), or 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz), for 2 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 3 min at 4°C, were washed twice with this lysis buffer, and if used for immune complex tyrosine kinase activity, the precipitates were washed twice with 2-fold concentrated tyrosine kinase assay buffer (100 mM sodium HEPES (pH 7.6), 60 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and then were resuspended with 70 μl of this buffer. In some experiments, an aliquot (10-20 μl) of the washed immune complex was removed for anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE on 8% gels as described. Efficient anti-Tyr(P) recovery of tyrosine phosphoproteins and kinase activity required high NaCl concentration (500 mM) in the cell lysis buffer. We postulate that Tyr(P) residues are dissociated from endogenous binding domains (e.g. Src homology domains) at high ionic strength and thereby are made accessible for immunoprecipitation. In cell lysates or affinity fractions, p125FAK was precipitated using 2-10 μl of monoclonal 2A7; EGF receptor was precipitated with anti-rat polyclonal EGF receptor antibody 1382 prepared in this laboratory. JAKs 1, 2, and 3 were immunoprecipitated after lysis in NLB with specific antisera provided by James Ihle. Routinely, 10-20-μl aliquots of immune complex suspension were preincubated for 5 min at 4°C with 160 μg of the synthetic tyrosine kinase substrate poly(Glu80-Tyr20) or the control substrate poly(Glu) (Sigma). Reactions (80 μl total reaction volume) were initiated by addition of 5 μM [γ-32P]ATP (2-10 μCi/reaction) for cell lysate experiments. Affinity fractions were assayed with 60 μM ATP, 5-20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to equalize the ATP concentration in various fractions. After 4-10 min at 25°C, 50 μl of the reaction mix was spotted onto Whatman No. 3MM paper. The papers were washed with trichloroacetic acid, air-dried, and assayed by liquid scintillation for acid-insoluble 32P. Tyrosine kinase activity was defined as 32P incorporation in counts/min occurring in the presence of poly(Glu80-Tyr20) minus that occurring in the presence of poly(Glu80-Tyr20). This defined phosphorylation above the background of endogenous protein phosphorylation. The rates of tyrosine phosphorylation so measured were linear for at least 15 min and were proportional to the amount of cell lysate used for immunoprecipitation. In experiments in which endogenous substrate autophosphorylation was assessed, the poly(Glu80-Tyr20) was not added to the reaction mixture. The reactions were terminated at 4-10 min by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 7-8% SDS-PAGE; gels were stained, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography on Kodak AR film. In some instances gels were transferred to Immobilon and subjected to two dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously(2Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unknown tyrosine kinase domains were amplified with degenerate oligonucleotides designated TK forward (cca gtt ctc gag cat cgn gat ttn gcn gcn cg) and TK reverse (ctg can acc tgg atg ccn ta tag cta ttg acc), encoding the conserved sequences HRDLAAR and DVWSFGV, respectively, as described (41Lai C. Lemke G. Neuron. 1991; 6: 691-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA template was prepared from poly(A) mRNA made by cesium chloride isolation of total RNA from the WB cell line followed by oligo(dT) selection. The cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in RT buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 3 mM MgCl2), 15 units of RNA guard (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 10 pmol of random hexamers, and 1.25 mM each dNTP in a 20-μl reaction. The volume of the cDNA was adjusted to 25-60 μl with TE following first strand synthesis. PCR amplifications were carried out with 5 μl of random-primed first strand cDNA in a 50-μl reaction volume of PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, and 0.1% Triton X-100), 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 50 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C (1 cycle), 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C (22 cycles), and 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 10 min at 72°C (1 cycle). The PCR product was then gel-purified, cut with XhoI and ClaI at sites included in the PCR primers, and subcloned into pBSII SK+ (Stratagene). In later experiments, the PCR product was TA-cloned (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions. The 190 cloned PCR products were sequenced by dideoxy termination sequencing (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.), grouped into families (40 of 190 were Abl), and the sequences compared to the GenBank data base with the Blast algorithm. A cDNA library was constructed in λgt11 using oligo(dT)-primed poly(A)-containing RNA purified from confluent cultures of WB cells. Recombinants were screened for cDNAs encoding active tyrosine kinases by a modification of the method of Letwin et al.(42Letwin K. Yee S.P. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 621-627PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 480,000 plaque-forming units from the unamplified phage library was used to infect Escherichia coli strain Y1090. Infected cells were plated in LB top agarose on 10 150-mm LB agar plates and incubated for 3 h at 42°C. When plaques had become visible, expression of insert sequences was induced by applying nitrocellulose filters, prewet with 10 mM IPTG, to the surface of the agarose and continuing incubation at 37°C. After 4 h, filters were rinsed briefly with 50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5), plus 0.05% sodium azide (“RB”) and blocked overnight in RB containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Boehringer Mannheim). Plaques containing proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine were identified by immunoblotting the filters with purified polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies followed by 125I-protein A as described. Twenty positive plaques were detected. Phage from the 12 plaques giving rise to the strongest isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, yielding 8 purified clones with Lambdasorb reagent (Promega). Insert DNAs were excised by restriction and endonuclease digestion with EcoRI and ligated into EcoRI-cut pBluescript II(KS+) (Stratagene). Partial nucleotide sequences of insert cDNAs, obtained using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), were compared to known sequences using the GCG analysis package. In a typical preparation, 50 150-mm tissue culture plates of confluent GN4 cells were treated with 1 μM Ang II for 1 min and scraped into 1.0 ml of NLB/plate. After centrifugation, the lysate was tumbled with 1 ml of PT66-agarose, washed five times, and eluted with 10 ml of NLB with 10 mM phenylphosphate. The Tyr(P) elute was brought to 50 mM MgCl2 in 150 mM NaCl and incubated with 0.5 ml of ATP-Sepharose synthesized by one of us (L. Graves). Briefly, 4-aminoanilido-ATP was synthesized by reacting ATP with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl)carbodiimide and phenylenediamine. The product, isolated by high performance liquid chromatography, was analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm the identity. The 4-aminoanilido-ATP derivative was coupled by carbodiimide chemistry to Sepharose resin containing a carboxyl group attached to a 6-carbon linker (Pharmacia ECH Sepharose). After transfer to a Bio-Rad 1-ml column, the resin was washed with 150 mM and 500 mM NaCl containing buffers and the purified ATP-binding proteins were eluted with 1 mM ATP in six to eight 1-ml fractions. Fractions were combined and used for immunoprecipitation (2 h at 0°C, as described) with p125FAK or EGF receptor antibodies or were concentrated by incubation with PT66-agarose overnight at 0°C. Some aliquots were autophosphorylated in immune complex kinase assays, as described, and subjected to gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Alternatively, aliquots were prepared for mini-gel electrophoresis, followed by silver staining, or after transfer to nitrocellulose, for Tyr(P) immunoblotting. For some gel electrophoresis analyses, the bisacrylamide concentration was reduced from 1 to 0.5% to increase the separation in the 120-kDa region. The subcellular localization of Ang II-dependent Tyr(P) substrates and tyrosine kinase activity was investigated in WB and rat liver epithelial cells. Previous experiments had assessed the time course of substrate phosphorylation and kinase activity in extracts of cells lysed in detergent-containing buffers with 500 mM NaCl, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors(2Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine subcellular localization, cells preincubated with 200 μM vanadate to preinhibit cellular Tyr(P) phosphatases were incubated with Ang II for 1 min, the time of maximal tyrosine kinase activation. Preincubation with vanadate prolonged the Ang II-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation response, but did not detectably alter the substrates phosphorylated. Cells were scraped, homogenized on ice, and centrifugated at 105,000 × g for 45 min. After resuspension of the pelleted membranes, Triton X-100 was added to a portion of the original homogenate (kept on ice during subcellular fractionation), as well as to the cytosol and membrane fractions. Following electrophoresis of the samples and transfer to nitrocellulose, an anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot was performed (Fig. 1). The majority of the Tyr(P) substrates in Ang II-treated WB cells were localized to the cytosolic fraction. In contrast, EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates both in the cytosolic and membrane fractions; the major substrate in the membrane fraction was the 170-kDa EGF receptor. To determine the localization of the tyrosine kinase(s) activated in Ang II-treated cells, the experiment was repeated using GN4 cells, a chemically transformed line derived from WB, that expresses ~3-fold more Ang II-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity. After separating homogenate, cytosol, and membrane fractions, detergent was added, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PT66. Immune complex tyrosine kinase activity was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” assessing the transfer of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP to the exogenous substrate poly(Glu80-Tyr20). In immunoprecipitates from the homogenate fraction, Ang II treatment increased tyrosine kinase activity by ~2.5-fold (2,637 cpm for control to 6,199 cpm for Ang II-treated). At least 75-80% of this activity was found in the immunoprecipitates of cytosolic Tyr(P) proteins (740 cpm for control, 4,596 cpm for Ang II-treated). In contrast, little activity was found in the immunoprecipitates from the membrane fraction (699 cpm for control, 313 cpm for Ang II-treated). Thus, the majority of the Tyr(P) substrates and virtually all of the increased tyrosine kinase activity were found in the cytosolic fraction. The fact that the Ang II-dependent tyrosine kinase activity was soluble and that there were Tyr(P) substrates in the p115-130-kDa region led us to test whether p125FAK was the major kinase activated. GN4 cells treated with vehicle or Ang II for 1 min were subjected to single or sequential immunoprecipitation protocols using control mouse Ig (mIg),"
https://openalex.org/W2089457445,"We extended our investigation on the structure of the redox centers of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli using cyanide as a monitoring probe. We found that addition of cyanide to the air-oxidized O2-bound enzyme caused appearance of an infrared C-N stretching band at 2161 cm- and concomitant disappearance of the 647 nm absorption band of the cytochrome d (Fe2+)-O2 species. Addition of cyanide to the air-oxidized CO-bound enzyme also resulted in disappearance of the 635 nm absorption band and the 1983.4 cm- C-O infrared band of the cytochrome d (Fe2+)-CO species. The resulting species had a derivative-shaped electron paramagnetic resonance signal at g = 3.15. Upon partial reduction with sodium dithionite, this species was converted partly to a transient heme d (Fe3+)-C=N species having an electron paramagnetic resonance signal at gz = 2.96 and a C-N infrared band at 2138 cm-. These observations suggest that the active site of the enzyme has a heme-heme binuclear metal center distinct from that of the heme-copper terminal oxidase and that the treatment of the air-oxidized enzyme with cyanide resulted in a cyanide-bridging species with “heme d(Fe3+)-C=N-heme b595(Fe3+)” structure.

INTRODUCTIONEscherichia coli has two terminal ubiquinol oxidases in the aerobic electron transfer chain: bo-type ubiquinol oxidase, which is expressed under high oxygen tension, and bd-type ubiquinol oxidase, which predominates under low oxygen tension(1Anraku Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Poole R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These oxidases are structurally unrelated, but both catalyze the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol-8 and the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to produce water(1Anraku Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Poole R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The E. coli bd-type ubiquinol oxidase has been isolated and was found to consist of two polypeptide chains: subunit I (58 kDa) and subunit II (43 kDa)(3Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9159-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cydAB genes coding for both polypeptides have been cloned and sequenced(5Green G.N. Fang H. Lin R.-J. Newton G. Mather M. Georgiou C.D. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13138-13143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this enzyme, it has been claimed, there are three types of cytochrome heme species based on the optical spectra: cytochrome d, cytochrome b595, and cytochrome b558(6Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1051-1056Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Lorence R.M. Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2314-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cytochrome d has a chlorin chromophore (heme D) (8Timkovich R. Cork M.S. Gennis R.B. Johnson P.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6069-6075Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) exhibiting a characteristic absorption maximum at 628 nm in the fully reduced state and is a primary binding site for exogenous ligands(3Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

Acta. 1985; 810: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The dioxygen molecule forms a very stable adduct with ferrous cytochrome d showing its Fe2+-O2 stretching vibration at 568 cm- (essentially identical to that of myoglobin)(10Kahlow M.A. Loehr T.M. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5845-5846Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and thus the enzyme in the air-oxidized state is actually an oxygenated form. The cytochrome d moiety also forms a remarkably stable oxoferryl (Fe4+=O) adduct(11Kahlow M.A. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Subunit I contains cytochrome b558 that shows its α and β peaks at 562 and 532 nm, respectively, in the reduced state (12Green G.N. Kranz R.G. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7994-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and most likely forms the ubiquinol-8 binding site(13Yang F.-D. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14987-14990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b595 is an unusual b-type cytochrome. It was suggested that the optical spectrum of this cytochrome is very similar to that of high spin cytochrome c peroxidase, and its α and β bands are at 595 and 562 nm, respectively, in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum(7Lorence R.M. Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2314-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recent low temperature CO photolysis experiments monitored by the infrared C-O stretching absorption suggest that cytochrome d and cytochrome b595 form a binuclear center(14Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Alben J.O. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): 367Google Scholar).In a previous study we analyzed the purified bd-type ubiquinol oxidase by resonance Raman, FT-IR, ( 1The abbreviations used are: FT-IRFourier-transform infraredEPRelectron paramagnetic resonance.) and EPR spectroscopies (16Tsubaki M. Uno T. Hori H. Mogi T. Nishimura Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We found that heme d-bound C-O and Fe2+-CO stretching frequencies were at 1980.7 and 471 cm-, respectively, in the fully reduced state. These values differ considerably from those of the heme-copper respiratory oxidases and the oxygen-carrying hemoproteins, both groups possessing a His residue as the heme axial ligand(17Tsubaki M. Srivastava R.B. Yu N.-T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 18Argade P.V. Ching Y. Rousseau D.L.

EPR analyses on the air-oxidized O2-bound and Na2S2O4-reduced nitric oxide-bound forms revealed that there is no superhyperfine structure originating from the heme axial 14N ligand in the central resonance of the nitric oxide EPR signals(16Tsubaki M. Uno T. Hori H. Mogi T. Nishimura Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results suggest strongly that the heme d axial ligand of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase is either a His residue in an anomalous condition or some other residue making the molecular structure around the oxygen-binding site different from those of the heme-copper respiratory oxidases. Indeed, electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy has shown that the axial ligand to heme d is most probably not a histidine or other strong nitrogenous ligand(21Jiang F.S. Zuberi T.M.

In the present study we extended our investigation on the redox centers of the E. coli bd-type ubiquinol oxidase using cyanide as a monitoring probe.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of bd-type Ubiquinol OxidaseThe E. coli bd-type ubiquinol oxidase was isolated from the cytoplasmic membranes as described (22Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the slight modification that Tris-HCl buffer was replaced by sodium phosphate buffer and that magnesium chloride was omitted during solubilization. The strain GR84N/pNG2 (cyo+cydA2 recA/cydAB+ Tetr(23Green G.N. Kranz J.E. Gennis R.B. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)), a kind gift from R. B. Gennis, which can overproduce bd-type ubiquinol oxidase, was used. The purified enzyme in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sucrose monolaurate SM-1200 (Mitsubishi-Kasei Food Corp., Tokyo) was stored at -80°C until use.Measurements of EPR, FT-IR, and Optical SpectraEPR measurements were carried out at X-band (9.23 GHz) microwave frequency with a home-built EPR spectrometer as described previously (16Tsubaki M. Uno T. Hori H. Mogi T. Nishimura Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 22Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and a Varian E-12 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford flow cryostat (ESR-900). Infrared spectra were recorded at 4°C with a Perkin-Elmer (model 1850) FT-IR spectrophotometer as described previously (24Tsubaki M. Shinzawa K. Yoshikawa S. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1564-1571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or a JASCO (model VALOR-III) FT-IR spectrophotometer. Absolute optical spectra of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase in the infrared cells with a 51-μm path length were measured at room temperature with a UVIKON 860 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Inc.) before and after FT-IR measurements.MiscellaneousProtein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Metal contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry with a SPS 1200VR plasma spectrometer (Seiko Instruments Inc., Tokyo). Heme B contents were analyzed as described previously(25Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The following potassium cyanide isotopes were used: K12C14N (natural abundance, Nacalai Tesque); K12C15N (99.4 atom % 15N, Isotec Inc.); K13C14N (99 atom % 13C, Isotec Inc.); and K13C15N (99 atom % 13C, 99 atom % 15N, Icon). Other chemicals were commercial products of analytical grade.RESULTSHeme B, Metal Contents, and Optical Extinction CoefficientsThe heme B and metal contents of the purified bd-type ubiquinol oxidase were examined. Heme B content was 18.2 ± 1.6 nmol/mg protein, whereas the heme B:Fe:Cu:Zn ratio (in mol basis) was 2:3.60 ± 0.60:0.084 ± 0.003:0.098 ± 0.026 (averages of three independent preparations). Theoretical value of the heme B content is 19.8 nmol/mg protein assuming the presence of 2 mol of heme B/mol of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase with a molecular mass of 101 kDa(3Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 13138-13143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that bd-type ubiquinol oxidase contains only 1 mol of cytochrome d/mol of the enzyme(14Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, previous and present heme B and metal content analyses of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase indicate that there is 1 mol of heme D and 2 mol of heme B and adventitious non-heme iron/mol of the enzyme and no other constitutive metals (including magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, zinc, selenium, molybdenum, and tungsten)(4Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9159-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of the present analyses, the optical extinction coefficients were calculated (Table 1). The results show considerable deviations from those previously reported(3Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miller M.J.

Soc. 1993; 115: 5845-5846Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) disappeared in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1), as previously reported(26Poole R.K. Kumar C. Salmon I. Chance B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 1335-1344PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lorence R.M. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7135-7140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneously a Soret band spectral change (a peak at 431 nm and a trough at 411 nm in the air-oxidized cyanide-treated minus air-oxidized O2-bound difference spectrum) was observed (Fig. 1)(28Krasnoselskaya I. Arutjunjan A.M. Smirnova I. Gennis R. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Exposure of the air-oxidized O2-bound sample to a CO atmosphere caused a shift of the 647 nm peak to 635 nm, consistent with the formation of the cytochrome d (Fe2+)-CO species(3Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The addition of cyanide to this air-oxidized CO-bound enzyme also caused the characteristic 635 nm band to disappear. The resulting species in both cases had a very broad absorption band around 630 nm, indicative of the oxidation of cytochrome d. Pretreatment of the air-oxidized O2-bound (or air-oxidized CO-bound) enzyme with cyanide retards the appearance of the reduced cytochrome d absorption band at 629 nm upon the addition of Na2S2O4 (spectra not shown), consistent with the previous results(29Kauffman H.F. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the addition of cyanide (10 mM) to the fully reduced (with Na2S2O4) form of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase did not affect the visible absorption spectrum (data not shown)(29Kauffman H.F. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Pudek M.R. Bragg P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 164: 682-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).FT-IR SpectroscopyJust after the addition of cyanide (5 mM) to the air-oxidized O2-bound enzyme, there was no infrared band assignable to a bound cyanide species, except for a band of free H12C14N at 2093 cm-(31Yoshikawa S. O'Keeffe D.H. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3518-3528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A weak feature at 2161 cm- developed in a time-dependent manner (spectra not shown). This band showed cyanide isotope-sensitive shifts to 2129 cm- (12C15N), to 2114 cm- (13C14N), and to 2082 cm- (13C15N). The identical cyanide band developed, but more quickly, upon the addition of cyanide (5 mM) to the air-oxidized CO-bound enzyme, with a concomitant disappearance of the cytochrome d(Fe2+)-C-O stretching band at 1983.4 cm- (Fig. 2, A and B). The addition of Na2S2O4 to the cyanide-pretreated enzyme in the CO atmosphere reversed the spectral change. The cytochrome d(Fe2+)-C-O stretching band at 1980.7 cm- developed in a time-dependent manner with a concomitant decrease of the 2161 cm- band intensity (Fig. 2, C, D, and E). A shoulder around 1975 cm- was noticed in the early stage of the spectral change (Fig. 2C), and a weak C-N infrared band at 2138 cm- was observed during the spectral change (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment of the air-oxidized O2-bound enzyme with Na2S2O4 and CO before the addition of cyanide produced only an infrared band of the heme d(Fe2+)-bound C-O stretching mode at 1980.7 cm-(16Tsubaki M. Uno T. Hori H. Mogi T. Nishimura Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The 2161 cm- species was not observed at all under the fully reduced conditions.Figure 2FT-IR spectra of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase in the C-O and C-N stretching vibration region. The air-oxidized O2-bound enzyme was exposed first to carbon monoxide (12C16O) atmosphere (A); then cyanide (12C14N; 5 mM) was added anaerobically to the air-oxidized CO-exposed enzyme, (B, taken 40 min after the addition of cyanide). Then Na2S2O4 was added anaerobically to the air-oxidized CO-exposed cyanide-treated enzyme, and the development of the 1980.7 cm- band and decay of the 2161 cm- band were recorded (C, D, and E; taken just after, 100 min after, and 16 h after the addition of Na2S2O4, respectively). Sample concentration was 0.60 mM (1.21 mM in heme B concentration). The band at 2093 cm- is due to free H12C14N.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EPR SpectroscopyThe addition of cyanide (5 mM) to the air-oxidized O2-bound enzyme just before the EPR measurement caused changes in the spectral line shape of the g = 6 high spin signal region (spectra not shown). The line shapes of both the rhombic and axial components are altered, with the axial component being slightly broader and the rhombic signal being further distorted. These observations are essentially consistent with those reported for the membrane-bound bd-type ubiquinol oxidase(32Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the intensity of the high spin signals did not change appreciably compared with that of the air-oxidized O2-bound state before addition of cyanide. Prolonged incubation of the enzyme with cyanide caused diminution of the g = 6 rhombic signal, whereas the axial high spin signal was little changed during the incubation (spectra not shown).Cyanide also caused disappearance of ferric low spin signals at gz = 2.46, gy = 2.32 (Fig. 3, A and B), and gx = 1.83 (not shown) at 15 K. Those were assigned to a minor form of ferric cytochrome d(9Hata A. Kirino Y. Matsuura K. Itoh S. Hiyama T. Konishi K. Kita K. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 810: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, a derivative-shaped EPR signal at g = 3.15 developed (Fig. 3B) together with another low spin signal at g = 2.82. Prolonged incubation of the sample at 4°C in the dark caused an increase in intensity of these EPR signals (Fig. 3C). The EPR signal at g = 3.15 is distinct from the g = 3.3 signal previously assigned as ferric low spin cytochrome b558(32Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem.

The derivative-shaped EPR signal at g = 3.15 persisted and a transient EPR species with gz = 2.96 appeared (Fig. 3D). The gz = 2.96 signal can be ascribed to a cyanide adduct of cytochrome d(Fe3+)(32Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Jünemann S.

Prolonged incubation of the Na2S2O4-treated sample on ice removed the derivative-shaped EPR signal and the transient EPR signal completely.DISCUSSIONNumber of Metal Centers in bd-type Ubiquinol OxidaseThe heme B and iron contents of the purified enzyme suggest that there are only three cytochromes present. Thus, we conclude that bd-type ubiquinol oxidase is a cytochrome bbd-type enzyme as reported previously(4Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9159-9165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Koland J.G. Miller M.J. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1051-1056Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Lorence R.M. Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2314-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Assuming this structure, we recalculated the extinction coefficients for various wavelength pairs (Table 1). ( 2Recently, R. B. Gennis recalculated and obtained essentially the same extinction coefficients for the E. coli oxidase (personal communication).) The new set gave us reasonable estimation of the number of metal centers in the oxidase. We found that the preparations of Kita et al.(3Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Konishi et al.(36Konishi K. Ouchi M. Kita K. Horikoshi I. J. Biochem. 1986; 99: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Lorence et al. (7Lorence R.M. Koland J.G. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2314-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) all contain two cytochromes b and one cytochrome d in the oxidase (i.e. 2:1.05, 2:0.76, 2:1.08 (b558:b595:d = 1:1.02:1.09), respectively).FT-IR SpectraOnly one bound cyanide infrared band (2161 cm-) was observed upon the addition of cyanide to the air-oxidized O2-bound enzyme. The increase of the band intensity was in parallel to the intensity decrease of the optical absorption band at 647 nm (Fig. 1). The same infrared band was formed upon the addition of cyanide to the air-oxidized CO-bound enzyme with concomitant disappearances of the 1983.4 cm- C-O infrared band and the 635 nm band of cytochrome d(Fe2+)-CO (Fig. 2). Thus, it is quite certain that cyanide binds at the cytochrome d(Fe3+) center. The frequency is in the region of the so-called “bridging cyanide” bound to metals in the oxidized state (i.e. 2181 ∼2141 cm-)(22Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Tsubaki M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Scott M.J. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11357-11367Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that the 2161 cm- band is due to a species having a cyanide-bridging structure between heme d(Fe3+) and one of other two ferric heme irons.EPR SpectraThe postulated cyanide-bridging species is expected to be either EPR-inactive or to have an unusual EPR character because the spin-spin coupling depends on the relative geometry and the spin state of the participating metal centers. The derivative-shaped EPR signal at g = 3.15 is likely derived from the cyanide-bridging species (Fig. 3). The ferric low spin EPR signals at gz = 2.46, gy = 2.32, and gx = 1.83 that are assignable to a minor form of ferric cytochrome d(9Hata A. Kirino Y. Matsuura K. Itoh S. Hiyama T. Konishi K. Kita K. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 810: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) seem at least partially responsible for the appearance of the peculiar signal at g = 3.15 and the low spin signal at g = 2.82, because these EPR signals appeared just after the addition of cyanide. However, a major part of the g = 3.15 species developed as the oxidation of the oxygenated form of cytochrome d(Fe2+) proceeded after the addition of cyanide.On the other hand, the g = 6 high spin rhombic EPR signal diminished appreciably upon prolonged incubation with cyanide, whereas the axial high spin signal changed little during the incubation. Although the assignment for the g = 6 high spin axial signal ( 3Although the g = 3.3 signal has been assigned as the gz component of the ferric low spin species of cytochrome b558 in the air-oxidized state(32Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Meinhardt S.W. Gennis R.B. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Spinner F. Chessman M.R. Thomson A.J. Kaysser T. Gennis R.B. Peng Q. Peterson J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we consider this signal as a minor form of cytochrome b558. The g = 3.3 signal seems to be too weak to account for the whole cytochrome b558 content. We suggest that a major population of cytochrome b558 in the air-oxidized O2-bound form adopts a high spin state that exhibits g = 6 axial EPR signal. This interpretation was confirmed recently by resonance Raman measurements of the air-oxidized O2-bound bd-type ubiquinol oxidase (S. Hirota, T. Mogi, Y. Anraku, and T. Kitagawa, unpublished observations). They could not observe any typical low spin marker bands in the higher frequency region with various excitation wavelengths around the Soret region.) is still controversial, there seems to be a consensus that the g = 6 high spin rhombic signal is due to cytochrome b595(32Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Meinhardt S.W. Gennis R.B. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Hata-Tanaka A. Matsuura K. Itoh S. Anraku Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From these pieces of evidence we conclude that the cyanide-bridging structure at the active site is a kind of “heme d(Fe3+)-C=N-heme b595(Fe3+).”The nature of the EPR signal at g = 2.82 is not clear because the intensity of this signal was preparation-dependent. This may be due to a minor form of heme d(Fe3+)-CN derived from the cyanide-bridging species in which the bridging structure is partially destroyed upon freezing. This scenario is consistent with the observation of only one C-N stretching infrared band (i.e. the 2161 cm- band) at room temperature. However, other possibilities (e.g. heme b595(Fe3+)-CN or heme b595(Fe3+)-NC species) cannot be completely excluded.The addition of Na2S2O4 to the preformed cyanide complex produced a new, but transient, low spin heme species having with the gz = 2.96 EPR signal (Fig. 3D) and the 2138 cm- cyanide infrared band (Fig. 2). This species is assignable to heme d(Fe3+)-CN unambiguously(32Rothery R.A. Ingledew W.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Jünemann S. Wrigglesworth J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16213-16220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The observed spectral changes are most likely due to a breakage of the cyanide-bridging structure caused by the reduction of cytochrome b595 heme itself or by the conformational change around the binuclear center upon reduction of cytochrome b558 heme. Such influence of the redox states of other metal centers on the heme d has been observed for the bound C-O stretching frequencies, i.e. the C-O band appears at 1980.7 cm- in the fully reduced state, whereas it is at 1983.4 cm- in the partially reduced state (Fig. 2)(16Tsubaki M. Uno T. Hori H. Mogi T. Nishimura Y. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These spectral characteristics are indicative of the heme-heme interactions and have some similarities to those of the heme-copper oxidase(22Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Tsubaki M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 40Yoshikawa S. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 412-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The lower gz value (2.96 for the partially reduced state and 2.82 for the air-oxidized state) and the higher C-N stretching frequency (2138 cm-) of the heme d(Fe3+)-CN moiety compared with those of corresponding species of the heme-copper oxidase (gz = 3.24 (41Ingledew W.J. Horrocks J. Salerno J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and 2123 cm( 4M. Tsubaki, H. Hori, T. Mogi, and Y. Anraku, unpublished results.) for the E. coli bo-type ubiquinol oxidase and gz = 3.58 (42Johnson M.K. Eglinton D.G. Gooding P.E. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 2132 cm(37Tsubaki M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for bovine cytochrome c oxidase) might be ascribed, however, mainly to the chlorin macrocycle of heme d. It was reported that cyanide adducts of ferric hemoproteins containing chlorin macrocycle exhibited a gz value as low as 2.6(43Peng Q. Peterson J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It is also known that presence of electron-withdrawing groups (such as hydroxyl groups) on iron porphyrin macrocycle leads to an increase of the bound C-N stretching vibration(31Yoshikawa S. O'Keeffe D.H. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3518-3528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Structure of the Heme-Heme Binuclear Metal CenterHill et al. (14Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Hill J.J. Gennis R.B. Alben J.O. Biophys. J. 1994; 66 (abstr.): 367Google Scholar) claimed that there is a heme d-heme b595 binuclear center at the catalytic site of bd-type ubiquinol oxidase on the basis of the low temperature FT-IR study. Heme b595 traps the photolyzed CO from cytochrome d and exhibits the 1974 cm- band at cryogenic temperature(14Hill J.J. Alben J.O. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5863-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Later, Krasnoselskaya et al.(28Krasnoselskaya I. Arutjunjan A.M. Smirnova I. Gennis R. Konstantinov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) proposed that cyanide reacts with the air-oxidized O2-bound bd-type ubiquinol oxidase to cause a decomposition of the cytochrome d-O2 complex and an oxidation of heme d resulting in a formation of a cytochrome d(Fe3+)-CN species. As one possibility, they proposed a structure like “heme d(Fe3+)-C=N-heme b595(Fe3+).” This is consistent with our present conclusion.We should consider, at this point, a possible structure of the heme-heme binuclear center to obtain detailed insight into the dioxygen reduction mechanism of bd-type quinol oxidase. In the cyanide-bridging structure, the C atom of the cyanide is likely bound to the Fe atom of heme d with the Fe-C bond being perpendicular to the heme plane (with the Fe-C and C=N bond lengths as 1.9 and 1.1 Å, respectively(38Scott M.J. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11357-11367Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). The Fe(b595)-NC distance and Fe(b595)-N-C angle would vary markedly with the relative distance and orientation of the two metal centers (38Scott M.J. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11357-11367Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The orientations of heme d and heme b595 have been determined by EPR studies on oriented multilayer preparations of cytoplasmic membrane fragments (44Ingledew W.J. Rothery R.A. Gennis R.B. Salerno J.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both ferric high and low spin heme d are oriented with their heme planes perpendicular to the membrane plane. Ferric high spin heme b595 is oriented with its heme plane at approximately 55° to the membrane plane. Thus, heme d and heme b595 planes are facing each other with 35° orientation. Assuming the Fe(b595)-N bond to be perpendicular to the heme plane with the bond length of 2.2 Å(38Scott M.J. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11357-11367Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the distance of the two metal center was calculated as 5.1 Å. In this case, peripheral group(s) of the two hemes must be in a close contact each other, the access of an amino acid residue(s) into the ligand binding pocket (i.e. the space between the two metal centers) must be highly restricted, and the ligand-binding pocket itself would be very hydrophobic. The hydrophobic nature of the ligand-binding pocket is consistent with the unusual stability of the oxygenated species as well as the oxoferryl (Fe4+=O) adduct(10Kahlow M.A. Loehr T.M. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 5845-5846Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Kahlow M.A. Zuberi T.M. Gennis R.B. Loehr T.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11485-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This might be one of the reasons why bd-type ubiquinol oxidase is more resistant to anionic inhibitors such as cyanide and azide than bo-type ubiquinol oxidase(2Poole R.K. Biochim. Biophys.

INTRODUCTIONEscherichia coli has two terminal ubiquinol oxidases in the aerobic electron transfer chain: bo-type ubiquinol oxidase, which is expressed under high oxygen tension, and bd-type ubiquinol oxidase, which predominates under low oxygen tension(1Anraku Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Poole R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 205-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These oxidases are structurally unrelated, but both catalyze the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol-8 and the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to produce water(1Anraku Y. Annu. Rev.

Within this enzyme, it has been claimed, there are three types of cytochrome heme species based on the optical spectra: cytochrome d, cytochrome b595, and cytochrome b558(6Koland J.G. Miller M.J.

https://openalex.org/W1501933018,"A primary site for initiation of plus strand DNA synthesis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) corresponds to a 19-nucleotide-long purine rich sequence located just upstream of the U3 region, designated the polypurine tract (PPT). The HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) uses its RNase H activity to cut the genomic RNA after minus strand DNA synthesis. A plus strand PPT primer is formed, extended, and then removed. In vitro, the HIV-RT recognizes this primer specifically, using it much more efficiently than other RNA primers. However, the PPT still primes significantly less efficiently than DNA primers. The 19-nucleotide PPT primer is partially resistant to degradation when compared with other oligoribonucleotides. Prior to initiation of DNA synthesis, several nucleotides are removed by the RT from the 3′ ends of some of the PPT primers. Cleavage is enhanced in the absence of dNTPs. We suggest that DNA synthesis suppresses primer degradation, so that primer extension and cleavage occur in proper sequence. As a result of 3′ end degradation, PPT elongation products contain 5′-RNA segments from 16 to 19 nucleotides in length. These shorter segments are also generated from a longer transcript containing the PPT sequence, indicating that they are not created as a result of binding of the RT to the 5′ end of the PPT oligoribonucleotide. Full-length and shorter versions of the PPT primers are cleaved from the extended DNA by RT. These experiments show that HIV-RT has a specificity to generate a primer in the region of the PPT but that the ends of the primer are not well defined."

We describe here the identification and characterization of an initiator element in the TATA-containing human βglobin promoter. Mutagenesis of the β-globin initiator element at positions +2/+3 and +4/+5 abrogates transcription in a heterologous construct. Interestingly, we have found a β-globin initiator binding activity in nuclear extracts whose presence or absence correlates with function of the β-globin initiator. Accordingly, this binding activity may be part of the machinery required for β-globin initiator-dependent transcription. Our analysis further describes a previously uncharacterized β-thalassemia mutation at the +1 site as a mutation that decreases β-globin initiator activity. Finally, consistent with other initiator elements, the β-globin initiator requires a TFIID-containing fraction for in vitro activity.

Administration of transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) to the basolateral, but not the apical, plasma membrane compartment disrupted the glucocorticoid-stimulated tight junction barrier.

Our recent studies have documented that glucocorticoids stimulate the in vitro formation of tight junctions in nontransformed mouse mammary epithelial cell line of ductal origin(16Singer K.L.

Given the biological importance of structurally distinguishing the lumenal side from the blood or basolateral side of normal mammary epithelia, it is tempting to consider that tight junctions mediate the polarized availability of growth factor receptors and/or their signaling pathways in mammary cells. To address whether EGF receptor signaling can be regulated by tight junction formation in mammary epithelial tumor cells, we have been utilizing the Con8 rat mammary tumor cell line which is derived from a 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene-induced rat mammary adenocarcinoma (19Segaloff A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1966; 22: 351-379PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, strongly suppresses the growth of Con8 mammary tumor cells(20Webster M.K. Guthrie J.

We have recently shown that glucocorticoids stimulate tight junction formation in confluent monolayers of Con8 cells and that constitutive expression and secretion of TGF-α reversed this process under conditions in which cellular proliferation is stimulated(25Buse P.

This result suggests that exogenously added TGF-α may be capable of disrupting fully functioning tight junctions in glucocorticoid treated Con8 cell monolayers, depending on the cell surface availability of EGF receptors. By examining the responsiveness of dexamethasone-treated monolayers of mammary tumor cells to TGF-α, we uncovered the first evidence for a polarized responsiveness of EGF receptors and provide direct support for steroid-stimulated intercellular junctions as crucial structures that police the ability of mammary tumor cells to respond to locally acting growth factors. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (50/50) and calf serum were supplied by Whittaker (Walkersville, MD) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin-EDTA, araC, and dexamethasone were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Thymidine (5 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Permeable supports manufactured by Nunc were distributed by Applied Scientific (San Francisco, CA). Human recombinant TGF-α was purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). The ZO-1 monoclonal antibodies (R40.76) were a generous gift of Bruce R. Stevenson (Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Alberta, Edmonton) and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-Rat IgG antibodies were supplied by Cappel (Malvern, PA). All other reagents were of highest available purity. Con8 is a single cell-derived epithelial subclone obtained after collagenase digestion of the 13762NF transplantable rat mammary adenocarcinoma(20Webster M.K. Guthrie J. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4831-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Webster M.K. Guthrie J. Firestone G.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6031-6038PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line was routinely grown to 100% confluency on Nunc permeable tissue culture supports in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, at 37°C in a humid atmosphere of air/CO2 (95:5). Cell culture medium was routinely changed every 24 h. In appropriate experiments, dexamethasone was added to a final concentration of 1 μM, and human recombinant TGF-α was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. In order to inhibit DNA synthesis, cells cultures were exposed to 10 μM araC. The transepithelial electrical resistance was measured on support-grown cells at room temperature, using the EVOM Epithelial Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) as described previously (16Singer K.L. Stevenson B.R. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Zettl K.S. Sjaastad M.D. Riskin P.M. Parry G. Machen T.E. Firestone G.L.

Calculations for ohms•cm2 were determined by subtracting the resistance measurement of a blank filter and multiplying by the area of the monolayer (0.49 cm2 for the 10-mm filters). To quantitate relative rates of DNA synthesis, triplicate samples of Con8 cells were grown to confluency on permeable supports and treated with indicated combinations of dexamethasone, TGF-α, and/or araC. The media were replaced with fresh media containing 1-4 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine (5 Ci/mmol), and the cells were incubated for 1 h. The cells were washed four times with PBS and twice with 100% methanol and air-dried for 12 h. The filter inserts were placed directly into scintillation vials, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Con8 cells were grown to 100% confluency on permeable 24-well filters and incubated with the indicated combinations of dexamethasone and TGF-α. TGF-α was added to either the apical or basolateral side of the monolayer. The monolayers were washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), and the cells were fixed with 1.75% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the monolayers were permeabilized with TX-100 extraction buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) with 3% nonfat dry milk. The cells were washed three more times with PBS and then blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS. ZO-1-specific antibody R40.76 was used at a dilution of 1:400. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed three times with TBST with 3% nonfat dry milk. The secondary antibody was a fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat IgG fraction to rat IgG and used at a dilution of 1:100. Cells were incubated with the antibody for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The cell monolayers were then washed three times with TBST containing 3% nonfat dry milk. The supports were punched out and mounted on glass slides in 50% glycerol, 50 mM Tris, pH 8-9, and 0.4% n-propyl gallate. Confocal images were obtained from a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope using a Zeiss 40X Plan-Neofluar multi-immersion objective (0.9 numerical aperture) and processed with a MRC 600 system. A series of digitized optical sections were collected starting from the basal side of the monolayer and stepping toward the apical membrane in 1.0-μm steps. The sections representing the plane of ZO-1 were printed on a Kodak Colorease PS printer. For Western blot analysis, whole cell samples in lysis buffer were normalized for protein content with the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Cell lysates were subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose (nitro ME, Micron Separations Inc, Westboro, MA), Western blots sequentially incubated with rat anti-ZO-1 monoclonal antibodies (R40.76), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary antibody, and the signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously(16Singer K.L. Stevenson B.R. Woo P.L. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16108-16115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel cell samples were electrophoretically fractionated, and equivalent protein loading was demonstrated by Coomassie Blue staining of the protein gels. Tight junctions define the distinct boundary between the apical and basolateral plasma membrane surfaces(9Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,10Anderson J.M. Balda M.S. Fanning S.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the in vitro formation of tight junctions in glucocorticoid-treated Con8 mammary tumor cells (25Buse P. Woo P.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) provides the opportunity to examine the polarized responsiveness of mammary tumor cells to environmental signals. A key issue is to determine whether mammogenic growth factor receptor responsiveness is polarized, since polarity of the normal epithelia is critical to the function of the mammary gland(2Imagawa W. Bandyopadhyay G.K. Nandi S. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,8Pitelka D.R. Larson B.L. Smith V.R. Lactation: A Comprehensive Treatise.

To test this notion, confluent monolayers of Con8 mammary tumor cells were cultured on permeable supports and tight junctions formed by treatment with 1 μM dexamethasone. The trans-well permeable support system allows the apical or basolateral surfaces of the cells to be selectively manipulated once tight junctions are formed since cell surface acting agents, such as TGF-α, can be added to either the basolateral (via the “outer compartment”) or apical (via the “inner compartment”) plasma membrane of the cell monolayer. Consistent with our previous results (25Buse P. Woo P.L. Alexander D.B. Cha H.H. Reza A. Sirota N.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6505-6514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), dexamethasone induced a significant increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the cell monolayer over a 42-h time course, which remained essentially unchanged in the absence of steroid (Fig. 1, upper panel; +DEX versus -DEX). To test for the polarized distribution and/or function of EGF receptors, TGF-α was added to either the apical or basolateral surfaces of dexamethasone-treated mammary tumor cells, and the effects on monolayer TER were monitored over 42 h. When TGF-α was added to the apical side of a Con8 mammary tumor cell monolayer treated with dexamethasone for 24 h, TER continued to increase at a rate slightly greater than that of cells treated only with dexamethasone (Fig. 1, upper panel; +DEX/TGFα Ap versus +DEX) which indicates that the tight junctional machinery was intact. In striking contrast, when TGF-α was added to the basolateral surface of the cells, TER was reduced to basal levels within 18 h of growth factor treatment (Fig. 1, upper panel; +DEX/TGFα Bl versus -DEX). Similarly, when both the apical and basolateral surfaces of the monolayer were exposed to TGF-α (Fig. 1, upper panel; +DEX/TGFα Ap/Bl), the monolayer electrical resistance was quickly restored to basal levels. Basolateral, but not apical, addition of TGF-α reversed the dexamethasone-inhibited paracellular leakage of small radiolabeled tracers, such as [3H]inulin (data not shown), further confirming that TGF-α disrupts the “gate” function and increases monolayer permeability in a polarized manner. To determine whether the observed polarized disruption of tight junction integrity may simply be due to differences in EGF receptor ligand responsiveness, 42-h dexamethasone-stimulated cells were incubated for an additional 72 h with various concentrations of TGF-α (0-20 ng/ml) added to either the apical or basolateral sides of the monolayer. Cells treated with dexamethasone without TGF-α displayed a 6-fold stimulation in TER (defined as 0 point in lower panel inFig. 1). Basolateral addition of TGF-α dose-dependently reduced the TER to basal levels, whereas apical addition of TGF-α further increased the TER (Fig. 1, lower panel). Although most dramatic at the higher doses of TGF-α, the polarized effects are observed at the lower concentrations of TGF-α corresponding to the physiological levels of growth factor. The similarities in each dose response suggest that the EGF receptor affinities are similar on both sides of the monolayer and supports the hypothesis that TGF-α activates different components of the EGF-receptor signal transduction pathways linked to the apical versus the basolateral compartments. To further investigate the dynamic steroid and growth factor control of tight junction structure, we tested whether the localization or expression of ZO-1, an intracellular peripheral membrane protein highly associated with tight junctions in epithelial cells (10Anderson J.M. Balda M.S. Fanning S.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,27Willott E. Balda M.S. Fanning A.S. Jameson B. Van I.C. Anderson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) may be a target of glucocorticoid or TGF-α signaling in Con8 mammary tumor cells. The images shown inFig. 2 illustrate sections taken in the apical plane of ZO-1 at the top through the basolateral plane at the bottom. The distance between each optical section is 2 μm. In the absence of steroid (Fig. 2, Panels a-c), ZO-1 staining displayed a spotty, discontinuous pattern, which appeared as apparent aggregates along the cell periphery, especially at the junctions between several cells. In addition, ZO-1 at the middle and basolateral plane (Fig. 2, Panels b and c) in certain cells of the untreated monolayer were visualized as intense, linear series of accumulations at the cell border. When cells were treated with dexamethasone (Fig. 2, Panels d-f), ZO-1 localization exhibited a very discrete and continuous band at the lateral membrane of adjacent cells in all three planes. Consistent with the effects on TER, addition of TGF-α to the apical side of a glucocorticoid-induced polarized monolayer (Fig. 2, Panels g-i) had no effect on ZO-1 localization which was maintained as a distinct and continuous band surrounding the peripheries of the cells. In contrast, when cells were treated with TGF-α at the basolateral surface of the monolayer (Fig. 2, Panels j-l), ZO-1 distribution reverted back to a disorganized and discontinuous pattern of staining, analogous to that seen in control cells without drug treatment. Although these cells retained the peripheral ZO-1 localization, the more intense staining was at the junctions shared by numerous cells. A similar disorganized ZO-1 immunostaining was also observed after the addition of TGF-α to both the apical and basolateral sides of the monolayer (data not shown). This growth factor alteration of ZO-1 localization is indicative of the disruption in the apical/basolateral boundary mediated by the loss of tight junctions. Under conditions in which glucocorticoids or TGF-α modulates the pattern of ZO-1 immunostaining, Western blot analysis revealed that there were no detectable differences in ZO-1 protein levels (Fig. 3). Thus, the coordinate and opposing regulation of the cellular distribution of ZO-1 correlates with the regulation of monolayer transepithelial electrical resistance of mammary tumor cells by glucocorticoids and basolateral addition of TGF-α. These results demonstrate for the first time a polarity of EGF receptor responsiveness in epithelial cells and strongly implicates the glucocorticoid induction of tight junction formation in mammary tumor cells as playing a role in governing this process.Figure 3:Western blot analysis of ZO-1 expression levels. Con8 mammary tumor cells were treated with no hormones (-Dex) or 1 μM dexamethasone (+Dex) for 72 h. 10 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-α was applied to 24-h dexamethasone-treated cells for an additional 48 h on the apical surface of the monolayer, +Dex+TGFα (Ap), basolateral surface, +Dex+TGFα (Bl), or simultaneously to the apical and basolateral surface, +Dex+TGFα (Ap+Bl). Cell lysates were normalized for total protein (confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of a parallel polyacrylamide gel), electrophoretically fractionated, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and analyzed for ZO-1 protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein molecular mass standards are myosin (200 kDa) and phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Conceivably, the polarized manner in which TGF-α disrupts the dexamethasone-stimulated formation of tight junctions may be due to the selective localization of the EGF receptor protein or due to the polarized function of the receptor-signaling pathway either at the apical or basolateral side of the cell. To test this possibility, TGF-α's mitogenic activity on Con8 cells was examined in monolayers exposed at the apical and/or basolateral surfaces to this growth factor. Dexamethasone strongly inhibited the DNA synthesis of Con8 cell monolayers grown on permeable supports (Fig. 4). In contrast to the polarized effects on monolayer TER, the addition of TGF-α to either the apical, basolateral, or both sides of the monolayer strongly restimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation of dexamethasone treated mammary tumor cells to approximately the same extent (Fig. 4). This result demonstrates that EGF receptors are distributed to and are functional at both the apical or basolateral cell surfaces in glucocorticoid-treated cells; however, the signal transduction events triggering the disruption of tight junctions appear to be distinct for the apical versus the basolateral compartments of the mammary tumor cells. To examine whether the basolateral-mediated disruption of tight junction formation by TGF-α is independent of the proliferative response, the glucocorticoid and growth factor regulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation and TER of Con8 cell monolayers were analyzed after treatment with araC, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. As shown inTable 1, dexamethasone stimulated the monolayer TER to the same extent in the presence or absence of 10 μM araC. Under conditions in which [3H]thymidine incorporation remains strongly inhibited by araC, basolateral exposure to TGF-α rapidly reduced the monolayer TER back to basal levels (Table 1). The monolayer TER remained at approximately the steroid-induced level after apical addition of TGF-α in the presence or absence of araC. This result suggests that the basolateral specific signaling pathway leading to the disruption of cell-cell interactions by TGF-α is distinct from and independent of the proliferative pathway mediated by this growth factor.TABLE I Open table in a new tab A key consequence of the glucocorticoid stimulated formation of tight junctions in Con8 mammary tumor cells is the formation of a polarized cell monolayer, since TGF-α reduces monolayer electrical resistance when added to the basolateral membrane compartment but not when exposed to the apical or lumenal compartment. Growth factor addition to either compartment of a dexamethasone-treated monolayer restimulates DNA synthesis, demonstrating for the first time that TGF-α, which binds to the EGF receptor(28Derynck R. Cell. 1988; 54: 593-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), appears to trigger different signal transduction cascades or activate polarized intermediates depending on the compartmental localization of its cognate receptor (Fig. 4). The proliferative pathway of TGF-α involves activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase C signal transduction pathways via the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase(29Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and we are currently attempting to uncover the basolateral specific components which selectively transduce the TGF-α disruption of cell-cell interactions. Reduction of tight junction permeability is an important differentiated function of normal mammary gland cells(8Pitelka D.R. Larson B.L. Smith V.R. Lactation: A Comprehensive Treatise. Academic Press, New York1978: 141-166Google Scholar), and our results show that glucocorticoid-regulated tight junctions can control access of growth factors to one class of receptor signaling networks (30Pawson T.

Sci. 1993; 340: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) which govern the growth and development of normal and transformed mammary cells(1Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1989; 45: 383-440PubMed Google Scholar,2Imagawa W. Bandyopadhyay G.K. Nandi S. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,4Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Treat. Res. 1988; 40: 251-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We propose that the glucocorticoid stimulation of tight junction formation provides a functional switch which restricts the biological response to TGF-α, and perhaps other factors, selectively secreted into the apical or lumenal side of the monolayer. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated a role for TGF-α in the growth and development of the normal mammary gland as well as in tumor progression and proliferation of rodent and human mammary tumor cells(2Imagawa W. Bandyopadhyay G.K. Nandi S. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 494-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,4Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Treat.

Rev. 1992; 13: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). For example, the introduction of TGF-α cDNA into the germ line of transgenic mice causes the appearance of hormone-dependent mammary adenocarcinomas (32Matsui Y. Halter S.A. Holt J.T. Hogan B.L. Coffey R.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 1147-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Mammary tumor cells produce TGF-α (33Liu S.C. Sanfilippo B. Perroteau I. Derynck R. Salomon D.S. Kidwell W.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the biological implication of basolateral exposure to TGF-α, and subsequent disruption of the apical/basolateral boundary and intercellular “gate” functions controlled by tight junctions may be the permissive passage of substances between lumenal and basolateral sides of mammary epithelia, thereby allowing the epithelium to be responsive to a variety of factors which normally are confined to one side of the mammary epithelium. Therefore, it is tempting to consider that dynamic interactions between steroid and EGF receptor-signaling networks, which have opposing effects on tight junction formation, ZO-1 protein localization, and cell polarity, may suppress or mediate the dysfunctional autocrine signaling cascades within mammary tumor cells. The ZO-1 tight junction-associated protein, whose cellular localization is regulated in an antagonistic manner by glucocorticoids and TGF-α in Con8 mammary tumor cells, has significant sequence homology to the product of the lethal (l) disc large-1 (dlg) gene of Drosophila(27Willott E.

Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) which has been implicated as a tumor-suppressor gene. Drosophila mutations in dlg result in a loss of apical-basolateral epithelial cell polarity and in a stimulation of neoplastic growth(35Abbott L.A. Natzle J.E. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has implicated other junctional components, adhesion molecules, and integral membrane proteins as potential tumor suppressors (34Tsukita S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S.

Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Thus, in mammalian cells, the hormonal control of junctional plaque proteins, such as ZO-1, may play a key role in suppression of a malignant phenotype by modulating growth factor receptor signal transduction pathways involved in tumor proliferation, dedifferentiation, or metastasis. Glucocorticoids can exert their effects on gene expression by specific binding of the steroid receptor complex to DNA transcriptional enhancer elements, which are present in promoters of steroid regulated genes, or by interfering with the action of other transcription factors via protein-protein interactions(40Fuller P.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3092-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,41Truss M. Beato M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 459-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that specific subsets of glucocorticoid-regulated gene products act as structural and/or regulatory components which modulate tight junction permeability, selectively target or functionally regulate cellular trafficking pathways mediating ZO-1 localization, and/or guide the cellular decision that determines whether TGF-α disrupts the tight junction belt. Steroid hormones have been shown to regulate the expression of certain cell adhesion molecules, for example C-CAM (cell-cell adhesion molecule) expression is repressed by androgens in rat ventral prostatic epithelium (42Hsieh J.T. Lin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3711-3716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glucocorticoids reduce integrin α1 transcript levels in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (43Zhang Z. Tarone G. Turner D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5557-5565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as stimulate expression of the connexin 26 and connexin 32 gap junction gene transcripts in rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cells(44Ren P. de F.A. Paul D.L. Ruch R.J. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, an emerging subset of steroid-regulated genes have been detected which mediate different types of cell-cell interactions in a variety of tissues. We are currently attempting to define the glucocorticoid-regulated components which target tight junction complex proteins and induce functional polarity to growth factor responsiveness in mammary cells.

Two distinct protein-DNA complexes were observed, the faster migrating complex (complex I, Kd = 4 × 10-9M) contained one molecule of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease, while the slower migrating complex (complex II, Kd = 4 × 10-7M) contained two molecules of the protein bound to every molecule of duplex DNA. The endonucleolytic activity of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease paralleled the formation of the complex I. Interestingly, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease exhibited similar affinities for both the substrate and the nicked duplex product and thus remained bound to the DNA after the cleavage reaction. The formation of a stable complex required the presence of a duplex structure 5′ to the deoxyinosine residue. DNase I footprinting revealed that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease protected 4-5 nucleotides 5′ to the deoxyinosine, and when complex II was formed, at least 13 nucleotides 3′ to deoxyinosine were protected. Based on these results, a model is proposed for the interaction of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease with DNA containing deoxyinosine.

Deoxyinosine in DNA can arise from deamination of deoxyadenosine, which can be spontaneous or promoted by exposure of DNA to ionizing radiation, UV light, or nitrous acid(1Kland M.J. Johnson L.A. J.

Res. 1986; 162: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Deoxyinosine in DNA was thought to be removed by hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase, which has been partially purified from Escherichia coli as well as other eukaryotic sources(5Karran P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5877-5879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Karran P. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 6005-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7Myrnes B.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3328-3334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was reported recently (9Saparbave M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that a well characterized repair enzyme, 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II, encoded by alkA gene in E. coli possesses hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase activity and releases hypoxanthine from deoxyinosine-containing DNA, suggesting that both 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase and hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase activities reside in the same protein. It has also been shown that 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase from human (ANPG protein), rat (APDG protein), and yeast (MAG protein) are able to excise hypoxanthine from DNA(9Saparbave M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified and purified a novel deoxyinosine specific endonuclease from E. coli, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease (10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme hydrolyzes the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to the deoxyinosine residue. In addition to deoxyinosine, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease also recognizes AP site, urea residue, and base mismatches in DNA and exhibits strand-specific cleavage of base mismatches in DNA(11Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease does not remove deoxyinosine or other lesions from the DNA(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that other proteins are required to complete the repair process initiated by deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease. The initial binding of a protein to DNA is critical for multiprotein interaction with DNA(12Echols H. Science. 1986; 233: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA complexes formed promote the entry of other proteins by protein-protein interaction or by induced comformational changes of the DNA. In DNA repair systems, both nucleotide excision repair and methyl-directed mismatch repair require multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions to remove the DNA damages (for reviews, see (14Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and (15Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar)). Since deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease might also initiate a repair process that requires more than one protein, it is of interest to determine whether deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease can interact with DNA containing deoxyinosine to form a stable complex. In this paper, we show that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease forms two stable complexes with duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing deoxyinosine, and we propose a model to explain its interaction with the DNA containing deoxyinosine. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease was purified from E. coli strain BW434 (nth-xth-, provided by Dr. B. Weiss, University of Michigan) as described previously(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that Fraction III from the Mono S column was loaded onto a 50-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column instead of Mono Q column to yield Fraction VI. Fraction IV was then further subjected to phenyl-Superose chromatography (Pharmacia) to yield Fraction V as described previously(11Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme preparation from Fraction V was used in this study. T4 polynucleotide kinase and deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. DNase I was from Life Technologies, Inc. Single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer housed at the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Vermont. The phosphoramidite derivatives used for dIMP incorporation were obtained from Glenn Research (Sterling, VA). Oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and were eluted from the gels by an IBI electroeluter or purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a Mono Q 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described before (10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) using T4 polynucleotide kinase or 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]cordycepin 5′-triphosphate (DuPont NEN) using deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase following instructions from the enzyme supplier (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The labeled oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed to the appropriate complementary strands at 1:1 ratio in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol by heating the mixture to 90°C and cooling down gradually to room temperature. The following oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes were used in this study. Duplex I/T:5′-GGTCGACTIAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′Duplex I/C:5′-GGTCGACTIAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGACTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′Duplex U/T:5′-GGTCGACTUAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′Duplex C/G:5′-GGTCGACTCAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGAGTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′Duplex A/T:5′-GGTCGACTAAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′ To obtain oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing a nick, oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-GGTCGACTIA-3′ was 5′-end-labeled with γ-32P and mixed with 5′-pGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CCGGGGATCCTCCTTAGTCGACCTGCA-3′ or 5′-CCGGGGATCCTCCTCAGTCGACCTGCA-3′ at a 1:1:1 ratio in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was heated to 90°C and cooling down gradually to 20°C. Other nicked and partial duplexes used were prepared similarly and will be described in the appropriate section. The standard binding reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 1 nM 5′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide (100,000 cpm) with different amounts of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease. The standard reaction buffer contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM MgCl2. The reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 10 min. Glycerol was then added to a final concentration of 6% (v/v), and the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The polyacrylamide gel (10%) contained acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide at a 19.76/0.24 ratio in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, pH 8.3, and 2.5 mM EDTA). The gels were prerun at 300 volts (4°C) for 30 min, samples were applied, and electrophoresis was continued at 300 volts (4°C) for 150 min. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. The radioactive bands in the dried gels were quantitated with a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager. To determine the Kd with different DNA substrates, the following binding equations was used. E+DNA↔E1⋅DNA↔E2⋅DNA(Eq. 1) E1 and E2 represent one and two molecules of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease, respectively. As will be shown in a later section, complex I contains one molecule of protein and complex II has two molecules of protein bound to one DNA molecule. The dissociation constant (Kd) can then be calculated as follows, Kd1=([DNA]free×[protein]free)/[E1⋅DNA](Eq. 2) Kd2=([E1⋅DNA]×[protein]free)/[E2⋅DNA](Eq. 3) when, [E1⋅DNA]=complex I=[DNA]freeKd1=[protein]free(Eq. 4) [E2⋅DNA]=complex II=[E1⋅DNA]freeKd2=[protein]free(Eq. 5) By using low DNA concentration, the protein concentration is always in great excess compared to the substrate concentration, thus, Kd = [protein]free can be approximated when 50% of the DNA is bound. Therefore by plotting [complex I]cpm [free DNA]cpm against [total protein], the protein concentration at which the radioactivity in complex I equals free DNA will be the apparent Kd1. Similarly, by plotting [complex I]cpm [complex II]cpm against [total protein], Kd2 can be estimated when the radioactivity in complex I equals complex II. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease nicking activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10-20 fmol of end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides and 1 μl of appropriately diluted enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (90% formamide containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The reaction mixture (4 μl) were then loaded onto a 20% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in TBE buffer. To correlate the nicking activity of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease with the formation of protein-DNA complex, the reaction was performed under standard binding reaction conditions as described above. An aliquot (2 μl) of the binding reaction mixture was withdrawn and added to 2 μl of loading buffer. The mixture was then loaded onto a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and electrophoresed as above. The remaining 18 μl of the binding reactions was analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The stoichiometry of the protein-DNA complex formation was determined following the method of Orchard and May(16Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Twenty fmol of labeled oligodeoxynucleotide and different amount of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease were incubated at 20°C for 10 min in a 10-μl reaction containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Then 0.1 unit of DNase I was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was incubated at 20°C for another 5 min. Digestion was terminated by the addition of loading buffer and EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mM. The DNase I protection pattern was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea. The ability of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to form stable complexes with duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing deoxyinosine was examineed by a band mobility shift assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” The standard conditions for binding reaction is also the optimal reaction condition for the endonucleolytic activity on DNA containing deoxyinosine(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the results of an experiment performed with a fixed amount of duplex oligodeoxynucleotide substrate (1 nM) and increasing amounts of the enzyme. At low concentrations of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease (less than 8 nM), a unique protein-DNA complex (complex I) was observed with oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing either an I/T or an I/C pair (Fig. 1, panel A). As the enzyme concentration increased, a second, slower migrating complex (complex II) was also observed (Fig. 1, panel B). At the highest enzyme concentration (1.28 μM) used, most of DNA substrate was found associated with complex II (Fig. 1, panel B), and at this enzyme concentration, no higher complexes were observed. To examine the specificity of the complexes formed, duplex 27-mers containing either an A/T or a C/G pair in placed of an I/T or an I/C pair were used as controls (duplex A/T and duplex C/G, see “Materials and Methods”). No complexes were found with the control oligodeoxynucleotides even at the highest protein concentration used (1.28 μM). The specificity of the complex formation was further demonstrated by a competition assay in which increasing amounts of unlabeled duplex containing deoxyinosine or control duplex were added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of the enzyme (5 nM). Fig. 2 shows the results of the competition reactions. As it was shown above, there was no detectable complex II formed at this enzyme concentration. The addition of an equal amount of unlabeled specific oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing deoxyinosine to the reaction mixture (lane 3) reduced by approximately 50% the amount of labeled complex I when no competitor was present (lane 2); the addition of large excess (32-fold) of unlabeled specific duplex abolished the binding of the deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to the labeled oligodeoxynucleotide. However, it required more than 40-80-fold excess of unlabeled nonspecific control oligodeoxynucleotide duplex to obtain a 50% reduction in the formation of labeled complex I. These data suggest that complex I is formed by specific binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to DNA containing deoxyinosine. In order to examine the specificity of complex II, an enzyme concentration of 0.32 μM was used. Under this condition, the reaction mixture yielded approximately 75% complex II, 20% complex I, and 5% free labeled duplex DNA. The preformed complex II was then chased by addition of unlabeled specific or control oligodeoxynucleotide duplex. Fig. 3 shows that the addition of an excess amount of specific duplex led to a reduction of complex II and a concomitant increase in the amount of complex I. As will be shown later, this is due to the formation of a tight complex, complex I, between deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease and deoxyinosine-containing DNA. The addition of unlabeled specific DNA trapped any enzyme that dissociated from the labeled complex II, thus regenerating labeled complex I. No such trapping was observed, even when a large excess (100-fold) of unlabeled control DNA was added, suggesting that complex II is also a specific complex with deoxyinosine-containing DNA. Similar to the competition reaction shown above for complex I, unlabeled specific DNA premixed with labeled specific DNA also led to drastic inhibition of the formation of complex II (data not shown).Figure 3:Chase of complex II by unlabeled specific and nonspecific oligonucleotide. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease (0.32 μM) was incubated with 5′-end-labeled duplex I/T or duplex I/C (1 nM) at 20°C for 10 min. Ten-fold, 50-fold, or 100-fold excess of unlabeled specific (duplex I/T or duplex I/C) or nonspecific (duplex A/T or duplex C/G) oligodeoxynucleotide duplex was added to the reaction mixture. The reactions were incubated at 20°C for another 10 min and analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When using single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing deoxyinosine as a substrate for a band mobility shift assay, two electrophoretic bands were observed. One migrated as the free oligodeoxynucleotide, and the other faster migrating species corresponded to the cleaved single-stranded product(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No stable protein-DNA complex was observed with single-stranded DNA containing deoxyinosine. Even in the absence of Mg2+, a reaction condition in which the enzyme does not nick DNA, stable complexes were not formed with single-stranded DNA. Thus, it appears that the formation of a stable DNA-protein complex requires a duplex DNA substrate. Since the above binding reactions of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to deoxyinosine-containing DNA were performed under conditions that allowed optimal cleavage of the DNA substrate, it was of interest to determine the relationship between endonucleolytic activity and the amount of each complex formed. To do this, an aliquot of binding reaction mixture was withdrawn from each binding reaction (performed in the presence of Mg2+) and added to an equal volume of loading buffer. The mixture was then loaded on to a 20% polyacrylamide gel with 8 M urea and electrophoresed for 2.5 h. The remaining binding reaction mixture (18 μl) was analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE as described. The gels were dried under vacuum and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. The amount of substrate cleavage (Fig. 4, panel A) was then compared with the amount of complexes formed (Fig. 4, panel B). The results show that the amount of total complexes formed paralleled the amount of endonucleolytic cleavage catalyzed by the enzyme. When the enzyme concentration was increased to 16 nM, almost all the substrate was cleaved. This was also the enzyme concentration when almost no free substrate remained in solution. The results also revealed that, when the enzyme concentration was lower than 8 nM, the formation of complex I correlated with the nicking activity. When the enzyme concentration was higher than 8 nM, the amount of complex I started to decrease, which was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the amount of complex II formed. Thus, the formation of complex I was sufficient to induce the cleavage of DNA containing deoxyinosine, and deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease was enzymatically active as a monomer. However, these data does not exclude the possibility that complex II formed could also initiate the cleavage reaction. Similar results were obtained with both I/T and I/C pair-containing oligodeoxynucleotides. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease has an obligatory requirement for Mg2+ for its nicking activity(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No activity was found in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer alone or in Tris-HCl buffer supplemented with different amounts of NaCl and/or EDTA. Addition of ATP, GTP, or NAD+ does not affect its nicking activity. Similar to its nicking activity, the binding activity of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease was not affected by the addition of ATP, GTP, or NAD. However, in contrast to the nicking activity, the formation of the complexes was independent of Mg2+. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease binds to duplex I/T and duplex I/C with the same pattern and similar binding activity with or without Mg2+ (data not shown). The apparent Kd determined in the presence or absence of Mg2+ was similar, i.e. 4 and 400 nM for complexes I and II, respectively. The correlation between the binding and nicking activities suggested that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease remained bound to the DNA even after the DNA was cleaved, and thus the enzyme might be capable of binding to nicked DNA. The complexes were stable under nondenaturing conditions as for the gel retardation assay, but were disrupted in the gels containing 8 M urea used for the activity assay. Furthermore, since deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease cleaves the DNA at the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to deoxyinosine in the presence of Mg2+, the similarity in the Kd values of the enzyme determined with and without Mg2+ implied that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease binds to both the substrate and the product with the same affinity. To test this, the following nicked DNA duplexes were prepared. Duplex A:5′-GGTCGACTIA pGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATT-CCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′Duplex B:5′-GGTCGACTIA pGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGACT-CCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′ These oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes contain a nick 1 base 3′ to deoxyinosine. The nick contains a 3′-hydroxyl- and 5′-phosphoryl terminus, which is identical to the products that would be generated by deoxyinosine 3′ endonuclease on duplex I/T or duplex I/C. Duplexes A and B were 32P-labeled at the 5′ termini of the top oligonucleotide GGTCGACTIA. Band mobility shift assay (Fig. 5). showed that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease formed stable complexes with these duplexes. No complex was formed with nicked DNA duplexes containing either A/T and C/G pair replacing the I/T or I/C pair (data not shown), suggesting that the binding was deoxyinosine-specific but not nick-specific. Binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to nicked deoxyinosine-containing DNA was also Mg2+-independent. Since deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease formed stable complexes with nicked duplexes, we next tested the relative contribution of the DNA segment flanking deoxyinosine and the nick to the recognition and binding of the enzyme. To do this, partial duplexes containing 5′-IAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′, 5′-TIAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′, 5′-GGTCGACTIA-3′, or 5′-TGGCAGGTCGACTIA-3′ were annealed to the complementary strand separately to form following duplexes. Duplex C:5′-IAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCCDuplex D:5′-TIAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCCDuplex E:5′-GGTCGACTIA3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′Duplex F:5′-TGCAGGTCGACTI3′-ACGTCCAGCTGATTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5′ Band mobility shift assays were performed with these duplexes under the same conditions as described above. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease bound to duplex C and duplex D poorly; less than 25% of the DNA was bound as complex I even when the enzyme concentration was 128 nM. Furthermore, no complex II was observed with these duplexes, even at very high enzyme concentration (1.28 μM). However, as shown in Fig. 6, the ability of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to form stable complexes with duplex E was comparable with that with duplex I/T. Similar results were obtained with duplex F. Thus, the data obtained with partial duplexes suggest that the presence of duplex structure 5′ to the deoxyinosine is essential for the formation of stable complexes. The stoichiometry of the protein-DNA complex formation was determined following the method of Orchard and May(16Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The molecular weights of the first and second complex were estimated to be around 42,400 and 65,000, respectively (Fig. 7). An estimate of the molecular weight of the protein component in the complexes was then obtained by subtracting the contribution from the DNA component (approximate 17,145 for a 27-mer oligodeoxynucleotide). Thus, a value of 25,255 and 47,855 for the protein component was obtained for the first and the second complex, respectively. Since the molecular weight of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease is around 25,000(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be concluded that complex I contains a single molecule of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease, while complex II contains two molecules of the protein/DNA molecule. Since deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease forms stable complexes with oligodeoxynucleotides containing deoxyinosine, it is of interest to know how these enzyme molecules interact with the DNA substrates. Deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease cleaves the DNA at the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to the deoxyinosine in the presence of Mg2+, therefore, DNase I footprinting was performed with both 5′-end-labeled and 3′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides. The 27-mer containing an I/T pair (duplex I/T) used in the gel retardation assay was also used in the footprinting experiments. Fig. 8 shows the results of DNase I footprinting with 5′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide (the strand containing deoxyinosine was labeled), demonstrating that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease protected five bases of the DNA 5′ to the nick site (this appeared as a thick dark band). The protection of band I and band II was quantitated and plotted against the protein concentration (Fig. 9). From these data, an apparent Kd (calculated as the enzyme concentration at which 50% protection from DNase I digestion was attained) was found to be about 4 nM, a value in good agreement with the Kd determined for complex I using the band mobility shift assay. This suggests that the protection of DNA 5′ to the nick is consistent with the formation of complex I. Due to the cleavage catalyzed by deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease, the protection pattern 3′ to deoxyinosine was not able to be obtained using the 5′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide.Figure 9:DNase I footprinting of 3′-end-labeled deoxyinosine-containing oligodeoxynucleotide. The strand containing deoxyinosine of duplex I/T was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]cordycepin 5′-triphosphate. DNase I footprinting was performed as described under “Material and Methods” with indicated amount of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease. Included for comparison is the digestion by DNase I of a single-stranded 17-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (also 3′-end-labeled with cordycepin 5′-triphosphate) with the same sequence as the 3′ cleavage product of duplex I/T. Panel A, DNase I footprinting assay at concentration of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease ranged from 1 to 32 nM. Panel B, DNase I footprinting assay at higher concentration of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease from 32 to 160 nM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain the protection pattern of the DNA 3′ to the deoxyinosine by the enzyme, the oligodeoxynucleotide was 3′-end-labeled with [α-32P]cordecypin triphosphate, and DNase I footprinting assay was performed as described with the 5′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide. The results are shown in Fig. 9. In contrast to the 5′-end-labeled substrate, very little protection was observed when the protein concentration was below 16 nM; however, up to 20-40% protection was observed when the protein concentration was increased to 32 nM (panel A), a concentration shown previously to give rise to complex II. Thus, it appears that the protection of the DNA 3′ to the deoxyinosine was not due to the formation of complex I but to complex II which contains two molecules of protein. Furthermore, at the higher protein concentration when complex II is formed, the segment of DNA protected by deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease dimer was very broad (panel B). The exact border of protection was not clear with this oligodeoxynucleotide. Based on the data presented in Fig. 9, we concluded that at least 13 bases 3′ to deoxyinosine were protected from DNase I digestion upon formation of complex II. However, the 2 to 3 bases immediate 3′ to the nick appeared to be hypersensitive to DNase I digestion when complex II formed. When the complementary strand (the DNA strand that does not contain deoxyinosine) of duplex I/T was labeled and used in DNase I footprinting assay, no protection by deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease was observed (data not shown). This suggests that the enzyme binds only to the DNA strand containing deoxyinosine and makes no contact with the opposite strand. Furthermore, no footprinting was observed when the DNA digestion was performed with 1,10-phenanthroline-copper ion system(17Kuwabara M. Yoon C. Goyne T. Thederahn T. Sigman D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7401-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Kuwabara M. Sigman D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein interacts with the DNA along the major groove (data not shown). As shown above, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease can also form stable complex I and complex II with deoxyinosine-containing DNA duplexes lacking the DNA segment 3′ to the deoxyinosine residue (duplex F) and 3′ to the nick (duplex E). This suggests that the DNA sequences 3′ to the deoxyinosine residue are not essential for the binding of the enzyme. However, the results of the DNase I footprinting assay with duplex I/T revealed that the formation of complex II provided protection to the DNA segment 3′ to the nick. Thus, it is possible that the second molecule of the enzyme binds to complex I by interacting with the enzyme already bound to the DNA. Consistent with the results of the DNase I footprinting assay with the labeled complementary strand of duplex I/T, no significant protection from DNase I digestion was observed on the complementary strand (the strand that does not contain deoxyinosine) of duplex E and duplex F, even at high concentration of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease (data not shown). These data suggest that the second molecule of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease binds to complex I through protein-protein interaction. In this paper, we show that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease from E. coli interacts with deoxyinosine-containing DNA and forms two stable protein-DNA complexes, complex I and complex II. Complex I contains a single molecule of protein, and complex II has two molecules of protein bound to one molecule of DNA. An unusual feature of the interaction of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease with deoxyinosine-containing DNA is that the enzyme can bind to the DNA under optimal cleavage conditions, exhibiting identical affinity for both the DNA substrate and the product. This is different from most endonucleases, such as restriction endonucleases. Under nonrestricting conditions, i.e. in the absence of Mg2+, these enzymes exhibit very high affinity to their substrates(19Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. 2nd Ed. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). Other enzymes, such as formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, a repair enzyme which recognizes 8-oxoguanine and formamidopyrimidines, form a tight complex with its uncleavable substrate analogue, reduced AP site, with a Kd value of 2.6 × 10-10M(23Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). No complex can be detected with its DNA substrates once it has been cleaved. Another unique feature of the interaction of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease with deoxyinosine-containing DNA also makes it different from most DNA binding proteins. The primary function of most DNA-binding proteins is to recognize DNA with a specific sequence and form a stable complex with the DNA, thus promoting the binding of other proteins to the DNA. These DNA-binding proteins generally do not have specific enzymatic functions. Their role is to locate the specific sequence on the DNA and bring other proteins with specific enzymatic functions to the site. For example, in nucleotide excision repair(14Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the function of the UvrA protein is to recognize and locate DNA damage, such as a UV photodimer, and help to deliver the UvrB protein to the damage site. After UvrB forms a stable complex with the lesion, UvrA then dissociates from the DNA(13Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Orren D.K. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similarly, MutS protein in a methyl-directed mismatch repair system binds to base mismatches and helps to activate the endonucleolytic activity of MutH protein through interaction with the MutL protein(15Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 25Su S.S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins have high affinity to their recognition sequences and form very stable complexes with the DNA, since they have no need for rapid dissociation to continue a catalytic cycle. In contrast to these proteins, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease exhibits not only high affinity to DNA containing deoxyinosine, but also an endonucleolytic activity which cleaves the DNA in the protein-DNA complex. Since deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease can form stable complexes with partial duplexes E and F, but not partial duplexes C and D, DNA duplex structure 5′ to the deoxyinosine residue must be essential for complex formation. Furthermore, the binding activities of the enzyme to partial duplexes E and F are comparable with those of duplex I/T or I/C. This demonstrates that duplex structure 5′ to deoxyinosine residues is not only essential but also sufficient for the enzyme to bind to DNA. Combined with the results of the DNase I footprinting, we propose that a single molecule of deoxyinosine 3′ endonuclease binds to a deoxyinosine-containing DNA duplex by direct contact with the four bases 5′ to the deoxyinosine residue, leading to the formation of complex I. DNase I footprinting also shows that the second molecule of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease protects the DNA 3′ to the nick. However, the formation of complex II does not require the DNA segment 3′ to the nick (as with duplex E and duplex F) nor does it provide protection to the complementary strand from DNase I digestion. Therefore, the second molecule of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease appears to bind to complex I by interacting with the first molecule of the enzyme. The biological role of the tight binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to deoxyinosine-containing DNA is not clear. Even though the binding and cleavage reaction of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to deoxyinosine-containing DNA do not lead to the removal of the lesion, the formation of stable complexes might be important for other biological processes. Hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase activity has been reported to be very low in E. coli(5Karran P. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5877-5879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Harosh I. Sperling J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3328-3334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the AlkA protein releases hypoxanthine from DNA containing deoxyinosine, the enzyme shows a very high Km (420 nM) (9Saparbave M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) for deoxyinosine. In contrast, the affinity of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to deoxyinosine-containing DNA is 100-fold lower (Kd about 4 nM). Furthermore, there are about 100 molecules of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease in a E. coli cell(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that deoxyinosine in DNA is primarily trapped in a complex with deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease. We have found that the binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to the DNA blocks the recognition of hypoxanthine by the AlkA protein, leading to a strong inhibition of the removal of hypoxanthine by AlkA protein. ( 1M. Yao and Y. W. Kow, unpublished observation.) Therefore, based on the current biochemical data, it is unlikely that AlkA protein will be able to remove deoxyinosine from DNA when deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease is present. Binding to DNA, even after nicking, indicates that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease not only acts as an endonuclease but also as a DNA binding protein. It is possible that the formation of stable complexes might be important for targeting other repair enzyme(s) to the damage site, which then leads to efficient removal of the lesion. The binding activity of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease would be similar then to the function of the UvrA protein in nucleotide excision repair or the MutS protein in the methyl-directed mismatch repair in E. coli. The strong binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to deoxyinosine-containing DNA prevents the dissociation of the enzyme from the DNA after cleavage. Thus, no turnover of the enzyme cleavage activity was observed when duplex I/T or duplex I/C was used as a substrate.1 However, deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease retains nicking activity on duplex C and duplex D and exhibits a turning over of cleavage, since the enzyme cannot form stable complexes with these duplexes. One can speculate that other repair protein(s) brought to the damage site by interacting with deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease in the protein-DNA complex would make an incision in the DNA 5′ to deoxyinosine. This would lead to the dissociation of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease from the DNA and generation of a small gap on DNA with the removal of the lesion. Alternatively, the binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to the DNA might expose the nick, thus facilitating the entry of a 3′- to 5′-helicase. This is supported by the finding that complex II renders the 2 to 3 bases immediate 3′ to the nick hypersensitive to DNase I digestion. Actually, although the binding of deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease to the DNA blocks the hypoxanthine base, it does not block the nick, since DNA polymerase I can nick-translate the DNA in the complex(10Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede J.R. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have cloned the gene for deoxyinosine 3′ endonuclease from E. coli,1 thus allowing us to investigate the biological function of the enzyme in vivo. We are grateful to Dr. Susan Wallace for critical reading of the manuscript. We also thank Drs. Robert Melamede, Zafer Hatahet, and Andrei Purmal for helpful discussions."

The model system we use for studies of antigen-Ab complementarity through protein engineering is based on a set of murine mAbs to the cardiac glycoside digoxin. Several features of these antibodies and the haptens lend themselves to this objective. Cardiac glycosides consist of a cardenolide steroid ring structure with a C-14 β-OH, attached β-glycosidic moieties at C-3 and a 17β unsaturated five-membered lactone ring (Fig. 1). Digoxin is a relatively rigid large hydrophobic hapten without charged groups. There are hundreds of structurally related natural and synthetic cardenolide analogues of known crystal structure or stereochemistry (reviewed in (10Thomas R.E. Bohl M. Duax W.L. Molecular Structure and Biological Activity of Steroids. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida1992: 399-464Google Scholar)), permitting studies of fine specificity. In addition, anti-digoxin antibodies have relatively high affinity compared to antibodies against smaller haptens. The three-dimensional structure of the high affinity anti-digoxin 26-10 Fab in the uncomplexed state and complexed with digoxin has been determined(11Jeffrey P.D. Strong R.K. Sieker L.C. Chang C.Y.Y.

Neither the antibody nor digoxin undergoes any significant conformational change upon forming the complex. Neither hydrogen bonds nor salt bridges are formed between 26-10 and digoxin. High affinity binding occurs solely by shape complementarity involving extensive nonpolar interactions between antibody and the hydrophobic hapten.

Sequences encoding the 26-10 Fab, from H chain position Glu-H1 to Arg-H228 ( 3The numbering system of Kabat et al.(39Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.-M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) for expression on the surface of bacteriophage M13 and secretion as soluble Fab. The 26-10 hybridoma cell line (γ2a,κ) was generated from the fusion of Sp2/0 cells with spleen cells of an A/J mouse immunized with digoxin-human serum albumin(21Mudgett-Hunter M. Margolies M.N. Ju A. Haber E. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1165-1172PubMed Google Scholar). The 26-10 H and L chain cDNAs were prepared from total RNA using standard methods(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers (1-4, Table 1 and Fig. 2) were used in a polymerase chain reaction (Taq polymerase from Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) with the 26-10 cDNA template to modify the ends of 26-10 DNA for insertion into the pComb3 vector (Fig. 2A). Primer 1 introduces a MunI site into the first two codons of 26-10 H chain DNA without altering the amino acid sequence. Primer 2 inserts an SpeI site 3′ to nucleotides encoding Arg-228 in the hinge region of the 26-10 H chain. Primer 3 introduces an AatII site in the 5′ terminus of the L chain. Primer 4 contains stop codons and an XbaI site inserted immediately 3′ of Cys-L214, the final L chain codon. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The expression vector pComb3 was altered using primers 5-8 (Table 1), complementary to and overlapping those used to modify 26-10, in order to retain the precise N-terminal amino acid sequences of 26-10 H chain (EVQL) and L chain (DV). Two new unique restriction enzyme sites (MunI and AatII) were inserted into pComb3 as a result of these manipulations (Fig. 2A). The vector and the antibody encoding DNA were each cut with MunI, SpeI, AatII, and XbaI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) (Fig. 2A). The resulting fragments were purified from agarose gels by electroelution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), ligated, and transformed into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli. Plasmid clones were screened for the presence of the desired pComb3 and 26-10 restriction enzyme sites. The sequence of the 26-10 Fab and altered pComb3 coding portions of the resulting construct, designated pComb3-26-10-1, was verified using dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical, Corp.) and [α-35S]thioadenosine 5′-triphosphate (DuPont NEN). The vector designated pComb3-26-10-2 is a template with HCDR1 alterations designed to prevent parental 26-10 contamination of 26-10 libraries randomized in HCDR1 and consequent competition in biopanning. The vector pComb3-26-10-2 has an altered HCDR1 created by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis employing the method of Eckstein (23Olsen D.B. Sayers J.R. Eckstein F. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 189-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Kit RPN1523, Amersham Corp.). The mutations insert a unique AgeI site, a Pro-H34 (CCG), and stop codon (TAA) in H chain CDR1 using oligonucleotide primer 9 (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). The new restriction enzyme site allows linearization and elimination of unwanted plasmids, while the amino acid changes render the 26-10 protein product nonparental and nonfunctional. Random mutations were introduced into six codons of the H chain V region of 26-10, including “framework” position 30 and CDR1 positions 31-35 using primers 10 and 1 (Table 1). Primer 10 is antisense 5′-CTT TCC ATG GCT CTG CCT GAC CCA SNN SNN SNN SNN SNN SNN GAA TAT GTA TCC AGA AGA CTT G-3′, where N represents an equimolar mixture of all four dNTPs and S represents an equimolar mixture of dCTP and dGTP. The NcoI site is underlined. Primer 1 contains the 5′ terminus of the 26-10 H chain and the MunI site (Table 1, Fig. 2B). The 147-bp product of this reaction encodes the 5′ V region of 26-10 H chain through CDR1 and the adjacent NcoI site at nucleotide position 504 bp. This 147-bp fragment was digested with NcoI and MunI, and the resulting 114-bp fragment was dialyzed and concentrated using a Centricon 30 filter unit (Amicon, Beverly, MA), ligated to a NcoI-MunI-digested pComb3-26-10-2 vector, and introduced by electroporation into E. coli XL1-Blue F′ cells. Infection of the XL1-Blue library of CDR1 mutants with VCSM13 helper phage generated a library of phage with surface Fab (XL1-Blue F′ and VCSM13 are from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Phage were recovered and concentrated by polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation from bacterial supernatants(20Barbas III, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage yield was quantitated by titration on lawns of XL1-Blue F′ bacteria, and phagemid was quantitated by postinfection XL1-Blue F′ colony formation on LB (1.0% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1.0% NaCl, pH 7.0)/agar/carbenicillin plates(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 24Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 119-124Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Digoxin, gitoxin, 16-acetylgitoxin, and gitaloxin (16-formylgitoxin) were conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using a scaled down version of a periodate/borohydride coupling procedure (25Smith T.W. Butler Jr., V.P. Haber E. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) followed by filter dialysis and concentration of the conjugated sample (Centricon 100 filter unit). All samples were adjusted to 1 mg protein/ml in PBSA ((0.14 M NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl, 0.01 M Na2HPO4, 0.0018 M KH2PO4 pH7.4) with 0.02% NaN3) and further diluted to 100 μg/ml in PBSA to coat ELISA wells or 20 μg/ml in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.6, to coat biopanning wells. Bacteriophage were panned on glycoside-BSA-coated microtiter wells (Costar 3690, Cambridge, MA) according to Barbas and Lerner(24Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 119-124Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, phage encoding an anti-tetanus toxoid Fab (kind gift of C. F. Barbas and D. R. Burton) were used as a negative control. Phage were analyzed after four successive rounds of biopanning. Phagemid was grown without VCSM13 helper, and DNA was isolated from a 50-ml culture using a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). An aliquot was sequenced to estimate the complexity of the sequences in the mutated CDR1. A 1-μg sample was cut with NheI and SpeI and religated (see Fig. 2A) to remove the gene III sequence that serves as a membrane anchor(20Barbas III, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 24Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 119-124Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Fabs secreted from cells containing these phagemids terminate at Arg-228 in the hinge region of 26-10 and contain a gene III-encoded Thr and Ser just 5′ to the stop codon. After religation, the DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue cells and plated on LB/carbenicillin plates. Bacterial colonies were isolated and screened for Fab production and antigen binding. Each colony was grown in superbroth (3% tryptone, 2% yeast extract, 1% 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, pH 7.0) containing carbenicillin at 37°C to an A600 of 1.0. Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to the culture, and incubation continued overnight. Culture supernatants and bacterial periplasmic space extracts prepared by osmotic lysis (26Pluckthün A. Skerra A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were tested in an ELISA for Fab production level and binding to cardiac glycoside-BSA conjugates (see below). If a majority of the clones were Fab positive/glycoside negative, additional rounds of panning were performed, and the output was analyzed. Yield of Fab was determined by ELISA titration on goat anti-mouse Fab-coated plates using enzymatically prepared 26-10 Fab of known concentration as a standard. The DNA sequences of cardiac glycoside ELISA-positive clones were determined using the dideoxy sequencing method. Bacterial supernatants were tested in a direct binding ELISA in a 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon 3911, Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) coated with BSA alone, cardiac glycoside-BSA, or goat anti-mouse Fab (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Wells were coated with 50 μl of 100 μg/μl antigen in PBSA and incubated at 4°C overnight. Wells were washed with water several times, blocked with 100 μl of 10% horse serum in PBSA, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After another water wash, 50 μl of bacterial supernatant was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. After washing to remove free Fab, bound Fab was detected after a 2-h room temperature incubation with peroxidase-labeled F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) using the TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) and neutralization with 1.0 M phosphoric acid. Color development was measured at 450 nM in a Bio-Tek ELISA reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). The 26-10 Fab, prepared by papain digestion of affinity-purified 26-10 Ig(27Rose D.R. Seaton B.A. Petsko G.A. Novotny J. Margolies M.N. Locke E. Haber E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control and standard for estimation of Fab concentration and digoxin binding activity of the bacterial supernatant Fab. The anti-arsonate Fab 36-71 (28Marshak-Rothstein A. Siekevitz M. Margolies M.N. Mudgett-Hunter M. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. ELISA was also performed on phage-displayed Fab using the same reagents and methods but detected with peroxidase-labeled anti-M13 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Bacterial supernatants and enzymatically prepared Fab were analyzed using Coomasie Blue-stained, SDS, 10-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. For Western blot analysis following electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and developed using peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham). An aliquot of purified bacterial 26-10 Fab was filtered through a ProSpin column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and protein sequence was determined using an Applied Biosystems gas phase sequencer. Affinities for digoxin were measured on dilute bacterial supernatants with a saturation equilibrium assay using filtration through glass fiber filters to separate bound and free [3H]digoxin (DuPont NEN). This method differs from a previously published assay (12Schildbach J.F. Panka D.J. Parks D.R. Jager G.C. Novotny J. Herzenberg L.A. Mudgett-Hunter M. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Margolies M.N. J. Biol.

Each tube contained a constant amount of Fab, one of 12 serial dilutions of [3H]digoxin (1.1 × 10-7M to 6.7 × 10-11M, depending on preliminary screening), and 0.5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse Fab antibody. Scatchard analysis on data from two or more independent experiments was used to determine affinities, except for clone D4-3. The specificity of Fab for different cardiac glycosides was determined using a competition radioimmunoassay based on the affinity assay described above(12Schildbach J.F. Panka D.J. Parks D.R. Jager G.C. Novotny J. Herzenberg L.A. Mudgett-Hunter M. Bruccoleri R.E. Haber E. Margolies M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4640-4647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Schildbach J.F.

Stock solutions of cardiac glycosides (10-2M in pyridine) were diluted in PBSA to result in 10-5 to 10-12M in the final mixture. Each mutant Fab was competed with digoxin as an internal control. The values reported are ratios of molar concentrations of inhibitor required to give 50% inhibition relative to the molar concentration of digoxin that gave 50% inhibition. In order to determine whether clones that dominated in panning using one glycoside could be selected by another glycoside if present in equal proportions in the original phage preparation, mixing experiments were performed. Individual clones were grown separately with helper phage using the same method employed for eluted phage during panning. Each preparation was titered independently, and a mixture was prepared with equal amounts of phage from several clones. This mixture was panned three times against BSA conjugates of digoxin, gitoxin, 16-formylgitoxin, and 16-acetylgitoxin. An unpanned aliquot of the mixture was expanded and processed each day in parallel with the phage eluted from the panning wells to control for selection of a clone due to growth advantage. The outputs were first analyzed by DNA sequence of a batch DNA preparation of phagemid from the third pan elution. Thereafter, individual clones were picked and sequenced to determine relative distribution of the clones. In order to analyze sets of sequences obtained from cardiac glycoside binding clones, the statistical distribution of amino acids was determined for each NNS-substituted position by the method of Matthews et al.(30Matthews D.J. Goodman L.J. Gorman C.M. Wells J.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Gln derived from the native codon or from the suppressed TAG stop codon in XL1-Blue E. coli was included in the same group. Δσ is the difference between the observed frequency of an amino acid and its expected frequency as standard deviation according to the following formula. ΔσObs(X)-nP(X){(nP(X)(1-P(X)))}1/2(Eq. 1) where Obs(X) is the number of occurrences of amino acid X in the selected sequences, P(X) is the expected frequency of amino acid X occurring (1/32, 2/32, or 3/32), and n is the total number of sequences. Values greater than 2Δσ are considered significant(30Matthews D.J. Goodman L.J. Gorman C.M. Wells J.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Phagemid clones were grown separately, and bacteriophage were prepared using the same method employed in the mixing experiments. A single round of panning was performed using each preparation, in duplicate, against the four glycoside-BSA conjugates or BSA alone. Panning efficiency was titered by infecting XL1-Blue bacteria with several aliquots of input and output phage and selecting resistant colonies on LB/carbenicillin plates. The number of colonies bound to the glycoside-BSA-coated well minus the number bound to BSA, divided by the number of colonies from the input preparation, equals the panning efficiency. ( 4M. Sullivan, personal communication.) The negative control was a phage-displayed anti-arsonate mAb 36-65 Fab (gift of Y.-W. Wong). DNA restriction fragments containing sequences encoding the murine anti-digoxin antibody 26-10 Fab were introduced into the vector pComb3 (20Barbas III, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), which had been modified to reproduce the 5′ amino acids of 26-10 H and L chains (Fig. 2). The complete DNA sequences of the 26-10 insertion and the pComb3 boundaries were verified as correct. When transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells, the plasmid pComb3-26-10-1 produced 26-10 Fab on the surface of bacteriophage M13 as a gene III fusion protein(31Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar), detected by phage ELISA. Bacterial 26-10 Fab was characterized by comparison with 26-10 Fab prepared enzymatically from hybridoma protein. The secreted bacterial 26-10 Fab was produced by excision of the gene III coding fragment of the phagemid by NheI/SpeI digestion (Fig. 2) (20Barbas III, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), followed by religation and transformation into E. coli XL1-Blue. Bacterial Fab was indistinguishable from enzymatically prepared 26-10 Fab by Western blot using isotype-specific reagents and by ELISA utilizing glycoside-BSA conjugates (data not shown). Because periplasmic space preparations and secreted preparations both yielded about 1 mg/liter of 26-10 Fab, the more easily prepared secreted samples were used thereafter. Bacterial 26-10 Fab was purified on a ouabain-amine-Sepharose column (32Zurawski Jr., V.R. Novotny J. Haber E. Margolies M.N. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 122-129PubMed Google Scholar). This preparation was indistinguishable from enzymatically prepared 26-10 Fab by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amino acid sequence analysis of bacterial 26-10 Fab resulted in a mixture of H and L chain amino acids in a 1:1 ratio with residues identical to the bona fide hybridoma antibody 26-10(12Schildbach J.F.

Gel mobility shift assays showed that triplex formation is sequence-specific for the target duplex and the third strand oligonucleotide.

Wild type and mutant cDNA were stably expressed in the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL and in the murine myeloblast-like cell line 32D. Biosynthetic labeling, followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography, showed that carbohydrate-deficient cathepsin G was synthesized as a 29-kDa proform in both cell lines. The proform was proteolytically processed into a stable form with an apparent molecular mass of 27.5 kDa, indicating removal of the carboxyl-terminal prodomain. The mutant cathepsin G was enzymatically activated as determined by acquisition of affinity to aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor. As for wild type cathepsin G, small amounts of the unprocessed form of the mutated enzyme were released from the cells, while the major part was transferred to a granular compartment as demonstrated by subcellular fractionation. Thus, neither processing leading to enzymatic activation nor granular sorting was obviously affected by the lack of oligosaccharides on the mutant cathepsin G.

Early processing of lysosomal enzymes involves modifications of carbohydrate side chains with phosphorylation of mannose residues followed by translocation to lysosomes mediated by receptors for mannose 6-phosphate(14von Figura K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,15Kornfeld S. Mellmann I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar,16Ludwig T. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In cells from patients with I cell disease phosphotransferase activity is defective, and consequently mannose 6-phosphate cannot be added during processing. Therefore, lysosomal enzymes are constitutively secreted from the cells with resulting intracellular deficiency of most lysosomal enzymes(17Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The packaging of serine proteases into azurophil granules is different from that of typical lysosomal enzymes and seems to be consistently independent of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors(18Hasilik A. Experientia. 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Specific sorting mechanisms involved in transfer of proteins for storage in azurophil granules have not been identified. Human cathepsin G contains one consensus site for asparagine-linked glycosylation (Asn64, numeration according to (19Salvesen G. Farley D. Shuman J. Przybyla A. Reilly C. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2289-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). Accordingly, biochemical characterization of cathepsin G has demonstrated asparagine-linked carbohydrates which are processed into complex forms(20Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the other members of the neutrophil serine protease family, i.e. leukocyte elastase, proteinase 3, and azurocidin, also contain asparagine-linked carbohydrates (20Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Campanelli D. Melchior M. Fu Y. Nakata M. Shuman H. Nathan C. Gabay J.E. J. Exp.

Biochem. 1991; 197: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In general, functions of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides include effects on folding and conformation as well as a role in recognition events(24Elbein A.D. Trends Biotech. 1991; 9: 346-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,25Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4980) Google Scholar). For example, glycosylation of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucosidase is required for catalytic activity (26Grace M.E. Grabowski G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and carbohydrates of the cysteine protease propapain A are important for subcellular transport and secretion of the enzyme(27Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Richardson C. Laliberté F. Khouri H.E. Bell A.W. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16661-16666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a functional role for the carbohydrates of the serine proteases of the azurophil granules has not been demonstrated. The aim of this work was to determine whether the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide has a critical role for folding, processing, or granular targeting of cathepsin G. We have recently used the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-1 as a transgenic model for studying the processing of transfected human cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase (28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have utilized site-directed mutagenesis for elimination of the glycosylation site by substitution of Asn64 with Gln followed by transfection of the mutated cDNA to RBL cells in order to investigate the consequences of absent glycosylation. To further strengthen our data, we have extended the studies by transfecting wild type and mutated cathepsin G to murine myeloid 32D cells. Our results demonstrate that, after transfection to RBL or 32D cells, cathepsin G lacking asparagine-linked carbohydrates is expressed as a proform which is processed into active enzyme. The oligosaccharide-deficient protein is also targeted for granular storage, thus questioning the importance of asparagine-linked carbohydrates of cathepsin G. The eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 was from In Vitrogen, British Biotechnology, Oxon, UK. The vector provides a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression of introduced cDNA. The plasmid also confers resistance to geneticin, allowing selection of recombinant cells. pBluescript was from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. [35S]Methionine/[35S]cysteine (cell labeling grade) was from Amersham, Amersham, UK. Percoll and protein A-Sepharose CL4-B were from Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden. Protein G-Sepharose and aprotinin-agarose were from Sigma. Geneticin was from Boehringer Mannheim. For site-directed mutagenesis cDNA of human cathepsin G (generously provided by Dr. G. Salvesen, Duke University, Durham, NC) was used as template in a two-step “spliced overhang extension” polymerase chain reaction (PCR)( (1)The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6830) Google Scholar) in the following way. In the first reaction two separate amplifications with 100 ng of DNA template in 10-cycle PCRs produced two fragments of cathepsin G cDNA overlapping the glycosylation-site (Asn64). By design of the primers, Asn64 was replaced with glutamine, the “Kozak” consensus leader sequence for maximum translational efficiency (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4166) Google Scholar) was introduced 5′ to the ATG initiation codon, and the flanking restriction enzyme sites KpnI and NotI were included for subsequent cloning into plasmid. The PCR primers in the two amplifications were upstream 5′-GACTTCAGGGTACCGCCGCCACCATGCAGCCACTCCTGCTTCTGCTGG-3′ (no. 1) plus downstream 5′-CAGGGTGACCTGTATATTGCT-3′ (no. 2) and upstream 5′-AGCAATATACAGGTCACCCTG-3′ (no. 3) plus downstream 5′-GACTTCAGGCGGCCGCTCACAGGGGGGTCTCCATCTGATCCAGC-3′ (no. 4), respectively (start and stop codons in bold, restriction enzyme sites underlined, Gln64 in italics). The PCR products were isolated on agarose gel, mixed, and subjected to a second 20-cycle splicing PCR amplification with primer nos. 1 and 4, thus creating full-length cathepsin G cDNA with Gln replacing Asn64. The resulting PCR product was digested by KpnI and NotI, followed by isolation on agarose gel and cloning into pBluescript plasmid. Individual clones were isolated and sequenced to verify the mutation and the integrity of the reading frame. cDNA with correct sequence was cloned into pCDNA3 to create the expression vector pCDNA3/CatGGln64. All PCRs were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 480 Thermal Cycler using UITma polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression vector pCDNA3/CatG, encoding the expression of wild type protein, was analogously created using a single PCR amplification with primer nos. 1 and 4. polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL-1 (32Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J.P. Pribluda V. Quarto R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 419-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. L. Hellman, Uppsala, Sweden. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) (complete medium). 32Dcl3 cells(33Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. G. Rovera (Philadelphia, PA), were grown in complete medium consisting of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 20-30% WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of interleukin 3(34Kreider B.L. Phillips P.D. Prystowsky M.B. Shirsat N. Pierce J.H. Tushinski R. Rovera G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4846-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cell cultures were kept in 5% CO2 at 37°C in a fully humidified atmosphere. Exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. RBL cells were transfected using the Bio-Rad Electroporation Apparatus (Bio-Rad) with electrical settings of 960 μF and 300 V as described previously(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electroporation, geneticin (2 mg/ml), was added to select for recombinant clones expressing the geneticin-resistant gene of pCDNA3. Similarly, transfected 32D cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml geneticin. Individual clones growing in the presence of antibiotic were isolated, expanded into mass cultures, and screened for expression of cathepsin G by biosynthetic labeling. Clones with the most pronounced expression were chosen for further experiments. Biosynthetic labeling of newly synthesized proteins was performed as described previously(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were starved for 30 min followed by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for 30 min. In chase experiments, following pulse labeling, cells were resuspended in complete medium. At timed intervals, cells were withdrawn and subjected to extraction of whole cells or homogenization and subsequent subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell homogenate was fractionated in a Percoll density gradient after which nine fractions were collected with all cytosol in fraction no. 9. The distribution of lysosomes and Golgi elements in the density gradient was determined by assaying β-hexosaminidase and galactosyl transferase as described elsewhere(35Hultberg B. Lindsten J. Sjöblad S. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,36Bretz R. Stäubli W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Peak activities of β-hexosaminidase and galactosyl transferase in subcellular fractions from RBL cells were localized in fractions 1-2 and 5-8, respectively, and from 32D cells in fractions 2 and 6 (data not shown). For immunoprecipitation, whole cells or Percoll-containing subcellular fractions were solubilized, and biosynthetically labeled cathepsin G was immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoretic analysis (SDS-PAGE) followed by fluorography as described previously(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adsorption to aprotinin-agarose was performed essentially as described by Salvesen and Enghild (9Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Gullberg et al.(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed, and the lysate was allowed to react with a suspension of aprotinin-agarose. The aprotinin with bound material was washed followed by incubation with elution buffer to obtain release of bound material. Cathepsin G in the eluate or remaining in the lysate after adsorption to aprotinin-agarose (lacking affinity to aprotinin) was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. An expression vector for human cathepsin G lacking glycosylation site (pCDNA3/cathepsin G/Gln64) was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mutated cDNA (pCDNA3/cathepsin G/Gln64) was transfected to RBL cells, and the stable expression was investigated by biosynthetic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography.Fig. 1 shows biosynthesis and processing of cathepsin G/Gln64 in RBL cells (RBL/CatG-Gln64 cells), demonstrating a proform of 29 kDa. This should be compared to the earlier demonstrated proform of 32.5 kDa of wild type cathepsin G transfected to RBL cells(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in apparent molecular mass (3.5 kDa) between mutant and wild type cathepsin G corresponds well to the amount of asparagine-linked carbohydrates of transgenic cathepsin G in RBL cells, thus confirming the absence of carbohydrates on cathepsin G/Gln64. Following translation, the proform of cathepsin G/Gln64 was converted into a 27.5-kDa form which was stable during 4 h of chase (Fig. 1). This reduction of molecular mass most likely represents carboxyl-terminal proteolytic processing, as demonstrated for endogenous and transgenic cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase(9Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No further processing was evident during the time of the experiment. Thus the absence of carbohydrates on cathepsin G apparently did not affect proteolytic processing or the stability of the protein. Small amounts of the unprocessed proforms of both mutant, hardly visible inFig. 1, and of wild type cathepsin G (data not shown) were released into the medium, as commonly seen with lysosomal enzymes (17Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). No obvious difference between the extracellular release of cathepsin G/Gln64 and wild type cathepsin G was evident. The enzymatic activation of cathepsin G follows the removal of an amino-terminal dipeptide and the acquisition of catalytic activity is paralleled by the appearance of affinity to the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin(9Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether the lack of carbohydrates on cathepsin G/Gln64 interferes with enzymatic activation, we utilized pulse-chase experiments followed by adsorption to aprotinin-agarose. Newly synthesized procathepsin G/Gln64 (29 kDa) did not reveal any affinity to aprotinin (Fig. 2), indicating the absence of enzymatic activity. After 30 min of chase, however, small amounts of the processed enzyme (27.5 kDa) did bind to the protease inhibitor, suggesting that enzymatic activation of the proenzyme had been initiated. After 5 h of chase, roughly half of the labeled enzyme showed an affinity for aprotinin (Fig. 2). These results are analogous to those from experiments with wild type cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that the asparagine-linked glycosylation of cathepsin G is nonessential for enzymatic activation. Endogenous cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase are targeted for storage in the azurophil granules of the neutrophil granulocyte. Similarly, cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase transfected to RBL cells are translocated to a granular compartment (28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which subcellular sorting is mediated are, however, unknown. Consequently it is unclear whether the asparagine-linked carbohydrates of cathepsin G are necessary for transport to granules. Therefore, pulse-chase labeling experiments, followed by subcellular fractionation of RBL/CatG-Gln64 cells, were performed.Fig. 3 shows that labeled cathepsin G/Gln64 was transferred, within 90 min, to dense fractions corresponding to lysosomes, as judged by the lysosomal marker β-hexosaminidase. After 5 h of chase, most of the labeled cathepsin G/Gln64 was found in the two fractions of highest density. Concurrently with transfer to the high density compartment, processing of the 29-kDa proform into the mature 27.5-kDa form was seen (Fig. 3). Thus, as for the wild type enzyme(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transfected cathepsin G/Gln64 is efficiently translocated to dense fractions in RBL cells, indicating that carbohydrates are not necessary for sorting to granules in these cells. Transfected cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase are adequately processed, enzymatically activated and translocated to granules in RBL cells(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sorting mechanisms in the basophilic/mast cell line RBL may, however, not be identical to those of the myeloid promyelocyte. In order to use a myeloid cellular model, we therefore adopted the murine myeloblast-like cell line 32D(33Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835PubMed Google Scholar,34Kreider B.L. Phillips P.D. Prystowsky M.B. Shirsat N. Pierce J.H. Tushinski R. Rovera G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4846-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). cDNA of wild type cathepsin G and cathepsin G/Gln64 was transfected to 32D cells and biosynthetic labeling of the proteins was performed.Fig. 4 shows processing of wild type cathepsin G (Fig. 4A) and cathepsin G/Gln64 (Fig. 4B) in 32D cells. As seen with RBL cells, proforms of 32.5 and 29 kDa, respectively, were processed into products with molecular masses of 31 and 27.5 kDa. The 31-kDa form of wild type cathepsin G was to a minor extent further processed into a 30 kDa form, which is analogous to what is seen in RBL cells(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small amounts of the proforms were released into the extracellular medium with no obvious difference between wild type and mutant cathepsin G. Targeting of wild type cathepsin G and cathepsin G/Gln64 to granules in 32D cells was investigated by use of subcellular fractionation.Fig. 5 shows translocation of processed forms of cathepsin G (Fig. 5A) and cathepsin G/Gln64 (Fig. 5B) to dense fractions. No obvious difference between the subcellular transfer of wild type cathepsin G and that of cathepsin G/Gln64 was evident. These results from myeloblast-like cells further support the notion that glycosylation of cathepsin G is not obligatory for synthesis, stability, processing or granular sorting of the enzyme.Figure 5:Granular targeting of transgenic cathepsin G and cathepsin G/Gln64 in 32D cells. A, 32D/cathepsin G cells and B, 32D/cathepsin G/Gln64 cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min, followed by chase for 90 min and 5 h. At times indicated, 100 × 106 cells were homogenized after which subcellular fractionation, immunoprecipitation, and subsequent analyses were performed as described in the legends toFigure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:. The fluorograms were exposed for 7 days. The positions of the proforms of 32.5 and 29 kDa, respectively, and the processing forms are indicated with arrows to the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of asparagine-linked carbohydrates in the cellular processing of cathepsin G. For this purpose we utilized site-directed mutagenesis to create a mutant form of cathepsin G, lacking a functional glycosylation site. Mutant or wild type cDNA was transfected into target cells and the processing of wild type and mutant protein was compared. Our results demonstrate that the mutant, carbohydrate-deficient, form of cathepsin G was synthesized in RBL and 32D cells as a proform with apparent molecular mass of 29 kDa. This is close to the calculated molecular mass of the protein core (26.9 kDa) and consistent with the previous characterization of wild type cathepsin G in RBL cells, which showed an apparent proform of 32.5 kDa, containing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of approximately 3.5 kDa(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proform of the carbohydrate-deficient mutant was processed into a 27.5-kDa form, indicating proteolytic removal of a 1.5-kDa prodomain, again similar to the processing of the wild type protein. The transfer of mutant cathepsin G to a granular compartment in RBL and 32D cells, as demonstrated by subcellular fractionation experiments, was not obviously affected by the lack of oligosaccharides. We also demonstrated that mutant cathepsin G was enzymatically activated in RBL cells, as judged by the acquisition of affinity to aprotinin, which indicates that carbohydrates are dispensable for efficient processing of cathepsin G. A minor portion of the mature forms of wild type cathepsin G and elastase in RBL cells is slowly processed with further reduction in molecular mass of approximately 1 kDa(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This late processing, occurring at a point of time when transfer to granules is accomplished, was also visible when wild type cathepsin G was expressed in 32D cells, seen as a tight double band after four hours of chase (Fig. 4A) and could involve further proteolytic processing or late trimming of carbohydrates. However, contrary to what was seen with wild type cathepsin G, the mutant form of cathepsin G (cathepsin G/Gln64) did not show any late reduction in molecular mass, whether expressed in RBL or 32D cells (Fig. 1 and 4B). Our results therefore indicate that the late processing of wild type cathepsin G is the result of trimming of carbohydrates in granular structures rather than further proteolytic processing. Different structures of the sugar chains of cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase in neutrophil granulocytes have been reported(37Watorek W. van Halbeek H. Travis J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); typical biantennary chains, commonly found on secreted glycoproteins(38Kornfeld S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), were present in a small fraction of the enzymes, while the major forms had truncated oligosaccharide chains. Since similar short structures of sugar chains are found on several lysosomal enzymes, it was hypothesized that the biantennary chain-containing cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase constitute a minor fraction of the enzymes, processed in a separate pathway, with specific functions involving extracellular secretion(37Watorek W. van Halbeek H. Travis J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, our results which indicate that late trimming of the carbohydrates is possible in the milieu of the maturing granules, rather support the alternative interpretation that the truncated forms arise by degradation of the complex chains by glycosidases present in the granules. A major concern when studying transgenically expressed proteins, is the relevance of the target cell chosen for transfection. The granules of the basophilic/mast cell like RBL cell line contain lysosomal enzymes and mast cell serine proteases (32Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J.P. Pribluda V. Quarto R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 419-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar,39Kido H. Izumi K. Otsuka H. Fukusen N. Kato Y. Katunuma N. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1061-1065PubMed Google Scholar,40Shiver J.W. Henkart P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1175-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and transfected cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase are adequately processed in this cell line(28Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms for granular targeting in RBL cells could be different from those of promyelocyte-like cells, in which cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase are normally formed and stored. Therefore, we extended our study of processing and granular targeting of carbohydrate-deficient cathepsin G (cathepsin G/Gln64) to include myeloblastic 32D cells. The 32D cell line has successfully been employed for transfection of defensin, another component of azurophil granules(41Liu L. Ganz T. Blood. 1995; 85: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the results from RBL cells, a stable expression of cathepsin G and cathepsin G/Gln64 was seen in 32D cells. Furthermore, processing of the proforms and targeting of processed forms to granules were also indistinguishable from what was seen in RBL cells. Thus also in myeloblast-like cells, the carbohydrates of cathepsin G do not seem to be important for stability or subcellular transport. Most lysosomal hydrolases carry phosphorylated mannose residues enabling a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated transfer to a prelysosomal compartment(14von Figura K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,15Kornfeld S. Mellmann I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar,16Ludwig T. Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 202-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The sorting of cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase, on the other hand, seems to be independent of the mannose 6-phosphate receptors(17Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Alternative targeting mechanisms to azurophil granules have not been demonstrated. A transient mannose 6-phosphate-independent membrane association can possibly be involved in the subcellular trafficking of some lysosomal enzymes(42Burge V. Mainferme F. Wattiaux R. Biochem.

Similar mechanisms could play a role in the sorting of cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase as both proteins exhibit C-terminal extensions which are proteolytically removed after transfer to granules(7Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar,9Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,28Gullberg U.

Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, previous results from experiments with deletion mutants indicate that transfer to granules occurs independently of the C-terminal prodomains of cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase(29Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Lindgren G. Persson A.-M. Nilsson E. Olsson I J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12912-12918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus data argue against an important function of the carboxyl-terminal prodomains in sorting of these enzymes. Similarly, the present results indicate that the oligosaccharide structures are also dispensable for granular targeting of cathepsin G. The sorting mechanisms for these hematopoietic serine proteases therefore remain obscure. In conclusion, the present investigation has demonstrated that cathepsin G lacking a functional glycosylation site can be stably expressed in both rat basophilic RBL cells and murine myeloid 32D cells. The absence of carbohydrates did not have any obvious consequence for stability, processing, activation, or granular targeting of the protein, thus strongly arguing against an important role for carbohydrates of cathepsin G in these processes.

Its three-dimensional structure, as well as that of its 1:1 complex with RNase A, have recently been reported(1Kobe B. Deisenhofer J.

Although the first piece of evidence about the existence of this inhibitor was gained a long time ago(3Pirotte M. Desreux V. Bull. Soc. Chim. Belges. 1952; 61: 167-180Crossref Google Scholar), the biological functionality of RI remains to be clarified yet (for reviews on early work on RI see (4Roth J.S. Methods Cancer Res. 1967; 3: 167-180Google Scholar) and (5Blackburn P. Moore S. Enzymes. 1982; 15: 317-433Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar)). Its name suggests that RI is involved in the control of cytoplasmic RNases, thus having a potential role in determining levels of gene expression (6Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13011-13014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact clear correlations between cellular metabolic states and levels of RI have been reported(7Kraft N. Shortman K. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1970; 23: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Kraft N. Shortman K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 217: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Suzuki Y.

Nevertheless, objections have been raised about a cytoplasmic functionality for RI(14Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The absence of experimental evidence about the in vivo existence of cytoplasmic RI-RNase complexes, together with the known high affinity of RI for enzymes of the noncytoplasmic RNase superfamily(14Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), leave open the question about the environment where RI plays its role, if intracellular or extracellular. Whichever the answer to this question it might be, or if eventually both were true, a second question arises. This is derived from the tight binding between RI and RNase A, which is the model ligand mostly used to study the interaction properties of RI (15Blackburn P. Gavilanes J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10959-10965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Blackburn P. Gavilanes J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 316-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hofsteenge J. Servis C. Stone S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24198-24204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding between these two molecules stands out as one of the tightest reported for protein-protein interactions (dissociation constant in the femtomolar range)(18Lee F.S. Shapiro R. Vallee B.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8827-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This adds more interest to the RI molecule whose amino acid sequence is characterized by its leucine-rich repeats(20Hofsteenge J. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8537-8544Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Lee F.S. Fox E.A. Shou H.-M. Strydom D.J. Vallee B.

Sci. 1994; 19: 415-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). The extremely high affinity between RI and certain RNases raises the question of which fate could have the respective RI-RNase complexes. Aside from taking them as dead complexes, any other functional implication should require to consider that binding affinity may be modulated(24Fominaya J.M. García-Segura J.M. Ferreras M. Gavilanes J.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this sense, the numerous half-cystines of the RI molecule (around 30 for the different RIs studied) (20Hofsteenge J. Kieffer B. Matthies R. Hemmings B.A. Stone S.R.

Peptide Protein Res. 1982; 19: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) may be involved in its regulation. In fact it is well established that these residues must be as free thiols for RI to exert its inhibitory activity; in addition, RNase dissociates from RI when complex preparations are treated with sulfhydryl reagents, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate being the most employed one for such a purpose(4Roth J.S. Methods Cancer Res. 1967; 3: 167-180Google Scholar, 5Blackburn P. Moore S. Enzymes. 1982; 15: 317-433Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 27Blackburn P. Wilson G. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This close relationship between the status of the SH groups and RI activity allows to propose some kind of redox control over the RI-RNase complex(24Fominaya J.M. García-Segura J.M. Ferreras M. Gavilanes J.G. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this context, a reasonable working hypothesis is to consider the RI-RNase complex as a heterodimeric enzyme, one of its subunits would be catalytic, the RNase, and the other one would be regulatory, the RI. ribonuclease inhibitor pancreatic ribonuclease A 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid para-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis convex constraint analysis. Thiol-disulfide exchange, as a general mechanism of enzyme control (28Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar), might be involved in the proposed regulation. Inactivation of porcine RI by exchanging of its thiol groups with the Ellman's disulfide (DTNB) has been reported(29Fominaya J.M. Hofsteenge J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24655-24660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This investigation, performed on free RI, evidenced an interesting “all-or-none” mechanism of inactivation by which, in the presence of amounts of DTNB that did not account for a complete oxidation of the thiol groups present in a RI preparation, the resulting RI molecules did not show intermediate oxidation degrees. Instead, a fraction of RI molecules resulted with all their half-cystines oxidized, whereas the rest maintained all of them as free thiols. According to our working hypothesis, we were interested in studying the effect of thiol-disulfide exchange on RI bound to RNase rather than on free RI. Thus, we report herein the effects of the Ellman's disulfide on the complex between porcine RI and RNase A, showing that RI, while bound, can reach intermediate oxidation degree, at the same time that the bound RNase can express some of its activity. The obtained results provide new ground to the hypothesis about the redox control of RNase bound to RI. Ribonuclease Inhibitor was purified from pig testis as described below. Testes were from pigs intended for slaughter (6 months old or older) and were directly collected at the abattoir (GYPISA, Pozuelo de Alarcón, Madrid) immediately after the animal death. Only testes weighing more than 200 g were selected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C until required. Under these storage conditions no decrease of the inhibitor activity was observed, at least after 6 months. Bovine pancreatic RNase A (type XII-A), DTNB, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma; cyanogen bromide and SDS were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); iodoacetic acid was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); and formic acid was from Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy). All other chemicals were at least of reagent grade. The buffers were boiled and degassed by bubbling argon both while cooling down and before use. All of them were 5 mM in dithiothreitol unless otherwise stated. The rapid procedure described by Blackburn (30Blackburn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12484-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the purification of RI from human placenta was essentially employed. Testes, once thawed and stripped of skin, were homogenized as described for placenta. After centrifugation of homogenates a high fat content remains in the supernatants, making it necessary to perform the subsequent salt-fractionation twice. For such a purpose the 35%-60% salt saturation precipitate is redissolved in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM EDTA, and dialyzed against 20 volumes of the same buffer for 6 and 12 h. The resulting solution is salt-fractionated again under the same conditions. The final recovery of RI was 70% or higher, being its final specific activity of 100,000 units/mg, as found for placenta inhibitor(27Blackburn P. Wilson G. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RI eluted from the affinity column was pooled and immediately desalted by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25 M (PD-10 column; Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated and eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. The pools so obtained were stored at 4°C in vials hermetically stoppered by Mininert valves (Alltech; Deerfield, IL) provided with septa, through which access with a syringe was possible without exposing the content to the atmosphere. Before storage, a positive pressure of argon (0.5 Kg/cm2) was bubbled into the vials through the septa. Periodically the inert atmosphere was renewed in order to minimize spontaneous oxidation during storage. RI preparations intended for N-terminal sequence were desalted as above described, but replacing the equilibration buffer of PD-10 columns by 0.575 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, containing 5 mM EDTA, 8 M urea, and 0.2 M 2-mercaptoethanol. The fractions containing RI were incubated for reduction and carboxymethylation with iodoacetic acid as described(31Crestfield A.M. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2413-2421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excess reagent was removed by gel filtration on PD-10 columns now equilibrated with 50 mM (NH4)HCO3. The mixtures, once lyophilized, were dissolved in 70% (v/v) formic acid at around 1.5 mg/ml protein concentration. Then 0.7 M CNBr in 70% (v/v) formic acid was added up to a 3,000 molar excess of the reagent over RI. The mixture was briefly flushed with nitrogen and allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 h in the dark. The mixture was then 35-fold diluted with glass-distilled water and lyophilized. The digest was redissolved in electrophoresis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) in a Mini-PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad). The electrophoretic pattern was visualized by reverse staining with imidazole-Zn2+(33Ferreras M. Gavilanes J.G. García-Segura J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The transparent bands of interest were excised and incubated in 2% (w/v) citric acid for 10 min in order to mobilize the peptides. Then the excised gel portions were incubated for 15 min in a solution containing 48 mM Tris, 39 mM glycine, 0.375% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Afterwards they were electroeluted in a semidry transblot system (Novablot LKB 2117-250) following the instructions of the manufacturer (0.8 mA/cm2 for 75 min). Once electroeluted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore) the cyanogen bromide peptides were detected by staining with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R-250 in 40% (v/v) methanol containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid for 1 min, followed of destaining with 50% (v/v) methanol. The peptides of interest so immobilized and stained were finally subjected to automatic Edman degradation by using an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencer, equipped with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin 120-A analyzer. The standard program supplied by the manufacturer was employed(34Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When required for subsequent studies, the complex between RI and RNase was formed immediately after elution of RI from the affinity chromatography by putting it into contact with commercial RNase A. Thus, a molar excess of RNase A (1.2 mol of RNase A/mol of RI) was added to each fraction of the affinity chromatography eluate. The required volume of a 10 mg/ml solution of RNase A was calculated for each fraction by taking into account its RI content (A 280 measurements) and the 1:1 stoichiometry of the RI-RNase complex. The mixtures so resulting were subjected to gel filtration on PD-10 columns (Pharmacia) as described for free RI, and the complex was getting formed as the proteins become desalted. Identical conditions to those described for free RI were employed for the storage of the RI-RNase complex. RI-RNase complex fractions eluting from PD-10 columns equilibrated in the buffer described for free RI, but without dithiothreitol, were pooled in order to obtain complex concentrations as high as 10-12 μM. These pools were poured into vials which were capped with Mininert valves (Alltech; Deerfield, IL). The vials were placed inside a diafiltration chamber lacking a filtration membrane and kept at room temperature. The solvent outlet of the chamber was closed and through the solvent inlet a pressure of 10 kg of argon/cm2 was supplied. Periodically the solvent outlet was opened in order to allow efficient air displacement. At fixed times the diafiltration chamber was opened, and 1 mM DTNB in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was injected into the vials through the Mininert septa. In each vial, the injected volume accounted for a DTNB/complex molar ratio of 0.5. In order to monitor the thiol-disulfide exchange, prior to DTNB addition aliquots of the vials were withdrawn and subjected to the same DTNB reaction than the rest remaining in the vials. The aliquots were continuously monitored at 412 nm in a Beckman DU-7 spectrophotometer until reaching constant absorbance values. Then, further additions of DTNB were performed to account for additional DTNB/complex ratios of 0.5 and so on. In this way, the accumulated DTNB/complex molar ratios of the reaction mixtures were increased 0.5 at a time. DTNB additions to the vials were repeated until all of the thiol groups in the mixtures were oxidized. The number of thiol groups oxidized after each DTNB addition step was evaluated by TNB quantification. For such a purpose an extinction coefficient of 13,600 M-1•cm-1 at 412 nm was used for TNB(35Janatova J. Fuller J.K. Hunter M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3612-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the number of thiol groups remaining after each reaction step was measured in aliquots of the reaction mixtures by the method of Ellman(36Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21474) Google Scholar), as described by Glazer et al.(37Glazer A.N. Delange R.J. Sigman D.S. Work T.S. Work E. Chemical Modification of Proteins: Selected Methods and Analytical Procedures (Series: Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biolog. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1975: 113-114Google Scholar). 1.5% (w/v) SDS was employed as denaturing agent. Ribonucleolytic activity, both free and latent (inhibited by RI), was evaluated by using cyclic 2′,3′-CMP as substrate(30Blackburn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12484-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases the amount of active RNase A in the assay mixture was in the 0.2-0.8 μg range. Gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia) was employed to evaluate the dissociation degree of complex preparations, whereas ion-exchange on a Spherisorb-TSK DEAE 5PW column (75 × 7.5 mm) (Beckman) was useful when RI-RNase complex had to be separated from released RI. In both cases a high performance liquid chromatography equipment (System Gold from Beckman) was employed. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Salt was included in order to avoid nonspecific interactions between the acidic RI and the alkaline RNase A, whereas the presence of glycerol was mandatory for quantitative recovery of RNase A. Samples of 100 μl were applied onto the column. A flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was employed, and the absorbance of the eluate was continuously monitored at 280 nm. For each evaluation two samples were run. They were prepared by incubating for 10 min at room temperature 90 μl of the complex preparation with either 10 μl of water or 10 μl of 10 mMpHMB in water. The respective elution profiles were integrated at the RNase position and the dissociation degree evaluated by referring the area of the RNase peak of the first sample (without 1 mMpHMB) to that of the second one (with 1 mMpHMB). The employed buffers were: A: 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 15% (v/v) glycerol and B: same as A but containing 300 mM NaCl instead of 50 mM. The column was equilibrated in buffer A. After sample loading (500 μl) the column was washed for 5 min with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The absorbance was continuously monitored at 280 nm. Complex and free RI were successively eluted with a linear gradient of 0%-50% buffer B in 1 min, followed of isocratic elution with 50% buffer B over 1 min; and a second linear gradient of 50%-100% buffer B in 1 min also followed of isocratic elution with 100% buffer B over 1 min. Finally, initial conditions were restored by a linear gradient of 100-0% buffer B in 1 min, followed of isocratic elution with 100% buffer A until constant base line. Under these conditions RI-RNase complex and free RI eluate as well resolved peaks (w1/2 ≈ 0.35 min) 11.3 and 14.4 min after sample injection, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra were registered in the 240-200-nm wavelength range by using a Jobin Yvon mark III dichrograph fitted with a 250-watt xenon lamp. The scanning speed was of 0.5 nm•s-1 and 0.05-cm optical path cells were employed. Ellipticity values were expressed in units of degree•cm2•dmol-1 of residue, considering that the mean residue mass for RI-RNase complex is 107.5 Da, as calculated from its amino acid composition. Prior to the spectroscopic measurements, DTNB-treated samples were chromatographed on Sephadex G-25 M (PD-10 columns, Pharmacia) in order to remove the released TNB. Under the employed DTNB reaction conditions no conformational changes should be expected for RNase A. Therefore, its calculated contribution was subtracted from each CD spectrum in order to simplify the subsequent conformational analyses. Thus, a set of CD curves (one curve for each accumulated DTNB/complex ratio) was generated, mostly reflecting the CD behavior of the RI subunit as increasingly oxidized. This set was appended to a set of 240-200 nm CD spectra from 18 reference proteins (Table VIII in (38Yang J.T. Wu C.-S.C. Martínez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar)) in order to deconvolute the whole data set according to the convex constraint analysis (CCA) method(39Perczel A. Hollósi M. Tusnády G. Fasman G.D. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For such a purpose three conformational components were allowed, in accordance with the known three-dimensional structure of RI (1Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 2Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which can be taken as a repetition of three structural motifs. The shapes of the three pure CD curves so resulting were in good agreement with the known CD spectra of α-helix, β-sheet, and unordered secondary structure (Fig. 1). Goodness of the deconvolution analysis was additionally checked with six proteins of known three-dimensional structure, whose CD spectra were among the reference data set: myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, lysozyme, ribonuclease A, α-chymotrypsin, and elastase. Correlations between their secondary structure percentages, as totalled from x-ray diffraction results (Table III in (40Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 426-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), and the respective estimations from the applied CCA method were quantified for each secondary structure through the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient(41Chang C.T. Wu C.-S.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 12-31Crossref Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Very good correlation was found for α-helix estimations (r = 0.995); on the other hand, the correlation coefficients for β-sheet and unordered form, 0.802 and 0.587, respectively, though poorer, were still significant. For these calculations β-turn percentages were not taken into account. The CD contribution of this structural element should be obscured in the pure CD curves of the other conformations and so its conformational weights added in some extent to the CCA-estimated percentages. Most likely this contamination affects the estimated contributions of β-sheet and unordered form, so explaining their lower correlation coefficients. Concentrations of pure RI, RNase A, and RI-RNase A complex were calculated from absorbance measurements. An extinction coefficient (E0.1%278nm) of 0.71 was employed for RNase A(42Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Enzymes. 1971; 4: 647-806Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Through amino acid analysis, performed as described(25Fominaya J.M. García-Segura J.M. Gavilanes J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we have evaluated extinction coefficients (E0.1%278nm) of 0.88 and 0.86 for free RI and RI-RNase A complex, respectively. The differential equations that govern the production of both TNB molecules and the evolution of the intermediate mixed disulfide are as follows. d[TNB1]dt=k1[complex][DTNB](Eq. 1) d[TNB2]dt=k2[complex-SS-TNB](Eq. 2) d[complex-SS-TNB]dt=k1[complex][DTNB][complex-SS-TNB]-k2[complex-SS-TNB](Eq. 3) Whereas can easily be integrated, integration of requires to previously integrate. In both cases, an integral similar to that numbered as 501 in the integral table of “CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics” (43Weast R.C. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 62nd Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1981Google Scholar) must be solved. The exact integrated equation contains a sum of squared and higher order terms that can be discarded because of their nonsignificant effect on the final results. Thus, the following integrated equations are obtained. [TNB1](t)=AB[emk1t-1]Aemk1t-B(Eq. 4) [TNB2](t)≈B[1-e-k2t]-[k2k1(BA)k2/mk1ln[Aemk1t-B]A-B]e-k2t(Eq. 5) where A = [complex]0•(number of SH), B = [DTNB]0, m = A - B; zero subindex refers to concentrations at zero time. For each DTNB addition, the k1 and k2 values could be obtained by nonlinear regression fitting of the experimental data (A412versus time) to the following equation. A412=13,600{[TNB1](t)+[TNB12](t)}(Eq. 6) where [TNB1](t) and [TNB2](t) are given by and, respectively, and 13,600 refers to the molar extinction coefficient of TNB(35Janatova J. Fuller J.K. Hunter M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3612-3622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a first approach, the same reactivity can be assumed for all the SH groups of the RI-RNase complex. Actually this is not the case, as deduced from the fluctuations detected in the evaluated rate constants (Table 1 under “Results”); however, it can be demonstrated (data not shown) that, while dissociation is not significant, the slight fluctuations measured for the rate constants are compatible with such an assumption. Accordingly, the probability of a particular SH group to be modified by DTNB will depend on the DTNB/SH molar ratio. Thus, for each global DTNB/complex ratio, r, reached in the reaction mixture, the probability P(m) of finding a complex molecule with m of its 30 thiol groups modified, whichever they can be into the amino acid sequence, will follow a binomial distribution. P(m)=()gm(1-g)30-m(Eq. 7) where g is the average oxidation degree of the reaction mixture. Obviously, g = 2r/30, since each DTNB molecule reacts with two thiol groups (Fig. SI). Let v be the minimum number of thiol groups that must be oxidized in a complex molecule for dissociation to occur. For a complex preparation subjected to DTNB treatment, the percentage of dissociated complex molecules (the dissociation degree) will be given by the summation of the probabilities of finding molecules with a number of modified groups ranging from v to 30. Thus, P(m)=()gm(1-g)30-m(Eq. 8) where P(m) can be calculated from by using the particular DTNB/complex ratio (r) accumulated in the reaction mixture.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The activation percentage would also be given by if only dissociation accounted for the release of ribonucleolytic activity. But this is not the case (see “Results”); the formation of active complex species should additionally be considered. Therefore, in order to predict the activation percentage of a complex preparation subjected to DTNB treatment, should be modified by including the contribution of such active complex molecules to the ribonucleolytic activity. This is taken into account in the following equation, %dissociation=100∑m=v30P(m)(Eq. 9) where u is the minimum number o"

The β IVS2 intronic enhancer region has a utilized binding site for erythroid transcription factor GATA-1.( (2)M. Flamm, submitted for publication.) We have previously shown in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells that the IVS2 sequences from the δglobin gene will not substitute for β IVS2 in human β globin expression. The replacement of β IVS2 with δIVS2 leads to a substantial decline in the expression of β globin and renders the gene uninducible(18LaFlamme S. Acuto S. Markowitz D. Vick L. Landschultz W. Bank A.

In order to identify DNA binding proteins that may play a role in the expression of human β globin, we have characterized the entire human β IVS2 region by DNase I footprint analysis. Based on the footprint pattern and transcription factor binding analysis utilizing a computer-generated map, sites were chosen to be analyzed by EMSA. We report here evidence that three of nine potential GATA-1 binding sites are utilized, as well as a fourth degenerate GATA-1 site. Additional proteins seen to bind IVS2 are Oct-1, a ubiquitous factor binding to a homeobox consensus site, several stage or tissue-specific factors, and the nuclear matrix binding protein SATB1. The binding of this latter protein to β IVS2 suggests that β IVS2 and nuclear matrix attachment may be involved in the regulation of β globin transcription. β IVS2 was cleaved into three smaller pieces as depicted (seeFig. 1). The parent vector for β IVS2 subcloning was pSP72β 3.4, which contains a 3.4-kb ClaI/SphI fragment of the human β globin gene subcloned into the ClaI and SphI sites of vector pSP72 (Promega). The BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the gene, including all of β IVS2, was analyzed further. To produce subclone I, pSP72β3.4 was sequentially digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and MunI, and the 200-bp insert was ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the Bluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene). For subclone II, pSP72β3.4 was sequentially digested with MunI and DraI, and the 329-bp insert was subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of plasmid pGEM 7Zf+ (Promega). For subclone III, pSP72β3.4 was sequentially digested with EcoRI and DraI, and the resultant 400-bp insert was subcloned into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of pGEM 7Zf+. All three subclones were entirely footprinted at least twice each in both orientations, using nuclear extracts from CEM(24Foley G.E. Lazarus H. Farber S. Uzman B.G. Boone B.A. Mc Carthy R.E.

Reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice. For competition assays, 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides was added to the reaction. For supershift assays, reactions were incubated as usual for 20 min on ice, and then 1 μg of antibody was added and the reactions were further incubated for 45 min to 1 h on ice. All antibodies were Supershift grade antibodies from Santa Cruz Biochemicals, except for the anti-SATB1 antibody, which was the generous gift of Dr. T. Kohwi-Shigematsu (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA). The following oligonucleotides (sense strands listed), which were synthesized and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-purified by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., were used in these analyses: site 2, 5′-GAATGGGAAACAGACGAATGATTGCATCAGTGTGGAAGTCTC-3′; site 5, 5′-GTACATTACTATTTGGAATATATGTGTGCTTATTTGCATATTCATAATCTCCCTACTTTA-3′; site 6, 5′-TTATTTTTAATTGATACATAATCATTATACATATTTATGGG-3′; site 7, 5′-GTTTATCTTATTTCTAATACTTTCCCTAATCTCTTTCTTT-3′; site 9, 5′-CATGCCTCTTTGCACCATTC-3′; site 10, 5′-ATTCTAAAGAATAACAGTGATAATTTCTG-3′; site 12, 5′-GTTTCATATTGCTAATAGCAGCTACAAT-3′; antennapedia consensus, 5′-CGCTCCCAATTAAATTGGCGGCTGGT-3′; SATB1, 5′-TCTTTAATTTCTAATATATTTAGAATCTTTAATTTCTAATATATTTAGAA-3′(21Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar); and Santa Cruz Biochemical oligonucleotides GATA-1, GATA-1 mutant, Oct-1, Oct-1 mutant, and AP-1. The 850-bp human β IVS2 was subcloned in three pieces into pGEM 7 or Bluescript SK+ vectors, as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1). DNase I footprinting was performed on both strands of each construct using nuclear extracts from the following cell lines: CEM, HEL-92, K562, HeLa, and MEL. The intron was found to be extensively footprinted. The central region of the intron has previously been shown to include a DNase I hypersensitive site(17Groudine M. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Gelinas R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7551-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Of the 14 footprinted regions identified (Table 1), seven were selected for further analysis, and one site had previously been characterized in this laboratory.2 The sequence of β IVS2 was mapped using the Eukaryotic Transcription Factor Binding Sites (tfsites) data base of the University of Wisconsin GCG package(33Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the GCG Package, version 7. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). This data base includes consensus sequences for the binding of sequence-specific eukaryotic transcription factors. Footprint data and this map were analyzed to determine which sequences to characterize by EMSA.TABLE I Open table in a new tab β IVS2 includes nine consensus sequences for the binding of GATA-1, yet not all of these sites are bound in vitro by GATA-1. Four sites were found to bind GATA-1 (footprints 2, 7, 10, and 14,Fig. 2;Table 1;Fig. 3, A and B; and seeFig. 8B). Sites 7, 10, and 14 conform to the general GATA-1 consensus sequences as listed in the GCG tfsites data base(33Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the GCG Package, version 7. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1991Google Scholar,34Wall L. de Boer E. Grosveld F. Genes & Dev. 1988; : 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but site 2 does not match any of these sequences. However, it is clear that GATA-1 can bind a great variety of sequences(35Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,36Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). When compared with the commonly used GATA-1 consensus sequences YTATCW (35Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,36Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell.

Genes & Dev. 1988; : 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the site 2 sequence (TGCATCAG) matches the first sequence at four of six positions and the second sequence at four of eight positions. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized to generate EMSA probes for sites 2, 7, and 10. Each of these three probes was specifically competed by an excess of unlabeled competitor GATA-1 consensus oligonucleotide, but not with a GATA-1 mutant consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B andFig. 8B). Site 14 has been previously characterized in this laboratory,2 and was found to bind GATA-1.Figure 3EMSA of site 2 with the 42-bp site 2 oligonucleotide. Gels are 5% polyacrylamide.

EMSA done with a 60-bp oligonucleotide containing the ubiquitous footprint 5 sequence revealed a complex pattern (Fig. 5A). Within this site are two possibly stage-specific bands seen only with HEL-92, K562 (bands 3, a and b), and weakly with CEM nuclear extracts in some gels (not shown). There is also a different sized band seen only with MEL nuclear extract (band 4), a unique band found only with CEM and K562 (band 5), and a ubiquitous band (band 1). Each of these bands was competed by an excess of unlabeled site 5 probe (Fig. 5B, lanes 2, 8, and 9) but not by a nonspecific probe for the general transcription factor AP-1 (not shown). The large ubiquitous band (Fig. 5A, band 1) was competed by an Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 5B, lanes 3, 10, and 11) and was also supershifted by an anti-Oct-1 antibody (lane 5). Additionally, the GATA-1 consensus oligonucleotide did not compete any bands even though a GATA-1 consensus is present in the site 5 oligonucleotide (lane 4). In an attempt to identify the nuclear factors responsible for bands 3, a and b, 4, and 5, supershift analyses were performed using antibodies against c-Fos, c-Jun/AP-1, Oct-2 (lane 6), Fli-1, Pu.1, Ets 1/Ets 2, GATA-1, NFE-2, YY1, and SATB1. All of these were negative by supershift assay with the site 5 oligonucleotide.Figure 5EMSA of site 5 with the 60 bp site 5 oligonucleotide. Gels are 4% polyacrylamide.

As occurred for site 5, the site 6 oligonucleotide EMSAs revealed a complex pattern buried within this ubiquitous footprint. This includes an embryonic-fetal erythroid specific band seen only with HEL-92 and K562 (band 2b). There is also a larger band seen with HEL-92, K562, and possibly MEL (band 2a), although the low mobility of this band makes resolution difficult. All bands are competed by an excess of unlabeled site 6 probe (Fig. 6B, lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7;Fig. 6C, lanes 2 and 9,Fig. 6D, lanes 2, 3, and 4), but not with the GATA-1 consensus oligonucleotide, although the gel shift oligonucleotide contains a GATA-1 consensus sequence (Fig. 6C, lanes 4 and 10). One ubiquitous band is competed by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence for the homeobox protein Antennapedia (CAATTAAA) (Fig. 6D, band 4, lanes 5, 6, and 7), and is also competed by an oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence for the homeobox protein Oct-1 (ATTTGCAT) (Fig. 6C, lanes 6 and 12) but not by the mutant Oct-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 6C, lanes 7 and 13). This may be the site in IVS2 previously described to bind the homeobox protein HOX 2B (B6)(37Vallerga A. Shen W.-F. Hauser C. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. Blood. 1991; 78: 254Google Scholar,38Shen W.-F. Largman C. Lowney P. Hauser C. Simonitch T.A. Hack F.M. Lawrence H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8536-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nuclear matrix attachment DNA binding protein SATB1 was found to bind to the site 6 probe in CEM nuclear extract (Fig. 6A, band 3). β IVS2 has been described as one of nine sites in 90 kb of globin gene sequence studied to contain a MAR(19Jarman A.P. Higgs D.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3337-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been noted that MARs from the human β globin gene can bind SATB1(21Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). A SATB1 consensus oligonucleotide inhibits band 3 formation with the site 6 probe (Fig. 6C, lane 3), and the SATB1 band is supershifted by an anti-SATB1 antibody (Fig. 6B, lane 4). SATB1 is a 103-kDa protein(39Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the SATB1 runs very slowly on EMSA. It is also possible that the SATB1 band seen inFig. 6B might be a complex of SATB1 and some other protein. SATB1 complexes have been suggested in a recent paper describing the binding of SATB1 to an Aγ globin regulatory region (20Cunningham J.M. Purucker M.E. Jane S.M. Safer B. Vanin E.F. Ney P.A. Lowrey C.H. Nienhuis A.W. Blood. 1994; 84: 1298-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As was done for footprinted site 5, a supershift assay was performed using the same panel of antibodies against general factors, erythroid factors, and ets proteins. No additional supershifts were seen by EMSA. The sense strand footprint at site 7, which is seen with CEM, HEL-92, and K562 nuclear extracts (Fig. 7) has consensus sequences for the homeobox protein bicoid (CCTAATCTC) and GATA-1 (CCTAATCTC). This footprint is broader in HEL-92 and K562 nuclear extracts than in CEM, and the region footprinted only in HEL-92 and K562 includes a GATA-1 consensus sequence. EMSA with a 40-bp oligonucleotide including the site 7 footprint showed a more complex pattern with erythroid nuclear extracts than other extracts (Fig. 8A). The site 7 probe used spanned two GATA-1 consensus sequences (CCTAATCTC and TTATCTTA), and in fact proved to bind GATA-1 in the erythroid lines, generating a GATA-1 band which could be supershifted with an anti-GATA-1 antibody (Fig. 8A, lane 8;Fig. 8C, lane 7). This band was also specifically competed with a GATA-1 consensus oligonucleotide, but not with a GATA-1 mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 8B, band 2, lanes 13 and 14). Additionally, a higher band seen strongly with CEM and faintly with K562 was due to binding of nuclear matrix binding protein SATB1 (band 1). Band 1 is specifically competed by the SATB1 consensus oligonucleotide (Fig. 8B, band 1, lanes 3 and 11) and is supershifted by the anti-SATB1 antibody (Fig. 8C, lanes 2 and 6). The SATB1 binding of the site 7 oligonucleotide seemed stronger than the binding to the site 6 oligonucleotide. A faint band was seen in CEM and K562 nuclear extracts when the site 7 probe was labeled to a high specific activity (Fig. 8, B and C, band 4). This band could be competed with an Oct-1 consensus oligonucleotide, but not with an Oct-1 mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 8B, lanes 7 and 15 and 8 and 16). However, no supershift was seen using the anti-Oct-1 antibody (Fig. 8C, lanes 4 and 8). A 20-bp oligonucleotide was synthesized to further investigate a faint but reproducible 7-bp footprint (site 9) found only on the sense strand (data not shown). It is possible that this represents either a functional RNA binding protein or a single-stranded DNA binding protein(40Bandziulis R.J. Swanson M.S. Dreyfuss G. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). However, no bands were seen by EMSA of double-stranded probe or labeled sense or antisense single-stranded probe with any nuclear extract (data not shown). A 28-bp oligonucleotide was synthesized to characterize a footprint (site 12,Fig. 9) seen with nuclear extracts CEM, HEL-92, and K562. This oligonucleotide generated a complex gel shift pattern. One band was seen only with CEM, HEL-92, K562 and NIH 3T3 embryonic fibroblast nuclear extracts (41Jainchill J.L. Aaronson S.A. Todaro G.J. J. Virol. 1969; 4: 549-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Further characterization of binding to this site 12 probe showed that the bands are not competed by a general factor binding oligonucleotide (AP-1), and no supershifts were observed with the anti-SATB1 antibody (data not shown). Human β globin IVS2 has been entirely footprinted and further characterized by EMSA. Previous data have indicated that this region has several interesting structural and functional features; it contains a 3′-enhancer region(13Antoniou M. de Boer E. Habets G. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,14Behringer R.R. Hammer R.E. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Townes T.M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), two DNase I hypersensitive sites(17Groudine M. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Gelinas R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7551-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and is required for proper expression of the β globin gene(16Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We have previously analyzed the expression in MEL cells of β constructs in which β IVS2 has been replaced by δor γ globin IVS2, and have found that these globin IVSs are not interchangeable. When β IVS2 is replaced with δIVS2, the base-line expression of β is greatly decreased, and the cells are not inducible with Me2SO(18LaFlamme S. Acuto S. Markowitz D. Vick L. Landschultz W. Bank A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4819-4826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, constructs in which β IVS2 has been replaced with γIVS2 produce β transcripts that are improperly initiated in K562 cells(42Donovan-Peluso M. Acuto S. Swanson M. Dobkin C. Bank A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17051-17057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of ε, γ, δ, and β IVS2 using restriction maps and maps generated by the tfsites data base reveals no significant sequence conservation on the nucleotide level, and few conserved potential transcription factor binding sites, except for two GATA-1 binding sites that are conserved in position. The first is the second intronic GATA-1 site (Fig. 2), which is conserved in position between εand β globin. The second is the seventh GATA-1 site, which is conserved in position between Aγ and β globin. Neither of these sites were found to bind GATA-1 in our experiments and are not apparently functionally important, at least in the expression of β globin. The footprint pattern of β IVS2 and those areas studied by EMSA ha"
