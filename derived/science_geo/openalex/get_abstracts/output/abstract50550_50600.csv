https://openalex.org/W1547482025,"Abstract The crystal structure of Pseudomonas putida cytochrome P-450cam in the ferric, camphor bound form has been determined and partially refined to R = 0.23 at 2.6 A. The single 414 amino acid polypeptide chain (Mr = 45,000) approximates a triangular prism with a maximum dimension of approximately 60 A and a minimum of approximately 30 A. Twelve helical segments (A through L) account for approximately 40% of the structure while antiparallel beta pairs account for only approximately 10%. The unexposed iron protoporphyrin IX is sandwiched between two parallel helices designated the proximal and distal helices. The heme iron atom is pentacoordinate with the axial sulfur ligand provided by Cys 357 which extends from the N-terminal end of the proximal (L) helix. A substrate molecule, 2-bornanone (camphor), is buried in an internal pocket just above the heme distal surface adjacent to the oxygen binding site. The substrate molecule is held in place by a hydrogen bond between the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr 96 and the camphor carbonyl oxygen atom in addition to complementary hydrophobic contacts between the camphor molecule and neighboring aliphatic and aromatic residues. The camphor is oriented such that the exo-surface of C5 would contact an iron bound, activated oxygen atom for stereoselective hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W1496172532,"Physiologic regulation of protein kinase C activity requires its interaction with cellular membranes. We have recently shown that binding of the enzyme to plasma membranes is controlled by Ca2+, whereas enzyme activators, like phorbol esters, regulate both membrane binding and enzyme activity. Here we describe the factors which control the dissociation of protein kinase C from the plasma membrane. In the absence of phorbol esters, the dissociation reaction is rapid and is determined by varying the Ca2+ concentration between 0.1 and 1 microM. However, the presence of 4-beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate greatly reduces enzyme release in response to Ca2+ depletion; removal of the phorbol ester itself permits efficient membrane-enzyme dissociation. The stabilization of the membrane-protein kinase C complex by phorbol esters can be reversed by ATP with an apparent Km for the nucleotide of 6.5 microM. The ATP effect requires MgCl2 and cannot be reproduced by other nucleotides or by a nonhydrolyzable analogue, suggesting that an ATP-dependent phosphorylation reaction may be involved. 4-beta-Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate appears to stabilize membrane-enzyme association by reducing the apparent Km for Ca2+ to about 15 nM, whereas ATP reverses the phorbol ester effect by increasing the Km for Ca2+ to about 760 nM. Furthermore, the strong degree of negative cooperativity displayed by the Ca2+-dependent enzyme-membrane dissociation is consistent with the presence of multiple interacting Ca2+-binding sites on protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1604033226,"A major integral membrane glycoprotein of 63 kDa (p63), present at 500,000 copies/cell, was found on the surface of Leishmania major LEM 513 promastigotes. This protein was labeled either by surface iodination of the cells or by metabolic incorporation of [35S]methionine. Peptide maps of the proteins labeled by the two procedures were identical. Protein p63 was purified in three steps: extraction and phase separation in the nonionic detergent Triton X-114, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and finally chromatography on a Mono-Q column. The carbohydrate content as well as the concanavalin A receptor activity were characterized. A hydrophilic form of p63 was generated during the purification of the protein. This form was not derived by proteolysis from the amphiphilic protein found in the membrane, but may have been generated by the hydrolysis of a lipid containing myristyl residue(s) anchoring the protein in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1553871308,"Purified human colonic mucin contains six distinct components which may be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Past studies defined the structure of oligosaccharide side chains from the most abundant species III, IV, and V which elute at intermediate salt concentrations. In these studies the structures of oligosaccharide side chains liberated from the remaining early and late eluting species I, II, and VI were determined after isolation by sequential conventional and high performance liquid chromatography through combination of gas chromatography, methylation analysis, and sequential glycosidase digestion. Mucin species I, II, and VI contained a less varied array of discrete oligosaccharide structures than that observed in the major mucin components. Mucin species I and II contained five and 10 structures, respectively, which account for 68 and 71% of total oligosaccharide content in these fractions. The predominant oligosaccharides of mucin species I included three neutral structures: a disaccharide GlcNAc beta (1-3)GalNAc-ol, a trisaccharide Gal beta (1-4)GlcNAc beta (1-3)GalNAc-ol, and a tetrasaccharide GlcNAc beta (1-4)Gal beta (1-4)GlcNAc beta (1-3)GalNAc-ol as well as two acidic components representing the sialylated forms of two of these oligosaccharides. Mucin species II contained these same oligosaccharides as well as four additional acidic structures, notably a disaccharide Neu alpha (2-6)GalNAc-ol and a hexasaccharide Gal beta (1-4)GlcNAc beta (1-3)Gal beta (1-4)GlcNAc beta (1-3) (NeuAc alpha (2-6))-GalNAc-ol, not identified in any other mucin species. The late eluting mucin species VI contained at least five discrete neutral oligosaccharides and six major acidic structures. While the majority of these structures had been previously isolated from the earlier eluting mucin species IV and V, species VI also contained di- and trisialylated oligosaccharides not identified in other mucin species. In conjunction with earlier studies of the major mucin species III, IV, and V, these data define the range of oligosaccharide structures present in human colonic mucin. These studies demonstrate that human colonic mucin possesses species with characteristic and distinguishable combinations of oligosaccharides which reflect variations of common core structures."
https://openalex.org/W1525224329,"Metmyoglobin (metMb) reduction by metMb reductase from heart muscle requires cytochrome b5 as electron-transfer mediator. The existence of a metMb-ferrous cytochrome b5 complex is demonstrated by mutual perturbation of the proteins' respective electrophoretic titration curves between pH 4 and 7. The same technique shows a preferential binding of cytochrome b5 over metMb by the enzyme. The paramagnetic hyperfine shifts in the cytochrome b5 1H NMR spectrum are perturbed by metMb, indicating the formation of a specific bimolecular complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a binding constant estimated to be less than 10 microM. The resonances assigned to the cytochrome b5 heme 6-propionate methylene group exhibit the largest complexation shifts. Computer modeling implicates lysines 47, 50, and 98 of metMb as contact points with cytochrome b5 carboxylate residues 43, 44, 60, and heme 6-propionate. The mechanism of the enzymatic reduction establishes metMb reductase as an NADH-cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase. Cytochrome b5 is reduced at near diffusion-controlled rates by the enzyme with a turnover number of 1000 min-1 X Km for the cytochrome is 0.9 microM versus 100 microM reported for the erythrocyte enzyme. Ferrous cytochrome b5 then reduces metMb nonenzymatically with an apparent rate constant of 4.9 X 10(4) M-1 min-1 X Acetylation of metMb, which does not affect its oxygen affinity or chemical reduction, renders it a poor substrate for enzymatic reduction. This study suggests a function for the three exterior lysine residues conserved in all mammalian myoglobin sequences: they are contact points for complexation with cytochrome b5."
https://openalex.org/W1557021584,"Protein kinase C (PK-C) was demonstrated in human erythrocytes using the exogenous substrate histone H1. The enzyme was dependent on the simultaneous presence of micromolar Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine. The Ca2+ requirement was reduced in the presence of the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Activity was normally recovered in cytoplasmic extracts, but treatment of intact cells with TPA (EC50 = 40 nM) prior to lysis caused a rapid translocation of activity from the cytoplasm to the membrane. Following translocation, PK-C activity in the isolated membrane was independent of Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine and could not be removed by manipulating ionic strength. Ghosts from TPA-treated cells showed a marked increase in the phosphorylation of five proteins (termed PK-C-1-5) of Mr 120,000, 110,000, 80,000, 78,000, and 49,000. Addition of purified bovine brain PK-C to ghosts from untreated cells resulted in the phosphorylation of the same five proteins. PK-C-3/4 corresponded to Band 4.1 and PK-C-5 to Band 4.9. Both proteins were isolated from ghosts and shown to be substrates for PK-C in vitro. PK-C-1 and -2 appear to be minor peripheral membrane proteins as both were released from the membrane by alkaline solutions. Incubation of 32P-prelabeled erythrocytes with TPA (EC50 = 40 nM) also resulted in a dose-dependent phosphorylation of PK-C-1-5. These results suggest that PK-C may play an important role in erythrocyte membrane function."
https://openalex.org/W1522309562,"Human plasma apolipoprotein E (apo-E) strongly self-associates to form a stable tetramer in an aqueous solution at pH 7.4 containing 0.15 M NaCl. Tetramerized apo-E is abundant in alpha-helical conformation with an asymmetric molecular shape. Apo-E forms a stable monolayer at the air-water interface with a collapse pressure of 14 dynes/cm and with a limiting molecular area of 21 A2/amino acid. Under low surface pressure (less than 0.5 dyne/cm), it behaves as a monomer at the interface. It binds reversibly to the surface of phosphatidylcholine-coated triolein particles with a diameter of 26 nm from the aqueous phase in which most of the molecules are tetramerized. An apparent dissociation constant (Kd), 1.2 X 10(-6) M (monomeric molarity) or 40 mg/l, is substantially larger than those of the other apolipoproteins, while a binding saturation level (N), 0.8 amino acid/surface phospholipid, is equivalent to the N values of those proteins (Tajima, S., Yokoyama, S., and Yamamoto, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10073-10082). Content of alpha-helix increases slightly when it is transferred from the aqueous phase to the lipid surface. The results are consistent with a model that amphiphilic alpha-helical conformation is responsible both for self-association and surface binding and suggest that apo-E may easily dissociate from the lipoprotein surface to form a self-associated soluble tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1550762552,"A peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-27 of preornithine carbamyltransferase (pOCT) has been chemically synthesized. When added to energized mitochondria in vitro, 20 microM of the peptide, designated pO(1-27), resulted in a collapse of the electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This effect on transmembrane potential was not observed, however, when pO(1-27) was added to energized mitochondria under conditions that support in vitro import of precursor proteins (i.e. in the presence of reticulocyte lysate). The latter finding, therefore, made possible an examination of the ability of pO(1-27) to block import of homologous and heterologous proteins into the organelle. At 5-10 microM, pO(1-27) prevented import of pOCT in vitro; inhibition was overcome by increasing the concentration of pOCT. In contrast, pO(16-27), a peptide corresponding to amino acids 16-27 of pOCT and exhibiting a charge:mass ratio similar to pO(1-27) had no such inhibitory effect. pO(1-27) blocked import of other unrelated precursor proteins destined either for the mitochondrial matrix (pre-malate dehydrogenase and a hybrid protein containing the signal sequence of pre-carbamyl phosphate synthetase) or for the mitochondrial inner membrane (pre-thermogenin)."
https://openalex.org/W1496864275,"In adipocyte membranes, cholera toxin may ADP-ribosylate the islet-activating protein (IAP) substrate, under certain conditions. Covalent modification is maximal in the absence of a guanosine triphosphate; in the presence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, incorporation of [32P]ADP-ribose is markedly reduced. ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin has similar functional consequences as does IAP-mediated modification, i.e. the biphasic response of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase to GTP and the inhibition by N6-phenylisopropyladenosine is abolished, and only the stimulatory phase remains. In contrast, membranes treated with cholera toxin in the presence of GTP display both the stimulatory and inhibitory responses to GTP. The binding of the adenosine analog [3H]N6-phenylisopropyladenosine is increased in the presence of GTP. Treatment of the membranes with IAP, but not with cholera toxin in the absence of GTP, reverses this GTP effect on [3H]N6-phenylisopropyladenosine binding. However, [3H]N6-phenylisopropyladenosine binding is still sensitive to GTP in membranes treated with cholera toxin in the presence of GTP. In adipocyte and cerebral cortical membranes, the IAP substrate appears as a 39,000/41,000-Da doublet which does not appear to reflect protease activity. On two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, these two proteins migrate with approximate pI values 6.0 and 5.6, respectively. Although both behave similarly under all conditions explored in this study, it is unknown whether both, or only one, are involved in inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. These results extend the already striking homology between the adenylate cyclase complex and the visual system. Ni, as well as transducin, may be ADP-ribosylated by cholera toxin and by IAP, and, in all cases, there are functional consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1503337358,"Lysosomal acid lipase was purified to near homogeneity in a yield of 25-30% from secretions of human fibroblasts grown on microcarriers in spinner culture. Ammonium chloride was added to the serum-free medium to stimulate production of extracellular enzyme and minimize modifications, including proteolytic processing and destruction of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker, that have been associated with packaging and maturation of acid hydrolases in lysosomes. Chromatography of secretions by decyl-agarose, hydroxylapatite, phenylboronate-agarose, and gel filtration resulted in greater than 1500-fold purification of the lipase, representing a 10,000-fold increase above the specific activity of intracellular enzyme. The apparent molecular weight of approximately 49,000, estimated for the lipase by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, was similar to that determined for the native enzyme by gel filtration (Mr approximately 47,000). By contrast, a smaller molecular weight (Mr approximately 41,000) was estimated for the intracellular enzyme. The purified enzyme was susceptible to hydrolysis by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, which resulted in at least two new forms, reduced in apparent molecular weight by approximately 4,000-6,000. Treatment with the endoglycosidase did not alter the catalytic activity or heat stability of the acid lipase. However, the treated enzyme was no longer internalized by fibroblasts via the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and thereby had lost the capacity to correct cholesteryl ester accumulation in cultured lipase-deficient cells. Acid fatty acyl hydrolase activity for cholesteryl oleate, triolein, and methylumbelliferyl oleate co-purified. All three esters were hydrolyzed optimally at pH 4.0, but the pH profile was altered by addition of salts or albumin to the phospholipid-bile salt substrate mixtures. In a series of saturated fatty acyl esters of 4-methylumbelliferone, a derivative with an intermediate chain length (9 carbons) was the best substrate and was hydrolyzed at a rate comparable to that of the oleate ester at pH 4. The optimal pH for hydrolysis of the intermediate and shorter chain length esters was higher by about 2 pH units than that for the longer chain esters (pH approximately 4). The activity of the purified lipase was stimulated by several different proteins. The relationship of this effect to the possible requirement for a natural activator substance has not been determined.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Exponentially growing cells contain concentrations of 0.25, 0.31, 0.87, and 2.25 microM, respectively. These nucleotides have been followed after stressing the cells either by CdCl2 addition or by heat-shock treatment. Their concentrations are not affected by exposure to 500 microM CdCl2 during 6 h. Beyond this threshold of cadmium concentration, the nucleotides increase. With 5 mM CdCl2, an enhancement by 2 orders of magnitude of all the dinucleoside tri- and tetra-phosphates is observed. Upon heat-shock from 19 to 37 degrees C, Ap4A, Ap3A, and Ap3G increase up to 2.2, 3, and 3.3 times their initial levels, respectively. The increase is achieved within 1 h."
https://openalex.org/W1592312760,"Phorbol ester tumor promoters and growth factors rapidly stimulate ornithine decarboxylase activity in the transformed hamster fibroblast line HE68BP. We report here a close correspondence between the time courses and magnitudes of induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity and immunoreactive ornithine decarboxylase protein following treatment of HE68BP cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and/or refeeding with fresh medium. Cycloheximide addition to induced cells caused a rapid fall in the levels of both ornithine decarboxylase activity and ornithine decarboxylase protein. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from HE68BP cells indicated that treatment with TPA and fresh medium increased the amount of two species of mRNA of lengths 2.4 and 2.1 kilobase. This increased accumulation of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA corresponded temporally to that observed at the protein level, with a 15-fold maximal induction 7 h after treatment followed by a rapid decline in hybridizable RNA. These data indicate that stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity by TPA or refeeding involves changes in levels of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA as well as changes in the rate of synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase protein."
https://openalex.org/W1553798207,"gamma-Tocopherol methyltransferase was solubilized and purified from Capsicum chromoplast membranes by a combination of standard fractionation techniques. The purified enzyme was electrophoretically homogeneous, and its molecular weight, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was 33,000. In the absence of detergent, the enzyme formed high molecular weight aggregates. Several properties of the enzyme have been determined. The Km values were 2.5 and 13.7 microM for S-adenosylmethionine and gamma-tocopherol, respectively. The enzyme was able to transfer the methyl group S-adenosylmethionine to N-4-azido-2-nitrophenyl-beta-alanyl-gamma-tocopherol. The rate of transfer was less efficient compared to gamma-tocopherol. In the presence of ultraviolet light, this analog inhibited the gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase activity."

The molecular details of how these lipid cofactors function is unknown. Presented here are results of deuterium NMR investigations of site specifically 2H-labeled PIs incorporated into model membranes. To complement previous omega-terminal PI labeling schemes, a simple synthesis of head group 2H-labeled PIs is presented in which a PI alcohol is esterified with deuterated acetyl chloride. The 2H-labeled PIs, when incorporated into multilamellar membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine, gave rise to 2H NMR powder patterns interpretable in terms of quadrupole splittings (delta vQ) and spin-lattice relaxation times (T1s). Pure isomers of head group 2H-labeled geraniol (C10) and solanesol (C45) gave rise to single splittings while farnesol (C15) gave rise to two sets of splittings due to cis-trans isomerization at the polar terminal double bond. Membranes containing C45 solanesol exhibited a large isotropic component, indicative of limited partitioning of this poly trans PI into the membrane. T1 measurements revealed high rates of motion for PIs relative to cholesterol in similar membrane hosts and revealed correlation times close to the fatty acyl methyl termini in phosphatidylcholine. The smaller PIs showed higher rates of motion but the T1s of head and tail labels were similar. These data indicate that both ends of the esterified PI molecules see similar environments, probably in the bilayer interior, and suggest that the esterified PIs studied here do not appear to adopt a conventional head group-at-interface orientation of lipids within the bilayer."

In liver microsomes isolated from rats fed both mevinolin and colestipol, the Mr 100,000 form was the predominant species, whereas in microsomes from animals fed only colestipol, the Mr 200,000 species was the major form. This Mr 200,000 form could be converted to the Mr 100,000 form by addition of dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol. Although both forms appear to possess catalytic activity, the Mr 200,000 species displays sigmoidal kinetics with respect to the concentration of NADPH, whereas the Mr 100,000 form exhibits typical hyperbolic kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1536116857,"Abstract The origin and the functional significance of apo-A-I polymorphism in man has been investigated. Together with proapo-A-I (identified as A-I1 of the polymorphic series), four other isoforms are found in human plasma, namely A-I2, A-I3, A-I4, and A-I5. A-I3 is the product of proapo-A-I conversion in plasma. In this study we provide evidence that the other, more acidic, mature apo-A-I isoproteins are derived from A-I3 by a stepwise deamidation process. This conclusion is based on the following observations. 1) Incubation of A-I3 or A-I4, either free or associated with high density lipoprotein, produces a series of more acidic isoproteins corresponding to the sequence found in plasma. The conversion process fits in well with a first order reaction, and A-I3 to A-I4 conversion occurs virtually at the same rate as A-I4 to A-I5 conversion. 2) A-I3 and A-I4 have the same NH2- and C-terminal residues. 3) Formation of apo-A-I acidic isoproteins is accompanied by liberation of ammonia. In order to investigate whether deamidation of apo-A-I results in the production of forms which have different catabolism, a series of turnover studies was carried out in normal volunteers. A-I3 and A-I4 residence times in plasma were, respectively, 3.50 +/- 0.16 and 3.00 +/- 0.10 days (mean +/- S.E.; n = 3). Degradation rate of A-I3 was 8.81 +/- 0.69 mg/kg/day and that of A-I4 was 1.66 +/- 0.15 mg/kg/day (mean +/- S.E.; n = 3). Conversion of A-I3 to A-I4 and A-I4 to A-I5 occurred at the same rate in vivo as that observed in vitro. These results are consistent with the concept that A-I3 is the precursor to the other mature apo-A-I isoforms in plasma. A-I3 is the major isoform through which apo-A-I is eliminated from plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1490873113,"Previously we have found that histone H1 and H3 of tsBN2 cells showing premature chromosome condensation (PCC) at nonpermissive temperature (40.5 degrees C) were phosphorylated extensively as in mitotic cells (Ajiro, K., Nishimoto, T., and Takahashi, T. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 4534-4538). Under the influence of various chemicals, both the prevention of the PCC induction and the suppression of H3 phosphorylation occurred simultaneously, whereas H1 phosphorylation did not. At the minimum concentration for the inhibition of PCC induction, H1 phosphorylation remained at the control level, but H3 phosphorylation was completely suppressed. Tryptic peptide analysis revealed that the H3 phosphopeptide in PCC was single, and it was observed in the same position as in mitosis. The results suggest that specific site(s) of H3 phosphorylation related to the maintenance of a condensed state of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W107201027,"A high salt nuclear extract from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum was used as a source of kinase activity for the incubation of calf thymus histones with [gamma-32P]ATP. A major proportion of the 32P incorporated into histones was acid-labile and alkali-stable. The nature of the alkali-stable phosphorylated component was analyzed by subjecting the phosphorylated protein to total alkaline hydrolysis and separating the resultant phosphoamino acids by anion exchange chromatography. The 32P-labeled material co-chromatographed with phosphohistidine standards and did not co-chromatograph with phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or phosphotyrosine standards. In similar experiments using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography to separate the phosphoamino acids, the 32P-labeled phosphoamino acid behaved like the 1-isomer of phosphohistidine, in not being retained by the column, and unlike 3-phosphohistidine, phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphoarginine, which were all retained on the column. Histone H4 was a good substrate for the histidine kinase activity and the location of the phosphorylated histidine residue was probed by peptide mapping using chymotrypsin or V8 protease. Both maps were consistent with labeling of histidine 75 and inconsistent with labeling of histidine 18. The data show that Physarum nuclei contain a major kinase activity which produces phosphohistidine. The methods we have developed for studying this kinase activity provide the basis for a complete characterization of the structure and function of the Physarum enzyme and can be applied to the study of similar kinase activities in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W1518605959,"The N-terminal formic acid fragment (FA1) of the N-[3H]ethylmaleimide-labeled and carboxymethylated bovine mitochondrial phosphate transport protein (PTPN*CM) has been purified and completely sequenced: NH2-Ala-Val-Glu-Glu-Gln-Tyr-Ser-Cys-Asp-Tyr10-Gly-Ser-Gly-Arg-Phe- Phe-Ile-Leu-Cys- Gly20-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ile-Ile-Ser-Cys-Gly-Thr-Thr30-His-Thr -Ala-Leu-Val-Pro-Leu-Asp- -Leu-Val40-Lys-Cys(N-[3H]ethylmaleimide)-Arg-Met-Gln-Val-Asp- COOH. By thermolysin digestion of FA1 and high-performance liquid chromatography isolation of the radioactive subfragment Leu39-Arg43, the sole N-ethylmaleimide-binding residue has been identified as Cys42. FA1 contains a high mole percentage of cysteine (8.5%) and shows silver staining anomaly. Its sequence reveals significant homology in the triplicated gene regions (Pro27,132,229) of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier from beef heart and Neurospora crassa. The hydropathic profile suggests that FA1 contains a transmembrane segment (Phe15-Val40) with only one basic (His31) and one acidic (Asp38) residue. The presence of the phosphate transport protein gene among nuclear genes is suggested from a lack of significant homology between the reverse-translated FA1 (mitochondrial codons) and the bovine mitochondrial genome. The inhibitory action of N-ethylmaleimide on the phosphate transport mechanism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1516283219,"Abstract Thermal or transformation of rat hepatic [6,7-3H]triamcinolone acetonide (TA)-receptor complexes purified in the unactivated state to near homogeneity (Grandics, P., Miller, A., Schmidt, T. J., Mittman, D., and Litwack, G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3173-3180) has been further investigated. The data generated in reconstitution experiments demonstrate that warming (25 degrees C for 30 min) of the purified unactivated complexes promotes their activation as judged by an increase in DNA-cellulose binding, but to a lower extent than that observed after warming of glucocorticoid-receptor complexes in crude cytosols. However, maximal DNA-cellulose binding capacity can be detected in reconstituted systems (also heated at 25 degrees C for 30 min) consisting of purified unactivated [3H]TA-receptor complexes and a cytoplasmic stimulator(s). This cytoplasmic factor(s), which does not copurify with the receptor, is heat-stable (90 degrees C for 30 min), excluded from Sephadex G-25, and trypsin-sensitive and stimulates DNA-cellulose binding in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of Na2MoO4 to block thermal activation of the highly purified receptor complexes suggests that this transition metal anion interacts directly with the receptor protein itself. The fact that the cytoplasmic stimulator(s) enhances DNA-cellulose binding of the [3H]TA-receptor complexes without increasing the proportion of those complexes eluted in the activated (low salt) position from DEAE-cellulose is consistent with a proposed two-step model of in vitro activation. During the Na2MoO4-sensitive Step 1, elevated temperature (25 degrees C for 30 min) may directly alter the conformation of the purified receptor complexes (i.e. subunit dissociation or disaggregation), resulting in the appropriate shift in the elution profile of the [3H]TA-receptor complexes on DEAE-cellulose but only in a minimal (approximately 2-3-fold) increase in the binding of these complexes to DNA-cellulose. During the Na2MoO4-insensitive and temperature-independent Step 2, a heat-stable cytoplasmic protein(s) may interact with these thermally activated [3H]TA-receptor complexes and enhance their ability to bind to DNA-cellulose without further increasing the percentage of those complexes which elute from DEAE-cellulose in the activated position. In crude cytosols these two steps would presumably occur simultaneously, and addition of Na2MoO4 prior to warming would block Step 1 and hence Step 2 would not occur."
https://openalex.org/W1602839092,"The major coat protein (gene 8 protein) of bacteriophage M13 has been studied intensively as a model of membrane assembly, protein packing, and protein-DNA interactions.

In the presence of arabinose, the cloned gene is expressed at a rate comparable to that in an M13-infected cell. Plasmid-derived procoat is inserted across the plasma membrane and processed to coat at a normal rate. The coat can support plaque formation by a defective M13 virus (M13am8) with an amber mutation in its procoat gene. This complementation assay was used to screen the mutagenized, cloned gene 8 for mutants which fail to make fully functional coat. Mutants were obtained which fail to synthesize procoat, which do not convert procoat to mature coat protein, or in which the coat protein is incapable of assembling into infectious virions."
https://openalex.org/W1549319248,"Methylene blue stimulates the oxidation of glutathione in red blood cells in vitro and in vivo. This oxidation has been attributed to hydrogen peroxide that is generated from the autooxidation of leucomethylene blue arising from the reduction of methylene blue by NADPH. In this report we present evidence that methylene blue directly oxidizes glutathione and that oxidation of glutathione by hydrogen peroxide is a secondary reaction. Moreover, superoxide dismutase has no effect on the oxidation. Under aerobic conditions, methylene blue oxidizes glutathione 30 times faster than the spontaneous autooxidation of glutathione. Under anaerobic conditions the stoichiometry of the reaction of methylene blue with glutathione supports a direct chemical reaction. The reaction rates between glutathione and methylene blue suggest a second order reaction over the conditions tested. That neither oxygen radical formation nor significant amounts of hydrogen peroxide are produced by methylene blue, even in the presence of added glucose, is further confirmed by the failure to detect significant amounts of lipid peroxidation products, or hemolysis, in red blood cells incubated with the dye."
https://openalex.org/W1607460173,"The glycoprotein egasyn complexes with and stabilizes precursor beta-glucuronidase in microsomes of several mouse organs. Several observations indicate egasyn is, in addition, an esterase. Liver homogenates of egasyn-positive strains have specific electrophoretically separable esterases which are absent in egasyn-negative mice. These esterases react with anti-egasyn serum. A specific esterase was likewise complexed with immunopurified microsomal beta-glucuronidase. The esterases were, like egasyn and microsomal beta-glucuronidase, concentrated in the microsomal subcellular fraction. Egasyn which is not bound to beta-glucuronidase, which represents 80-90% of total liver egasyn, is not complexed with other liver proteins. Egasyn, therefore, specifically stabilizes beta-glucuronidase in microsomes. The esterase activity is inhibited by bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate indicating it is a carboxyl esterase. Several possible functions of egasyn-esterase activity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1550857256,"The in situ state of assembly of the human erythrocyte anion carrier (band 3) has been investigated by applying target size analysis on the radiation-induced inactivation of anion flux and degradation of polypeptide band 3. Irradiation with a high energy electron beam resulted in inactivation of carrier-mediated anion flux in intact cells, in inside-out vesicles devoid of cytoskeletal and cytoplasmic proteins, and in inside-out vesicles whose band 3 protein has been partially proteolyzed, with little change in leak pathway. The inactivation showed a single exponential function of radiation dose from which the target size of the anion carrier was estimated to be 210,000, 220,000, and 98,000 daltons in intact cells, in the inside-out vesicles, and in the vesicles after a limited proteolysis, respectively. Irradiation also resulted in degradation of the band 3 of the inside-out vesicles, as detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, with a dose dependence characteristic of a target size of 220,000 daltons. It is suggested that the human erythrocyte anion carrier exists in situ as a dimer of band 3."
https://openalex.org/W1514766530,"Diethylstilbestrol (DES) and certain chemically structural derivatives and analogs, indenestrol A (IA), indenestrol B (IB), indanestrol (IN), and pseudo-DES (PD), have been used as probes to examine various estrogenic responses previously considered interrelated and obligatory to the stimulation of uterine growth. All the analogs had poor uterotropic activity in vivo which ranged from 10-200 times less than that of estradiol or DES. The poor uterotropic activity was not due to poor binding affinity for the receptor. All compounds except IN interacted with the mouse uterine estrogen receptor with high affinity (approximately Ka 1.5-2.2 X 10(10) M-1). In addition, the compounds were able to translocate similar levels of receptor to the nucleus in vivo. Nuclear retention and occupancy of the estrogen receptor by the compounds was comparable to the patterns produced by DES or estradiol. The activity of uterine tissue responses was investigated during treatment with the compounds. Only IA stimulated uterine glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to significant levels similar to DES or estradiol. Uterine progesterone receptor was induced to varying degrees by all compounds; the indenestrol isomers (IA and IB) were the most active. Uterine DNA synthesis was marginally stimulated by the derivatives and analogs except for IB which showed a response increase comparable to DES or estradiol. Because of the differential stimulation, these data suggest that in uterine tissue estrogen receptor stimulates certain biochemical responses independently and not in concert. The ability of a particular response to be increased may depend on the chemical nature of the ligand receptor complex and its interaction at genomic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1525120564,"A comparison is made of the antioxidant activity of a water-soluble form of alpha-tocopherol complexed with bovine serum albumin (alpha-T X BSA) with that of micellar alpha-tocopherol and aqueous 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylate (Trolox) to inhibit autoxidation of linoleic acid in sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles. The peroxyl radical trapping ability of alpha-T X BSA compares favorably with that of alpha-tocopherol and Trolox, and all three can be used in quantitative measurements of the susceptibility of the micellar substrate to undergo autoxidation: the oxidizability, for reactions initiated in the micellar phase by di-tertbutylhyponitrite (DBHN) or in the aqueous phase by azobisamidinopropane hydrochloride (ABAP). alpha-Tocopherol and Trolox are also effective antioxidants to inhibit DBHN- or ABAP-initiated autoxidations of dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC) liposomes prepared as multilamellar or unilamellar bilayers characterized by 31P NMR spectra. The oxidizability of DLPC liposomes is determined by various combinations of water-soluble and lipid-soluble initiators and the antioxidants, alpha-tocopherol and Trolox. In contrast, alpha-T X BSA does not effectively trap peroxyl radicals when it is added after initiation of autoxidation in the lipid phase (DBHN) or in the aqueous phase (ABAP). The radical trapping ability of alpha-T X BSA becomes evident if it is mixed with the DLPC for some hours before initiation. This result is interpreted in terms of diffusion of alpha-tocopherol from the bound alpha-T X BSA form to the liposome before it exhibits antioxidant activity."
https://openalex.org/W1511210631,"Abstract The distribution along the polypeptide of the carbohydrate units of two major calf thyroid cell surface glycoproteins, GP-1 and GP-3, was obtained from a study of their glycopeptides obtained after Pronase digestion. The GP-3 molecule (Mr = 20,000) yielded two large glycopeptides (Mr = 9,500 and 7,000) in equimolar amounts which each consisted of one N-linked (Mr = 5,400) and several small O-linked oligosaccharides accounting for a total of nine carbohydrate attachment sites in a 27-amino acid residue segment of the peptide chain. The Pronase treatment of GP-1 (Mr = 100,000) revealed the presence of a large protease-resistant fragment (Mr = 50,000) which contained 34 carbohydrate units (eight N-linked and 26 O-linked) in a segment of 105 amino acids. In addition to these densely glycosylated peptides (one glycosylation site/3 amino acid residues), small glycopeptides with polymannose saccharide units were found in the digests of both proteins. The occurrence of repeating N-acetyllactosamine sequences in the N-linked carbohydrate units of GP-1 and GP-3 was suggested by the composition and size of the oligosaccharides released by hydrazinolysis and was demonstrated by endo-beta-galactosidase treatment. The cleavage products from digestion with this enzyme were identified as NeuAc alpha 2----6Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal, Gal alpha 1----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal, Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal, and GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal with the tetrasaccharides constituting the predominant species. The terminal alpha-D-Gal residues accounted for the binding of GP-1 and GP-3 glycopeptides to Bandeiraea simplicifolia I-agarose; concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography indicated that most of the N-linked carbohydrate units of both glycoproteins contained more than two branches. Difference in the branching on the poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences of GP-1 and GP-3 was suggested by the finding that only the latter glycoprotein, as well as its glycopeptides, reacted with anti-blood group I antibodies; neither glycoprotein demonstrated blood group i antigenicity. Examination of cultured thyroid follicular cells revealed that both I and i determinants were present at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1561293143,"Following injection into Manduca sexta (L.) female pupae (day 16), [14C]cholesterol was converted to a C21 steroid conjugate, 5-[14C]pregnen-3 beta,20 beta-diol glucoside. The conjugate was isolated from ovaries and eggs and contained three glucose units at least one of which is attached to C-20. The distribution of the other two glucose units remains to be determined. Other than the dealkylation of C-24 alkane or alkene substituents, side-chain cleavage of sterols is uncommon to insects. Here we report the first definitive proof of the biosynthesis of a C21 steroid conjugate from cholesterol in an insect species. The capability of M. sexta to so readily convert cholesterol to a C21 steroid suggests a physiological role for 5-pregnen-3 beta,20 beta-diol in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1591913504,"Isolated rat hepatocytes secreted a major phosphorylated glycoprotein (PP63) with apparent Mr = 63,000 and isoelectric point ranging from 4.8 to 5.3. Specific antibodies were raised in a rabbit using material obtained from plasma as an antigen. The biosynthesis of PP63 was studied in vitro in a cell-free system and in intact hepatocytes incubated with or without tunicamycin. The mRNA translation product had a Mr = 43,000 and was of the same size as the major unglycosylated precursor found in intact cells. This precursor was rapidly processed into two major intracellular forms of Mr = 53,000 and 56,000. These species were insensitive to neuraminidase but susceptible to endoglycosidase H, indicating that they contained oligosaccharide side chains of the high mannose-type. Terminal glycosylation gave rise to the mature Mr = 63,000 protein that contained sialic acid and fucose. This species represented the exportable form of the protein and was the only one to be phosphorylated. The charge heterogeneity observed for the mature protein already existed in all the precursors, indicating that it could not be ascribed to sialylation or to phosphorylation. However, these covalent modifications were mainly responsible for the acidic character of PP63. PP63 secretion was altered by tunicamycin. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the phosphorylated glycoprotein was secreted according to kinetics similar to that described for other liver glycoprotein, with slower kinetics than albumin. Permanent phosphorylation did not appear mandatory for excretion since the dephosphorylated PP63 was excreted with an efficacy comparable to that of the phosphorylated protein. Phosphorylation of PP63 was shown to occur on a single tryptic peptide, at a serine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1526775182,"Peptide 1, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly, is an excellent substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. While the importance of both arginines for effective enzyme-substrate interactions has been shown, it has not been known whether the kinase will catalyze phosphorylation of substrates which contain other than peptide bonds. We report that analogs of peptide 1 which contain depsi linkages replacing selected amide bonds are good protein kinase substrates. Therefore, with the possible exception of the serine amide proton, no peptide 1 amide hydrogens are involved in peptide-peptide or peptide-enzyme hydrogen bonding crucial to defining the high substrate activity of this peptide. It is thus unlikely that peptide 1 is bound by the protein kinase while in an alpha-helical or a beta-turn structure. Three peptides were found to be very poor substrates for protein kinase, those containing N-methyl amino acids in place of Ser5 or Leu6 and a peptide containing Pro in place of Leu6. These peptides are poor substrates for the enzyme possibly because they are unable to adopt a conformation necessary for catalysis of phosphoryl group transfer to occur or due to steric effects in the enzymatic active site."
https://openalex.org/W1566475950,"Proliferation during kidney development can be stimulated with an iron chelator, ferric pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (FePIH). Neither the starting products nor the intermediary in FePIH synthesis stimulated proliferation. Thus, the growth-promoting effects of FePIH are due to the iron ion. Some other low molecular weight, saturated iron chelators such as glycyl-histidyl-lysine acetate, nitrilotriacetic acid, ascorbate, citrate, and unchelated ferrous sulfate could not support as high a degree of proliferation as FePIH or transferrin. FePIH delivered just slightly less radioactive iron into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction than transferrin. The octanol/saline partition coefficients of radioactive iron in solution with transferrin, nitrilotriacetic acid, or chloride were all less than 0.06. Thus, these compounds cannot efficiently traverse the lipid membrane. On the other hand, Fe3+ carried by PIH had a partition coefficient of 0.96. Hence, FePIH can stimulate proliferation because it can carry iron through the lipid membrane. Transferrin is not lipophilic but it delivers iron by receptor-mediated endocytosis."

Using an in vitro mitochondrial protein synthesizing system, we provide evidence that this 60-kDa heat shock protein is encoded within the organelle. Further support for this heat-induced protein being encoded within mitochondria is that its synthesis is inhibited in whole seedlings by chloramphenicol. This 60-kDa heat shock protein is induced in all lines of maize we examined. Additionally, a heat-induced peptide of similar size (62 kDa) can be detected in isolated mitochondria of a dicot plant, Brassica campestris. The function of the heat shock protein encoded within the mitochondria remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W114922951,"Normal adult human articular cartilage in organ culture secretes proteoglycan subunits that cannot initially interact in a normal manner with hyaluronic acid unless the latter is present at high concentrations and a neutral pH is employed. However, if the newly secreted subunit is allowed to mature in the cartilage matrix for up to 12 h, then its ability to interact is indistinguishable from that of its more mature counterparts. This conversion does not take place if the proteoglycan subunits are incubated in dilute solutions in the absence of the cartilage, and it is prevented by culturing at low temperature. The newly secreted proteoglycan subunits can, however, be induced to interact with hyaluronic acid by the presence of link proteins. The complex formed by these three components cannot be dissociated in the presence of hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides, suggesting a normal aggregate configuration. It is thus possible that proteoglycan aggregate formation within the cartilage is initially mediated by the presence of link proteins, which induce a conformational change with the hyaluronic acid-binding region of the proteoglycan subunits, although additional modification may be necessary to render any such change irreversible."

https://openalex.org/W1606585991,"The activation of cobra venom phospholipase A2 by activators (containing phosphorylcholine moieties) appears to depend upon the aggregation state of the enzyme, and the presence of a lipid-water interface. The characteristics of this activation were studied by comparing the behavior of the enzyme immobilized on an agarose gel to that of the soluble enzyme. The immobilized enzyme displays only a few per cent of the soluble enzyme activity toward micellar dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC). However, the relative loss of activity is much less with micellar dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine or soluble diheptanoyl-PC. The affinity for Ca2+ is increased about 10-fold by immobilization while the apparent pKa of the enzyme is decreased by 0.5-0.8 pH units. Activation energies are similar for the two enzyme forms and are independent of the physical state of the substrate used. Catalytic constants of the enzyme toward monomeric PC are not changed by immobilization. Yet, activators of the soluble enzyme have negligible effect on the immobilized enzyme, either in the presence or absence of an interface. Monomeric activators promote the binding of the soluble enzyme to the immobilized form. Apparently, immobilization mainly produces monomerically constrained enzyme which cannot be activated under any condition, whereas normally, activators in the presence of lipid-water interfaces induce the formation of enzyme dimers or possibly higher order aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1558721407,"The enzyme from almond that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic linkage between asparagine and the oligosaccharide chain of glycopeptides and glycoproteins has been variously termed an N-glycosidase and an amidase enzyme. Using turkey ovomucoid glycopeptide as a substrate for the enzyme, we followed the hydrolysis reaction by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These kinetic data revealed a rapid hydrolysis of the substrate but a delayed appearance of the final product. This implied that an intermediate, most likely a 1-aminooligosaccharide, was formed during the reaction. Identification of the intermediate as a 1-beta-amino-N-acetylglucosamine-oligosaccharide was achieved by trapping it as the 1-acetamido derivative using acetic anhydride and subsequent analysis by 1H NMR. The data conclusively demonstrate that the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the glycopeptide to form an aspartic acid-containing polypeptide and an intermediate oligosaccharide amine. The latter derivative is hydrolyzed nonenzymatically to yield the final carbohydrate product. Thus, the enzyme is in fact an amidohydrolase (amidase) and not an N-glycosidase. The trivial name glycopeptidylamidase is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1510123421,"Four oligosaccharide fractions were isolated and purified from the kidney of goats affected with beta-mannosidosis by repeating Bio-Gel P-2 column chromatography. The structural characterization of the purified oligosaccharide fractions (oligosaccharides A, B, C1,2, and D) included sugar composition analysis by gas chromatography, sugar sequence analysis by mass spectrometry of their permethylated alditols, and by methylation analysis as well as anomeric configuration studies by exoglycosidase digestions. Oligosaccharides A and B were the major oligosaccharides accumulating in the kidney and were elucidated as Man beta 1-4GlcNAc and Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc, respectively (Matsuura, F., Laine, R. A., and Jones, M. Z. (1981) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 211, 485-493). Oligosaccharide C1,2 was a mixture of two tetrasaccharides and oligosaccharide D was a pentasaccharide. The proposed structures are: oligosaccharide C1, Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4Man beta 1-4GlcNAc; oligosaccharide C2, Man alpha 1-6Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc; oligosaccharide D, Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc. Tetrasaccharide C1 and pentasaccharide D are heretofore undiscovered oligosaccharides. There is no precedent for these structures in glycoproteins or other glycoconjugates. One possibility which accounts for the presence of oligosaccharide C1 and D is that a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (the beta-N-acetylglucosamine residue linked at the C-4 position of the beta-mannosyl residue of the trimannosyl core of the asparagine-linked sugar chains) is linked by a beta-mannosyl residue. Moreover, the detection of oligosaccharides containing two N-acetylglucosamine residues at the reducing terminus, together with those containing a single N-acetylglucosamine residue, is further corroboration of species-specific differences in glycoprotein catabolic pathways (Hancock, L. W., and Dawson, G. (1984) Fed. Proc. 43, 1552) or in glycoprotein structures."

The conformation of NAD+ as bound to the T. caldophilus enzyme was elucidated by analyses of the transferred nuclear Overhauser effects (TRNOE), in the presence and the absence of the allosteric effector, Fru-1,6-P2. Upon binding of Fru-1,6-P2 to the enzyme, the ribose ring of the adenosine moiety of NAD+ is converted from the C2'-endo form to the C3'-endo form. This C3'-endo form of the adenosine moiety is similar to that of NAD+ as bound to nonallosteric vertebrate enzymes. However, the anti conformation of the adenine-ribose bond of NAD+ as bound to the T. caldophilus enzyme is not affected by the binding of Fru-1,6-P2. In contrast, the syn conformation of the nicotinamide-ribose bond is converted to the anti form on the binding of Fru-1,6-P2, while the ribose ring remains in the C3'-endo form as found in the case of a nonallosteric enzyme. Such a conformational change of enzyme-bound NAD+ as found on TRNOE analysis is essentially involved in the allosteric regulation of the T. caldophilus enzyme by Fru-1,6-P2."

The equilibrium constant of the reaction is Keq = 5.8 X 10(7) M-1 at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. The inhibition kinetic patterns obtained when 4-hydroxybutyrate or substrate analogs are used as inhibitors of the reaction catalyzed by the reductase are consistent with an ordered sequential mechanism, in which the coenzyme NADPH adds to the enzyme before the aldehyde substrate. A specific aldehyde reductase was also purified to homogeneity from brain mitochondria preparations. Its catalytic properties are identical to those of the enzyme isolated from whole brain homogenates. It is postulated that two enzymes, i.e. a NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase and a NADP+-dependent reductase, participate in the metabolism of succinic semialdehyde in the mitochondria matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1542953549,"The effect of an IgM class monoclonal antibody (B36) (Greene, G. L., Fitch, F. W., and Jensen, E. V. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 157-161) raised against the calf uterine estrogen receptor was tested in vitro on certain parameters of estrogen receptor activation by estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a potent anti-estrogen. The following results were obtained. The antibody prevented the decrease in the dissociation rate of the receptor-estradiol complex which results from activation of the complex, whereas it did not affect the dissociation rate of the receptor-4-hydroxytamoxifen complex, which remains unchanged upon activation. The antibody also increased the dissociation rate of the preactivated receptor-estradiol complex. The antibody protected the naked estrogen receptor against heat-inactivation. B36 partially inhibited the binding of the estradiol- and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen-receptor complexes to DNA adsorbed onto cellulose, but did not reverse the receptor-DNA binding. This inhibition was not overcome by higher DNA concentrations and was more pronounced for the receptor interacting with estrogen than with anti-estrogen. All these effects were specific since they were related to antibody/antigen recognition and were dose-dependent. These results indicate that the binding of the antibody to the estrogen-activated receptor induces a conformational change in the receptor and that the antibody can prevent and overcome the effect of activation whatever its mechanism. They also confirm that the conformations of the estrogen receptor differ when bound to estradiol or to 4-hydroxytamoxifen."
https://openalex.org/W1516035740,X-ray diffraction data were measured by x-ray diffractometry to 5-A resolution for both the monoclinic form of rabbit skeletal muscle aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13) and a platinum derivative. The heavy atom difference patterson was solved at 6-A resolution yielding eight distinct heavy atom sites. Choice was made of the enantiomorph and protein phases were calculated on the basis of single isomorphous replacement differences. The electron density map calculated from these phases was averaged according to the non-crystallographic molecular symmetry. Rotational symmetry analysis of native patterson and site symmetry analysis of refined heavy atom positions are consistent with the aldolase tetramer possessing a very high degree of 222 internal symmetry. The subunits in the tetramer are positioned in a tetrahedral configuration displaying a slight square planar deformation. Each subunit is roughly ellipsoidal in shape with the major axis nearly parallel to a local 2-fold axis. Prominent at the surface of each subunit were structural features resembling alpha helices. Each subunit contributes to its boundary surface at least six helices which are arranged in a barrel-like manner and possessing a right handed twist with respect to each other. Density associated with binding of substrate on the enzyme was located on the surface of each subunit. Cooperative aspects of the conformational changes produced upon substrate binding are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1566990644,"Abstract The coupling between depolarization-induced calcium entry and neurotransmitter release was studied in rat brain neurons in culture. The endogenous dopamine content of the cells was determined by high performance liquid chromatography utilizing electrochemical detection. The amount of dopamine in unstimulated cells was found to be about 16 ng/mg of protein. Depolarization of the neurons by elevated K+ caused a Ca2+-dependent release of dopamine from the cells. Following 1 min of depolarization, the cellular dopamine content and the amount of [3H]dopamine in cells preloaded with the radioactive transmitter were reduced by 35%. The release of [3H]dopamine by the neurons was measured at 1.5-6-s intervals by a novel rapid dipping technique. Depolarization in the presence of Ca2+ (1.8 mM) enhanced the rate of neurotransmitter release by 90-fold (0.072 +/- 0.003 s-1) over the basal release in the presence of Ca2+. The evoked release consisted of a major rapidly terminating phase (t1/2 = 9.6 s) which comprised about 40% of the neurotransmitter content of the cells and a subsequent slower efflux (t1/2 = 575 s) which was observed during following prolonged depolarization. Predepolarization of the cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ did not affect the kinetics of the evoked release. The fast evoked release could be re-elicited in the cells after 20 min rest in reference low K+ buffer. The effects of varying the extracellular Ca2+ concentrations on the kinetic parameters of the evoked release were measured. The amount of neurotransmitter released during the fast kinetic phase was very sensitive to the external Ca2+ (from 0% in the absence of Ca2+ to 40% of the neurotransmitter content at Ca2+ 0.3 mM). The rate constant of the fast release did not depend on the extracellular Ca2+, whereas the rate constant of the slow release increased from 0.0004 +/- 0.0001 s-1 at 0.4 mM Ca2+ to 0.0012 +/- 0.0002 s-1 at 0.8 mM Ca2+. The fast evoked release was inhibited by verapamil in a concentration-dependent manner. By contrast, verapamil enhanced the basal and the slow release independent of the presence of Ca2+. Both fast and slow phases of the evoked release were blocked by Co2+. Addition of Co2+ within the first 6 s after the onset of depolarization inhibited the fast release but failed to do so when added later on.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 31,000 and 33,000 by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate under the reducing and the nonreducing conditions, respectively. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 4.8. The pH optimum of the activity was 8.4. The enzyme was stable between pH 6 and 9 in the presence of 0.005% Brij 35 as a stabilizer. Substrate specificity of the purified enzyme was broad toward various peptidyl-arginine (or -lysine) 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amides and was similar to that of a trypsin-like enzyme found in the fertilization product. The purified enzyme was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and a variety of trypsin inhibitors including leupeptin, but not, or scarcely, inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, pepstatin, chymostatin, bestatin, elastatinal, and tosyl-phenylalanyl-chloromethane. The rankings in the potencies of leupeptin and its six analogs as the inhibitors of the purified enzyme were well correlated with those found in their inhibitory effects on the expansion of perivitelline space. Thus, the trypsin-like enzyme possibly present in the fertilization product participates in the expansion of perivitelline space of the egg during fertilization of the ascidian."

The KS glycopeptides remaining after digestion of the proteoglycans with thermolysin and chondroitinases were isolated and depolymerized by hydrazinolysis and nitrous acid cleavage. The resulting KS disaccharides had nonreducing terminal D-galactose (Gal) residues and reducing terminal anhydro-D-mannose (AMan) residues. The KS fractions from all cultures had identical disaccharide compositions, with 18-20% Gal—-AMan, 72-79% Gal—-AMan(6-SO4), and 7-9% Gal(6-SO4)—-AMan(6-SO4). The ratios of chondroitin sulfate (CS) to KS synthesized by cultures of dividing, elongated, and hypertrophied chondrocytes were 15, 27, and 30, respectively. Approximately 30% of the CS chains of the proteochondroitin sulfate in the cell matrix pools had nonreducing terminal GalNAc(4,6-diSO4) residues, but none of the CS chains in the proteochondroitin sulfate recovered from the culture medium pools were terminated with these residues."

The proteins in the culture fluid were fractionated resulting in a radioactively pure 63-kDa protein and 30- and 89-kDa protein preparations with residual minor radioactive impurities. The secreted 89-kDa protein shared at least one characteristic with some interferon-induced cell-associated enzymes: it bound double-stranded RNA tightly. The 63-kDa protein was undetectable in the culture fluid from resting BALB/c-3T3 cells and was barely or not at all detectable in the culture fluids from growing BALB/c-3T3 and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively. The protein was, however, among the three major constitutively secreted proteins in the case of growing Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Treatment with 1000 units/ml beta-interferon decreased the accumulation of the 63-kDa protein in the culture fluid of quiescent BALB/c-3T3 cells which had been treated with a platelet-derived growth factor preparation by over 80% and that in the culture fluid of Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed NIH 3T3 cells by about 50%. This decrease was not a consequence of an inhibition of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1503184488,"The fluorescence emission of 1-N6-etheno-2-aza-ATP (epsilon-aza-ATP) at 410-460 nm is enhanced approximately 8-fold upon mixing substoichiometric concentrations of epsilon-aza-ATP with bovine cardiac actomyosin-S1 or myofibrils. The time course of nucleotide fluorescence measured in a front face stopped flow cell upon mixing epsilon-aza-ATP with bovine cardiac myofibrils ([Ca2+] less than 10(-7) M) is essentially the same as that with bovine cardiac actomyosin subfragment-1. In single turnover experiments, the fluorescence rapidly rises to a maximum value, then decreases with a rate constant of 0.04 s-1 at 0 degree C to a final value that is approximately twice the level of the unbound nucleotide. At concentrations of epsilon-aza-ATP greater than 40 microM the kinetics of epsilon-aza-ATP binding is clearly biphasic for both actomyosin-S1 and myofibrils. At 0 degree C, the rate of the more rapid phase is proportional to nucleotide concentration and has a second order rate constant of 1.7 X 10(5) M-1 s-1; the rate of the slower phase extrapolates to a maximum of 4-5 s-1 at high nucleotide concentration. The rate constants for dissociation of epsilon-aza-ADP from bovine cardiac actomyosin-S1 and myofibrils were measured from the decrease in epsilon-aza-ADP fluorescence enhancement observed upon displacement by ATP to be 20 and 18 s-1, respectively, at 0 degree C. These results indicate that most of the cross-bridges in cardiac myofibrils are bound to actin and that the geometric constraints imposed upon the interaction of actin and myosin by the three-dimensional structure of the myofibril do not modify the kinetics of epsilon-aza-ATP binding or epsilon-aza-ADP dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1523619707,"The hydrogen exchange kinetics of the N delta H proton in His F8 of iodoacetamide- and N-ethylmaleimide-treated human deoxyhemoglobins were studied using a NMR method. Comparison with unmodified hemoglobin shows that the reagents, covalently bound to Cys beta 93, significantly increase (about one order of magnitude) the exchange kinetics in beta chains only. This effect was partially reversed by the strong allosteric effector inositol hexaphosphate. Study of the high resolution 400-MHz NMR spectra of modified oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobins permitted localization of the extent of chemically induced structural perturbations. The resonances corresponding to hydrogen bonds specific to the deoxy conformation are not changed, in accord with the preserved cooperativity. Under the experimental conditions (0.1 M bis-Tris, 10 mM Cl-, pH 7.2), the salt bridge at the C terminus of the beta chain in the deoxy state (His beta 146-Asp beta 94) is perturbed by both modifications. The His beta 146 appears to be rendered more immobilized by the reagents in the oxy conformation. From the resonances corresponding to heme pocket protons of oxyhemoglobin it is deduced that the perturbations do not extend over the distal side of the heme pocket but are limited to the FG, F, and HC segments of the beta chain."
https://openalex.org/W1520750633,"Asymmetrical hybrid hemoglobins formed in mixtures of Hb A and Hb S, Hb F and Hb S, Hb S and Hb York(beta 146 His----Pro), and Hb A and Hb York were separated by high performance liquid chromatography on cation and anion exchange columns under anaerobic conditions. The ratio of the hybrid hemoglobin to the total mixture was consistently lower than that theoretically expected and decreased with longer elution times. The hybrid tetramer appears to be unstable even under anaerobic conditions and dissociates into alpha beta dimers. The time course of dissociation of the hybrid hemoglobins was determined by varying the separation programs and thus separating the hybrid hemoglobin at different elution times. The rate of the dissociation of the hybrid hemoglobins studied follows first order kinetics. The lines representing the time course of dissociation of hybrid hemoglobins were extrapolated to time 0 to determine the fraction of the hybrid hemoglobin in the mixture prior to separation. The values obtained for equimolar mixtures of Hb A and Hb S and Hb York and Hb S or Hb A were in agreement with the expected theoretical value (50%). In contrast, the value obtained for hybrid hemoglobin FS was slightly less (about 40%). AY and SY hybrid hemoglobins dissociated into dimers at a considerably faster rate than did AS and FS hybrid hemoglobins, possibly because of the mutation at the beta 146-position in hybrid hemoglobins containing alpha beta Y dimers. This mutation hinders the formation of salt bridges that normally stabilize the T quaternary conformation. Since such hybrid hemoglobins have a partial R conformation even when deoxygenated, their rate of dissociation to dimers is expected to increase."
https://openalex.org/W1582421664,"Young sorocarps (consisting of a mass of spore cells resting on a stalk) were exposed to low levels of [U-14C]glucose and the spore cells were rapidly separated from stalk cells. Metabolites were isolated from spores and their specific radioactivities compared to these metabolites isolated from the whole organism; i.e. spore plus stalk cells. Based on these data, known reaction rates, and metabolite concentrations, highly constrained steady state models of metabolism in spore and stalk cells were constructed. Direct evidence has been obtained which substantiates earlier predictions regarding cell permeability, the distribution of specific metabolites, and the location of reactions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1534101135,"The soluble cytochrome o from Vitreoscilla contains two identical subunits and two hemes. The reduced form binds 2 mol of CO in a cooperative manner with a Hill coefficient near 2 (Tyree, B., and Webster, D. A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6988-6991). This carbonyl compound was photolysed with a dye laser and recombination followed at 437 or 420 nm where maximal absorbance changes were registered. Recombination kinetics were biphasic, and the fast phase was approximately 10 times the rate of the slow phase. Apparent rate constants of both phases showed a nonlinear dependence on CO concentration, respectively, in conformity with a reaction scheme which assumes the transient formation of an intermediate species in both slow and fast reactions. A study of temperature dependence of the reactions gave EA = 2.7 kcal/mol for the slow reaction and EA = 3.2 kcal/mol for the fast reaction below 23 degrees C; above this temperature the slope of the Arrhenius plot for the fast reaction became positive. Maximal rates for both phases were around pH 6.5 and fell to approximately 40% of maximal at pH 12. The binding reaction was affected by even a low concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.0025%), which changed both the kinetic constant of each phase and the relative contribution of each phase to the reaction. A model which assumes the existence of fast and slow reaction conformers in equilibrium is proposed."
