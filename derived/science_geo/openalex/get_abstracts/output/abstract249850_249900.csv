https://openalex.org/W1975912195,"β-Catenin is a signaling molecule that promotes cell proliferation by the induction of gene transcription through the activation of T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors. The canonical mechanism of the regulation of β-catenin involves its phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 at the Ser-45 site and by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) at the Thr-41, Ser-37, and Ser-33 sites. This phosphorylation targets β-catenin to ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome system. Mitogenic factors promote β-catenin signaling through the inhibition of GSK3, resulting in reduced β-catenin phosphorylation, its stabilization, and subsequent accumulation in the nucleus, where it stimulates TCF/LEF-dependent gene transcription. In the present study, we have shown that (i) β-catenin can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) in vitro and in intact cells at two novel sites, Ser-552 and Ser-675; (ii) phosphorylation by PKA promotes the transcriptional activity (TCF/LEF transactivation) ofβ-catenin; (iii) mutation of Ser-675 attenuates the promoting effect of PKA; (iv) phosphorylation by PKA does not affect the GSK3-dependent phosphorylation ofβ-catenin, its stability, or intracellular localization; and (v) phosphorylation at the Ser-675 site promotes the binding of β-catenin to its transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel, noncanonical mechanism of modulation of β-catenin signaling through direct phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA, promoting its interaction with CREB-binding protein. β-Catenin is a signaling molecule that promotes cell proliferation by the induction of gene transcription through the activation of T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors.

First, being a major component of the cell-cell adherens junctions, β-catenin links members of the cadherin family of transmembrane cell-cell adhesion receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (1Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Second, β-catenin acts as an inducer of gene expression that controls an array of embryonic and adult processes (2Huelsken J. Behrens J. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a key effector of Wnt signaling, a pathway first identified in Drosophila (4Nusslein-Volhard C. Wieschaus E. Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (3055) Google Scholar) and soon found to be highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and to affect cell growth and differentiation in many cell types (5Willert K.

McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). Mutations of β-catenin or of its regulatory proteins are frequently found in various types of cancers, and they result in the accumulation of β-catenin and in the activation of TCF/TCF-dependent gene transcription (9Morin P.J.

This is provided by its interaction with the scaffolding proteins, adenomatous polyposis coli and axin, and protein kinases, casein-kinase 1α (CK1α) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which phosphorylate β-catenin on Ser-45 and then on Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 sites, respectively (11Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (12Aberle H.

The Wnt and other growth stimuli lead to inhibition of GSK3, resulting in a decreased phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 sites, its stabilization, accumulation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus (14van Noort M. Meeldijk J. van der Zee R. Destree O. Clevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17901-17905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3 at the N terminus, β-catenin can also be phosphorylated at the C terminus on Tyr-654 by Src tyrosine kinases, and this phosphorylation affects the association of β-catenin with cadherin, resulting in a loss of cell-cell adhesion (15Roura S. Miravet S. Piedra J. de Herreros A.G. Dunach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36734-36740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). While analyzing the primary structure of β-catenin, we found two putative sites of phosphorylation by PKA that are distinct from those phosphorylated by CK1, GSK3, or Src kinases (Fig. 1). In this study, we have shown that (i) β-catenin can be phosphorylated by PKA at these sites and (ii) phosphorylation at one of these sites promotes the transcriptional activity of β-catenin by facilitating its interaction with a transcriptional co-activator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). Cell Culture, DNA Reagents, and Antibodies—COS7 cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Twenty-four hours prior to stimulation, the cells were serum-deprived using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm l-glutamine. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine-PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cDNA for human β-catenin was kindly provided by Dr. Stephen W. Byers, Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.). The β-catenin mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. The TCF/LEF luciferase reporter constructs (TOPflash and FOPflash) were from Upstate Biotechnology. The replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) encoding a complete sequence for the PKA inhibitor protein (PKI) gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was described previously (16Hogarth D.K. Sandbo N. Taurin S. Kolenko V. Miano J.M. Dulin N.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C449-C456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cDNA for Myc-tagged dominant negative PKA mutant was described previously (17Davis A. Hogarth K. Fernandes D. Solway J. Niu J. Kolenko V. Browning D. Miano J.M. Orlov S.N. Dulin N.O. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the PKA catalytic subunit (cPKA) was from Stratagene. The antibodies were from the following sources: anti-PKA substrate (PKAS, catalog number 9624), anti-phospho-pS33/pS37/pT41-β-catenin (catalog number 9561), and anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (catalog number 9331) were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-β-catenin (catalog number sc-7939), anti-cPKA (catalog number sc-903), anti-CREB-binding protein (CBP, catalog number sc-369), and anti-N-cadherin (catalog number sc-7939) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-GSK-3α/β (catalog number 44-610) was from BIOSOURCE International; anti-FLAG M2 (catalog number F1804) and anti-β-actin (catalog number A5441) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Nonradioactive in Vitro Assay for PKA Activity in Cell Lysates—Following stimulation with the desired agonists, the cells (grown in 12-well plates) were lysed in 0.1 ml/well lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF, 200 mm Na-orthovanadate). The lysates were cleared from insoluble material by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and 5 μl of cleared lysates were subjected to a kinase reaction with the fluorescence-labeled PKA substrate, Kemptide (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples for 10 min. The phosphorylated Kemptide was separated by 0.8% agarose electrophoresis, and the fluorescence of the phosphorylated Kemptide was detected and quantified by a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Western Blotting—Unless indicated, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium-orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were cleared from insoluble material by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, boiled in Laemmli buffer, subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with the desired primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem), and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Pierce). The digital chemiluminescence images were taken by a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm). Immunoprecipitation—Generally, the lysates from 2 × 106 transfected cells were used for one immunoprecipitation. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in the extraction buffer (300 μl/106 cells) containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The immunoprecipitation of endogenous β-catenin was performed by overnight incubation of the cleared lysates with agarose-conjugated goat anti-β-catenin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-1496), followed by three washes with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged β-catenin proteins was performed using agarose-conjugated mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number A2220). Immunoprecipitation of CBP was performed using anti-CBP antibodies followed by incubation with protein A/protein G-conjugated agarose beads (The immune complexes were boiled in Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western blotting with the desired antibodies. In Vitro 32P Labeling of β-Catenin—FLAG-tagged wild-type (WT) β-catenin or its PKA phosphorylation mutants were expressed in COS7 cells and purified using anti-FLAG-agarose beads. The beads were washed once with PKA assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) and then incubated with 45 μl of PKA assay buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 units of purified protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Promega, V5340), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography Western blotting with the desired antibodies. 32P Labeling of β-Catenin in Intact Cells—COS7 cells were transfected with cDNAs for N-terminally truncated (ΔN100) FLAG-tagged WT-β-catenin or its PKA phosphorylation mutants and serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were incubated with 0.25 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in a phosphate-free and serum-free medium, followed by three washes and stimulation with 10 μm forskolin (FSK) for 10 min. The cells were then lysed, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies as described above, followed by electrophoresis, autoradiography, or Western blotting with FLAG antibodies. TCF/LEF-Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells grown on 24-well plates were transfected in triplicates or quadruplicates with cDNAs (20 ng/well) for TCF-luciferase reporter (TOPflash) or its mutated control reporter (FOPflash) along with the Renilla reporter driven by the thymidine kinase promoter (tk-RL) and with the other plasmids of interest. The total amount of DNA was equalized in all of the samples by using the corresponding empty vector. Following stimulation with the desired agonists, the cells were lysed and the luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the corresponding Renilla activity using the dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega). The normalized FOPflash values were subtracted from the corresponding TOPflash values and expressed as mean ± S.D. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (18Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass chamber slides and transfected with FLAG-tagged β-catenin cDNA were stimulated with or without 10 μm forskolin for 15 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS for 5 min, followed by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (5 μg/ml in PBS/bovine serum albumin, as above) overnight at 4 °C for 1 h and washed four times with PBS, followed by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml in PBS/bovine serum albumin, as above) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were additionally washed four times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted using Gel/Mount aqueous mounting medium (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). The confocal images (sections near the bottom of the cell) were taken under a confocal fluorescent microscope. Statistics—The Bonferroni t test for multiple comparisons was utilized to test for statistically significant differences. The appropriate level of significance was determined for each analysis, according to the number of simultaneous comparisons tested against the reference group (p value cutoffs are indicated in the figure legends). Phosphorylation of β-Catenin by PKA—We first tested the possibility that the endogenous β-catenin can be phosphorylated by PKA using PKAS antibodies directed against the phosphorylated PKA substrates ((RXX(pS/pT), Cell Signaling Technology). Fig. 2A shows stimulation of PKA by a cAMP-rising agent, FSK, and inhibition by adenovirus (Ad)-mediated transduction of the PKA inhibitor PKI (AdPKI). The specificity of AdPKI was previously confirmed by its inability to affect mitogen-activated protein kinase activation induced by various agonists (16Hogarth D.K. Sandbo N. Taurin S. Kolenko V. Miano J.M. Dulin N.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C449-C456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Western blotting of cell lysates with PKAS antibodies revealed a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of a number of proteins, and this PKAS recognition was attenuated by AdPKI transduction (Fig. 2B). When β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates followed by Western blotting with PKAS antibodies, a single band that co-migrated with β-catenin was detected only after FSK stimulation (Fig. 2C). Overexpression of PKI prevented the recognition of immunoprecipitated β-catenin by PKAS antibodies. The equal amount of β-catenin in the immunoprecipitation samples was confirmed by probing with β-catenin antibodies (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that endogenous β-catenin can be phosphorylated in a PKA-dependent manner in response to FSK. We identified two potential PKA phosphorylation sites on β-catenin (serine 552, serine 675; Fig. 1) and generated alanine substitutions to examine the function. We first examined whether PKA could phosphorylate β-catenin and the above mutants in vitro and found that PKA readily phosphorylated the WT β-catenin (Fig. 3). The S552A or S675A mutation partially attenuated this effect, whereas the double mutation (S552A/S675A) completely abolished the phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA (Fig. 3). We then examined whether FSK could stimulate PKA-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin in intact cells. To dissect the CK1- and GSK3-dependent phosphorylations, we generated the FLAG-tagged truncated versions of β-catenin and of its PKA phosphorylation mutants by deleting the N-terminal (ΔN100) region containing the phosphorylation sites for CK1 or GSK3. We then overexpressed these truncated β-catenin proteins in COS7 cells and examined their phosphorylation in response to FSK by immunoprecipitation from 32P-labeled cells, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4, FSK stimulated phosphorylation of ΔN100-WT-β-catenin; this phosphorylation was partially attenuated by the S552A or S675A mutations and was abolished by mutation of both sites. The smear (Fig. 4A, above the β-catenin band), nonspecifically precipitated by FLAG antibodies, served as an internal control for the presence of 32P labeling in all of the original lysates. Together, these data convincingly demonstrate that β-catenin can be phosphorylated by PKA at Ser-552 and Ser-675 sites both in vitro and in intact cells.FIGURE 4Phosphorylation of ΔN100-β-catenin and its mutants in intact cells. COS7 cells were transfected with empty vector or with cDNAs for FLAG-tagged ΔN100-β-catenin and the corresponding mutants labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with 10 μm FSK for 10 min. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies followed by electrophoresis and autoradiography (A) or Western blotting with FLAG antibodies (B). C, 32P densitometry (A) was normalized to the corresponding levels of ΔN100-β-catenin (B) and expressed as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was analyzed using the Bonferroni t test for three comparisons. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.017) are indicated by an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of β-Catenin Promotes Its Transcriptional Activity—To understand the functional significance of β-catenin phosphorylation by PKA, we first examined how the stimulation of cells with FSK affects the signaling of endogenous β-catenin, using TCF/LEF-luciferase reporter (TOPflash/FOPflash). As shown in Fig. 5A, FSK stimulated a significant induction of TCF/LEF reporter (TOPflash) without affecting the control (mutant) reporter activity (FOPflash). Overexpression of dominant negative PKA mutant (dnPKA) abolished FSK-induced TCF/LEF activity, indicating the role of PKA for this effect (Fig. 5B). The efficiency and specificity of dnPKA in inhibiting PKA activity in intact cells was previously confirmed (17Davis A. Hogarth K. Fernandes D. Solway J. Niu J. Kolenko V. Browning D. Miano J.M. Orlov S.N. Dulin N.O. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that PKA can phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3 resulting in decreased phosphorylation and increased stability of β-catenin (19Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 20Khaled M. Larribere L. Bille K. Aberdam E. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Bertolotto C. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36955-36961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We examined whether this could explain the effect of FSK on TCF/LEF induction in our experiments. In COS7 cells, FSK stimulated a rapid and prolonged phosphorylation of GSK3α (a major GSK3 isoform in these cells), as assessed by phosphospecific antibodies (Fig. 6A). Nevertheless, the total levels of β-catenin, as well as its GSK3-dependent phosphorylation, were not significantly affected by FSK, as assessed by Western blotting with antibodies against total β-catenin (Fig. 6D), or with phospho-(pS33/pS37/pT41)-specific β-catenin antibodies (Fig. 6C). Together, these data suggest that, in COS7 cells, PKA promotes the signaling of endogenous β-catenin without affecting the levels of its expression. We then examined how the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of ectopically expressed β-catenin affects its transcriptional activity. Overexpression of FLAG-tagged WT-β-catenin on its own in COS7 cells resulted in a 5–7-fold activation of TCF/LEF-reporter, as expected (not shown), but this effect was further potentiated by FSK treatment (Fig. 7A). Mutation of β-catenin at S552A did not change the TCF/LEF-reporter activity, but the S675A or the S552A/S675A mutations decreased the effect of FSK by half. Western blotting of cell lysates with FLAG antibodies revealed that FSK facilitated the expression of ectopic β-catenin (Fig. 7B), which was probably the result of an increased transcription by the cytomegalovirus promoter (driving transcription of β-catenin and its mutants). Likewise, FSK treatment also increased the expression of cytomegalovirus-driven β-galactosidase or green fluorescent protein (data not shown). This may partially, but not entirely, contribute to a FSK-induced TCF/LEF activity in β-catenin-transfected cells (note that FSK did not affect the expression of endogenous β-catenin (Fig. 6D); whereas it still stimulated the TCF/LEF activity in nontransfected cells (Fig. 5A)). Importantly, the expression of both WT and all three PKA phosphorylation mutants of β-catenin was equally increased upon FSK stimulation, whereas the FSK-induced TCF/LEF reporter activity was significantly reduced in cells transfected with S675A or S552A/S675A mutants. This suggests that the S675A mutation attenuates the ability of FSK to promote the β-catenin-mediated TCF/LEF activity. To test whether the results obtained in FSK-stimulated COS7 cells could be reproduced in other cells and by other means of PKA stimulation, we overexpressed the PKA-catalytic subunit (cPKA) in HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 8A, cPKA overexpression in HEK293 cells promoted the signaling of WT-β-catenin or its S552A mutant to a much greater extent than that of S675A or S552A/S675A mutants. Similar to our observations using FSK-stimulated COS7 cells (Fig. 7), cPKA overexpression in HEK293 cells resulted in increased levels of β-catenin and its mutants but all to the same extent (Fig. 8C). Thus, the very similar results obtained by two different approaches strongly suggest that (i) PKA promotes the TCF/LEF activity induced by β-catenin, at least in part, through phosphorylation of β-catenin at the Ser-675 site and (ii) this effect of PKA does not seem to involve stabilization of β-catenin. To further address the latter notion, we examined the rate of β-catenin degradation following the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 9A, a 3-h treatment of cells with cycloheximide resulted in a 60% decrease of exogenous β-catenin but not of β-actin. Importantly, (i) treatment of cells with FSK did not protect β-catenin from degradation, and (ii) there was no significant difference between WT-β-catenin and its PKA phosphorylation mutants in the degradation rate. We also examined how PKA affects the intracellular localization of β-catenin. As shown on Fig. 9B, overexpressed β-catenin localized mainly to the nucleus as expected. However, forskolin stimualtion for 15 min (which results in maximal phosphorylation at both the Ser-552 and Ser-675 sites) did not affect the localization of WT-β-catenin (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, the alanine substitution of either the Ser-552 or Ser-675 sites also had no obvious effect on β-catenin localization under basal or forskolin-stimulated conditions; it still remained largely in the nucleus (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that PKA promotes β-catenin signaling without affecting its stability or intracellular localization. Given that the Ser-675 phosphorylation site (responsible for the promoting effect of PKA) is located within the transactivation domain of β-catenin, we then hypothesized that phosphorylation by PKA promotes β-catenin signaling at the level of its transcriptional activity, through modulation of its interaction with co-activators, such as CBP. CBP is an acetyltransferase that promotes the activity of several transcription factors (i.e. CREB) by their acetylation. CBP acetylates β-catenin and increases its transcriptional activity (22Hecht A. Vleminckx K. Stemmler M.P. van Roy F. Kemler R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wolf D.

Renard C.-A. Buendia M.A. Neuveut C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA is important for β-catenin-CBP interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. As shown on Fig. 10, WT-β-catenin and the S552A mutant bound specifically to CBP, and their binding was significantly increased by 50% after FSK treatment. In contrast, the S675A mutation resulted in a dramatic reduction of β-catenin binding to CBP, and, importantly, FSK no longer promoted this binding. Note that β-catenin is partially phosphorylated at the Ser-675 site under basal conditions (as the S675A mutation abolishes this basal phosphorylation) (Fig. 4C), which may explain an appreciable binding of β-catenin to CBP under control conditions (Fig. 10, no FSK (–)). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA at the Ser-675 site is important for its interaction with CBP, which may explain how PKA promotes transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Finally, we sought to examine whether the phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA affects its interaction with cadherin, for the following reasons: (i) the Ser-552 phosphorylation site does not seem important for modulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may modulate the other function of β-catenin at cell-cell adherens junctions, (ii) the Ser-552 phosphorylation site is located within the 10th armadillo repeat of β-catenin that may be important for interaction with cadherin (25Huber A.H. Weis W.I. Cell. 2001; 105: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), and (iii) the β-catenin/cadherin interaction was reported to be regulated by PKA, albeit through phosphorylation of cadherin (26Boucher M.J. Laprise P. Rivard N. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 202: 178-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 11A, endogenous N-cadherin readily and specifically co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-WT-β-catenin. However, stimulation of cells with FSK had no effect on the interaction of N-cadherin with either WT-β-catenin, or with its PKA phosphorylation mutants. Thus, at least as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation approach, phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA does not seem to affect its interaction with N-cadherin. In addition, Fig. 11C also shows that GSK3-dependent phosphorylation (at Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 sites) of ectopic β-catenin is not affected by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin (at Ser-552 or Ser-675 sites), which is consistent with the results on the endogenous β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 (Fig. 6C). The present study describes three major findings. (i) β-Catenin can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and in intact cells at novel sites (Ser-552 and Ser-675) distinct from those phosphorylated by CK1, GSK3, or Src kinases. (ii) Phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA at the Ser-675 site promotes its transcriptional activity by a noncanonical mechanism that does not involve the stabilization of β-catenin. (iii) Phosphorylation of β-catenin at the Ser-675 site facilitates the interaction between β-catenin and CBP, which may provide a molecular mechanism by which PKA promotes the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. The role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the modulation of cell growth is highly complex and cell-specific; it stimulates cell growth in many cell types while inhibiting cell growth in others (27Stork P.J.S. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Moreover, even in the same cell type (vascular smooth muscle cells), PKA can promote or inhibit cell proliferation dependent on the agonist that stimulates its activity (16Hogarth D.K. Sandbo N. Taurin S. Kolenko V. Miano J.M. Dulin N.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C449-C456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that, in COS7 and HEK293 cells, PKA facilitates the signaling of β-catenin, which is consistent with the recent report demonstrating that prostaglandin E2, through PKA activation, promotes β-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells (28Shao J. Jung C. Liu C. Sheng H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26565-26572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, in the latter report, the promoting effect of PKA is attributed to phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3, whereas our results point to the role of a direct phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA at the Ser-675 site. Regarding the mechanism by which phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA promotes its transcriptional activity, we first showed that phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA: (i) does not affect the GSK3-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous or ectopic β-catenin at the Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 sites (Figs. 6C and 11C), (ii) does not protect β-catenin from degradation (Fig. 9A), (iii) does not affect the amount of endogenous β-catenin (Fig. 6D), and (iv) does not affect the nuclear localization of ectopic β-catenin (Fig. 9B). Thus, our data suggest that PKA promotes β-catenin signaling by a noncanonical mechanism. In this study, we have proposed one potential mechanism wherein phosphorylation of β-catenin by PKA at the Ser-675 site promotes the interaction between β-catenin and its co-activator, CBP, whereas S675A mutation nearly abolishes this interaction. It has been recently shown that the phosphoserine-binding protein 14-3-3ζ interacts with β-catenin and potentiates its transcriptional activity by an unknown mechanism (29Tian Q. Feetham M.C. Tao W.A. He X.C. Li L. Aebersold R. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Given that both PKA phosphorylation sites on β-catenin (RRTS552MGGT and KRLS675VELT) (Fig. 1) match the type-2 consensus 14-3-3 binding motif (RX1–2(pS/pT)X2–3(pS/pT)) (30Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar), we explored whether 14-3-3 interacts with β-catenin through these sites. However, we have failed to coimmunoprecipitate these two proteins despite multiple efforts using different conditions (data not shown). In contrast, a positive control interaction between the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS3) and 14-3-3 (experiments performed in parallel) was readily detectable, as we have shown previously (31Niu J. Scheschonka A. Druey K.M. Davis A. Reed E. Kolenko V. Bodnar R. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Du X. Kehrl J. Dulin N.O. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 677-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, an independent study by Hino et al. (32Hino S.-i. Tanji C. Nakayama K.I. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9063-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) has been published showing that PKA can phosphorylate β-catenin at the Ser-675 site. Consistent with our results, these authors show that phosphorylation of β-catenin at this site promotes TCF-dependent gene transcription, whereas the S675A mutation attenuates this effect. However, Hino et al. (32Hino S.-i. Tanji C. Nakayama K.I. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9063-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) suggest that phosphorylation of β-catenin at the Ser-675 site leads to stabilization of β-catenin, which is different from what our data, showing no stabilization and no protection of β-catenin from degradation, suggest. Although acknowledging that such a discrepancy could be the result of multiple experimental factors, including cell-type specificity, cell growth conditions, density, etc., we propose here an additional possible mechanism by which PKA promotes the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, namely by facilitating its interaction with CBP (Fig. 10). Finally, we also identified Ser-552 as a site of phosphorylation by PKA, which was not reported previously (Figs. 3 and 4). Even though its mutation has a lesser effect on 32P incorporation into β-catenin, as does the S675A mutation (Figs. 3A and 4A), the Ser-552 site is surely phosphorylated by PKA, because its mutation abolishes the recognition of β-catenin by antibodies against phosphorylated PKA substrates (data not shown). At this time, we do not know what the functional significance is of β-catenin phosphorylation at the Ser-552 site. Few possibilities exist. (i) It has no significance; this can be argued by the notion that every modification of the protein is meaningful. (ii) We have missed the effect of the S552A mutation due to an overwhelming overexpression of the mutant; this is unlikely, because under the same transfection conditions, the effect of the S675A mutation was readily detectable (Figs. 7, 8, and 10). (iii) Phosphorylation of β-catenin at the Ser-552 site may be important for another previously unrecognized function of β-catenin. These unanswered questions are currently being addressed in our laboratory. We thank Dr. Stephen W. Byers for providing the cDNA for β-catenin. Download .pdf (.16 MB) Help with pdf files"

Although wild-type mice died after administration of 0.02 μg of VT-2 or 1.0 μg of VT-1, the mutant mice showed no reaction to doses as much as 100 times that administered to wild types. Expression analysis of Gb3/CD77 in mouse tissues with antibody revealed that low, but definite, levels of Gb3/CD77 were expressed in the microvascular endothelial cells of the brain cortex and pia mater and in renal tubular capillaries. Corresponding to the Gb3/CD77 expression, tissue damage with edema, congestion, and cytopathic changes was observed, indicating that Gb3/CD77 (and its derivatives) exclusively function as a receptor for VTs in vivo. The lethal kinetics were similar regardless of lipopolysaccharide elimination in VT preparation, suggesting that basal Gb3/CD77 levels are sufficient for lethal effects of VTs. To examine whether globotriaosylceramide (Gb3/CD77) is a receptor for verotoxins (VTs) in vivo, sensitivity of Gb3/CD77 synthase null mutant mice to VT-2 and VT-1 was analyzed.

Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3/CD77) 2The abbreviations used are: Gb3/CD77, globotriaosylceramide; α1,4Gal-T, α1,4-galactosyltransferase, Gb3/CD77 synthase; VT, verotoxin; HUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TNF, tumor necrosis factor, IL, interleukin. is synthesized from lactosylceramide by α1,4-galactosyltransferase (Gb3/CD77 synthase, α1,4Gal-T). This glycolipid has been characterized as Pk blood group antigen (1Marcus D.M. Kundu S.K. Suzuki A. Semin. Hematol. 1981; 18: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar) and has also been referred to as Burkitt lymphoma-associated antigen (2Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6485-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, its role in the apoptosis of immature B cells has been reported previously (3Gregory C.D. Dive C. Henderson S. Smith C.A. Williams G.T. Gordon J. Rickinson A.B. Nature. 1991; 349: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). A unique aspect of Gb3/CD77 is its role as a receptor for bacterial toxins produced by Escherichia coli O157 strain (4Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 5Lingwood C.A. Law H. Richardson S. Petric M. Brunton J.L. De Grandis S. Karmali M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8834-8839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also referred to as the Shiga-like toxin(s) or verotoxin(s) (VTs) (6Konowalchuk J. Speirs J.I. Stavric S. Infect. Immun. 1977; 18: 775-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VT-producing E. coli are considered to be causative agents of hemorrhagic colitis (7Riley L.W. Remis R.S. Helgerson S.D. McGee H.B. Wells J.G. Davis B.R. Hebert R.J. Olcott E.S. Johnson L.M. Hargrett N.T. Blake P.A. Cohen M.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 308: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), and infections have often been associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which has been associated with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (8Karmali M.A. Petric M. Lim C. Fleming P.C. Arbus G.S. Lior H. J. Infect. Dis. 1985; 151: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). HUS is also frequently associated with disruption of the central nervous system (9Tzipori S. Chow C.W. Powell H.R. J. Clin. Pathol. 1988; 41: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and can be lethal. Gb3/CD77 was reported to bind specifically to the β-subunit of VTs. Consequently, tissue damage by VTs is considered to depend on Gb3 expression in individual tissues (10Boyd B. Lingwood C. Nephron. 1989; 51: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the following issues remain to be clarified, specifically, whether Gb3 is the only specific receptor for VTs in vivo and whether clinical signs of HUS are dependent upon Gb3 expression. In the present study, we established knock-out mice for the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene (11Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and analyzed their sensitivity to VTs as well as Gb3/CD77 expression in mouse tissues. We clearly demonstrated that Gb3/CD77 and/or its derivatives are exclusive receptors in vivo and that they mediate the tissue damage and pathological features caused by VTs. These results suggest that therapeutic approaches directed at disrupting the function of Gb3/CD77 could be an effective method for protecting against disorders related to pathogenic E. coli infection. Generation of Knock-out Mice—A targeting vector was constructed using a 10.5-kb mouse genomic fragment including the α1,4Gal-T gene. Part of the α1,4Gal-T gene (nucleotides 68-615 in the open reading frame) was replaced with a neo-resistant gene (Fig. 1A). The targeting vector was linearized and transfected into embryonic stem cells, and G418-resistant clones were isolated. Homologous recombination was confirmed by dual Southern blotting. Chimeric mice were generated by microinjection of the embryonic stem clones into embryos at the 8-cell stage and were mated with C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygotes. Genotyping was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from mouse tails and amplified with primers: P1, 5′-ACG ACC TCT GGA CTT GCA AGA ACT GTT TGA-3′; P2, 5′-AAG GCA CCG TTG AGG ACA TAG CGG GAT-3′; and P3, 5′-GCC TGC TTG CCG AAT ATC ATG GTG GAA AAT-3′ (Fig. 1C). The Nagoya University Committee on Animal Research approved all experimental procedures. Southern Blotting—Southern blotting was performed using a current method. Briefly, genomic DNA was prepared from embryonic stem cells or mouse tails with a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS) or Tail DNA extraction solution (0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS), respectively. Isolated DNA was digested with restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on agarose gels, and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. First, EcoRV digests were blotted with 32P-labeled probe-1 prepared by PCR using primers 5′-CGG CCT GAT GTC CTT AAT TCA CCA ACA-3′ and 5′-GAT ATC TGC CTT GGA CTC TAG TGT CAC-3′. Second, BglII digests were probed with 32P-labeled probe-2 prepared by PCR using primers 5′-AGG GTA CAC ACC TAG AGG CCA CA-3′ and 5′-TCC TGA CCC CAC CTC TAA CCA G-3′ as depicted in Fig. 1A. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen). Total isolated RNAs were then separated using 1.25% agarose gels and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. The cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 90-637 in the open reading frame of the mouse α1,4Gal-T gene (GenBank accession number AA682117) was used as a probe. Enzyme Assay—The enzyme activity of α1,4Gal-T was measured as described previously (11Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and membrane fractions were prepared from kidneys. Glycolipid Extraction, TLC, and TLC Immunostaining—Glycolipid extraction and TLC immunostaining were performed as described using kidney from 10-week-old mice (12Furukawa K. Clausen H. Hakomori S. Sakamoto J. Look K. Lundblad A. Mattes M.J. Lloyd K.O. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7820-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected using an ABC kit™ (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Wako, Osaka, Japan) as a substrate. Flow Cytometry and Measurement of Serum Antibody—Spleen cell and thymocyte subsets were analyzed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD45R (B220), FITC anti-CD4, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD3, and PE-anti-CD8 mAbs (eBioscience, Kobe) by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as described previously (13Okada M. Itoh M. Haraguchi M. Okajima T. Inoue M. Oishi H. Matsuda Y. Iwamoto T. Kawano T. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Furukawa K. Aizawa S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1633-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). IgG, IgM, and IgA levels in mouse serum were measured using a Mouse Immunoglobulin ELISA Quantitation Kit™ (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). VT-1 and VT-2 Preparation—A clinically isolated E. coli O157 H7 strain was used for production of VTs as reported (14Zhao Y.L. Cen X.B. Ito M. Yokoyama K. Takagi K. Kitaichi K. Nadai M. Ohta M. Takagi K. Hasegawa T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1522-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Luria broth culture supernatant was precipitated with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and used after dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Contaminating lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in this preparation (10.62 mg/ml) were eliminated by Detoxi-Gel™ (Pierce); the LPS concentration was < 0.001% (final 99.52 ng/ml), but VT-2 concentration was >93% after the purification. VT-2 concentration was determined by the VTEC-RPLA™ kit (Denka Seiken, Tokyo). LPS concentration in the crude VT-2 preparation was determined by the ENDOSPESY™ kit (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo). Histology and Immunohistochemistry—For pathological analysis, tissues from 10-15-week-old mice before and after treatment with VT-2 were fixed with 3.7% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. For immunohistochemical analysis, tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and 7-μm sections were prepared on a cryostat (Leica) and fixed with ice-cold acetone for 15 min at -20 °C. After blocking with 0.05% H2O2 and 10% normal goat serum, cryosections were incubated with mAb-38.13 (1:50) or an anti-CD31 mAb-390 (1:50) (eBioscience), and the antibody bindings were detected with Histofine Simple Stain Mouse MAX PO™ (Rat) (Nichirei, Tokyo) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) as a substrate. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. For negative controls, immunohistochemistry was carried out using non-relevant antibodies with the same isotypes. To determine the expression sites of Gb3 in tubules, we carried out immunohistochemistry using fluorescence-conjugated second antibodies and performed our analysis with a Fluoview FV500™ confocal laser microscope (Olympus, Tokyo). Antibody binding to Gb3 and CD31 was detected with anti-rat-IgM fluorescein isothiocyanate (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) and anti-rat-IgG-Alexa-488 (Molecular Probe, Invitrogen), respectively. GM1 expression in tissues was detected with CTB-Alexa-555 (1:100) (Molecular Probe, Invitrogen). Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR was carried out using the DNA Engine Opticon2™ (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and DyNAmo™ kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). For α1,4Gal-T, amplification of a 264-bp fragment (nucleotides 800-1063) in the cDNA (AI647273) was performed. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, amplification of a 224-bp fragment (nucleotides 471-694) in the cDNA (BC083065) was performed. Measurement of TNF-α and IL-1β—After injection of VT-2, mouse serum was obtained and used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using Mouse TNF-α or IL-1β immunoassay™ kits (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA). Generation of α1,4 Galactosyltransferase Knock-out Mice—After transfection of the targeting vector (Fig. 1A) and G418 selection, the obtained clones were Southern blotted. Of the 12 candidate homologous recombinants selected from the first screening, 9 clones were identified in the second screening (data not shown). Chimeric mice were generated by microinjection of three isolated clones, and heterozygotes were mated with each other to generate homozygotes. The results of Southern blotting and PCR genotyping are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Northern blotting revealed that α1,4Gal-T mRNA was completely absent (Fig. 1D). Loss of Gb3 Synthase Activity and Globo-series Glycolipids in α1,4Gal-T-/- Mice—We examined Gb3 synthase activity and globo-series glycolipids (Fig. 1F). Gb3 synthase activity in membrane fractions from kidney was reduced by ∼50% in α1,4Gal-T+/- mice compared with the wild type, with no activity observed in α1,4Gal-T-/- mice. TLC analysis revealed that the globo-series glycolipids were completely deleted in α1,4Gal-T-/- mice; ceramide monohexoside and ceramide dihexoside were observed to increase. Neutral glycolipids in mouse kidney were similar to those reported previously (15Sekine M. Yamakawa T. Suzuki A. J. Biochem. 1987; 101: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and TLC immunostaining confirmed that α1,4Gal-T-/- mice contained no Gb3. These mutant mice were born at ratios that followed Mendelian inheritance and grew up without apparent abnormalities over a year. Routine examinations revealed no apparent blood, serum, urine, or fecal disorders (data not shown). Immune Tissues and Antibody Levels in Gb3 Null Mutant Mice—A number of studies reported that a subset of immature B-cells expressed Gb3/CD77 and that they underwent apoptosis under certain conditions (3Gregory C.D. Dive C. Henderson S. Smith C.A. Williams G.T. Gordon J. Rickinson A.B. Nature. 1991; 349: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that this antigen is a functional molecule involved in B-cell differentiation. In this study, routine immunological analyses, such as counting the numbers of spleen cells and thymocytes, measurement of immunoglobulin levels, and ratios of lymphocyte populations or T-cell subsets, were performed and no apparent abnormalities were found (Table 1).TABLE 1Lymphocyte populations and serum antibody levels in Gb3 null mutant mice All analyses were carried out with 4-week-old female mice (n = 3). No significant differences between wild-type and Gb3 null mutant mice were found.OrganGenotype+/+–/–SpleenNo. of cells (× 108)0.96 ± 0.11.07 ± 0.11Population (%)B220+38.42 ± 5.9838.16 ± 4.12CD3+32.10 ± 3.4532.00 ± 1.88CD4+21.09 ± 4.6923.92 ± 4.86CD8+12.28 ± 2.811.41 ± 0.37ThymusNo. of cells (× 108)1.60 ± 0.081.58 ± 0.2Population (%)CD4+7.72 ± 1.087.15 ± 1.15CD8+2.69 ± 0.242.64 ± 1.43CD4+ CD8+83.57 ± 1.3286.92 ± 1.17CD4– CD8–6.72 ± 0.874.80 ± 1.79Serum Igs (mg/ml)IgG9.81 ± 0.667.81 ± 0.57IgM0.098 ± 0.020.097 ± 0.01IgA0.81 ± 0.040.83 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Sensitivity of Mutant Mice to VTs—Although a number of studies indicated that Gb3/CD77 was a receptor for VTs (16Lingwood C.A. Trends. Microbiol. 1996; 4: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and its possible roles in HUS, direct evidence for Gb3/CD77 being a target for VTs in vivo has never been demonstrated. To clarify whether tissue damage depends on Gb3 expression in vivo, responses of mice to VTs were examined. As expected, wild-type mice exhibited convulsions and shivering within 48 h and died 48-120 h after injection of more than 0.02 μg of VT-2 or 1 μg of VT-1. Conversely, α1,4Gal-T-/- mice exhibited no abnormal behavior and survived even after the injection of 2.0 μg of VT-2 or VT-1 (Table 2). Histological analysis of VT-2-treated mouse tissues revealed tissue damage in the brain cortex, proximal tubules, glomerulus, and liver in wild-type mice after VT-2 injection. Pathological changes in the brain cortex were observed from 24 h after VT-2 injection. In the cortex, extravasated erythrocytes, swelling of the endothelial cells (Fig. 2B, arrows), and edematous changes in cortical gray matter were observed at 48 h (Fig. 2, C-H). In the kidney, apparent changes were observed in proximal tubules and some glomeruli. A number of proximal tubules were observed to have sloughed epithelial cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and contained eosinophilic fluid (Fig. 2, J and L, arrows), indicating cell loss due to necrosis as reported previously (17Tesh V.L.

Maloney M.D. Lingwood C.A. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 832-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Several glomeruli were associated with segmental endocapillary congestion without fibrin and platelet thrombi and diminished numbers of endothelial cells (Fig. 2, N, arrows, and P). These changes were observed 24 h after VT-2 injection, increasing in extent to almost all glomeruli at 48 h. In the liver, microsteatosis of hepatocytes was observed 48 h after injection (data not shown). No morphological changes were observed in the α1,4Gal-T-/- mice.TABLE 2Motality of mice treated with VTs 2 to 0.002 μg of VT-2 or 2 to 0.01 μg of VT-1 were dissolved in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and intravenously injected into 10-15-week-old mice (20-25 g).

In the brain, Gb3 was expressed on the endothelial cells in the cortex (Fig. 3, B, D, and E, arrows) and the pia mater (Fig. 3C, arrowheads), with the intensity of antibody staining increasing slightly after VT-2 treatment (Fig. 3H). These staining patterns were very similar to that observed for CD31 (Fig. 3, F and G, white arrowheads), a marker of endothelial cells, indicating that Gb3 was expressed in some of the endothelial cells of the cortex. In the kidney, Gb3 was strongly expressed in the basilar regions of the proximal tubules (Fig. 3, J and L, arrowheads), with the intensity of antibody staining being slightly enhanced after VT-2 treatment (Fig. 3N). However, no such expression was observed in the glomerulus at all (Fig. 3, J and N, arrows). The regions that were positively stained in the tubules were considered to be capillaries, because they overlapped partly with the expression sites of CD31 (Fig. 3, K and M, arrowheads). Gb3 expression was undetectable in liver even after the VT-2 stimulus (data not shown). The Effects of LPS—VT preparations contain high amounts of LPS. Because it has been reported that LPS induced Gb3 expression via the induction of inflammatory cytokines (19Obrig T.G. Louise C.B. Lingwood C.A. Boyd B. Barley-Maloney L. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15484-15488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β after VT-2 administration (Fig. 4, A and B). Both cytokines showed increased serum levels. Real-time PCR also showed up-regulation of α1,4Gal-T mRNA in various tissues (Fig. 4C) as well as an increased intensity in antibody staining. However, no apparent changes were observed in the survival times of mice administered 0.2 μg of VT-2 (contaminated with LPS) or 0.2 μg of purified-VT-2 (LPS-free) (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Survival times of mice treated with VT-2. To analyze the effects of LPS in the crude VT-2 preparation, mice were treated with crude and purified VT-2 (LPS-free). Filled and open circles represent crude or purified (LPS-free) VT-2 (0.2 μg) preparations, respectively. The crude preparations contained 10 μg of LPS. n = 12 (LPS-free VT-2) or 6 (others). Data were analyzed with the Student's unpaired t-test. No significant differences could be found in the results between crude and LPS-free VT-2 preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As expected, targeted disruption of the Gb3 synthase gene resulted in complete loss of the mRNA, Gb3 synthase activity, and all glycolipids belonging to the globo-series in the tissues examined. These results indicated that the targeted gene is the only gene coding Gb3 synthase. This mutant mouse line appeared useful for functional analysis of globo-series glycolipids in vivo and also for the expression analysis of glycolipids that are synthesized through the synthesis of Gb3 in murine tissues and organs. As shown in Table 1, there are no clear abnormalities in lymphocyte populations and subsets in spleen and thymus. Immunoglobulin levels were also equivalent between wild type and the null mutants. However, implication of Gb3/CD77 in the immune responses to various antigens remains to be investigated. Although brainiac gene is involved in the synthesis of glycolipids in Drosophila, the finding that null mutant mice showed no definite morphological or functional changes during their development was surprising (20Wandall H.H. Pizette S. Pedersen J.W. Eichert H. Levery S.B. Mandel U. Cohen S.M. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4858-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and it is likely that the remaining glycolipid structures might compensate the functions of globo-series glycolipids. A number of studies have indicated that Gb3 and its derivatives may be involved in various biological events such as clonal selection and differentiation of B lymphocytes, apoptosis, bacterial adhesion, viral invasion, and many other physiological processes. Therefore, we expect that these mutant mice possess potential defects particularly in the humoral immunity, although they are not overt at this moment. However, extensive studies and long-term observation are needed to elucidate the biological importance of Gb3 and its derivatives, and we are now further investigating these mutant mice for physiological defects. Numerous studies showing that Gb3 is a receptor for VTs have been conducted using cultured cells, and it has been proposed that other carbohydrate-containing molecules such as N-glycans (4Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) or other alternative receptors (21Devenish J. Gyles C. LaMarre J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 28-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may also be able to receive VT signals. The findings of this study revealed that mice lacking functional Gb3 synthase gene appear to be completely insensitive to VTs, with neither clinical signs nor pathological changes found in the null mutant mice. These results clearly indicated that Gb3/CD77 (including its derivatives) is the only structure that plays a role as a receptor for VTs. It was reported that the P1 antigen might also be a receptor for VTs (4Jacewicz M. Clausen H. Nudelman E. Donohue-Rolfe A. Keusch G.T. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the P1 antigen is also a product of Gb3/CD77 synthase (22Iwamura K. Furukawa K. Uchikawa M. Sojka B.N. Kojima Y. Wiels J. Shiku H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44429-44438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and consequently the null mutant mouse is expected to lack the P1 antigen. However, because no cells expressing only the P1 antigen (not Gb3/CD77) are currently available, it seems very difficult to confirm that P1 acts as a receptor for VTs. It can therefore be concluded that only Gb3/CD77 synthase products act as receptors for VTs. As for gangliosides, it is well known that GT1b/GD1b are receptors for botulinum toxins and/or tetanus toxins (23Lalli G. Bohnert S. Deinhardt K. Verastegui C. Schiavo G. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and this has been confirmed using complex ganglioside-lacking mice (24Kitamura M. Takamiya K. Aizawa S. Furukawa K. Furukawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which were relatively resistant to the injected toxins. However, the fact that the mice finally died suggested that coreceptors for individual toxins were present (23Lalli G. Bohnert S. Deinhardt K. Verastegui C. Schiavo G. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Conversely, VT-injected null mutant mice survived for more than six months without exhibiting any disorders. Consequently, the finding that Gb3/CD77 behaved as the sole receptor for VTs was thus relatively unique. Because mutant mice were observed to be perfect negative controls in immunohistochemistry, it was possible to distinguish minimal expression of Gb3/CD77 from the background and confirm that the main targets of VTs in tissue damage were Gb3/CD77 on endothelial cells in restricted regions (10Boyd B. Lingwood C. Nephron. 1989; 51: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Zoja C. Corna D. Farina C. Sacchi G. Lingwood C. Doyle M.P. Padhye V.V. Abbate M. Remuzzi G. J. Lab. Clin.

Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 832-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) tissues, with some ambiguity observed in the precise localization thereof. In our study, definite expression of Gb3/CD77 was observed in the microvascular endothelial cells of the brain cortex and pia mater and the capillary vascular endothelial cells surrounding renal tubules and glomeruli, as well as lumenal side of the proximal tubules. Actually, pathological changes observed shortly after VT administration occurred in these regions, suggesting that initial VT target sites are endothelial cells expressing Gb3/CD77. Pathological changes detected at relatively later phases in the glomeruli and liver appeared to be because of circulation disturbances caused by primary disruption of the endothelial cells. Interestingly, damage in liver was observed immediately before death, suggesting that the liver damage was not a direct consequence of VT-2 but rather that it occurred secondary to systemic damage. Implication of vascular endothelial cells in the brain damage under HUS has been also been considered (9Tzipori S. Chow C.W. Powell H.R. J. Clin. Pathol. 1988; 41: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Ren J. Utsunomiya I. Taguchi K. Ariga T. Tai T. Ihara Y. Miyatake T. Brain Res. 1999; 825: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Colocalization of Gb3/CD77 and CD31 and accordance of their expression sites and pathological changes in brain cortex in VT-injected mice strongly supported the idea that endothelial cells are the primary targeting sites of VTs in the brain. These findings should explain the neurological signs and unconsciousness episodes observed in HUS. Because it was reported that LPS and inflammatory cytokines induced Gb3/CD77 expression on some endothelial cells (19Obrig T.G. Louise C.B. Lingwood C.A. Boyd B. Barley-Maloney L. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15484-15488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it may be possible that they potentiate VT cytopathology (30van de Kar N.C. Monnens L.A. Karmali M.A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Blood. 1992; 80: 2755-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of LPS on VT toxicity depend on when it is administered (31Barrett T.J. Potter M.E. Wachsmuth I.K. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3434-3437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the mouse strains used and tissue origins of endothelial cells are also critical for the assessment of LPS effects (10Boyd B. Lingwood C. Nephron. 1989; 51: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Barrett T.J. Potter M.E. Wachsmuth I.K. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3434-3437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our results, the α1,4Gal-T gene might be induced by LPS via cytokine induction, but it scarcely affected the sensitivity to VTs. Specifically, the roles of LPS/cytokines in inducing Gb3/CD77 expression may not be a major cause underlying tissue damage in vivo. Consequently, basal levels of Gb3/CD77 expressed on vascular endothelial cells in non-treated mice should be sufficient to cause tissue damage and induce lethal toxicity. One explanation for the lack of any observable difference between crude and LPS-eliminated VT-2 preparations in our experiment was that the injected VT2 may have been cleared from the blood before sufficient Gb3/CD77 was induced by LPS. The data obtained with the null mutant mice are useful as they clearly infer the presence of targets for protection against the toxic effects of VTs. Although apoptotic pathways mediated by Gb3/CD77 may be heterogenous (32Tetaud C. Falguieres T. Carlier K. Lecluse Y. Garibal J. Coulaud D. Busson P. Steffensen R. Clausen H. Johannes L. Wiels J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45200-45208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), efforts to combat HUS should focus on inhibiting the interaction between VTs and Gb3/CD77.

https://openalex.org/W2097844867,"The current study demonstrates a novel cross-talk mechanism between the TRAIL receptor death signaling pathway and the mitochondria. This newly identified pathway is regulated at the mitochondrial outer membrane by a complex between the prosurvival Bcl-2 member, Mcl-1 and the BH3-only protein, Bim. Under non-apoptotic conditions, Bim is sequestered by Mcl-1. Direct degradation of Mcl-1 by TRAIL-activated caspase-8 or caspase-3 produces Mcl-1-free Bim that mediates a Bax-dependent apoptotic cascade. Using Mcl-1 or Bim RNAi, we demonstrate that a loss in Mcl-1 expression significantly enhances the mitochondrial apoptotic response to TRAIL that is now mediated by freed Bim. Whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 contributes to the preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, Mcl-1 knockdown facilitates the Bim-mediated dissipation of this potential. Loss of Mcl-1 contributes to an increased level of caspase activity downstream of the mitochondrial response to TRAIL. Furthermore, the Mcl-1 expression level at the mitochondrial outer membrane determines the release efficiency for the apoptogenic proteins cytochrome c, Smac, and HtrA2 in response to Bim. These are the first findings to demonstrate the involvement of Bim in the TRAIL-mediated mitochondrial cascade. They also suggest that Mcl-1 may serve as a direct substrate for TRAIL-activated caspases implying the existence of a novel TRAIL/caspase-8/Mcl-1/Bim communication mechanism between the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways.

Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In certain types of cells, referred to as type II, effector caspase activation requires amplification of the apoptotic signal mediated by the death-inducing signaling complex through engagement of the intrinsic cell (mitochondrial) signaling pathway (2LeBlanc H.

Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The cross-talk between these two prototypical pathways is partly mediated by caspase-8-truncated Bid (tBid) (4Broaddus V.C. Dansen T.B. Abayasiriwardana K.S. Wilson S.M. Finch A.J. Swigart L.B.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3075) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic fragment of Bid translocates to the mitochondria where it activates Bax and thereby induces the release of the apoptogenic proteins, cytochrome c, AIF, endonuclease G, Smac, and HtrA2 (7Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 8Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Once released into the cytoplasm, cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form the “apoptosome” that serves to further activate caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 and -7 downstream of mitochondrial apoptotic events. Released Smac and HtrA2 bind to members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein family, and thereby prevent IAP inhibition of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (9Shiozaki E.N. Shi Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 486-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat Rev Mol. Cell.

The requirement for Bax in TRAIL-induced apoptosis of type II cells has been mapped to the mitochondrial amplification cycle (2LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J. Schow P. Fong S. Schwall R. Sinicropi D. Ashkenazi A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 12Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X.

Early events triggered by TRAIL, including DISC formation, caspase-8 activation, and Bid cleavage are not dependent on Bax; however, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 were prevented in Bax-deficient cells. The BH3-only protein Bid is currently the only known link between the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways mediated by TRAIL. Recently, we identified a novel mitochondrial apoptotic cascade that is initiated by the degradation of Mcl-1 and proceeds through the disruption of the Mcl-1·Bim complex (14Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinovitz A. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16383-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, degradation of Mcl-1 by either granzyme B or caspase-3 relieves Bim, a high affinity Mcl-1 binding partner, from sequestration and neutralization of its activity. In the current study, we investigated the possibility that the mitochondrial Mcl-1·Bim complex serves as an additional link between the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways activated by TRAIL. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that Bim is involved in the mitochondrial response to TRAIL and suggest that Mcl-1 and Bim are functionally linked in the cell response to TRAIL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 serves to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential that is disrupted by the presence of Mcl-1-free Bim, leading to the release of apoptogenic proteins. Thus, our studies imply the existence of a cross-talk mechanism between the TRAIL death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade that has not been previously considered.

Cell Lines, Cell Lysates, and Cell Extracts—HeLa, breast carcinoma CAMA-1, and colon cancer Hct116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. To prepare cell extracts for caspase-3 or caspase-8 reactions, cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells (2.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular extracts were obtained as the supernatants resulting from centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. In Vitro Cleavage Reaction with Caspase-3 or Caspase-8—In vitro cleavage reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl.

Each reaction also contained 1 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Mcl-1 and also reticulocyte lysate minus plasmid in the presence or the absence of recombinant caspase-3 or -8 (5-100 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C.

All single substitution Asp to Ala mutant cDNA clones (D72A, D127A, and D157A) were produced from a wild-type (WT) Mcl-1 cDNA clone by overlap extension using PCR (14Han J. Goldstein L.A.

Single point mutations (GAC→GCC) were introduced by mutated forward and reverse primers that overlap the specific Asp residue that was changed to Ala. The primer pairs (forward and reverse) used were: D72A, 5′-CTCACGCCAGCCTCCCGGAGGGTCGCGCGGCCG-3′ and 5′-CCTCCGGGAGGCTGGCGTGAGGGTGGACGGGGG-3′; D127A, 5′-GAGGAGCTGGCCGGGTACGAGCCGGAGCCTCTC-3′ and CTCGTACCCGGCCAGCTCCTCTTCGGGCGACAT-3′; D157A, 5′-ACCAGTACGGCCGGGTCACTACCCTCGACGCCG-3′ and 5′-TAGTGACCCGGCCGTACTGGTGTTATTACCAGATTC-3′. PCR was carried out using the Expand Long Template PCR System kit (Roche Applied Science). Mutated PCR amplicons were gel-purified and subcloned into the vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) as previously described (14Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol.

All Asp to Ala conversions were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis (University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Core Facility) of randomly selected clones. In Vitro Transcription-Translation—WT and mutated Mcl-1 cDNAs were expressed in the TnT T7 transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 1 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 μl in a methionine-free reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture supplemented with 35S-labeled methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction products were immediately used or stored at -70 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins in cell lysates, cell extracts, mitochondria, or S-100 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as previously described (17Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Protein bands were quantified by Molecular Dynamics Densitometer SI and the ImageQuaNT software. Mcl-1, Bim, and Caspase-3 RNAi—Short interfering RNAs for Mcl-1 and Bim were obtained as duplexes in purified and desalted form (Option C) from Dharmacon. The two siRNAs had the following sense strand sequences: Mcl-1-5′-GAAACGCGGUAAUCGGACUdTdT-3′; Bim-5′-GACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUUGdTdT-3′. Human caspase-3 siRNA was obtained as the siGENOME SMARTpool reagent (M-0004307-01-0005, Dharmacon). The non-targeting siRNA control for Mcl-1, Bim, and caspase-3 siRNAs was also obtained from Dharmacon (siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #1) with the sense strand sequence 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU-3′. CAMA-1 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in a 6-well plate, and following 24 h (at ∼30% confluency) were transfected with 200 nm siRNA in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) without fetal calf serum using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's transfection protocol. After 4 h, fetal calf serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. At 40 h, the medium over the cells was adjusted to 1 ml before the addition of an apoptotic agent. Mcl-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was generated using the siSTRIKE U6 Hairpin Cloning System (Promega). The Mcl-1 siRNA sequence used above was included in the following sense and antisense oligonucleotides: 5′-ACCGAAACGCGGTAATCGGACTCTTCCTGTCAAGTCCGATTACCGCGTTTCTTTTTC-3′ and 5′-TGCAGAAAAAGAAACGCGGTAATCGGACTTGACAGGAAGAGTCCGATTACCGCGTTT-3′. Sense and antisense strands were annealed and ligated into the linearized psiSTRIKE Neomycin Vector following the manufacturer's directions. Sequence analysis of transformed randomly picked clones (University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Core Facility) confirmed the sequence integrity of the Mcl-1 shRNA plasmids. Stable Transfection—Hct116 or HeLa cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in electroporation buffer (AMAXA) at a final concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml. 5 μg of linearized Mcl-1 plasmid, linearized pCR3.1 vector, or linearized Mcl-1 shRNA plasmid were mixed with 0.1 ml of cell suspension, transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette, and nucleofected with an Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) utilizing the appropriate program according to the manufacturer's directions. Geneticin-resistant cell lines were grown in the presence of G418 (1500 μg/ml). Geneticin-resistant clonal cell lines expressing either Mcl-1 or Mcl-1 shRNA were generated by dakocytomation (1 cell/well) utilizing a MOFLO high speed cell sorter and Summit Software. Flow Cytometry—Cytofluorometric analyses of apoptosis were performed by costaining with propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V conjugates (Becton Dickenson). Activity of caspase-3 and -8 was assessed with the caspase-specific Vybrant-FAM substrates from Molecular Probes. Mitochondrial depolarization was measured with the MitoProbe JC-1 and DiCl1 (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3781) Google Scholar) from Molecular Probes. The staining was performed according to the manufacturer's procedures, assessed by a Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL and analyzed with the EXPO32 software. Mitochondria Purification—To obtain an enriched mitochondrial fraction, HeLa cells were suspended in mitochondrial buffer (MIB) composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization as previously described (14Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 650 × g, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by two successive spins at 10,000 × g for 12 min. To obtain the S-100 fraction, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. To obtain the enriched mitochondrial fraction, the mitochondria-containing pellet was resuspended in MIB and layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of four layers of 10%, 18%, 30%, and 70% Percoll in MIB. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, the mitochondrial fraction was collected at the 30/70 interface. Mitochondria were diluted in MIB containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (at least a 10-fold dilution required to remove Percoll). The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by a 40-min spin at 20,000 × g and used immediately. Purity was assessed by electron microscopy and by enzyme marker analysis (18Matsko C.M. Hunter O.C. Rabinowich H. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For enzyme analysis, the following enzymes were assayed: aryl sulfatase (lysosomes/granules); N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, α-l-fucosidase, and β-glucoronidase (lysosome); lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol); cytochrome oxidase; or monoamine oxidase (mitochondria); thiamine pyrophosphatase (Golgi); NADH oxidase (endoplasmic reticulum); dipeptidyl peptidase IV (plasma membrane). The purity was assessed at 95%, with ∼5% or less contamination from the microsomal fraction. Release of Mitochondrial Apoptogenic Proteins—Purified mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were incubated with various doses of His-BimL in 25 μl of MIB at 37 °C for 30 min. Generation of His-BimL has been previously described (14Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants or mitochondria were mixed with SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, cytochrome c, Smac, and HtrA2. Involvement of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 Activity in the Down-regulation of Mcl-1 during TRAIL-mediated Apoptosis—To investigate a potential role for Mcl-1 in the mitochondrial response to TRAIL, we assessed its expression in lysates of tumor cell lines treated with TRAIL. Consistent with recent observations (19Weng C. Li Y. Xu D. Shi Y. Tang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10491-10500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Taniai M.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3517-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), TRAIL induced a significant Mcl-1 degradation in multiple tumor cell lines, including HCT116 (Fig. 1A), CAMA-1, HeLa, and Jurkat. Mcl-1 degradation was accompanied by the processing of caspase-8 and caspase-3 that were blocked in the presence of the potent caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In the presence of this caspase inhibitor, neither a TRAIL-mediated loss in the level of Mcl-1 was detected nor was there cleavage of caspase-8. A certain level of p20 caspase-3 was detected in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK, but as the inhibitor binds to this fragment of caspase-3, no further processing of the p20 caspase-3 subunit to its p19 or p17 active forms was detected (Fig. 1A). Recent reports by us (14Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7863-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Clohessy J.G. Zhuang J. Brady H.J. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 125: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Mcl-1 serves as a substrate for caspase-3, but its potential cleavage by caspase-8 has not yet been examined. In the TRAIL-mediated apoptotic cascade, activation of caspase-8 is mainly upstream of caspase-3. Because the potential cleavage of Mcl-1 by caspase-8 may serve as a new cross-talk mechanism between the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways, we examined the possibility that Mcl-1 also serves as a substrate for caspase-8. For this purpose, we added recombinant caspase-3 and recombinant caspase-8 into Hct116 cell extracts and assessed by immunoblotting changes in the levels of Mcl-1. In the presence of either caspase-3 or caspase-8 Mcl-1 was cleaved, generating fragments that exhibit similar migration patterns on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). To confirm that Mcl-1 was cleaved directly by caspase-8, rather than by an unknown endogenous caspase-activated protease(s), we tested for the ability of recombinant caspase-3 or recombinant caspase-8 to directly cleave 35S-labeled in vitro translated Mcl-1 (Fig. 2A). As assessed by autoradiography, a similar pattern of cleavage was generated by the two recombinant caspases. We previously mapped the caspase-3 cleavage sites to aspartic acid residues 127 and 157 of Mcl-1 (15Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinovitz A. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16383-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To map the caspase-8 cleavage sites in Mcl-1, we utilized mutant Mcl-1 plasmids that possess single residue conversions of aspartic acid to alanine, including D72A, D127A, D157A, or a mutant for both residues 127 and 157. The mutated Mcl-1 plasmids were transcribed and translated by an in vitro system, and the products were treated with recombinant caspase-3 or caspase-8 (Fig. 2B). As determined by autoradiography, Mcl-1 cleavage by caspase-8 was mapped to the same aspartic acid residues, 127 and 157, as the cleavage by caspase-3. The double mutant for aspartic acid residues 127 and 157 was resistant to cleavage by each of these caspases. To further examine the possibility that Mcl-1 cleavage takes place in the absence of caspase-3, we used RNAi to knockdown the expression of caspase-3 in Hct116 and CAMA-1 tumor cell lines. Despite a significant knockdown of caspase-3 in each of these cell lines, treatment with TRAIL induced Mcl-1 cleavage in association with caspase-8 activation (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, in Hct116 cells, increased TRAIL-induced activity of caspase-8 was detected in the absence of caspase-3 as compared with control siRNA cells.FIGURE 2Caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleave Mcl-1 at similar sites. A, similar cleavage pattern is produced by caspase-3 and caspase-8 when added to in vitro translated Mcl-1. 35S-labeled in vitro translated Mcl-1 was incubated with caspase-3 or caspase-8 (100 nm each) for the indicated time periods. The reaction products were then assessed by autoradiography for the presence of 35S-labeled cleavage products. B, Mcl-1 cleavage by caspase-8 maps to the same sites, Asp-127 and Asp-157, as those cleaved by caspase-3. 35S-labeled in vitro translated Mcl-1 products, including WT and the indicated mutants were treated with caspase-3 or caspase-8 (100 nm each at 37 °C for 20 min). The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The numbered arrows identify the fragments produced by the protease digestion (15Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R.

The Bax knock-out cells have been shown to be TRAIL-resistant because of Bax deficiency, despite caspase-8 activation in response to TRAIL (2LeBlanc H. Lawrence D. Varfolomeev E. Totpal K. Morlan J.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In agreement with the previous reports, no Annexin V-positive cells were detected in Bax knock-out cells; these cells were independent of the reaction kinetics or the dose of TRAIL utilized (Fig. 3C). However, TRAIL treatment of these isogenic cell lines resulted in Mcl-1 cleavage in association with caspase-8 activation (Fig. 3D). As expected, caspase-3 and -7 were activated in Hct116 Bax+/-, but not in Bax-/- cells, where mitochondrial involvement is blocked (Fig. 3D). In Bax-/- cells, caspase-3 is processed down to the p20 subunit, but as reported previously, activation of this subunit requires mitochondrial involvement, particularly the release of Smac (12Deng Y.

The data obtained with saturation binding assays and structural analyses delineated the key interactions responsible for the binding of CCR5 inhibitors with CCR5 and illustrated that their binding site is located in a predominantly lipophilic pocket in the interface of extracellular loops and within the upper transmembrane (TM) domain of CCR5. Mutations in the CCR5 binding sites of AVC decreased gp120 binding to CCR5 and the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, although mutations in TM4 and TM5 that also decreased gp120 binding and HIV-1 infectivity had less effects on the binding of CC-chemokines, suggesting that CCR5 inhibition targeting appropriate regions might render the inhibition highly HIV-1-specific while preserving the CC chemokine-CCR5 interactions. The present data delineating residue by residue interactions of CCR5 with CCR5 inhibitors should not only help design more potent and more HIV-1-specific CCR5 inhibitors, but also give new insights into the dynamics of CC-chemokine-CCR5 interactions and the mechanisms of CCR5 involvement in the process of cellular entry of HIV-1.

Highly active antiretroviral therapy has brought about a major impact on the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemics in industrially advanced nations (1Fauci A.S. Nat.

Successful antiviral drugs, in theory, exert their virus-specific effects by interacting with viral components such as viral genes or their transcripts without disturbing cellular metabolisms or functions (2Mitsuya H. Erickson J. Merigan T.C. Bartlet J.G. Bolognesi D. Textbook of AIDS Medicine. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 751-780Google Scholar). However, at present, no antiretroviral drugs or agents have been demonstrated to be completely specific for HIV-1 and devoid of toxicity or side effects in the therapy of AIDS (4Richman D.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Limitations of antiviral therapy of AIDS are exacerbated by complicated regimens, emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (1Fauci A.S. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and a number of inherent adverse effects (5Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-infected Adults and Adolescents. 2005; Google Scholar). Thus, identification of new antiretroviral drugs that have unique mechanisms of action and produce no or least minimal side effects remains an important therapeutic objective (2Mitsuya H. Erickson J.

Aplaviroc (AVC; AK602/ONO4128/873140; Fig. 1), a novel spirodike-topiperazine derivative, represents a CCR5 inhibitor that specifically binds to human CCR5 with a high affinity, greatly blocks HIV-1-gp120/CCR5 binding, and exerts potent activity against a wide spectrum of laboratory and primary R5-HIV-1 isolates including multidrug-resistant HIV-1MDR (IC50 values of 0.2-0.6 nm) (11Maeda K.

AVC, despite its much greater anti-HIV-1 activity than other previously published CCR5 inhibitors including TAK-779 and SCH-C (Fig. 1), preserves RANTES and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β binding to CCR5+ cells and their functions, whereas TAK-779 and SCH-C fully block the CC-chemokines/CCR5 interactions (11Maeda K.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled short-term monotherapy trial in patients with AIDS including those who were drug-experienced, AVC demonstrated potent antiretroviral activity and brought about significant reduction in HIV-1 viremia (by ∼1.7 log) in AIDS patients (38Lalezari J.

In the present study, we examined the profile of binding to and interactions with CCR5 of three CCR5 inhibitors, AVC, SCH-C, and TAK-779. We also conducted structural analyses of the interactions of CCR5 inhibitors with CCR5, using homology modeling, robust structure refinement, and docking. Notably, the molecular modeling analyses were combined and fine-tuned with the results of the saturation binding assay using a panel of mutant CCR5-expressing cells and [3H]CCR5 inhibitors and the resultant configurations and orientations of inhibitors docked within the hydrophobic cavity of CCR5 yielded structure-activity predictions and interpretations consistent with the observed experimental data. The present approach of combining the site-directed mutagenesis-based data and molecular modeling should represent a valuable strategy for gaining structural insights for membrane-bound proteins for which x-ray crystal structures are not as yet available. The present data delineating residue by residue interactions of CCR5 with CCR5 inhibitors should not only help design more potent and more HIV-1-specific CCR5 inhibitors, but also give new insights into the dynamics of CC-chemokine-CCR5 interactions and the mechanisms of CCR5 involvement in the process of cellular entry of HIV-1.

The HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-galactosidase indicator cell line expressing human CCR5 (CCR5+MAGI (multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator) cells) (18Maeda Y. Foda M. Matsushita S. Harada S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1787-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Yosuke Maeda, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan. CCR5+MAGI cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 200 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 100 μg/ml zeomycin. The U373-MAGI cell line was obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). U373-MAGI cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 200 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. An R5-HIV-1 strain, HIV-1BaL, was employed for the determination of the susceptibility of mutant CCR5 (CCR5MT)-expressing cells to the infectivity of HIV-1. Generation of Wild-type and CCR5MT-overexpressing Cells—A mammalian expression vector pZeoSV2 (Invitrogen) carrying the human wild-type CCR5 (CCR5WT) gene (pZeoSV-CCR5) (18Maeda Y. Foda M.

A variety of plasmids carrying a mutant CCR5-encoding gene were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis technique employing the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Mutations introduced into the CCR5 gene were introduced through: (i) substitution of an amino acid(s) or (ii) deletion of an amino acid(s) at selected amino acid positions of CCR5. A mutation from Gly to Arg at position 163, where the corresponding amino acid in simian CCR5 is Arg, was also introduced. This G163R substitution has been reported to reduce the binding of R5-HIV-1-gp120 to human CCR5 and the susceptibility to HIV-1 (19Siciliano S.J. Kuhmann S.E. Weng Y. Madani N. Springer M.S.

All these plasmids were confirmed to contain only the desired mutation(s) by nucleotide sequencing. CHO cells (or U373-MAGI cells) were transfected with a plasmid containing the CCR5WT-encoding gene or a plasmid carrying a CCR5MT-encoding gene using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen); the transfectants were magnetically sorted, following treatment with an anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody (2D7 or 3A9; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), using Dynabeads M-450 coupled to goat anti-mouse IgG (Dynal A.S., Oslo, Norway); and the cells were cloned using the limiting dilution technique. Determination of CCR5 Expression Levels in CHO and U373-MAGI Cells—CCR5 expression levels of the various clones described above were determined using three indicators: (i) maximal amounts of [3H]AVC bound to cells (Bmax); (ii) mean florescence intensity values when stained with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3A9; and (iii) mean florescence intensity values when stained with mAb 2D7. The antigenic epitope for 2D7 is located distant from that for 3A9 (20Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J. Samson M. Parmentier M. Moore J.P. Mackay C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1373-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and 3A9 does not compete with AVC binding to CCR5 (data not shown). The expression levels were expressed as % control (CCR5WT-expressing cells as control), and the highest value obtained was chosen as the estimated CCR5 expression level. There were no clones that had low values in all three indicators, thus sustaining that the current method used for the CCR5 expression levels was thought to be legitimate. CD4 and CCR5 expression levels were also determined using the quantitative fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay system (Quantum Simply Cellular Kit; Sigma) using 3A9 and 2D7 (12Nakata H. Maeda K. Miyakawa T. Shibayama S. Matsuo M. Takaoka Y. Ito M. Koyanagi Y. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2087-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For the HIV-1 susceptibility assay, U373-MAGI clones that expressed CD4 molecules ranging 10-25 × 104 antigen-binding sites were selected. CCR5MT-expressing CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FCS and 100 μg/ml zeomycin. CCR5WT- and CCR5MT-expressing U373-MAGI cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 200 μg/ml G418, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 100 μg/ml zeomycin. Saturation Binding Assay Using 3H-Labeled CCR5 Inhibitors—Saturation binding assay using 3H-labeled CCR5 inhibitors was conducted and the KD values of CCR5 inhibitors in CCR5WT-, or CCR5MT-expressing CHO cells were calculated as previously described (11Maeda K. Nakata H. Koh Y. Miyakawa T. Ogata H. Takaoka Y. Shibayama S. Sagawa K. Fukushima D. Moravek J. Koyanagi Y. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8654-8662Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Inhibitor Binding/Competition Studies—CCR5WT-expressing cells (1.5 × 105) were plated onto 48-well microculture plates, incubated for 24 h, rinsed, exposed to [3H]AVC, [3H]SCH-C, or [3H]TAK-779 for 15 min at room temperature, subsequently exposed to various concentrations of unlabeled CCR5 inhibitors, incubated for 30 min, thoroughly washed, lysed, and the radioactivity in the lysates was counted. All experiments were performed in duplicate. The amounts of each 3H-labeled CCR5 inhibitor bound to the cells are shown as mean % control values. Standard deviation values are indicated with the vertical lines. To obtain control values, the experiment was also performed without the addition of unlabeled CCR5 inhibitors. Determination of CC-chemokine- and HIV-1 Gp120 Binding Affinity to CCR5WT and CCR5MT—Binding profiles of chemokines to CCR5WT- or CCR5MT-expressing cells were determined using 125I-labeled chemokines as previously reported (11Maeda K. Nakata H. Koh Y. Miyakawa T. Ogata H. Takaoka Y. Shibayama S. Sagawa K. Fukushima D. Moravek J. Koyanagi Y. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8654-8662Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, CCR5WT- or CCR5MT-expressing cells (1.5 × 105) were plated onto 48-well microculture plates, incubated for 24 h, rinsed, exposed to 5 nm 125I-MIP-1α, 125I-MIP-1β, or 125I-RANTES at room temperature for 1 h, thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH, and the radioactivity in the lysates counted. The nonspecific binding of the labeled chemokine to the cells was determined based on the radioactivity detected in the wells plated with the same number of CCR5-negative CHO (CHO-K1) cells exposed to an equal amount of 125I-labeled chemokine. Determination of the binding profiles of HIV-1-rgp120 to CCR5WT or CCR5MT was also conducted. Briefly, CCR5+CHO cells were exposed to rgp120 (5 μg/ml) and sCD4 (5 μg/ml: biotinylated using EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce)) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and binding of the rgp120-sCD4 complex to CCR5+CHO cells was determined using phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SA-PE: BD Pharmingen). Nonspecific binding was determined based on the mean florescence intensity of SA-PE with sCD4 but without rgp120. Because CCR5 expression levels vary among CCR5 clones, the % binding (occupancy) values for 125I-chemokines and rgp120 were normalized using the following formula: % binding (occupancy) = 100 × (amount of 125I-chemokine or rgp120 bound to CCR5MT/amount of 125I-chemokine or rgp120 bound to CCR5WT) × (number of CCR5WT/number of CCR5MT), where numbers of CCR5WT and CCR5MT are expressed as Bmax (cpm) or mean florescence intensity values as described above. Determination of HIV-1 Susceptibility of CCR5WT- and CCR5MT-expressing Cells—The susceptibility of CCR5WT- and CCR5MT-expressing cells to the infection by an R5-HIV-1 strain, HIV-1BaL, was determined as previously described (22Maeda Y. Venzon D.J. Mitsuya H. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In brief, target cells (CCR5WT- or CCR5MT-expressing U373-MAGI cells; 104/well) were plated onto 96-well flat microtiter culture plates, inoculated with 100 TCID50 of HIV-1BaL on the following day, cultured for 48-72 h, stained with 400 μg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), and all blue cells were counted. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For testing each CCR5MT-expressing cell preparation, multiple (5 to 13) clones were examined. In each set of experiments, CCR5WT-clone 1 was included and served as a standard. Percent infection in CCR5WT- and CCR5MT-expressing cells was determined using the following formula: % Infection = 100 × (mean blue cell number in a well)/(mean blue cell number in a well of CCR5WT-clone 1). Structural Modeling of the Interactions of CCR5 Inhibitors with Wild-type and Mutant CCR5 Species—An initial structural model of CCR5 was defined with homology modeling using the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin as a template (23Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). This resulted in the initial placement of the helices and side chains. The CCR5-inhibitor complex structures were defined with an iterative optimization of CCR5 and inhibitor structures in the presence of each other, using software tools from Schrödinger (Schrödinger, LLC, New York), as described below. The conformational flexibility of both CCR5 and the inhibitors were taken into account. The molecular structures of AVC, SCH-C, and TAK-779, without the presence of counter-ions and solvents, were obtained by minimization using the MMFF94 force field (24Halgren T.A. Murphy R.B. Friesner R.A. Beard H.S. Frye L.L. Pollard W.T. Banks J.L. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). For each minimized inhibitor configuration, a set of low energy structures was generated by performing a Monte Carlo sampling of their conformations. Thus obtained structures were used as starting structures for docking calculations where their conformations were further refined. The protonation states of CCR5 residues were assigned, and residues more than 20 Å from the active site were neutralized. In an attempt to place an inhibitor within CCR5, initially the active site was artificially enlarged by mutating Tyr108, Cys178, Glu283, and Met287 to Ala. The van der Waals radii of inhibitor atoms were scaled by a factor of 0.70 to reduce steric clashes and docked into CCR5. After obtaining an initial set of CCR5-inhibitor complexes, residues 108, 178, 283, and 287 were mutated back from Ala to their original states. CCR5 atoms within 15 Å of an initially placed inhibitor were subsequently refined. It was achieved by using the rotamer library of Xiang and Honig (25Xiang Z. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and optimizing each side chain one at a time holding all other side chains fixed. After convergence, all side chains were simultaneously energy minimized using the OPLS-AA force field (26Kaminski G.A. Friesner R.A. Tirado-Rives J. Jorgensen W.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 6474-6487Crossref Scopus (3224) Google Scholar) to remove any remaining clashes. The inhibitors were docked again and scored to estimate their relative affinity. The docked complexes with higher scores were visually examined along with the mutational data to select the best possible CCR5-inhibitor complex. Mutated CCR5 structures were defined using the wild-type CCR5 structure and optimized using the OPLS2003 force field. Charges were taken from the force field. The minimization was carried out until the gradient was below 0.2 kJ/Å-mol. Resulting minimized structures were used as starting structures for obtaining docked complexes of mutated CCR5 with inhibitors using the protocol described above. Visualization, structural refinement, and docking were performed using Maestro 7.0, MacroModel 9.0, Prime 1.2, Glide 3.5, and IFD script from Schrödinger, LLC (New York). The extra precision mode of Glide, which has higher penalties for unfavorable and unphysical interactions, was used (27Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6462) Google Scholar). Computations were carried out on a multiprocessor SGI Origin 3400 computer platform. A probe radius of 1.4 Å with Connolly surfaces generated was used to define binding site cavities using the method of Exner et al. (28Exner T.E. Keil M. Moeckel G. Brickmann J. J. Mol. Model. 1998; 4: 340-343Crossref Google Scholar) as implemented in the MOLCAD tool in Sybyl 7.0 (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Lipophilic potential was mapped onto the cavities using parameters from Viswanadhan et al. (29Viswanadhan V.N. Ghose A.K. Revankar G.R. Robins R.K. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1989; 29: 163-172Crossref Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of CCR5 and Binding Affinity of CCR5 Inhibitors—We have previously reported (11Maeda K. Nakata H. Koh Y. Miyakawa T. Ogata H. Takaoka Y. Shibayama S. Sagawa K. Fukushima D. Moravek J. Koyanagi Y. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8654-8662Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that AVC competitively blocked the binding of a monoclonal antibody, 45531, which is known to be specific against the C-terminal half (or domain B) of the second extracellular loop (ECL2B) of CCR5 (21Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), whereas AVC failed to block or only partially blocked the binding of two other monoclonal antibodies, 2D7 and 45523, specific for CCR5 but not for its ECL2B. When we examined three additional monoclonal antibodies, 3A9 and 45502 (both specific for NH2 terminus) and 45549 (multidomain reactive) (20Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N.

These data suggest that the potent inhibitory activity of AVC against R5 HIV-1 infection stems from its binding to ECL2B and/or its vicinity with high affinity. In an attempt to delineate the CCR5 binding profile of the three CCR5 inhibitors, we generated a variety of CCR5 mutant-overexpressing (CCR5MT) CHO cells and determined the KD values of each inhibitor to mutant CCR5 species using the saturation binding assay with tritiated inhibitors. When we determined the KD value of AVC with respect to a CCR5 mutant carrying an Asp to Ala substitution at position 11 of the amino terminus domain (CCR5D11A), the value was 3.0 nm, virtually identical to the KD value with wild-type CCR5 (CCR5WT; Table 1), indicating that the D11A substitution did not affect the binding of AVC to CCR5. The KD value of AVC with respect to CCR5Y37A was moderately greater with 7.9 nm (2.7-fold compared with the KD value with regard to CCR5WT). On the other hand, those of TAK-779 and SCH-C to CCR5Y37A were 98.9 nm (3.3-fold compared with the KD with regard to CCR5WT) and >200 nm (>12.5-fold), respectively, in agreement with the previous reports in which both TAK-779 and SCH-C apparently failed to bind, probably explaining that these inhibitors failed to block HIV-1 infection of CCR5Y37A-expressing cells (30Dragic T. Trkola A. Thompson D.A. Cormier E.G. Kajumo F.A. Maxwell E. Lin S.W. Ying W. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Moore J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These data suggest that the binding of TAK-779 and SCH-C to CCR5WT is more dependent on interactions with Tyr37 than that of AVC. We also generated a series of CCR5-overexpressing CHO cells carrying a mutation(s) at a selected amino acid position(s). As shown in Table 1, the mutations that substantially (more than 3-fold compared with AVC binding to CCR5WT) affected the KD values of AVC were as follows: Y108A and F113A in the third transmembrane domain (TM3) of CCR5; R168A and S180E in ECL2; K191R and K191N of the interface of ECL2B and TM5; K197A"
https://openalex.org/W2158819883,"The possible role of candidate receptors in the cellular penetration of HCV from serum of infected patients remains unclear. SR-BI/Cla1 interacts with plasma HDL, native and modified LDL, and VLDL, and facilitates cellular cholesterol efflux to lipoprotein acceptors. SR-BI/Cla1 binds HCV E2 protein and interacts with HCV pseudotypes via the HVR1 of the E2 envelope glycoprotein. Our data reveal that functional SR-BI/Cla1 expressed on the surface of CHO cells mediates the binding and uptake of HCV from the sera of infected patients. Interaction between HCV and SR-BI/Cla1 is not sensitive to either anti-E2 or anti-HVR1 antibodies but is effectively inhibited by anti-betalipoprotein antibodies and competed out by apoB-containing lipoproteins and notably by VLDL. We interpret our data to indicate that VLDL associated with or incorporated into HCV plays a critical role in the primary interaction of HCV with SR-BI/Cla1, whereas the HCV E2 protein does not. In addition, our findings in hepatoma cell lines suggest that the interaction of HCV with human hepatocytes is equally mediated, at least in a part, by VLDL, and as such may represent an alternative pathway for infection. The association of HCV with ApoB-containing lipoproteins may promote cellular uptake of this virus in the presence of neutralizing antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2008280357,"ATM and ATR are two related kinases essential for signalling DNA damage. Although ATM is thought to be the principle kinase responsible for signalling ionising radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage, ATR also contributes to signalling this form of genotoxic stress. However, the molecular basis of differential ATM and ATR activation in response to IR remains unclear. Here, we report that ATR is recruited to sites of IR-induced DNA damage significantly later than activation of ATM. We show that ATR is recruited to IR-induced nuclear foci in G1 and S phase of the cell cycle, supporting a role for ATR in detecting DNA damage outside of S phase. In addition, we report that recruitment of ATR to sites of IR-induced DNA damage is concomitant with appearance of large tracts of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and that this event is dependent on ATM and components of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1975407164,"Insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is stimulated by glucose, amino acids, and other metabolic fuels. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) has been shown to play a regulatory role in this process. The importance of GDH was underscored by features of hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia syndrome, where a dominant mutation causes the loss of inhibition by GTP and ATP. Here we report the effects of green tea polyphenols on GDH and insulin secretion. Of the four compounds tested, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate were found to inhibit GDH with nanomolar ED50 values and were therefore found to be as potent as the physiologically important inhibitor GTP. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that EGCG inhibits BCH-stimulated insulin secretion, a process that is mediated by GDH, under conditions where GDH is no longer inhibited by high energy metabolites. EGCG does not affect glucose-stimulated insulin secretion under high energy conditions where GDH is probably fully inhibited. We have further shown that these compounds act in an allosteric manner independent of their antioxidant activity and that the β-cell stimulatory effects are directly correlated with glutamine oxidation. These results demonstrate that EGCG, much like the activator of GDH (BCH), can facilitate dissecting the complex regulation of insulin secretion by pharmacologically modulating the effects of GDH.

The mitochondria of the pancreatic β-cell play an integrative role in the fuel stimulation of insulin secretion. The current concept is that mitochondrial oxidation of substrates increases the cellular phosphate potential that is manifested by a rise in the ATP4-/MgADP2- ratio. This in turn closes the plasma membrane KATP channels, opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, causes a rise of free cytoplasmic Ca2+, and leads to insulin granule exocytosis. Mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) 2The abbreviations used are: GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; EGCG, epigallocatechin gallate; EGC, epigallocatechin; ECG, epicatechin gallate; EC, epicatechin; BCH, β-2-aminobicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid; LSIS, leucine-stimulated insulin secretion; BCH-SIS, BCH-stimulated insulin secretion; GSIS, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion; DON, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine; HI/HA, hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia. catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l-glutamate and exhibits complex regulation in mammals through inhibition by palmitoyl CoA, GTP, and ATP and activation by ADP and leucine (1Brunhuber N.M.W. Blanchard J.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 415-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The connection between GDH and insulin regulation was initially established using an analog of leucine that is not able to be metabolized (2Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Malaisse W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies demonstrated that activation of GDH was tightly correlated with increased glutaminolysis. In addition, it has also been noted that factors that regulate GDH may affect insulin secretion (4Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Kmiotek E.H. Mertz R.J. Fahien C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13610-13614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that glutamate serves as a mitochondrial intracellular messenger when glucose is being oxidized and that the GDH participates in this process by synthesizing glutamate (5Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, the hypothesis that GDH (with a very high Km for ammonium) functions in the reductive amination reaction in vivo is controversial (6MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. J. Biol.

Stanley C.A. J. Pediatr. 2001; 138: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). During glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we have proposed that the generation of high energy phosphates inhibits GDH and promotes conversion of glutamate to glutamine, which, alone or combined, may amplify the release of insulin (7Li C.

Our goal was to find a nontoxic pharmacological agent that could be used to test these models and assess whether GDH might be an appropriate target in the treatment of disorders of glucose homeostasis. To that end, naturally occurring compounds from green tea were examined. According to legend, green tea was discovered by the Chinese Emperor Shen-Nung in 2737 B.C. and for centuries has been used as a folk remedy to treat a number of ailments, including diabetes mellitus. Green tea is a significant source of a type of flavonoid called catechin, which includes epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC) (see Fig. 1 for the structure). One 200-ml cup of green tea supplies 140, 65, 28, and 17 mg of these polyphenols, respectively (14Yang C.S. Wang Z.Y. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1038-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Over the past few decades, there has been growing interest in EGCG, because it has been suggested to decrease cholesterol levels (15Maron D.J. Lu G.P. Cai N.S. Wu Z.G. Li Y.H. Chen H. Zhu J.Q. Jin X.J. Wouters B.C. Zhao J. Arch. Intern. Med. 2003; 163: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), act as an antibiotic (16Hamilton-Miller J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2375-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and anticarcinogen (17Katiyar S.K. Mukhtar H. Int. J. Oncol. 1996; 8: 221-238PubMed Google Scholar), repress hepatic glucose production (18Waltner-Law M.E. Wang X.L. Law B.K. Hall R.K. Nawano M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and enhance insulin action (19Anderson R.A. Polansky M.M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 7182-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of action of EGCG with regard to these various effects is largely unknown and in many cases is assumed to be due to its antioxidant activity. In this current study, we have demonstrated that EGCG specifically and allosterically inhibits GDH and, in turn, affects insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that EGCG and ECG (but not EGC and EC) inhibit purified GDH with nanomolar ED50 values. This inhibition is dependent upon the “antenna-like” protrusion on the enzyme but EGCG is unlikely to bind to the GTP inhibitory site since it inhibits forms of GDH with nonfunctional GTP sites. Studies with pancreatic β-cells have demonstrated that EGCG specifically affects insulin secretion under conditions where GDH is known to be important for glucose homeostasis. These results demonstrate that, as has been the case with the activator of GDH (BCH), EGCG can be used as a pharmacological tool to examine the complex regulation of insulin secretion by specifically blocking GDH activity. Kinetic Analyses—The bovine GDH used in these studies was obtained as an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 suspension from Sigma. Prior to kinetic analysis, aliquots of GDH were extensively dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, that contained 1 mm EDTA. Human wild-type and mutant GDH was expressed in Escherichia coli (20Fang J. Macmullen C. Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 363: 81-87Crossref Google Scholar) and tGDH was purified from Tetrahymena (21Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) as previously described. The enzyme concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/ml, and the amount of enzyme added to the reaction mixture was adjusted to yield optimal steady state velocity measurements. All solutions were made immediately prior to use. Enzyme assays were performed by monitoring reduced coenzyme absorbance at 340 nm using a Shamadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. The reductive amination reactions were performed in 1-ml volumes at pH 7.0 in the presence of 0.1 mm NADH, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm 2-oxoglutarate. The rate of NADH oxidation was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1. Islet Isolation and Culture—Pancreatic islets were isolated from fed adult male Wistar rats by collagenase digestion and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (glucose-free; Sigma). The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and islets were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air-humidified incubator. The islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3-4 days. Insulin Secretion by Perifused Islets—100 cultured rat islets were loaded onto nylon filters in a small chamber and perifused in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (115 mmol/liter NaCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.25% bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Samples were collected every minute for insulin assay. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Islet Perifusion and Oxygen Consumption Measurement—Approximately 1000 isolated rat islets were cultured in 10 mm glucose for 3 days and perifused in a glass chamber. The perifusion apparatus consisted of a peristaltic pump, a water bath (37 °C), a gas exchanger (artificial lung, where medium flowed through the thin-walled silastic tubing loosely coiled in a glass jar that contained 20% O2 and 5%CO2 balanced with N2), and a fraction collector (Waters Division of Millipore). All transfer lines were insulated. Oxygen partial pressure was recorded every 10 s by phosphorescence lifetimes of an oxygen-sensitive porphyrin (palladium-mesotetra; 4-carboxyphenyl porphyrin dendrimer) (22Lo L.W. Vinogradov S.A. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 428: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dye molecules were excited with pulses at 524 nm from a UV lead, and emission was measured at 690 nm. The inflow oxygen tension was measured in the absence of islets in the chamber before and after each experiment. The perifusate was a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin equilibrated with 20% O2 and 5% CO2 balanced with N2. The flow rate was ∼100 μl/min, and samples were collected every 2 min for insulin measurements. [U-14C]Glutamine Oxidation—Islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3 days. Batches of 100 islets were preincubated with glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing EGCG, EGC, or DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine) for 60 min. The islets were then incubated with 2 or 3 mm glutamine in the presence of BCH and EGCG, EGC, or DON (in accordance with the preincubation protocol) for another 60 min with 2 μCi [U-14C]glutamine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) present. A trap filter was placed in each tightly sealed glass tube to collect the 14CO2 produced by the islets, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. [U-14C]Glucose Oxidation—Islets were prepared as described above, and batches of 100 islets were preincubated with glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing varying concentrations of EGCG for 60 min. The islets were then incubated with 3 and 12 mm glucose in the presence of EGCG for another 60 min with 2 μCi [U-14C]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) present. Production of 14CO2 was monitored as described above. Because green tea was suggested as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes more than 70 years ago (23Konayagi S. Minowada M. Stud. Phys., Kyoto Univ. 1933; 10: 449-454Google Scholar) and because of the role that GDH plays in insulin secretion, the effects of green tea catechins on GDH were tested in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1, EGCG and ECG (but not EGC or EC) are potent inhibitors of GDH activity with ED50 values of ∼300 nm. Because all four polyphenols have comparable antioxidant activities (24Anderson R.F. Fisher L.J. Hara Y. Harris T. Mak W.B. Melton L.D. Packer J.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this strongly suggests that EGCG and ECG effects are allosteric in nature. This inhibition is also reversible, because dialysis of an EGCG/GDH mixture completely alleviated the inhibition (data not shown). To further ascertain how EGCG inhibits the reductive amination reaction, the polyphenol was added to the reaction at various concentrations of NADH and 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 2). As summarized in Table 1, EGCG affects both the slope and the y-intercept of the curves in a manner consistent with noncompetitive inhibition. These results suggest that EGCG does not act by directly competing with either coenzyme or substrate binding to the active site and that it inhibits by binding to either the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex.TABLE 1Summary of the effects of EGCG on the reductive amination reaction As shown here, EGCG has marked effects on both the y-intercept and the slope of the curves and therefore infers that EGCG inhibits in a non-competitive manner.[EGCG]NADH varied2-oxoglutarate varied0 μm0.3 μm0.6 μm0 μm0.3 μm0.45 μmSlope0.0034 ± 0.00010.0041 ± 0.00030.0065 ± 0.00041.77 ± 0.0142.19 ± 0.143.5 ± 0.39y-intercept0.120 ± 0.0060.247 ± 0.0180.322 ± 0.02624.0 ± 0.7446.0 ± 7.369.0 ± 10.8R20.98800.95040.95830.99970.97990.9640 Open table in a new tab To examine how EGCG interacts with other allosteric regulators, the ability of the activators BCH, leucine, and ADP to reverse EGCG was examined. Fig. 3 displays the data in two different ways. On the left, the raw velocities of the reactions are shown in the presence and absence of EGCG at varying concentrations of the activators. On the right, the same data is plotted as a percent of the velocity of the reaction compared with the reaction rate in the absence of activators in the presence or absence of EGCG. Under these assay conditions and in the absence of EGCG, all three activators only increase the velocity of the reactions by, at most, 30%. However, in the presence of 1 μm EGCG, all three regulators can activate the reaction by as much as 3-fold. In absolute terms, the addition of 1 μm EGCG decreased GDH activity to ∼20% that of the uninhibited enzyme. In all cases, the activators partially alleviated EGCG inhibition and increased the enzymatic activity to ∼60% that of the uninhibited enzyme. This is very similar to previous studies that have shown that ADP and leucine activate by binding to spatially different sites (25Prough R.A. Culver J.M. Fisher H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8528-8533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can have apparently greater activation if an allosteric inhibitor is present (e.g. GTP). Abrogation of EGCG inhibition by these allosteric activators supports the above contention that EGCG acts in an allosteric manner. HI/HA syndrome is caused by the loss of GTP inhibition of GDH (9Stanley C.A. O'Rahilly S. Dunger D.B. Genetic Insights in Paediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism. BioScientifica, Ltd, Bristol, UK2000: 23-30Google Scholar). Many of the mutations lie in the GTP binding site and likely act by sterically interfering with GTP binding (12MacMullen C. Fang J. Hsu B.Y. Kelly A. DeLonlay-Debeney P. Saudubray J.M. Ganguly A. Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Fang J.

Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Therefore, EGCG (or compounds that specifically target GDH) could be therapeutically useful if it also inhibited the HI/HA mutant forms of GDH. To this end, EGCG was tested against five different HI/HA mutant forms of GDH (Fig. 4) and was found to have the same efficacy as with wild-type human GDH. In addition, EGCG inhibited GDH from Tetrahymena thermophilia (tGDH), which, similar to these HI/HA mutants, is not regulated by GTP (21Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggest that EGCG acts independently of the GTP inhibitory site. From our previous structural analyses, mammalian GDH has a 48-residue antenna-like feature protruding from the top of each of its six subunits (27Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Smith T.J. Schmidt T. Fang J. Wu J. Siuzdak G. Stanley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that is necessary for ADP, GTP, and palmitoyl CoA regulation (21Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, EGCG does not inhibit the “antenna-less” form of human GDH. This demonstrates that EGCG inhibition of GDH is unrelated to the antioxidant activity of the flavonoids, does not directly affect the active site, and is dependent upon the antenna structure to exert its activity. Because EGCG was found to be a potent inhibitor of GDH in vitro, it was postulated that GDH-dependent β-cell functions should also be influenced by these catechins. For example, the phenomenon of leucine-stimulated insulin secretion (LSIS) has been recently elucidated by our studies showing that LSIS is mediated by GDH and its regulation of glutaminolysis (7Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). LSIS is only observed after a prolonged period of rundown to produce a state of energy depletion. Under these conditions, the levels of GDH inhibitors ATP and GTP are reduced, whereas the concentration of the GDH activator ADP is increased. When leucine (or its nonmetabolizable analog BCH) is then added to cells in this depleted state, the flux of glutamine through glutaminase and GDH is increased, ATP is generated, and the β-cells are stimulated to secrete insulin. As shown in Fig. 5, the BCH stimulation of insulin secretion is blocked by EGCG (but not EGC) in a dose-dependent manner with an ED50 value of <10 μm. EGCG did not affect the intrinsic ability of the cells to secrete insulin, because depolarization by KCl still resulted in release of insulin. The concentration of EGCG required to abrogate LSIS is significantly higher than what is necessary to inhibit GDH in vitro. This is likely because of the bioavailability of EGCG in the mitochondria and/or that higher levels of EGCG are required in tissue to overcome antagonism by leucine, ADP, and BCH. According to our working model, the effects of EGCG on BCH-stimulated insulin secretion (BCH-SIS) are due to a block of glutamine oxidation through GDH (7Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test for this, the effects of EGCG and EGC on BCH-SIS were measured while simultaneously monitoring respiration rates. As shown in Fig. 6, EGCG strongly inhibited both BCH-SIS and the BCH-induced increase in respiration rates. The addition of EGCG itself does not have any significant effect on oxygen consumption in the absence of BCH. EGC has a number of interesting effects on BCH-SIS. First, it does not cause significant inhibition of BCH-SIS nor is its effect on respiration as strong as EGCG. Second, EGC seems to cause a slight sensitization of the β-cells to BCH, as manifested in a slightly faster response to BCH-mediated insulin secretion and respiration enhancement. This clearly demonstrates that the EGCG effects are not due to the catechin antioxidant activity and suggests that EGC may have some, although quite different, effects on the pancreatic cells. According to the working model (7Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daihkin Y. Nissiam I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13393-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it was predicted that EGCG would block BCH-SIS by inhibition of GDH-mediated glutaminolysis. To directly test for this, the effects of EGCG on BCH stimulation of glutamine oxidation were measured (Fig. 7A). As shown, EGCG (but not EGC) completely blocks BCH stimulation of glutaminolysis. EGCG inhibition of glutamine oxidation occurs in a dose-dependent manner with maximal effects occurring at ∼20 μm and never decreasing glutamine oxidation below that of the cells not stimulated by BCH (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig. 7C, this is in contrast to the effects of DON, an inhibitor of glutaminase, which blocks glutaminolysis to levels lower than the unstimulated β-cells at high concentrations. These results are summarized in Fig. 7D and demonstrate that EGCG does not have an effect on basal levels of glutamine oxidation but does block BCH enhancement of glutaminolysis. Together with the enzymatic data, it is clear that EGCG effects on BCH-SIS are due to the inhibition of GDH. Because our previous studies have suggested that glutamine is an important signaling molecule for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (8Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daihkin Y. Nissiam I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13393-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), it was then necessary to determine whether EGCG might also affect GSIS. Islets were incubated for 3 days in the presence of 20 mm (Fig. 8A) or 10 mm (Fig. 8B) glucose, perifused for 50 min in the absence of glucose ± catechins, and then subjected to a glucose ramp. In all cases, neither EGC nor EGCG affected GSIS under these short run-down conditions. As confirmation of this, insulin secretion and oxygen consumption were measured during glucose stimulation (Fig. 9). It is clear that EGCG does not affect respiration under these conditions. Finally, as shown in Fig. 10, EGCG does not affect glucose oxidation over a wide range of EGCG concentrations when the islets are incubated in either 3 or 12 mm glucose. Therefore, the catechins do not, in and of themselves, affect cellular respiration, glucose oxidation, or insulin secretion. Rather, these results support the contention that EGCG affects insulin secretion via modulation of GDH activity. Under the brief run-down conditions used for the GSIS analysis, the levels of high energy metabolites (GTP and ATP) were not depleted, and these effectively shut down GDH activity (7Li C. Najafi H.

Therefore, additional inhibition by EGCG does not affect glutamate/glutamine levels nor does it, in turn, affect GSIS under these conditions.FIGURE 9Effects of EGCG on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and oxygen consumption.

Results are presented as means ± S.E. from four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The data presented here clearly demonstrate that EGCG allosterically inhibits GDH in vitro with a nanomolar ED50 value. Because this inhibition is observed with EGCG and ECG (but not EC or EGC), inhibition cannot be due to the anti-oxidant property of these catechins. EGCG inhibition is apparently noncompetitive and, similar to GTP inhibition, is abrogated by leucine, BCH, and ADP. It is unlikely that EGCG acts by binding to the GTP site, because HI/HA GDH mutants and tGDH are all inhibited by EGCG but have inactive GTP binding sites. EGCG inhibition is apparently dependent upon the antenna, because the an antenna-less mutant of GDH is also unaffected by EGCG. This was also found to be the case with ADP activation and GTP inhibition (21Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This specificity of EGCG for GDH inhibition was mirrored in studies on β-cells and demonstrates the importance of GDH in the regulation of insulin secretion. Our previous studies have demonstrated that GDH plays a major role in LSIS by controlling glutaminolysis (7Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 8Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daihkin Y. Nissiam I. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13393-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore it was not unexpected that EGCG, by inhibiting GDH activity, abrogated BCH-SIS. The specificity of this inhibition was confirmed by demonstrating that EGCG (but not EGC) causes a concomitant blockade of glutaminolysis stimulated by BCH but not in the basal level of glutamine oxidation or cellular respiration. When EGCG is added to β-cells during glucose stimulation, under conditions where GDH is known to not play a major role in the regulation of insulin secretion, no effect is observed on insulin secretion, glucose oxidation, or cellular respiration. It is worthy of note that, to keep the involvement of the oxidation of leucine in the process of insulin secretion from complicating the interpretation of the experiments, this study was limited to using BCH to stimulate GDH. Together, the data presented here clearly demonstrate that EGCG can affect BCH-SIS by inhibiting GDH activity in a manner that is consistent with our working hypothesis as summarized in Fig. 11. The foundation of this model is that GDH can regulate insulin secretion by controlling the intracellular pool of glutamine and/or glutamate. In the case of BCH-SIS, the β-cell is depleted of glucose and provided with glutamine at low concentration levels prior to the application of BCH. Therefore, when BCH is applied, the lack of ATP/GTP inhibition combined with ADP and BCH activation facilitates glutaminolysis. This leads to the generation of ATP, and combined with the exogenously added glutamine that may act as an intracellular signal, insulin secretion is facilitated. EGCG inhibits GDH, blocks glutaminolysis, and thereby prevents the BCH effects. In the case of GSIS, the effects of EGCG are likely dependent upon the energy state of the cell. When the β-cell has been run-down for a brief period of time, glutaminolysis is not the main energy source for the cell, and high energy metabolites (GTP and ATP) are still present at high enough levels to inhibit GDH activity. Under these conditions, EGCG does not affect GSIS, because GDH is already effectively inhibited. Further, these results demonstrate that EGCG does not intrinsically affect insulin secretion. These experiments support the hypothesis that GDH, through its allosteric regulation, plays an important role in the process of amino acid stimulation of insulin release. We have recently suggested that the complex allosteric regulation of GDH started to evolve in the Ciliates in response to the changing function of cellular organelles and, through exaptation, further allostery (leucine and GTP/ATP regulation) was layered on for the regulation of additional functions for the reaction (for example, insulin secretion) (21Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present results continue to support this by the demonstration that the antenna, which evolved in the Ciliates, is essential for EGCG inhibition. Similar to other compounds, such as DON and BCH, EGCG is a new pharmacological tool that will help elucidate the intersecting metabolic pathways that regulate insulin secretion. Finally, the present observations suggest that GDH may be a novel target for future treatment of glucose homeostasis disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2132948186,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) γ has been implicated in a vast array of physiological settings including the activation of different leukocyte species and the regulation of myocardial contractility. Activation of PI3Kγ is primarily mediated by Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are recognized by a p101 regulatory subunit. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel regulatory subunit of PI3Kγ, which we termed p87PIKAP (PI3Kγ adapter protein of 87 kDa). It is homologous to p101 in areas that we have recently shown that they mediate binding to the catalytic p110γ subunit and to Gβγ. Like p101, p87PIKAP binds to both p110γ and Gβγ and mediates activation of p110γ downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. In contrast to p101, p87PIKAP is highly expressed in heart and may therefore be crucial to PI3Kγ cardiac function. Moreover, p87PIKAP and p101 are both expressed in dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, raising the possibility of regulatory subunit-dependent differences in PI3Kγ signaling within the same cell type. We further provide evidence that p87PIKAP physically interacts with phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3B, suggesting that p87PIKAP is also involved in the recently described noncatalytic scaffolding interaction of p110γ with PDE3B. However, coexpression of PDE3B and PI3Kγ subunits was not sufficient to reconstitute the regulatory effect of PI3Kγ on PDE3B activity observed in heart, implying further molecules to be present in the complex regulating PDE3B in heart. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) γ has been implicated in a vast array of physiological settings including the activation of different leukocyte species and the regulation of myocardial contractility. Activation of PI3Kγ is primarily mediated by Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, which are recognized by a p101 regulatory subunit. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel regulatory subunit of PI3Kγ, which we termed p87PIKAP (PI3Kγ adapter protein of 87 kDa). It is homologous to p101 in areas that we have recently shown that they mediate binding to the catalytic p110γ subunit and to Gβγ. Like p101, p87PIKAP binds to both p110γ and Gβγ and mediates activation of p110γ downstream of G protein-coupled receptors. In contrast to p101, p87PIKAP is highly expressed in heart and may therefore be crucial to PI3Kγ cardiac function. Moreover, p87PIKAP and p101 are both expressed in dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, raising the possibility of regulatory subunit-dependent differences in PI3Kγ signaling within the same cell type. We further provide evidence that p87PIKAP physically interacts with phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3B, suggesting that p87PIKAP is also involved in the recently described noncatalytic scaffolding interaction of p110γ with PDE3B. However, coexpression of PDE3B and PI3Kγ subunits was not sufficient to reconstitute the regulatory effect of PI3Kγ on PDE3B activity observed in heart, implying further molecules to be present in the complex regulating PDE3B in heart.

It acts as a lipid second messenger by recruiting proteins containing pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to cellular membranes, thereby initiating various cellular responses (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 2Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). Class I PI3K are further subdivided into classes IA and IB according to their mode of activation. Class IB PI3Kγ is chiefly activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and therefore grouped separately from the class IA PI3K that are activated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases. Insight into the physiological role of PI3Kγ has been mostly derived from the characterization of p110γ knockout mice, which show defects in chemoattractant-induced neutrophil migration and oxidative burst, thymocyte development (3Li Z.

Moreover, characterization of p110γ knockout mice revealed a role for PI3Kγ both in the regulation of myocardial contractility and in cardiac remodeling processes (9Oudit G.Y. Sun H. Kerfant B.G.

Recently, characterization of mice with a knockin of a catalytically inactive mutant of p110γ revealed that the impact on contractility is probably mediated by a scaffolding interaction with phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3B, whereas remodeling processes are governed by pathways depending on catalytic activity of p110γ (11Patrucco E. Notte A. Barberis L. Selvetella G. Maffei A. Brancaccio M. Marengo S. Russo G. Azzolino O. Rybalkin S.D. Silengo L. Altruda F. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Lembo G. Hirsch E. Cell. 2004; 118: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Besides the catalytic p110γ subunit, PI3Kγ consists of a p101 regulatory subunit that binds both p110γ and Gβγ (12Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although lipid kinase activity of p110γ can be stimulated by Gβγ in the absence of the regulatory p101 subunit (13Leopoldt D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7024-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), p101 appears to be necessary for Gβγ-mediated activation of PI3Kγ in living cells. In a heterologous reconstitution system, p101 binds to Gβγ subunits and thereby recruits p110γ to the plasma membrane, whereas p110γ was neither recruited to the plasma membrane by Gβγ nor activated by GPCR stimulation in the absence of p101 (14Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, p110γ is functional and physiologically important in tissues where neither expressed sequence tag data nor direct experimental evidence validate an expression of p101, rendering the role of p101 still controversial. Recently, we were able to map the determinants relevant for interaction with p110γ and Gβγ to distinct areas within the p101 primary structure (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings enabled us to identify an mRNA sequence within the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base that encodes a distantly related p101 homologue (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas the encoded putative protein showed little overall sequence similarity to p101, a higher degree of conservation was observed within the regions that correspond to the p101 functional domains. Meanwhile, an initial characterization of this gene product was published by Suire et al. (16Suire S. Coadwell J. Ferguson G.J. Davidson K. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 566-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), who showed that it indeed interacts with p110γ and Gβγ. Here we report a different cloning strategy and further functional characterization of this novel PI3Kγ regulatory subunit, which we designated as p87PIKAP (p87 PI3K adapter protein) (17Voigt P. Schaefer M. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: R44Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Similarly to p101, p87PIKAP interacts with p110γ and Gβγ. p87PIKAP and p101 bind to p110γ in a mutually exclusive fashion with a similar orientation within the dimeric complex. p87PIKAP was necessary and sufficient to reconstitute a PI3Kγ signaling pathway in transfected HEK293 cells, mediating Gβγ-dependent activation of p110γ downstream of a Gi-coupled receptor. p87PIKAP mRNA was detected in various tissues, albeit most prominently in the heart. By contrast, p101 is only weakly expressed in the heart, whereas B and T cells feature p101 as the only p110γ regulatory subunit. In DCs, neutrophils, and macrophages, both p87PIKAP and p101 are coexpressed, raising the possibility of isoform-specific signaling with respect to the PI3Kγ regulatory subunit. Moreover, we present evidence that p87PIKAP interacts with PDE3B, pointing to an additional involvement of p87PIKAP in the recently described noncatalytic scaffolding interaction of p110γ with PDE3B. Cloning of Murine p87 PIKAP cDNA and Generation of ExpressionPlasmids—Total RNA of murine CD11c+ DC was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Murine p87PIKAP cDNA was then amplified by PCR (Expand HF; Roche Applied Science) using the primers 5′-CCTCCCCCATACAGGACAGA-3′ and 5′-GTGGGGCTGTCAGTGTAAATG-3′ and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS-TOPO (Invitrogen). The p87PIKAP cDNA nucleotide sequence of three independently amplified and subcloned clones was determined by sequencing (DYEnamic ET kit; Amersham Biosciences). These sequence data have been submitted to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base under accession number AY753194. Expression plasmids encoding p87PIKAP N- or C-terminally tagged with cyan (CFP) or yellow (YFP) fluorescent proteins were generated by subcloning the p87PIKAP open reading frame into the custom-made vectors pcDNA3-NCFP, pcDNA3-NYFP, pcDNA3-CFP, or pcDNA3-YFP (19Schaefer M. Albrecht N. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In p87PIKAP-FLAG, a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag was added by subcloning into a pcDNA3-FLAG vector (20Hellwig N. Albrecht N. Harteneck C. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A CFP-tagged version of the C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK-CT-CFP) was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-GCCACCATGGGCACCAAAAACAAGCAGTTGG-3′ and 5′-TTAATCTAGACCGTTGGCACTGCCG-3′ and subcloned first into pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS-TOPO and then into pcDNA3-CFP via HindIII and XbaI. Construction of expression plasmids coding for p101, CFP-p101, YFP-p101, p110γ, YFP-p110γ, p110γ-YFP, CFP-p110γ(K833R), p110γ-CAAX, YFP-p110β, p110β-YFP, YFP-Grp1-PH, Gβ1, Gγ2 and the human fMLP receptor has been described elsewhere (14Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The generation of the plasmid encoding murine PDE3B-FLAG has been published (21Shakur Y. Takeda K. Kenan Y. Yu Z.X. Rena G. Brandt D. Houslay M.D. Degerman E. Ferrans V.J. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38749-38761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For the generation of CFP-PDE3B, the PDE3B open reading frame was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-GCCACCATGAGGAAAGACGAGCGC-3′ and 5′-TTAGCTCGAGTCAAACATTTGTTCTTCCTCTTCA-3′ and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS-TOPO. The CFP tag was inserted into this construct via NdeI and HindIII. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. COS-7 cells were cultivated at 37 °C and 7% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Transfection of HEK293 and COS-7 cells was performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The amount of transfected plasmid cDNA was 2 μg/35-mm dish or 4 μg/60-mm dish for coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. The total amount of transfected plasmid was always kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector (pcDNA3) where necessary. For fluorescence microscopy experiments, the cells were seeded on glass coverslips 24–48 h prior to the experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and anti-GFP antibodies (BD Biosciences) and suitable secondary antibodies (Sigma). For the analysis of p87PIKAP and p101 stability, whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells directly into Laemmli sample buffer followed by sonification (5 s) to ensure complete lysis. The lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Akt phosphorylation was analyzed in whole cell lysates using anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Fluorescence Imaging and Confocal Microscopy—FRET efficiencies were determined using the acceptor photobleaching method as described previously (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). FRET efficiencies E were calculated using the equation E = 1 – (FDA/FD), with FDA representing the CFP fluorescence measured before bleaching YFP and FD representing the CFP fluorescence in absence of YFP acceptor. FD was obtained by linear regression of the increase in CFP fluorescence with the decrease in YFP fluorescence and extrapolation to zero YFP fluorescence, i.e. complete YFP photobleach (22Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The expression levels of YFP- and CFP-tagged proteins were assessed by calibration of fluorescence intensities using an intramolecularly fused CFP-YFP construct. A 1.5–3-fold excess of YFP-over CFP-tagged proteins was maintained to ensure comparability and to avoid situations where availability of the FRET acceptor may limit FRET efficiencies. For FRET competition studies, the excess of YFP-over CFP-tagged proteins was limited to 1.2–1.5-fold, allowing for an effective competition with untagged proteins. For the analysis of p87PIKAP and p101 expression, fluorescence intensities of YFP-tagged regulatory subunits of PI3Kγ and of a cotransfected free CFP (to identify transfected cells) were quantified using a 40×/1.3 F-Fluar objective and CFP- and YFP-selective band pass filters used for FRET microscopy (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Pixel fluorescence intensities were integrated over single cells and corrected for background. Confocal microscopy was performed essentially as described (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All of the imaging experiments were performed at room temperature in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 128 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from BD Biosciences. RNA probes were generated with the StripEZ-SP6 kit (Ambion) using either BglII-linearized p87PIKAP-FLAG or the supplied β-actin control plasmid as a template and α-[32P]UTP (10 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the radioactive label. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 68 °C in UltraHyb hybridization buffer (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The signals were detected on an image plate (Fujifilm), which was read by a phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm BAS Reader 1500). Multiplex and Competitive PCR—Bone marrow-derived macrophages and splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice were obtained and cultured as described (23Dorner D.G. Scheffold A. Rolph M.S. Hüser M.B. Kaufmann S.H.E. Radbruch A. Flesch I.E.A. Kroczek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Magnetic cell sorting of leukocyte subtypes from splenocytes of C57BL/6 mice was performed according to the manufacturer's conditions (Miltenyi Biotec). Purity of sorted cell populations was assessed with appropriate antibodies by flow cytometry on a LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the FlowJo analysis software (Tree-Star Inc.) as described (24Löhning M. Hutloff A. Kallinich T. Mages H.W. Bonhagen K. Radbruch A. Hamelmann E. Kroczek R.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using the High pure RNA kit (Roche Applied Science), and poly(A+) RNA was prepared with the μMACS mRNA kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Both were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total RNA (0.5–1.5 μg) or mRNA (5–50 ng) was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Multiplex PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in the supplied buffer supplemented with 1.5 mm MgCl2. Initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min was followed by 24 amplification cycles (94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) and a final extension time of 5 min at 72 °C. The following primers were used: GAPDH forward (5′-TTAGCCCCCCTGGCCAAGG-3′) and GAPDH reverse (5′-CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG-3′) to amplify bases 521–1061 (541 bp) of NM_001001303; p87PIKAP forward (5′-GGACGGACGGCGGACTTTC-3′) and p87PIKAP reverse (5′-GTGGGGCTGTCAGTGTAAATG-3′) to amplify bases 2313–2598 (286 bp) of BC028998; p101 forward (5′-AAGCCGGAGGAGCTAGACTC-3′) and p101 reverse (5′-GCAGAGCCCCACTGAATGTC-3′) to amplify bases 2263–2611 (349 bp) of NM_177320; and p110γ forward (5′-TCCTGGGCATCAATAAAGAGAG-3′) and p110γ reverse (5′-GGGCCCTAGCACCACATATC-3′) to amplify bases 3245–3648 (404 bp) of NM_020272. All of the primers were designed to span at least one intervening intron so that contaminations from genomic DNA would result in amplification of considerably longer PCR products. The identity of all amplified fragments was initially confirmed by direct sequencing and, in all further experiments, by digestion with restriction endonucleases that specifically cut only in one of the fragments amplified (GAPDH, ApaI; p110γ, BclI; p101, XbaI; and p87PIKAP, HindIII). PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels and documented on a CCD camera-based gel documentation system (Fujifilm LAS-1000). For the quantification of template copy numbers by competitive PCR, internal standards were generated for p87PIKAP and p101 fragments. These were designed to have each a 40-bp deletion upstream of the 3′-primer-binding site to yield a construct of distinguishable size but a composition similar to the respective fragment to be quantified. These competitor constructs were generated by 20 cycles of PCR using the primers p87PIKAP forward (see above) and p87PIKAP competitor reverse (5′-GTGGGGCTGTCAGTGTAAATGGCTGCCCCTGGACC-3′) for the p87PIKAP internal standard and p101 forward (see above) and p101 competitor reverse (5′-GCAGAGCCCCACTGAATGTCGTCTCTGCTGGCTGG-3′) for the p101 internal standard. The PCR products were purified (High pure PCR product purification kit; Roche Applied Science), and the yield and purity were assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by UV spectroscopy. Serial dilutions of these purified PCR fragments in H2O were then used as internal standards in subsequent PCRs. For quantitative analysis of band intensities, TINA 2.09 software (Raytest) was used. PDE Assay—PDE activities were determined by a modification (25Shepherd M.C. Baillie G.S. Stirling D.I. Houslay M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) of the two-step radioactive method described by Thompson and Appleman (26Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Igepal Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The cell lysates were diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and cAMP as the substrate (0.075 μCi/reaction (2,8)-3H-cAMP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) supplemented with 1 μm unlabeled cAMP) and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C (100 μl of reaction volume). Substrate turnover did not exceed 15% of the total cAMP amount, which is well in the linear portion of the reaction. The reactions were terminated by boiling (3 min at 95 °C). To convert the AMP to adenosine, the samples were incubated with 25 μg of snake venom from Crotalus atrox (Sigma) for 10 min at 30 °C. The samples were rocked on ice for 20 min with 400 μl of a 1:1:1 slurry of Dowex (1 × 8, 200–400; Sigma), H2O, and ethanol and then centrifuged for 3 min. (2,8)-3H-adenosine in the supernatant was then quantified by liquid scintillation counting. To specifically assess PDE3 activity, PDE activity was measured in the presence of the PDE3-specific inhibitor cilostamide (10 μm; Sigma) in the reaction mix and compared with untreated samples. In each transfection experiment, PDE3 activities were determined in duplicate. Identification and Cloning of p87PIKAP—As previously reported, we have identified an mRNA (GenBank™ accession number BC028998), whose encoded putative protein shows homology to p101 within the p110γ- and Gβγ-interacting domains (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), although the overall sequence similarity is relatively low (about 24% amino acid similarity). Based on expressed sequence tag data and the origin of the identified sequence, we chose murine DCs as a suitable source for RT-PCR-based amplification and cloning of the coding sequence of the p101 homologue. We could amplify and subclone the expected 2.3-kb fragment from total RNA of CD11c+ DCs of C57BL/6 mice. Clones derived from three independent PCRs were sequenced and yielded the coding sequence deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base (accession code AY753194). It corresponds to the predicted coding region in BC028998, which was also used in the study of Suire et al. (16Suire S. Coadwell J. Ferguson G.J. Davidson K. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 566-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Multiple clones were obtained containing a 12-bp insertion at the boundary of exons 12 and 13 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number DQ295832). This insertion, however, did not result in obvious functional differences to the protein encoded by the deposited sequence (data not shown). The p87PIKAP coding sequence consists of 20 exons, and the gene is located on murine chromosome 11 immediately next to the p101 gene (see the Ensembl data base at www.ensembl.org for further information on gene structure). An alignment of the protein sequence has been published previously (15Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5121-5127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although Suire et al. (16Suire S. Coadwell J. Ferguson G.J. Davidson K. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 566-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) proposed p84 as a name for the novel regulatory subunit, we intend to stick to our previously introduced nomenclature that is also used in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ data base entries pertaining to this gene (Refs. 17Voigt P. Schaefer M. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: R44Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 18Wymann M.P. Marone R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar; see also GenBank™ entry AY753194). Subcellular Distribution and Stability of p87PIKAP—The subcellular distribution of p87PIKAP was assayed in living cells by confocal microscopy. Unlike p101 fusion proteins, YFP-tagged p87PIKAP localized almost exclusively to the cytosol of HEK293 and COS-7 cells regardless of the position of the fluorescent tag (Fig. 1A, upper panels). Because p110γ also localizes to the cytosol in these cell types, it is not surprising that coexpression of p110γ did not change the localization of p87PIKAP (Fig. 1A, lower panels). In contrast, YFP-p101 was predominantly localized within the nucleus of both COS-7 and HEK293 cells in the absence of p110γ, whereas coexpression of p110γ led to a redistribution to the cytosol (Fig. 1A, right panels; see also Ref. 14Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For p101, a conserved nuclear localization signal can be located at positions 499–502 (residues numbered as in pig p101). The p87PIKAP sequence, however, lacks such nuclear targeting signals, and the protein partitions to the cytosol. Furthermore, as observed previously (14Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the overall fluorescence intensity of YFP-tagged p101 was substantially lower if it was expressed without p110γ. If cotransfected with free CFP as a control for transfection efficiency, expression levels of p101-YFP were reduced to 36 ± 3% (n = 3, 75–120 cells each) upon expression without p110γ. In contrast, expression levels of p87PIKAP-YFP remained largely unchanged (reduction to 75 ± 2%). To further test a dependence on p110γ expression, HEK293 cells were transfected with different ratios of FLAG-tagged PI3Kγ subunits, whose expression was assayed in whole cell lysates. A dependence on p110γ expression was observed for p101-FLAG (Fig. 1B), which was comparable with previous results with CFP-p101 (14Brock C. Schaefer M. Reusch H.P. Czupalla C. Michalke M. Spicher K. Schultz G. Nürnberg B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We thus conclude that these p101 fusion proteins are stabilized by coexpression of p110γ. In contrast, the expression level of p87PIKAP-FLAG was largely independent of the amount of p110γ-FLAG coexpressed (Fig. 1B), indicating a higher stability of the p87PIKAP protein in the absence of p110γ. Interaction between p87 PIKAP and p110γ—Next, we tested the interaction between p87PIKAP and the catalytic p110γ subunit of PI3Kγ by employing co-IP assays. CFP-fused p87PIKAP copurified with p110γ-FLAG from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with both proteins (Fig. 2), supporting the earlier observation of Suire et al. (16Suire S. Coadwell J. Ferguson G.J. Davidson K. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 566-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Likewise, CFP-p101 copurified with p110γ-FLAG under the same conditions. A CFP-YFP fusion protein employed as a control for unspecific binding to the fluorescent protein moiety was not detectabl"

Recently we reported an essential role for prohormone convertase (PC) 1/3 in the cleavage of intestinal proglucagon, resulting in formation of GLP-1, as demonstrated in PC1/3-deficient mice. However, little is known about the endoproteolytic processing of the GIP precursor. This study investigates the processing of proGIP in PC1/3 and PC2 null mice and in cell lines using adenovirus-mediated overexpression. Supporting a role for PC1/3 in proGIP processing, we found co-localization of GIP and PC1/3 but not PC2 in intestinal sections by immunohistochemistry, and analysis of intestinal extracts from PC1/3-deficient animals demonstrated severely impaired processing to GIP, whereas processing to GIP was unaltered in PC2-deficient mice. Accordingly, overexpression of preproGIP in the neuroendocrine AtT-20 cell line that expresses high levels of endogenous PC1/3 and negligible levels of PC2 resulted in production of GIP. Similar results were obtained after co-expression of preproGIP and PC1/3 in GH4 cells that express no PC2 and only low levels of PC1/3. In addition, studies in GH4 cells and the α-TC1.9 cell line, expressing PC2 but not PC1/3, indicate that PC2 can mediate processing to GIP but also to other fragments not found in intestinal extracts. Taken together, our data indicate that PC1/3 is essential and sufficient for the production of the intestinal incretin hormone GIP, whereas PC2, although capable of cleaving proGIP, does not participate in intestinal proGIP processing and is not found in intestinal GIP-expressing cells.

The endoproteolytic processing of many protein precursors depends on the expression of members of the family of subtilisin-like endoproteases also known as prohormone convertases (PCs). 2The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; GLP, glucagon-like peptide; GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; RIA, radioimmunoassay; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; AcN, acetonitrile; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Ad, adenovirus. 2The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; GLP, glucagon-like peptide; GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; RIA, radioimmunoassay; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; AcN, acetonitrile; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Ad, adenovirus. Three members of the family, PC1/3, PC2, and PC5/6A, are believed to be the principal convertases localized to the granules of the regulated secretory pathway of neuroendocrine cells (1Zhou A.

That the expression of a specific PC ultimately determines the peptide product becomes especially apparent regarding the processing of proglucagon, a prohormone precursor co-expressed with PC1/3 in the intestinal L-cell and with PC2 in the pancreatic α-cell, resulting in entirely different precursor products (11Ugleholdt R. Zhu X. Deacon C.F. Orskov C. Steiner D.F. Holst J.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Zhu X. Zhou A. Dey A. Norrbom C. Carroll R. Zhang C. Laurent V.

Thus, in the islet α-cell, the main peptide product is glucagon, and the principal intestinal peptides are the incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and the intestinotrophic hormone GLP-2.However, processing of the other main incretin hormone precursor pro-glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (proGIP) has so far been unexplored. ProGIP is expressed in the intestinal mucosal K-cell throughout the intestine with the highest density in the proximal jejunum (17Mortensen K. Christensen L.L. Holst J.J. Orskov C. Regul. Pept. 2003; 114: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). ProGIP consists of three domains of which the middle one, corresponding to GIP, is thought to be the only biologically active peptide from the precursor. Despite this, most antisera raised against GIP have been found to cross-react with another larger molecule, designated GIP8000 (18Krarup T. Holst J.J. Regul. Pept. 1984; 9: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Krarup T. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This has been suggested to be a precursor product, although other experiments have concluded differently (20Otte S.C. Mutt V. McIntosh C.H.S. Brown J.C. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1984; 29 (suppl.) (abstr.): 63Google Scholar). We, therefore, decided to define the processing requirements of proGIP using for this PC1/3- and PC2-deficient mice as well as cell lines manipulated with an adenovirus vector overexpression system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—The PC1/3 and PC2 null mutant mice were generated by introducing a targeted mutation in 129sv embryonic stem cells as previously described (12Zhu X. Zhou A. Dey A. Norrbom C. Carroll R. Zhang C. Laurent V. Lindberg I. Ugleholdt R. Holst J.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. A. 1997; 94: 6646-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). 3–5-Month-old PC1/3 and 5–9-month-old PC2 null mice and age-matched controls on a C57BL/6j x 129sv F1 background were used in the study. The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. The animals were euthanized, and intestinal tissue samples were quickly removed, rinsed in PBS, and immediately frozen.Immunohistochemistry—Specimens of upper and lower jejunum and ileum from three wild-type mice and four PC1/3 null mice were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The tissue sections were dewaxed and subjected to antigen-retrieval by microwave irradiation in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) before the immunohistochemical staining. For immunohistochemistry, we used the rabbit PC1/3 antiserum RS-18B7 or PC2 antiserum PC2Pep4, both produced as described in Scopsi et al. (21Scopsi L. Gullo M. Rilke F. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 294-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the monoclonal mouse GIP antiserum 3.65H (a generous gift from Dr. C. H. McIntosh, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). In double staining experiments, PC1/3 antiserum (diluted 1:1000) or PC2 antiserum (diluted 1:10,000) was visualized using biotin anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:200, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) and Texas Red streptavidin (red fluorescence, diluted 1:200, Amersham Biosciences). Simultaneously, the GIP antibody was diluted 1:500 and visualized using digoxigenin-labeled anti mouse antibody (diluted 1:25, Roche Applied Science) and fluorescein-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (diluted 1:25, green fluorescence, Roche Applied Science). For the double staining, we used the Mouse on Mouse (MOM) kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for dilution of antibodies and reagents to allow the use of a mouse primary antibody in mouse tissue.Immunocytochemistry—GH4 cells (4 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were grown on polylysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated 18 × 18-mm glass plates and co-infected with combinations of adenovirus expressing preproGIP and adenovirus expressing PC1/3 or PC2 as described below (infections of cell lines). Cells were then fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Before applying the primary antibodies, cells were incubated in Image IT FX Signal Enhancer according to the manufacturer's instructions to block background staining (Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR). The primary antibodies were the rabbit PC1/3 antiserum RS-18B7 diluted 1:2000, the rabbit antiserum PC2Pep diluted 1:2000 (21Scopsi L. Gullo M. Rilke F. Martin S. Steiner D.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 294-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the monoclonal mouse GIP antiserum 3.65H diluted 1:400. The PC1/3 and PC2 immunoreactive cells were incubated with biotinylated swine anti-rabbit antibody as above, and the GIP immunoreactive cells were incubated with biotin-labeled anti-mouse antibody (DAKO). All immune reactions were then visualized using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences tyramide signal amplification-indirect kit as described by the manufacturer and finished by streptavidin coupled to Texas Red (red fluorescence, Amersham Biosciences).Extraction—Mucosa was scraped of frozen intestinal pieces (∼0.1 g), suspended in ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number P8340), and homogenized in 1% trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml/g of tissue). An equal volume of 12 mol/liter urea was added, and the homogenate was centrifuged. The supernatant was retained for gel filtration. Furthermore, small intestines from PC1/3 null mice and controls were extracted using a boiling method or acidic ethanol previously described (11Ugleholdt R. Zhu X. Deacon C.F. Orskov C. Steiner D.F. Holst J.J. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Holst J.J. Bersani M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 5: 3-22Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When measuring intestinal GIP content in PC2 -/- mice and controls, frozen small intestines were extracted in acidic ethanol as previously described in Holst and Bersani (22Holst J.J. Bersani M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 5: 3-22Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), modified to exclude the urea and ether step. The supernatant was retained for protein measurement.Construction of Adenovirus—An adenovirus construct expressing PC1/3 (AdPC1/3) or PC2 (AdPC2) was previously described in Irminger et al. (23Irminger J.C. Meyer K. Halban P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the pACCMV vector (24Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) was a gift from Ole H. Mortensen (the Panum Institute). cDNA encoding rat preproGIP was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase. The amplified fragment was ligated to the pACTRECMV vector using the EcoRI and HindIII sites. The resulting plasmid was co-transfected with the PBGH plasmid into HEK293 cells using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The PBGH vector (Microbix, Inc.) is a modified adenovirus vector expressing the reverse Tet repressor from the deleted E3 region and contains homologous regions for recombination with the pACTRECMV plasmid. The pACTRECMV plasmid (a generous gift from Prof. C.B. Newgard, Duke University Medical Center) was derived from pACCMV (25Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by insertion of a Tet-responsive element at the 3′ end of the CMV promoter. An adenovirus not encoding a protein (AdNil) was made from co-transfection of the pACCMV and pJM17 plasmid as described in Becker et al. (24Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). After ∼3 weeks, cell lysates were collected, and recombinant E1/E3 deleted virus was cloned by plaque assay. DNA was isolated from the recombinant clone, and the inserted sequence was amplified with the flanking primers: sense, TGGGAGGTCTATATAAGCAG; antisense, TCTCTGTAGGTAGTTTGTCC. The PCR product was purified, and sequence and orientation were verified on an ABI310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The virus stocks were amplified in HEK293 cells and purified on a CsCl gradient. All procedures and the pACCMV vector are described in Becker et al. (24Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The infection titer of the viral stocks was determined using the Adeno-X rapid titer kit (Clontech).Cell Culture—α-TC1.9 (mouse α-cell derived) and GH4 (rat pituitary derived) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Marianne Schiodt (Novo Nordisk, Denmark), and AtT-20 (mouse pituitary) cells were generously donated by Dr. Jens R. Bundgaard (Rigshospitalet, Denmark). AtT-20, α-TC1.9, HEK293, and COS-7 cells were grown in 37 °C at 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 180 units/ml penicillin and 45 μg/ml streptomycin. GH4 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in nutrient mixture (Ham's F-10) with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 180 units/ml penicillin, and 45 μg/ml streptomycin.Isolation of Pancreatic Islets—Mouse and rat islets of Langerhans were isolated after collagenase digestion of pancreatic tissues and prepared as previously described (26Hoy M. Olsen H.L. Bokvist K. Petersen J.S. Gromada J. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2003; 368: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer's specifications, with an additional TRI Reagent and bromochloropropane extraction step. Total RNA was DNase-treated and reverse-transcribed with oligo-dT primers using Fermentas reagents. Q-PCR on islets and cell lines was performed using Stratagene Brilliant QPCR green Master mix on a Stratagene Mx3000P real time thermocycler and the following primers: murine GAPDH sense, CAATGTGTCCGTCGTGGA; murine GAPDH antisense, GATGCCTGCTTCACCACC; rat GAPDH sense, CAGGGCTGCCTTCTCTTGTGA; rat GAPDH antisense, GGCGGAGATGATGACCCTTT; murine PC1/3 sense, ACATGGGGAGAGAATCCTGTAGGCA; murine PC1/3 antisense, CATGGCCTTTGAAGGAGTTCCTTGT; rat PC1/3 sense, TGGAACCAGCACCGTACTGTTGG; rat PC1/3 antisense, TCCACTCCTCTCCTGTCATTCTGGA; murine PC2 sense, TTGATGCAGGTGCCATGGTGAA; murine PC2 antisense, ACTTGTCAAAGCCCACCTTGGAGT; rat PC2 sense, TCGGTGCAGAACCCTGAGAAAAT; rat PC2 antisense, CATTCCTTCAGCAAGCCCTTCTGT. Relative RNA expression was calculated using the formula C = 2(Ctref -Cttarget).Q-PCR on cDNA from PC1/3-deficient and wild-type mice was performed with the following primers: GAPDH sense, CAATGTGTCCGTCGTGGA; GAPDH antisense, GATGCCTGCTTCACCACC; proGIP sense, TGAGTTCCGATCCCATGCTAA; proGIP antisense, CCAGTTCACGAAGTCTTGTTGTC and internal Taqman probes, GAPDH, CGCCTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTAT (5′ marked to 6-carboxy-4,7,2′,4′,5′,7′-hexachlorofluorescein and 3′ marked to BHQ-1); proGIP, CCCTCGACCTCGAGGTCCAAGG (5′ marked to 5-carboxyfluorescein and 3′ marked to BHQ-1). Relative expression levels were calculated using the formula: ratio = EtargetΔCt(control-sample)/ErefΔCtref(control-sample) (27Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24904) Google Scholar). PCR efficiency was determined from a 4 log dilution of wild-type cDNA template. The GAPDH expression was similar in PC1/3-deficient mice and controls.Infections of Cell Lines—Cells (8 × 106) were grown in 15-cm BD Biosciences Falcon™ culture dishes and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with different combinations of adenovirus. AtT-20 and α-TC1.9 cells were incubated with 5 and 50 m.o.i. AdpreproGIP, respectively. GH4 cells were incubated with 7 m.o.i. AdpreproGIP in the presence of 3 m.o.i. AdGFP, 3 m.o.i. AdPC1/3, 3 m.o.i. AdPC2, or both AdPC1/3 (3 m.o.i.) and AdPC2 (3 m.o.i.). Doxycyclin (10 μg/ml medium) was used as an inducer of preproGIP expression. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium, washed in PBS, and scraped off in PBS with protease inhibitor mixture (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number P8340). Cells were then centrifuged (3000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) and reconstituted in assay buffer (here and later, 40 mmol/liter sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% w/v human serum albumin, 0.1 mol/liter NaCl, 0.6 mmol/liter thimerosal, and 10 mmol/liter EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture, sonicated for 3 × 15 s, and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was retained for gel filtration.Secretion Experiment—GH4 cells (1 × 106) were grown in 35-mm polylysine-coated culture dishes and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with 7 m.o.i. AdpreproGIP and 3 m.o.i. AdPC1/3, AdPC2, or AdNil as described above. Cells were washed 4 times with PBS and incubated for 10 min in serum-free medium (1 ml/dish) containing 0.1% human serum albumin with ionomycin (10 μmol/liter) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (0.15 μmol/liter) as secretagogues or without secretagogues. PBS and media were prewarmed to 37 °C. Triplicate dishes were used for all incubation conditions. After incubation, cell culture dishes were cooled on ice, medium was withdrawn, and cells were washed 4 times in cold PBS. Cells were scraped off in PBS containing 0.1% human serum albumin and protease inhibitor mixture, centrifuged, and sonicated as described above. Media and cell lysates were analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the GIP antibody R65.Flow Cytometry—To obtain GIP antibody for flow cytometry, 100 μg of 3.65H monoclonal antibody peritoneal exudate was conjugated using Alexa Fluor® 647 monoclonal antibody labeling kit (Molecular Probes). For analysis, GH4 cells (4 × 106 cells/10 cm dish) were infected with 7 m.o.i. AdpreproGIP and 3 m.o.i. AdGFP or with 10 m.o.i. AdPC1/3 as control. Doxycyclin (10 μg/ml) was added as an inducer of preproGIP expression. The protocol for intracellular staining has been described previously and modified to exclude a peptide incubation step (28Christensen J.P. Kauffmann S.O. Thomsen A.R. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, loosened with EDTA, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using 0.5% saponin, and stained using Alexa Fluor® 647-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3.65H at 1:100 dilution. Cells were then washed and run on a FACSCalibur system (BD Biosciences), and results were analyzed using Cell Quest software. For analysis, cells were gated on GIP-positive cells. AdPC1/3-infected cells were used to define cut-off values.GIP Receptor Signaling—Receptor signaling experiments were carried out using COS-7 cells transfected with the human GIP receptor. Transfection of the COS-7 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Brauner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For the cAMP accumulation assay, the transiently transfected cells (2.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h with 2 μCi/ml of [3H]adenine in 0.5 ml of growth medium per well. Cells were washed twice in HBS buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), supplemented with 0.75 mm NaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and then 0.5 ml of HBS buffer supplemented with 1 mm phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) was added with increasing concentrations of the native porcine GIP (Bachem) or two different concentrations (30 and 90 pm, as determined by the N-terminal assay (98171)) of GIP immunoreactivity obtained from gel filtration of GH4 cells co-transfected with preproGIP and PC1/3 or PC2. The gel filtration fractions used for further analysis represented the GIP standard position. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were placed on ice, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid supplemented with 0.1 mm cAMP and 0.1 mm ATP for 30 min. The lysate mixtures were loaded onto Dowex columns (Bio-Rad), which were washed with 2 ml of water and placed onto the top of alumina columns (Sigma) and washed again with 10 ml of water. The alumina columns were eluted with 6 ml of 0.1 m imidazole into 15 ml of scintillation fluid (Highsafe III) and counted. Columns were re-used up to 15 times. Dowex columns were regenerated by adding 10 ml of 2 n HCl followed by 10 ml of water; the alumina columns were regenerated by adding 2 ml of 1 m imidazole, 10 ml of 0.1 m imidazole, and finally 5 ml of water. Determinations were made in duplicate.Gel Filtration—Acidic intestinal extracts were applied to a K16/100 Sephadex G50, fine-grade column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 0.5 mol/liter acetic acid. Cell lysates were applied to a similar column equilibrated and eluted with assay buffer (described above). For both columns, flow rates were 16–21 ml/h at 4 °C, and sample size never exceeded 2% of total column volume. 125I-Labeled albumin and 22NaCl were added in trace amounts for internal calibration. The coefficient of distribution (Kd) was calculated using the formula Kd = (Ve - V0)/Vi where Ve is the elution position of the peak in question, V0 is the elution volume of 125I-labeled albumin, and Vi is the inner volume of the column, determined as the difference between the elution volumes of 22NaCl and V0. When the processing profile could not be foreseen, as in extracts from PC1/3-deficient mice and cell lysates, only 22NaCl was added, and the coefficient of distribution (Kd) was calculated from this tracer and previous calibrations. Intestinal murine and rat GIP-(1–42) were used as standards, extracted similarly to the extracts and cell lysates investigated. Furthermore, synthetic rat GIP-(34–42) was applied as a standard (Schafer-N). Fractions eluted with acetic acid were dried in a vacuum centrifuge (Heto-Holten A/S, Alleroed, Denmark) and reconstituted in assay buffer. All fractions were analyzed by RIA.Reverse Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—Relevant fractions obtained by gel filtration of cell lysates were subjected to HPLC. 1 ml of gel filtration fractions eluted in GIP-(1–42) and GIP-(34–42) standard positions were acidified by 10% trifluoroacetic acid (Rathburn, Walkerburn, UK), applied to an HPLC Vydac C18 column (Mikrolab Aarhus A/S, Hoejbjerg, Denmark), and eluted with a segmented gradient of acetonitrile (AcN; Rathburn) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0–10% AcN over 2.5 min, 10–60% AcN over 50 min, 60–75% AcN over 2.5 min at 1 ml/min). Eluted fractions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge, reconstituted, and analyzed by RIA. Rat GIP-(1–42) extracted from proximal jejunum as previously described (22Holst J.J. Bersani M. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 5: 3-22Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and synthetic GIP-(34–42) (Schafer-N) were used as a standards.RIA—Three different RIAs for GIP immunoreactivity were used. Briefly, antiserum RIC34 (30Morgan L.M. Morris B.A. Marks V. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1978; 15: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Linda M. Morgan, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK) is raised to natural porcine GIP and recognizes N-terminal truncated forms and is here shown to also recognize extended forms (see Fig. 4). It is referred to as “side-viewing.” Antiserum 98171 is directed toward the N-terminal GIP-(1–10) and binds N- and C-terminal-extended forms (Fig. 4) and require an intact N terminus (31Deacon C.F.

Furthermore, it does not recognize the so-called GIP8000. Human GIP was used in all assays for standard and tracer preparation.Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. unless indicated otherwise. Statistical significance was analyzed by Student's t test for unpaired values of equal variance or by Mann-Whitney U test when analyzing the secretion ratios within a group of transfected cells. Comparison of three samples was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Values were considered significantly different when p < 0.05.RESULTSStructure of the GIP Precursor, GIP"
https://openalex.org/W2111541528,"This study was designed to define the molecular epitopes of dystrophin-actin interaction and to directly compare the actin binding properties of dystrophin and utrophin. According to our data, dystrophin and utrophin both bound alongside actin filaments with submicromolar affinities. However, the molecular epitopes involved in actin binding differed between the two proteins. In utrophin, the amino-terminal domain and an adjacent string of the first 10 spectrin-like repeats more fully recapitulated the activities measured for full-length protein. The homologous region of dystrophin bound actin with low affinity and near 1:1 stoichiometry as previously measured for the isolated amino-terminal, tandem (CH) domain. In contrast, a dystrophin construct including a cluster of basic spectrin-like repeats and spanning from the amino terminus through repeat 17, bound actin with properties most similar to full-length dystrophin. Dystrophin and utrophin both stabilized preformed actin filaments from forced depolymerization with similar efficacies but did not appear to compete for binding sites on actin. We also found that dystrophin binding to F-actin was markedly sensitive to increasing ionic strength, although utrophin binding was unaffected. Although dystrophin and utrophin are functionally homologous actin-binding proteins, these results indicate that their respective modes of contact with actin filaments are markedly different. Finally, we reassessed the abundance of dystrophin in striated muscle using full-length protein as the standard and measured greater than 10-fold higher values than previously reported.

Finally, we reassessed the abundance of dystrophin in striated muscle using full-length protein as the standard and measured greater than 10-fold higher values than previously reported. Dystrophin and utrophin are homologous proteins with similar interacting partners. By providing a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, dystrophin functions to maintain the integrity of the cell membrane during muscle contraction. Consequently, genetic ablation of dystrophin leads to increased fragility in the muscle membrane and results in the pathologies observed in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies and some forms of cardiomyopathy. The functional role of utrophin is not completely understood. However, utrophin overexpression in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse has been shown to correct all known parameters of the dystrophic phenotype (1Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Notably, utrophin overexpression rescued the mechanical linkage between costameric actin and the sarcolemma of the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse muscle (2Rybakova I.N. Patel J.R. Davies K.E. Yurchenco P.D. Ervasti J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Like other members of the spectrin superfamily of proteins, both dystrophin and utrophin interact with actin via the amino-terminal tandem calponin homology (CH) 2The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; Dys, dystrophin; Utr, utrophin. 2The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; Dys, dystrophin; Utr, utrophin. actin-binding domain (3Way M.

Additionally, in both dystrophin and utrophin, the spectrin-like repeats of the rod domain have been shown to contribute to actin binding. According to our recent study, the first 10 spectrin-like repeats of utrophin increase the affinity and capacity of its amino-terminal domain for actin (7Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23018-23023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The actin binding activity of the homologous region of dystrophin has not been investigated yet. However, a cluster of basic repeats 11–17 of dystrophin was shown to bind actin independently of its amino-terminal domain (8Amann K.J. Guo W.X.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The homologous repeats in utrophin are acidic and exhibited no actin binding activity (8Amann K.J. Guo W.X.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In spectrin, a protein crucial for the stability of erythrocyte membranes, the very first repeat of the rod domain contributes to tandem CH domain association with actin (9Li X. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Actin-binding sites distributed throughout the amino-terminal and rod domains of spectrin, utrophin, and dystrophin create the extended contact with actin filament, consequently providing more effective mechanical stabilization of the cell membrane. Evaluation of how much of the dystrophin rod domain is involved in association with actin is therefore of interest from many perspectives. First, it will contribute to the understanding of diverse actin-binding mechanisms, and how particular spectrin-like repeats are modified to serve different functional requirements of the proteins. Second, mapping the molecular epitopes involved in association with actin and side-by-side comparison of dystrophin and utrophin with regard to the actin binding activities of the proteins may aid in designing the optimal utrophin construct to replace dystrophin in muscle. The actin binding properties of full-length utrophin and a series of truncated constructs were detailed in our recent publication (7Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23018-23023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The actin binding characteristics are also available for the isolated amino-terminal and middle rod domains of dystrophin, as well as full-length protein associated with the glycoprotein complex (3Way M. Pope B. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Weeds A.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J.

However, the finding that α1-syntrophin, a component of the glycoprotein complex, binds actin prompts the evaluation of actin binding characteristics of dystrophin in the absence of any potential contribution by its associated proteins (12Iwata Y. Pan Y. Yoshida T. Hanada H. Shigekawa M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Iwata Y. Sampaolesi M. Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed full-length mouse dystrophin and characterized its actin binding properties by high speed sedimentation and PRODAN-labeled F-actin depolymerization assays. Using full-length dystrophin as a standard we measured the absolute dystrophin content in striated muscle of control mice at more than 10-fold greater than the dystrophin content of control muscle estimated previously (14Hoffman E.P. Brown R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3569) Google Scholar). To define the molecular epitopes of dystrophin-actin interaction, we further generated two dystrophin fragments encoding the amino-terminal domain and 10 or 17 spectrin-like repeats. A side-by-side comparison of full-length dystrophin and utrophin and dystrophin fragments, lead us to conclude that dystrophin and utrophin are functionally homologous actin-binding proteins but act through distinct modes of contact. Proteins—Full-length dystrophin was derived from the transgenic expression vector pMDA, encoding mouse dystrophin cDNA (15Cox G.A. Cole N.M. Matsumura K. Phelps S.F. Hauschka S.D. Campbell K.P. Faulkner J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The first 1.2 kb of dystrophin sequence was PCR-amplified from pMDA using the following set of primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) 5′-GCGGCCGCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCTTTGGTGGGAAGAA-3′and 5′-GCGCCCAACTAGTTGACTTCCTAACTGTAGAACATTAC-3′. The forward primer was designed with the FLAG epitope (underlined) in-frame with the dystrophin coding sequence. The PCR product was sequenced and inserted into the EcoR1 and SpeI sites of pFastBac1 transfer plasmid (Invitrogen), producing the intermediate plasmid. A 12.5-kb SpeI fragment encoding the remaining 3′-portion of the dystrophin cDNA was excised from pMDA with SpeI and added into the intermediate plasmid to produce pFast-Bac1 vector encoding full-length mouse dystrophin with the amino-terminal FLAG epitope. A DNA fragment encoding the amino terminus and 10 or 17 spectrin-like repeats of dystrophin were PCR-amplified from the pFastBac1 vector containing the full-length mouse dystrophin sequence. The sequence-verified PCR products were ligated into pFastBac1 transfer plasmid. The resulting pFastBac1 vectors encoding full-length dystrophin and dystrophin fragments were used for the site-specific transposition of an expression cassette into bacmid. Baculovirus strains prepared from the recombinant bacmids were used to infect SF9 cell monolayers for dystrophin protein expression. Recombinant dystrophin proteins were isolated from infected insect cell lysates on anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) as previously described for the purification of full-length FLAG-tag utrophin (2Rybakova I.N. Patel J.R. Davies K.E. Yurchenco P.D. Ervasti J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse utrophin was expressed in the baculovirus expression system as described previously (2Rybakova I.N. Patel J.R. Davies K.E. Yurchenco P.D. Ervasti J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Lyophilized rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton and reconstituted according to manufacturer's instructions. Hydrodynamic Analysis—Measurements of the sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius as well as the calculation of the native molecular weight and frictional coefficient of dystrophin proteins were performed as described previously (8Amann K.J. Guo W.X.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Actin Binding Analysis—The actin binding properties of dystrophin proteins were measured using the previously described high speed cosedimentation assay (5Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing amounts of purified protein incubated with 6 μm muscle F-actin were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The amount of free and bound protein was determined densitometrically from Coomassie Blue-stained gels of resulting supernatants and F-actin pellet fractions. Binding data were fitted to a hyperbolic binding equation by non-linear regression analysis (17Brooks S.P.J. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). PRODAN Actin Depolymerization Assay—PRODAN-labeled actin (18Marriott G. Zechel K. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6214-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was the kind gift of Dr. G. Marriott (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). PRODAN-actin filaments assembled alone or in the presence of dystrophin or utrophin were induced to depolymerize by dilution to 0.1 μm in low salt buffer conditions. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C in an SLM-AMINCO AB2 fluorescence spectrophotometer (ThermoElectron) at an excitation wavelength of 385 + 4nm and an emission wavelength of 465 + 4nm. Quantitation of Dystrophin Protein Expression in Muscle—0.5 g of cardiac or skeletal muscle of C57BL/10 control mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were pulverized in a liquid nitrogen and solubilized in 2 ml of 1% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The samples were incubated for 2 min at 100 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The protein concentration of the resulting supernatants was measured with Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Nitrocellulose transfers containing various loads of total protein were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of mAb Dys2 (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle, United Kingdom), and immunoreactivity was detected with 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and autoradiography. A standard curve of purified recombinant dystrophin was included on transfers. The intensities of immune signal were analyzed densitometrically. We have previously characterized the actin binding properties of dystrophin in dystrophin-glycoprotein complex purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (5Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28771-28778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To examine the dystrophin/actin interaction in the absence of any potential contribution by its associated proteins and to directly compare dystrophin and utrophin actin binding activities, we expressed full-length mouse dystrophin in the baculovirus expression system as was previously described for utrophin (2Rybakova I.N. Patel J.R. Davies K.E. Yurchenco P.D. Ervasti J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As for utrophin, dystrophin was designed with the FLAG epitope on its amino terminus and therefore purified on anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Fig. 1A). Gel filtration chromatography in combination with density gradient centrifugation revealed that purified dystrophin was composed of elongated monomers in the solution (Table 1). We further subjected increasing amounts of the purified protein to high speed cosedimentation with 6 μm F-actin. To directly compare dystrophin and utrophin with regard to the actin binding activity of each protein, the experiments were performed in parallel with full-length utrophin. Fitting the binding data obtained from three independent experiments to the hyperbolic binding equation showed that dystrophin and utrophin bound actin with similar Kds of 0.32 ± 0.04 μm and 0.29 ± 0.1 μm, respectively (Fig. 1B). However, the Bmax values for dystrophin (0.037 ± 0.003) and utrophin (0.077 ± 0.01) indicated that the proteins differed in extent of lateral association with actin. Thus, dystrophin appeared to occupy 27 ± 2 actin monomers on actin filament versus 13 ± 2 actin monomers bridged by utrophin. To analyze whether this difference made dystrophin more efficient in stabilizing actin filaments, we directly compared the effect of each protein on forced depolymerization of PRODAN-labeled F-actin. Considering the differences in Bmax values, the experiments were performed at 1:12 and 1:24 molar ratios measured for saturable binding to actin for utrophin and dystrophin, respectively. PRODAN-labeled actin depolymerization analysis demonstrated that dystrophin and utrophin protected actin filaments with similar efficacies and that the protective effect was dependent on the dystrophin and utrophin:actin molar ratio. At 1 dystrophin or utrophin presented per every 12 actin monomers, the protective effect lasted over a wide time range (Fig. 2A). At 1:24 molar ratio, both proteins had a smaller effect on actin filament decay (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Physical properties of dystrophin proteinsProteinDysN-R10DysN-R17DysPredicted Mr170,241258,188427,797Denatured Mr168,537245,094396,641Native Mr177,368232,106441,867Stokes radius, nm6.67.59.7Sedimentation coefficient, s6.37.210.6Frictional coefficient1.761.841.92 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Effect of dystrophin and utrophin on forced depolymerization of actin filaments. 1 μm PRODAN-labeled F-actin was preincubated alone (Actin) or in the presence of dystrophin or utrophin.

Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23018-23023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that spectrin repeats 1–10 of dystrophin also may contribute to its actin binding activity. Alternatively, dystrophin may bind actin through two distinct sites located on its amino terminus and middle rod domain. A recombinant dystrophin fragment corresponding to the middle rod domain of dystrophin and encoding a cluster of basic spectrin-like repeats 11–17 has been shown to bind actin in a NaCl-sensitive manner through an electrostatic interaction (8Amann K.J. Guo W.X.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, full-length dystrophin binding to actin decreased 50% in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, whereas the utrophin-actin interaction was unaffected (Fig. 3A). In view of the differences between dystrophin and utrophin actin binding properties, we further evaluated whether they compete for the binding sites on actin filaments. Because Dys and Utr are indistinguishable on Coomassie-Blue-stained gel (Fig. 1A) and because the utrophin fragment corresponding to the amino terminus of utrophin and 10 spectrin-like repeats of its rod domain (UtrN-R10) recapitulates the actin binding activity of full-length utrophin, we tested whether UtrN-R10 could inhibit dystrophin binding to actin. UtrN-R10 had no effect on dystrophin binding to actin, because the amount of dystrophin cosedimented with actin did not change over a range of UtrN-R10 concentrations (Fig. 3B). Similarly, dystrophin was found to have no effect on UtrN-R10 binding to actin (Fig. 3B). To investigate how much of the dystrophin rod domain is necessary for high affinity binding measured for full-length dystrophin-actin interaction, we generated two dystrophin fragments, DysN-R10 and DysN-R17 (Fig. 4). DysN-R10 was designed to correspond to the extended actin-binding site of utrophin (UtrN-R10) and therefore encoded the amino terminus of dystrophin and 10 spectrin-like repeats of its rod domain. DysN-R17 spanned from the amino terminus through the cluster of basic repeats 11–17 that display intrinsic actin binding activity (8Amann K.J. Guo W.X.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic analysis showed that both proteins purified as soluble monomers of elongated shape (Table 1). Cosedimentation of DysN-R10 and DysN-R17 with F-actin demonstrated that both dystrophin fragments bound actin in a saturable manner yet with dramatically different properties (Fig. 5A). DysN-R10 bound actin with a Kd of 13.7 ± 7.1 μm (Fig. 5B), similar to that previously measured for the isolated amino-terminal tandem CH domain of dystrophin (10Renley B.A. Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In comparison, a Kd of 0.76 ± 0.39 μm, measured for DysN-R17 binding to actin, was comparable to the Kd value obtained for full-length Dys. The data shown in Fig. 5 strongly suggest that dystrophin requires a cluster of basic spectrin-like repeats to bind actin with high affinity and high capacity. The plots of Kd and Bmax versus spectrin repeat number (Fig. 5, B and C) demonstrate that DysN-R10 lacking the cluster of basic repeats bound to actin with low affinity and a 1:1 stoichiometry analogous to the isolated amino-terminal tandem CH domain of dystrophin and further support the importance of repeats 11–17 for dystrophin-actin interaction.FIGURE 5Recombinant dystrophin constructs binding to F-actin. A, increasing amounts of DysN-R10, DysN-R17, and full-length Dys were incubated with 6 μm F-actin and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The amount of free and bound proteins was determined densitometrically from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE loaded with equal volumes of resulting supernatants and pellets. Symbols denote the data from three independent experiments, and lines represent the fitted values. Values (n = 3; ±S.D.) for Kd (B) and Bmax (C) calculated from the data in A were plotted against the number of spectrin-like repeats present with the amino-terminal domain. The data indicated for 0 repeats report the values for the isolated amino-terminal domain of dystrophin (Dys246) as measured previously (10Renley B.A. Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also made use of the purified full-length dystrophin as a standard to measure the absolute dystrophin content in the striated muscle of control mice by quantitative Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle exhibited similar dystrophin abundances of 0.026 ± 0.014% and 0.026 ± 0.003%, respectively. The value of dystrophin level in skeletal muscle measured in this study was more than 10-fold greater than the dystrophin content of cardiac muscle estimated previously (14Hoffman E.P. Brown R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3569) Google Scholar). Transgenic utrophin overexpression has been shown to correct all known phenotypic parameters associated with dystrophin deficiency in mdx mice (1Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A widespread perception, however, is that utrophin levels must greatly exceed the content of dystrophin in normal muscle to effect full rescue from the dystrophic phenotype. We believe this perception is largely based on an early quantitative estimate (14Hoffman E.P. Brown R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3569) Google Scholar) of dystrophin abundance in normal cardiac muscle (0.002% of total muscle protein) and our own measurements of utrophin expression (2Rybakova I.N. Patel J.R. Davies K.E. Yurchenco P.D. Ervasti J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1512-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in normal (0.0006%) and mdx skeletal muscle (0.0013%), as well as in the Fiona line of transgenic mdx mice overexpressing utrophin to levels (0.014%) that fully corrected the mdx phenotype (1Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). From these measurements, it can reasonably be concluded that up to 7-fold greater levels of utrophin (0.014/0.002%) may be necessary to compensate for dystrophin deficiency. However, a short 60-kDa dystrophin fragment was used as a standard to determine the expression level of 427-kDa full-length protein by Western blot analysis in the early measurement of dystrophin content in cardiac muscle (14Hoffman E.P. Brown R.H. Kunkel L.M. Cell. 1987; 51: 919-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3569) Google Scholar). Although state-of-the-art at the time, the much smaller protein fragment likely transferred more efficiently than full-length dystrophin, raising concern that this measurement underestimated the content of dystrophin in cardiac muscle. Using full-length protein as a standard, we determined that dystrophin abundance in normal cardiac muscle (0.026 ± 0.003%) and skeletal muscle (0.026 ± 0.014%) was more than 10-fold greater than the previous estimate (0.002%). Our measurements more closely agree with the quantitation of dystrophin abundance (19Ohlendieck K. Ervasti J.M. Snook J.B. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) in highly purified sarcolemma vesicles (2%) and with estimates that sarcolemmal proteins comprise 1% of total muscle protein based on the abundance of sodium channels in total muscle homogenates and purified sarcolemmal vesicles (20Barchi R.L. Weigele J.B. J. Physiol. 1979; 295: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Most importantly, our data indicate that up-regulation of utrophin in mdx muscle (0.0013/0.026% = 5% of wild type dystrophin levels) is below the lowest level of transgenic dystrophin expression (20% of wild type) found to rescue the dystrophic phenotype (21Phelps S.F. Hauser M.A. Cole N.M. Rafael J.A. Hinkle R.T. Faulkner J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). When utrophin expresses to levels approaching that of dystrophin in normal muscle (0.014/0.026% = 54%) as in the Fiona line of transgenic mice, it can fully rescue the mdx phenotype (1Tinsley J. Deconinck N. Fisher R. Kahn D. Phelps S. Gillis J.M. Davies K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The direct comparison of actin binding properties of dystrophin and utrophin demonstrated that they are functionally interchangeable. First, both proteins bound actin with similar submicromolar affinities (Fig. 1B). Second, although a significantly higher Bmax value measured for utrophin/actin interaction implies that utrophin bridges less actin monomers, forced depolymerization of preformed PRODAN-labeled actin filaments demonstrated that dystrophin and utrophin inhibited actin disassembly in a similar fashion (Fig. 2). One difference between dystrophin and utrophin, however, is the molecular epitopes involved in interaction with actin. As we demonstrated previously, the first 10 spectrin-like repeats of utrophin failed to bind actin (7Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23018-23023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, their presence in cis with the amino-terminal domain is necessary for the full actin binding activity of utrophin (Fig. 7). Although the equivalent region of dystrophin did not alter the actin binding properties of the adjacent amino-terminal domain, the addition of the repeats 11–17 to the DysN-R10 increased the affinity for actin almost 18-fold and provided more widely spaced distribution of dystrophin along the actin filament (Figs. 5 and 7). The dramatic changes in Kd and Bmax values with the addition of repeats 11–17 to DysN-R10 argue for the necessity of this region of rod domain for the full actin binding activity measured for dystrophin. The salt sensitivity of dystrophin-actin interaction further validates the importance of spectrin-like repeats 11–17 for dystrophin actin binding activity. Indeed, this region of the dystrophin rod domain represents a cluster of basic repeats (Fig. 7) and was shown to bind actin via electrostatic interaction (8Amann K.J. Guo W.X.A. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that full-length dystrophin binding to actin was ∼50% abolished in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 3A). Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex cosedimentation with F-actin was also found to be sensitive to increasing NaCl concentrations, and was about 40% inhibited in 0.5 m NaCl (5Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and full-length recombinant dystrophin bound actin with similar Kd and Bmax values (Fig. 7). These results suggest that neither α1-syntrophin, or any other dystrophin-associated protein contributed to the actin binding characteristics previously measured for native dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (5Rybakova I.N. Amann K.J. Ervasti J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A considerable amount of syntrophins is recovered in the soluble fraction after muscle homogenization (13Iwata Y. Sampaolesi M. Shigekawa M. Wakabayashi S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and does not copurify with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (22McDearmon E.L. Combs A.C. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35078-35086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the soluble syntrophins were shown to be able to interact with actin and inhibit actin binding to myosin. These findings, in combination with our results, lead us to suggest that dystrophin and actin binding activities of syntrophins could be mutually exclusive. The actin binding data obtained for the native dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, various dystrophin fragments, and for full-length protein fit well to the model in which dystrophin binds laterally along an actin filament through the concerted effect of two distinct low affinity binding sites. In contrast, utrophin interacts with multiple actin monomers via a single contiguous actin binding domain spanning from the amino terminus through repeat 10 of the rod domain (Fig. 7). The rod domains are the least conserved regions (35%) between dystrophin and utrophin (23Pearce M. Blake D.J. Tinsley J.M. Byth B.C. Campbell L. Monaco A.P. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which may give rise to different modes of actin binding by spectrin-like repeats. In contrast, the amino-terminal tandem CH domains of dystrophin and utrophin are 80% identical (24Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J. Roche A. Byth B.C. Knight A.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Suthers G.K. Love D.R. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and were found to bind actin similarly (Fig. 7). Interestingly, different modes of contact were also shown for the interaction of cysteine rich/carboxyl-terminal domains of dystrophin and utrophin with β-dystroglycan (25Ishikawa-Sakurai M. Yoshida M. Imamura M. Davies K.E. Ozawa E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the cysteine-rich/carboxyl-terminal domains are 88% homologous between the two proteins, the regions involved in β-dystroglycan interaction were found to be only 66% similar (24Tinsley J.M. Blake D.J. Roche A. Byth B.C. Knight A.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Suthers G.K. Love D.R. Edwards Y.H. Davies K.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Lastly, we did not observe any effect of dystrophin on utrophin interaction with actin and vice versa (Fig. 3B). This finding suggests that both proteins could bind the same actin filament in vivo, supplementing one another. Although dystrophin and utrophin are expressed in muscle in a mutually exclusive manner, both proteins are present at the sarcolemma during the short period of neonatal development when dystrophin replaces utrophin (26Clerk A. Strong P.N. Sewry C.A. Development (Camb.). 1992; 114: 395-402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Clerk A. Morriss G.E. Dubowitz V. Davies K.E. Sewry C.A. Histochem. J. 1993; 25: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Radojevic V. Burgunder J.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 300: 447-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The noncompetitive actin binding via different modes of contact may therefore serve to protect the sarcolemma of increasingly active muscle from mechanical injuries during this transitional stage. The rod domain of dystrophin is frequently speculated to function as a molecular spring or shock absorber. However, the molecular basis for these functions has not been proposed. We hypothesize that the two independent actin-binding sites employed by dystrophin may hold important clues to its mechanical function in vivo. For example, Wachsstock et al. (29Wachsstock D.H. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that multiple, rapidly rearranging cross-links can explain the loading rate-dependent, viscoelastic properties of actin filaments cross-linked by α-actinin. Likewise, the presence of two low affinity binding sites (likely binding and unbinding very rapidly) may enable the F-actin/dystrophin/sarcolemma linkage to respond elastically to rapid muscle stretches while yielding in a more fluid manner under prolonged strains of substantially lower magnitude (during muscle cell growth, or osmotic cell swelling with exercise, for example). Assuming that some portions of the dystrophin rod domain function as elastic elements, the cluster of actin-binding, basic rod domain repeats could act as a molecular “shock absorber” to dampen elastic recoil during contraction or stretch. In this role, the electrostatic binding of the dystrophin middle rod domain would be less sensitive (relative to a classical “lock and key” ligand/receptor interaction) to changes in binding interface orientation that would likely occur with its extension during muscle stretch. In contrast, our data indicate that utrophin lacks the basic middle rod domain and therefore also the capacity to function as a shock absorber. Given its single contiguous actin binding domain spanning from the amino terminus through repeat 10 (7Rybakova I.N. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23018-23023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and its high expression during embryonic/fetal development, we hypothesize that utrophin may normally function as a molecular ruler to help define the length of costameric actin filaments during muscle development. The availability of full-length dystrophin and utrophin through expression in the baculovirus system now makes possible studies to characterize the mechanical properties of each protein through single molecule analyses (30Rief M. Pascual J. Saraste M. Gaub H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Jeffrey Chamberlain for the full-length mouse dystrophin cDNA (pMDA) and Dr. Gerard Marriott for providing PRODAN-labeled actin, access to his fluorescence spectrophotometer, and helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2095283725,"β-Catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, is a coactivator of human androgen receptor (hAR) transcriptional activity. Here, we show that Wnt signaling also influences androgen-mediated signaling through its ability to regulate hAR mRNA and protein in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Three functional LEF-1/TCF binding sites lie within the promoter of the hAR gene as shown by CHIP assays that captured β-catenin-bound chromatin from Wnt-activated LNCaP cells. Chimeric reporter vectors that use the hAR gene promoter to drive luciferase expression confirmed that these LEF-1/TCF binding elements are able to confer robust upregulation of luciferase expression when stimulated by Wnt-1 or by transfection with β-catenin and that dominant-negative TCF or mutations within the dominant TCF-binding element abrogated the response. Semi-quantitative and real time RT-PCR assays confirmed that Wnt activation upregulates hAR mRNA in PCa cells. In contrast, hAR protein expression was strongly suppressed by Wnt activation. The reduction of hAR protein is consistent with evidence that Wnt signaling increased phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target, MDM2 that promotes degradation of hAR protein through a proteasomal pathway. These data indicate that the hAR gene is a direct target of LEF-1/TCF transcriptional regulation in PCa cells but also show that the expression of the hAR protein is suppressed by a degradation pathway regulated by cross-talk of Wnt to Akt that is likely mediated by Wnt-directed degradation of the B regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase, PP2A."

There are seven serotypes of BoNT, termed A–G. BoNT serotype A and serotype E cleave SNAP25 at residues 197–198 and 180–181, respectively. Unlike other zinc proteases, the BoNTs recognize extended regions of SNAP25 for cleavage. The basis for this extended substrate recognition and specificity is unclear.

Rossetto O. Tonello F. Montecucco C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 257-274PubMed Google Scholar). There are seven distinguishable BoNT serotypes, A–G, with serotypes A, B, and E responsible for most natural human intoxications (2Marvaud J.C. Raffestin S. Popoff M.R. C. R. Biol. 2002; 325 (discussion 879–883): 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). BoNT serotypes are defined by the specificity of antibody neutralization where antibodies that neutralize one serotype fail to neutralize other serotypes. There are two licensed vaccines against botulism, a pentavalent vaccine against serotypes A–E (3Middlebrook J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 383: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and a heptavalent vaccine against serotypes A–G (4Robinson R.F. Nahata M.C. Ann. Pharmacother. 2003; 37: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, these vaccines are produced from chemically inactivated BoNT produced in C. botulinum and are currently in limited supply. Upon intoxication, BoNT intoxication has significant morbidity and mortality (5Shapiro R.L. Hatheway C. Swerdlow D.L. Ann. Intern Med. 1998; 129: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 6Arnon S.S. Midura T.F. Damus K. Wood R.M. Chin J. Lancet. 1978; 1: 1273-1277Abstract PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a need to develop more efficient vaccines and therapies against botulism.BoNTs are zinc proteases that elicit flaccid paralysis by inhibiting the fusion of neurotransmitter-carrying vesicles to the plasma membrane of peripheral neurons. BoNTs are ∼150-kDa single chain proteins that are activated by proteolysis to generate disulfide-linked di-chain proteins. BoNTs are organized into three functional domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain (light chain, LC), an internal translocation domain (heavy chain, HCT), and a C-terminal receptor binding domain (heavy chain, HCR) (7Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 8Poulain B. Humeau Y. Ann. Readapt. Med. Phys. 2003; 46: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). BoNTs enter neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The tropism for neurons is due to the affinity of BoNT for receptors on peripheral neurons (7Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). BoNT-receptor interactions are sometimes enhanced by gangliosides, which act as co-receptors (9Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the acidic endosome, the HCT inserts into the endosome membrane to generate a pore that allows the catalytic LC to translocate into the cytosol (10Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). LCs cleave neurotransmitter vesicle fusion proteins. BoNT/A cleaves SNAP25 between residues 197 and 198, and BoNT/E cleaves SNAP25 between residues 180 and 181, inactivating SNAP25 on the plasma membrane (11Tonello F. Morante S. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). BoNT/C cleaves both SNAP25 and syntaxin (12Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), whereas the other BoNT serotypes and tetanus toxin cleave the vesicle-associated membrane protein (13Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Benfenati F. Poulain B. Montecucco C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 710: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Previous studies have addressed the specificity of substrate recognition to define residues and regions of SNAP25 that are required for cleavage by BoNT. Several amino acids that surround the scissile bond contribute to efficient cleavage of SNAP25 (14Schmidt J.J. Bostian K.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Montecucco and coworkers (15Washbourne P. Pellizzari R. Baldini G. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) defined an amino acid repeat motif within SNAP25, termed the SNARE motif, which correlated to substrate recognition, whereas Binz and coworkers (16Vaidyanathan V.V. Yoshino K. Jahnz M. Dorries C. Bade S. Nauenburg S. Niemann H. Binz T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) defined regions and residues of SNAP25 required for optimal cleavage by BoNT/A, BoNT/E, and BoNT/C. Although the first co-crystal of BoNT/B and vesicle-associated membrane protein did not provide electron density of substrate (17Hanson M.A. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) defined an α-exosite and β-exosite within SNAP25 that were implicated in substrate recognition. This study provides a reference for the functional mapping of substrate determinants required for catalysis.Relative to thermolysin, the BoNTs recognize a larger region of substrate for optimal cleavage. The large regions required for substrate recognition of vesicle fusion proteins, such as SNAP25, may be due to the limited structure of the SNARE proteins which may require an extended contact region for high affinity binding. There is limited understanding of how the SNAP25 is recognized for specific cleavage, which prompted a detailed study to identify how these BoNT/A and BoNT/E recognize SNAP25.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction and Protein ExpressionBoNT LC/A and LC/E were constructed by amplifying DNA encoding LC fragments from Clostridium botulinum serotype A1 Hall strain (20Siegel L.S. Metzger J.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 606-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and EBegula (21Poulet S. Hauser D. Quanz M. Niemann H. Popoff M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), (E. A. Johnson, University of Wisconsin-Madison) respectively, and subcloning into pET-15b. Plasmids encoding LCs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL (Stratagene). Protein expression was achieved by culturing E. coli at 16 °C overnight with 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as previously described (22Baldwin M.R. Bradshaw M. Johnson E.A. Barbieri J.T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were broken with a French press. His-LCs were purified sequentially from cell lysates by nitrilotriacetic acid-affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and DEAE chromatography. SNAP25 was constructed by amplifying DNA encoding the indicated region of SNAP25 and subcloning into pGEX-2T. Plasmids encoding SNAP25 were transformed into E. coli TG1. Protein expression was achieved by culturing E. coli at 30 °C for 2 h with 0.75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST-SNAP25 was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences).Mutagenesis of SNAP25Random and directed mutagenesis was performed to achieve saturation mutagenesis of SNAP25. Mutations are designated N(XXX)N, where the first N is the native amino acid, the XXX is the residue mutated, and the second N is the mutation. Random mutagenesis of SNAP25 was performed with GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) by Mutazyme II DNA polymerase during DNA amplification. Briefly, amplification was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing 1 ng of pGEX-SNAP25-(141–206), 2.5 units of Mutazyme II DNA polymerase, 40 μm dNTPs, and 50 pmol of 5′-GTTCCGCGTGGATCGGAGCTC and 5′-AGTCACGATGAATTCGGATCC. The reaction was preheated at 95 °C for 2 min, and then incubated for 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, and then finishing by incubating at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplified products were purified, digested, and subcloned into pGEX-2T. Recombinant plasmids were sequenced to identify the mutations within SNAP25. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate DNA encoding residues that were not mutated by random mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by QuikChange (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instruction, using pGEX-SNAP25-(141–206) as a template. For example, the G168R, R176C, D179V, I181E, A195D, and R198E point mutations generated by random mutagenesis that had >50% inhibition of LC cleavage were engineered with more conserved mutations, G168A, R176A, D179A, I181A, A195S, and R198A, and tested for sensitivity to cleavage by LC/A and LC/E.Cleavage of SNAP25 by BoNT-LCsLinear Velocity Reactions—Reactions contained (10 μl): 5 μm of the indicated SNAP25 incubated with LC/A or LC/E in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) with 20 mm NaCl. Reactions were run at 37 °C for 10 min, stopped by adding SDS-PAGE buffer and heating for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained, and the amount of SNAP25 cleavage was determined by densitometry.Kinetic Parameters—Km and kcat determinations were made for LC/A with the indicated SNAP25-(146–206). LC was adjusted to cleave <10% substrate in various concentrations of substrates. Reaction velocity versus substrate concentration was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, and kinetic constants were derived, using the EnzFitter program (Elsevier, UK).Molecular ModelingProteins were modeled with Swiss Model software from the Brookhaven National Laboratories (23Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4425) Google Scholar).RESULTSResidues That Define Substrate Recognition of SNAP25 for LC/A and LC/EInitial attempts to identify the molecular basis for the substrate recognition of BoNT, by exchanging the surface determinants within LC/A and LC/E were not successful. In these experiments, chimeric proteins were generated that contained complementary loops of the two LCs (at residues 50, 170, 250, and 370 of LC/A and the corresponding region of LC/E) but yielded chimeric proteins that were either inefficient or inactive in SNAP25 cleavage. This prompted the reciprocal strategy to define substrate specificity through the mutagenesis of SNAP25.Previous deletion analysis resolved residues 141–202 as the minimal region of SNAP25 that can be efficiently cleaved by LC/A (15Washbourne P. Pellizzari R. Baldini G. Wilson M.C. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 16Vaidyanathan V.V. Yoshino K. Jahnz M. Dorries C. Bade S. Nauenburg S. Niemann H. Binz T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Initial mapping showed that deletion of the SNARE motif (residues 145–154) did not affect the ability of LC/E to cleave a SNAP25 and had 5-fold lower rate for cleavage by LC/A (Table 1). Further mapping showed that SNAP25-(167–202) was efficiently cleaved by LC/E, whereas LC/A cleavage was less efficient, suggesting that the binding domain for LC/E was shorter than LC/A. This also indicated that residues 146–155 played a limited role in SNAP25 recognition by LC/A or LC/E and prompted a saturation mutagenesis approach to residues 156–202 of SNAP25 to define cleavage properties of LC/A and LC/E. Fig. 1A shows the differential affect of representative single amino acids mutations within residues 156–202 of SNAP25 on the cleavage capacities of LC/A and LC/E. A composite of the effect of individual point mutations within residues 156–202 of SNAP25 on cleavage by LC/A and LC/E cleavage is presented in Fig. 1B. Mutation of 18 of 48 residues did not effect LC/A or LC/E cleavage of SNAP25, mutations of 11 of 48 residues inhibited the ability of LC/A and LC/E to cleave SNAP25, whereas 18 of 48 residues had differential effects on SNAP25 cleavage by LC/A or LC/E. Two regions were resolved that included mutated residues, which showed the greatest inhibitory action to LC/A, residues 193–202, termed the active site (AS) domain and residues 156–181, termed the binding (B) domain. Consistent with the co-crystal structure of a non-catalytic form of LC/A and SNAP25 (19Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), Ile156, Asp166, Glu170, Ile171, Asp172, Arg176, Ile178, Ile181, Glu183, and Asp193, which showed side-chain interaction with LC/A, showed inhibitory effects on LC/A cleavage of the mutated SNAP25. Several additional residues (Ala195, Arg198, and Lys201) also inhibited LC/A cleavage of the mutated SNAP25. In linear velocity reactions, mutation of R198E in SNAP25 abolished the ability of LC/A to cleave SNAP25, whereas the more conserved mutation, R198A, reduced LC/A cleavage efficiency ∼1000-fold. Mutation of A195S reduced LC/A cleavage efficiency ∼ 5000-fold.TABLE 1Cleavage of SNAP25 derivatives by LC/A and LC/ESNAP25 derivativesLC/AaActivity relative to WT, which was designated as 1. cleavageLC/EaActivity relative to WT, which was designated as 1. cleavageReference(146-206)1b1 designates that activity was within 2-fold of WT.1(16Vaidyanathan V.V.

Open table in a new tab Relative to LC/A, mutation to fewer residues in SNAP25 inhibited LC/E cleavage. Mutations that influenced LC/E cleavage included residues 178–183 within the AS domain and residues 167–173 within the B domain. Mutation to I181E in SNAP25 abolished LC/E cleavage, whereas the more conserved mutation, I181A, reduced LC/E cleavage efficiency ∼100-fold. Mutation to I178A in SNAP25 reduced LC/E cleavage efficiency ∼60-fold.Thus, two domains in SNAP25 were required for optimal LC/A and LC/E cleavage. The AS domain included the respective cleavage sites for LC/A and LC/E, and the B domain included residues that were 12 or 5 amino acids upstream of the respective cleavage site domain for LC/A and LC/E. Limited trypsin digestion patterns for point mutated SNAP25 that were cleaved by LC/A or LC/E by <50% cleavage relative to wild type yielded three identical SNAP25-dependent peptides for the mutated and wild-type SNAP25, suggesting that the point mutations that had the greatest effect on cleavage did not have gross conformational effects on SNAP25 structure (data not shown).AS Domain Contributes to Catalytic Efficiency, whereas B Domain Contributes to High Affinity Binding of SNAP25 by LC/A and LC/ECleavage of SNAP25 by LC/A—Kinetic constants were determined for seven point mutations within SNAP25: K201N, R198E, R198A, A195D, A195S, and D193A in the AS domain and I171A in the B domain. These mutations were chosen based upon their capacity to reduce the catalytic efficiency SNAP25 cleavage by LC/A. Point mutations K201N, R198A, A195D, and D193A reduced the kcat but had limited effect on the Km for SNAP25 cleavage by LC/A (Table 2). There was no detectable cleavage of SNAP25(R198E) by LC/A, whereas the more conserved mutation, SNAP25(I198A), had a primary defect in kcat. SNAP25(A195D) had a ∼6000-fold lower kcat than wild-type SNAP25. Using the cleavage site terminology for zinc proteases, Ala195 comprised the P3 substrate location and Arg198 comprised the P1′ substrate location for cleavage. SNAP25(D193A) and SNAP25(K201N) had 60- and 45-fold lower kcat than wild-type SNAP25, respectively, indicating a minor role for the P5 and P4′ sites in catalysis. In contrast, the major change of SNAP25(I171A) in the B domain was a 20-fold increase in Km, which indicated that residues within the region contributed to SNAP25 binding to LC/A. Previous studies also reported that mutations to Ile156 and Met167 increased the Km of SNAP25 cleavage by LC/A (19Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Kinetic constants of LC/A and LC/E for mutated SNAP25Light chainSNAP25-(141-206)SiteKmkcatkcat/KmμmS-1S-1μm-1LC/AWT16.2 ± 0.6602.7K201NP4′18 ± 2.11.548.5 × 10-2R198EP1′NDaND designates that cleavage was not detected.NDR198AP1′17.5 ± 1.80.092.8 × 10-3A195DP316.8 ± 0.90.015.9 × 10-4A195SP317.2 ± 1.10.015.8 × 10-4D193AP512.5 ± 0.51.089.0 × 10-2I171A279 ± 10.56.42.2 × 10-2LC/EWT4.9 ± 0.321.84.4E183AP3′32.2 ± 4.56.31.9 × 10-1I181EP1′NDNDI181AP1′6.5 ± 0.50.304.6 × 10-2D179VP23.0 ± 0.20.051.5 × 10-2D179AP23.5 ± 0.40.257.1 × 10-2I178NP37.1 ± 0.30.557.7 × 10-2I171A62.6 ± 8.57.81.2 × 10-1a ND designates that cleavage was not detected. Open table in a new tab Cleavage of SNAP25 by LC/E—Kinetic constants were determined for seven point mutations within SNAP25: E183A, I181E, I181A, D179V, D179A, and I178N in the AS domain and I171A in the B domain of SNAP25. There was no detectable cleavage of SNAP25(I181E) (P1′ site) by LC/E, whereas the more conserved mutation, SNAP25(I181A), had a primary defect in kcat. SNAP25(D179A) (P2 site) had a ∼ 90-fold lower kcat than wild-type SNAP25. Thus, for LC/E the P1′ site (Ile181) and P2 site (Asp179) were important for efficient catalysis. SNAP25(I178N) and SNAP25(E183A) had a 40- and 3-fold lower kcat than wild-type SNAP25, respectively, indicating a role for the P3 site but not the P3′ site in catalysis. In contrast, the major change of SNAP25(I171A) was a 12-fold increase in Km, which indicated that residues within this region contributed to SNAP25 binding to LC/E. Thus, the AS domains contributed to catalysis while the B domains contributed to the affinity of SNAP25 by LC/A and LC/E.Deletion Mapping SNAP25 Peptides as Substrates for LC/A and LC/ESaturation mutagenesis studies predicted optimal cleavage sites of SNAP25 that should support cleavage by LC/A or LC/E. Deletion mutations were engineered within SNAP25 to test the role of B domain and AS domain on efficiency and specificity of SNAP25 cleavage by LC/A and LC/E.Previous studies that mapped the minimal domain required for the LC/A and LC/E cleavage of SNAP25 (16Vaidyanathan V.V. Yoshino K. Jahnz M. Dorries C. Bade S. Nauenburg S. Niemann H. Binz T. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) were performed using GST fusion proteins. Our initial studies determined that GST-SNAP25-(156–206) is cleaved by LC/A and LC/E at a slow rate when the cleavage site residues were aligned close to the GST component of the fusion protein (data not shown). This indicated that the GST component of GST-SNAP25 fusion proteins hindered cleavage by BoNTs when the cleavage site was aligned near GST. To circumvent these complications, an extended version of GST-SNAP25 was engineered to include residues 93–206 of SNAP25, which placed the SNAP25 cleavage site more distanced from the GST component of the fusion protein than used in the earlier studies. In this platform, LC/A cleaved SNAP25-(93–206)Δ146–155 within 5-fold of the rate of SNAP25-(93–206) cleavage. Deletion of residues 146–166 reduced the ability of LC/A to cleave by ∼100-fold, whereas removal of residues 146–186 reduced the ability of LC/A to cleave substrate by ∼1000-fold relative to the cleavage of SNAP25-(93–206) (Table 1). Deletion of 199–206 of SNAP25 abolished LC/A cleavage, indicating the importance of C-terminal residues for substrate cleavage (Table 1). The efficiency of LC/A cleavage of deletion peptides of SNAP25 were consistent with the analysis of point mutations within SNAP25, where mutation to Ile156, Leu160, Met163, and Ala164 inhibited LC/A cleavage of SNAP25. This defined residues 156–202 of SNAP25 as an optimal cleavage site for LC/A.LC/E cleaved SNAP25-(93–206)Δ146–155 and SNAP25-(93–206)Δ146–166 similar efficiencies, within ∼2-fold, as SNAP25-(93–206). LC/E cleaved SNAP25-(146–186) at a rate similar as SNAP25-(93–206). LC/E did not cleave SNAP25-(141–182), implicating a role for residues 183–186 in substrate cleavage (Table 1). This defined residues 167–186 of SNAP25 as an optimal cleavage site for LC/E.Minimal AS Domains of SNAP25 That Can Be Cleaved by LC/A and LC/EThe cumulative data indicated the AS domain contributed to the catalytic capacity and substrate specificity of SNAP25 by LC/A and LC/E. To test this model, GST fusion proteins were engineered that included two minimal LC/A AS domains, 192DEANQRATK200 and 194ANQRATK200 termed as SN/A1 and SN/A2, respectively, and two minimal LC/E AS domains for LC/E, 178IDRIMEKAD186 and 178IDRIME183 termed SN/E1 or SN/E2, respectively (Fig. 2A). LC/A cleaved SN/A1, but did not cleave SN/A2 at the highest concentration of LC/A tested, 10 μm. This indicated that 192DEANQRATK200 was a minimal substrate for LC/A. LC/E cleaved SN/E1 more efficiently than SN/E2, but cleavage of SN/E2 was detected at the highest concentration of LC/E, 10 μm (Fig. 2B). This indicated that residues 184–186 enhanced substrate cleavage, but that 178IDRIME183 was a minimal cleavable substrate for LC/E. Controls showed that 10 μm LC/A did not cleave SN/E1 and that 10 μm LC/E did not cleave SN/A1 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Cleavage of peptide substrates by LC/A and LC/E.

Mass spectrometry analysis detected two peptide products with masses of 965.5 Da and 520.3 Da, indicating that LC/E cleaved the peptide at the scissile bond, between Arg180 and Ile181 of SNAP25.A Peptide Comprising Residues 167–181 of SNAP25 Inhibits LC/A and LC/E CatalysisMutational analysis showed a common region (residues 167–181) that impacted the ability of LC/A and LC/E to cleave SNAP25 at their respective cleavage sites. A peptide comprising SNAP25-(167–181), MGNEIDTQNRQIDRI, was synthesized and tested for the ability to inhibit LC/A and LC/E cleavage of SNAP25. The peptide inhibited 50% cleavage of SNAP25 by LC/E at ∼400 μm and LC/A at ∼600 μm. The concentration of peptide required for inhibition was similar to the Km of peptides that were previously identified as substrates for BoNT/A cleavage (14Schmidt J.J. Bostian K.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The peptide did not inhibit cleavage of vesicle-associated membrane protein by LC/B, which indicated inhibition specificity. Mass spectrometry did not detect cleavage of the peptide by LC/E or LC/A (data not shown).DISCUSSIONUnderstanding the mechanism of substrate recognition by the BoNT can provide insight for vaccine and therapeutic development (24Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T.

The recent co-crystal structure of a non-catalytic LC/A and SNAP25-(146–204) (19Breidenbach M.A. Brunger A.T. Nature. 2004; 432: 925-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) defined an α exosite and β exosite in substrate recognition. This structure provided a model for biochemical studies to define the functional interactions between LC and SNAP25. The current study utilized saturation mutagenesis and deletion mapping to define regions and residues within SNAP25 involved in substrate binding and catalysis. From these functional studies, an AS domain and a B domain are shown to be required for efficient cleavage and high affinity binding, respectively, of SNAP25 by LC/A and LC/E (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Model of active-site pocket mediated substrate recognition for LC/A and LC/E.

https://openalex.org/W2048489220,"Mammalian heparanase degrades heparan sulfate, the most prominent polysaccharide of the extracellular matrix. Causal involvement of heparanase in tumor progression is well documented. Little is known, however, about mechanisms that regulate heparanase gene expression. Mutational inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequent genetic alteration in human tumors. p53 is a transcription factor that regulates a wide variety of cellular promoters. In this study, we demonstrate that wild-type (wt) p53 binds to heparanase promoter and inhibits its activity, whereas mutant p53 variants failed to exert an inhibitory effect. Moreover, p53-H175R mutant even activated heparanase promoter activity. Elimination or inhibition of p53 in several cell types resulted in a significant increase in heparanase gene expression and enzymatic activity. Trichostatin A abolished the inhibitory effect of wt p53, suggesting the involvement of histone deacetylation in negative regulation of the heparanase promoter. Altogether, our results indicate that the heparanase gene is regulated by p53 under normal conditions, while mutational inactivation of p53 during cancer development leads to induction of heparanase expression, providing a possible explanation for the frequent increase of heparanase levels observed in the course of tumorigenesis."

In this study we investigated whether the oncogenic G protein-coupled receptor (KSHV-GPCR or vGPCR), one of the key KSHV genes involved in KS development, activated HO-1 expression.

Chronic administration of SnPP to the implanted mice, under conditions that effectively blocked HO-1 activity and VEGF-A expression in the transplanted cells, strikingly reduced tumor growth, without apparent side effects. On the contrary, administration of the HO-1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) further enhanced vGPCR-induced tumor growth.

Oxidative cleavage of the protoporphyrin ring results in formation of the physiological messenger molecule carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and biliverdin, the latter being subsequently reduced to the antioxidant bilirubin by cytosolic biliverdin reductase (1Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). So far, three mammalian isoforms of heme oxygenase have been identified: HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3. HO-2 is a constitutive 36-kDa isoform present mostly in brain and testis, and HO-3 has been recently cloned but its role remains uncertain because of its very low enzyme activity compared with that of the other variants (1Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast, HO-1 is an inducible and ubiquitous 32-kDa isoform highly expressed in spleen and liver and normally found in very low levels in most mammalian tissues (1Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The regulation of its potent enzymatic activity depends primarily on the control of HO-1 expression at the transcriptional level (1Maines M.D. Gibbs P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 568-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Alam J. Igarashi K. Immenschuh S. Shibahara S. Tyrrell R.M. Antioxid.

Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because of the antioxidant properties of the heme metabolism products, HO-1 is considered a cytoprotector molecule involved in several physiological responses against oxidative and cellular stress (2Alam J. Igarashi K. Immenschuh S. Shibahara S. Tyrrell R.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Its expression is triggered by stress-inducing stimuli including hypoxia, heavy metals, UV radiation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide (NO), antioxidants, growth factors, and hormones (4Salinas M.

HO-1 prevents a wide range of stress and inflammatory responses such as endotoxic shock, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and hyperoxia-induced lung injury among others (9Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 10Amersi F. Buelow R. Kato H. Ke B. Coito A.J. Shen X.D. Zhao D. Zaky J. Melinek J. Lassman C.R.

Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence for the cytoprotective role of HO-1 derives from organ transplantation research, in which the expression of HO-1 by the graft vasculature is key for heart, liver, kidney, thyroid, and pancreatic islet allografts survival (11Otterbein L.E. Soares M.P. Yamashita K. Bach F.H. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 449-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). An increasing number of studies support the notion of an important role for HO-1 in the physiology of the vasculature, where by means of the heme degradation by-products, it protects endothelial cells from a wide variety of apoptotic stimuli (3Dulak J. Loboda A. Zagorska A. Jozkowicz A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Indeed, HO-1 has been recently defined as an important regulator of endothelial cell cycle control, proliferation, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, and angiogenesis (3Dulak J. Loboda A. Zagorska A. Jozkowicz A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As such, angiogenic stimulating factors including interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6), transforming growth factor β, prolactin, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J (2Alam J. Igarashi K. Immenschuh S. Shibahara S. Tyrrell R.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and atrial natriuretic peptide are able to up-regulate HO-1 expression (3Dulak J. Loboda A. Zagorska A. Jozkowicz A. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 858-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent study has shown that HO-1 expression and activity are induced by an angiogenic oncovirus, the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), in endothelial cells. Besides, elevated levels of the enzyme are detectable in biopsy tissue from oral AIDS-Kaposi sarcoma lesions (12McAllister S.C. Hansen S.G. Ruhl R.A. Raggo C.M. DeFilippis V.R. Greenspan D. Fruh K. Moses A.V. Blood. 2004; 103: 3465-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent tumor in AIDS patients, characterized by multifocal angioproliferative lesions containing spindle cells derived from the infection of endothelial cells by the KSHV (13Flore O. Rafii S. Ely S. O'Leary J.J. Hyjek E.M. Cesarman E. Nature. 1998; 394: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This virus (also denominated human herpesvirus-8) is involved in all clinical forms of KS. Its genome harbors KSHV unique genes, common genes shared with other herpesviruses, and genes with homology to mammalian signal transduction proteins (14Nicholas J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 475-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One gene from the latter group, the open reading frame 74, encodes a G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) named KSHV-GPCR or vGPCR, which is related to the mammalian IL-8 receptor CXCR2 (15Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This receptor has an Asp142 → Val mutation in a highly conserved Asp-Arg-Lys (DRY) sequence in homologue mammalian GPCRs, which enables its constitutive, ligand-independent activity. Thus, vGPCR is able per se to induce transformation in fibroblasts, angiogenesis in endothelial cells (16Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), and human KS-resembling angioproliferative lesions (16Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L.

Sawai E.T. He Y. Li Y. Ray P.E. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Recent distinct experimental strategies using animal models revealed that vGPCR has a key role in the development of KS. Despite the fact that only few cells in KS-like lesions are vGPCR-positive (18Montaner S. Sodhi A. Molinolo A. Bugge T.H. Sawai E.T. He Y. Li Y. Ray P.E. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), down-regulation of its expression results in diminished expression of angiogenic factors and tumor regression (19Jensen K.K. Manfra D.J. Grisotto M.G. Martin A.P. Vassileva G. Kelley K. Schwartz T.W. Lira S.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3686-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which confirms the key role of vGPCR in KS-induced oncogenesis. Taking into account the predominant function of vGPCR in KS and the elevated expression of HO-1 observed in KS lesions and KS-infected endothelial cells, the goal of this study was to investigate whether vGPCR could induce HO-1 expression and if so to explore the putative role of the enzyme in vGPCR-dependent transformation. Accordingly, we show that the viral oncogene induced HO-1 mRNA and protein levels and that HO-1 was highly expressed in mouse tumors derived from vGPCR-transfected cells. Our data indicate that targeted knock-down gene expression of HO-1 and chemical inhibition of HO-1 enzymatic activity impaired vGPCR-induced VEGF expression, survival, proliferation, and transformation both in cell culture and in a murine allograft tumor model. These findings uncovered the identity of HO-1 as a potential therapeutic target in KS. DNA Constructs—The plasmid pHO-1-Luc was provided by J. Alam and contains a 15-kb murine HO-1 promoter upstream of a luciferase gene as described previously (5Martin D. Rojo A.I. Salinas M. Diaz R. Gallardo G. Alam J. De Galarreta C.M. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The pVEGF-Luc was a kind gift from B. Vonderhaar and R. Hovey (20Goldhar A.S. Vonderhaar B.K. Trott J.F. Hovey R.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 232: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pCEFL-AU5-vGPCR, pCEFL-VEGF, pCEFL-β-galactosidase, pCEFL-GFP, and pCEFL-AU5 Ras V12 have been described previously (18Montaner S.

The murine full-length HO-1 was amplified by RT-PCR from RNA from hemin-treated NIH3T3 cells with the primers 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGAGCGTCCACAGCCCGACAG and 3′-GCGCGGCCGCTTACATGGCATAAATTCCCACTG and subcloned into an HA-tagged pCEFL expression vector as an EcoRI/NotI fragment. pCEP4, a plasmid carrying a hygromycin resistance gene, was commercially purchased (Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain). pS-shRNAHO-1, a plasmid carrying shRNA for HO-1, was engineered by annealing the single strand oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCCCAACTTTCAGAAGGGCCAGGTGTTCAAGAGACACCTGGCCCTTCTGAAAGTTTTTTTGGAAA and 3′-GGGTTGAAAGTCTTCCCGGTCCACAAGTTCTCTGTGGACCGGGAAGACTTTCAAAAAAACCTTTTCGA and inserting the double strand oligonucleotide in the pSilencer 1.0-U6 plasmid (Ambion). Cell Lines and Transfections—NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Simian virus 40, large T-antigen-immortalized, murine endothelial cells (SVECs) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Stable transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate technique (22Marinissen M.J. Servitja J.M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46814-46825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 and SVEC cells were plated at 20% confluence in 10-cm plates and transfected with 10 μg of pCEFL, pCEFL-vGPCR, or pCEFL-HA-HO-1. Transfected cells were selected with 750 μg/ml G418 (Promega Corp., Madrid, Spain). NIH-vGPCR cells were further transfected with 100 ng of pCEP4 along with 10 μg of pSilencer (Ambion) (NIH-vGPCRshRNA), pS-shRNAHO-1 (NIH-vGPCRshRNAHO-1), or pCEFL-VEGF (NIH-vG-PCR-VEGF). Transfected cells were selected with 160 μg/ml hygromycin B from Streptomyces (Sigma, Madrid, Spain). Transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Analysis of mRNA Levels by Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were treated for 6 h with vehicle (control), 100 ng/ml IL-6, 250 μm CoCl2, 150 ng/ml IL-8 or GROα (Sigma), and 10 μm cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) (Frontier Scientific Europe Ltd., Great Britain). When indicated, cells were preincubated with 50-100 μm tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP) (Frontier Scientific Europe Ltd.) for 24-48 h. Total RNA from cells and tumors was extracted by homogenization in TRIzol (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were grown to 80% confluence, serum-starved for 24-48 h, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in TRIzol according to the manufacturer′s indications. Total RNA from tumors was obtained by homogenizing the tissue in TRIzol with a Teflon homogenizer. Equal amounts of RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed to obtain cDNA with the transcription first strand cDNA kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Madrid, Spain). PCRs were performed using the Ready Mix RedTaq PCR reactive mix (Sigma). The nucleotide sequences HO-1 5′-CAACAGTGGCAGTGGGAATTT and HO-1 3′-CCAGGCAAGATTCTCCCTTAC were used to amplify a 106-bp HO-1 fragment. To obtain a 1029-bp vGPCR fragment, the primers were 5′-GCGAATTCACCATGGCGGCCGAGGATTTCCTAAC, vGPCR 3′-GCGCGGCCGCCTACGTGGTGGCGCCGGACATGA. The three splice variants of VE-GF-A were amplified using VEGF-A 5′-CTGCTCTCTTGGGTGCA-CTGG and VEGF-A 3′-ACCGCCTTGGCTTGTCACAT primers. Expected product sizes were 431, 563, and 635 bp corresponding to the VEGF120, VEGF164, and VEGF188 splice variant isoforms (20Goldhar A.S. Vonderhaar B.K. Trott J.F. Hovey R.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 232: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); VE-GF-C 5′-TGAACACCAGCACAGGTTAC and VEGF-C 3′-TCTTGTTAGCTGCCTGACAC oligonucleotides yielded a VEGF C fragment of 204 bp. A fragment of 102 bp from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) housekeeping gene was amplified in parallel to all reactions to ensure that equal amounts of starting cDNA were used in each reaction. The nucleotide sequences of the corresponding primers were GAPDH 5′-TCCATCACAACTTTGGCATTG and GAPDH 3′-TCACGCACAAGCTTTCCA. After an initial denaturalization step of 2 min at 94 °C, amplification of each cDNA was performed in 22-34 cycles (in increments of 2) to detect the linear amplification phase. Most reactions were set at 28 cycles, which also allowed detection of basal HO-1 mRNA levels in control cells. The same amount of cycles were used for VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and GAPDH using a thermal profile of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. For full-length mouse HO-1 and vGPCR, the amplifications were performed with 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were detected by electrophoresis in agarose gels and fluorescence under UV light upon ethidium bromide staining. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid and 100 ng of pRenilla-null (Promega Corp.) per well in 6-well plates. In all cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3-β-galactosidase. When indicated, cells were pretreated for 24 h with vehicle or 50-100 μm SnPP (Frontier Scientific Europe Ltd.) dissolved in Me2SO, 50 nm bilirubin, or 1 μm [Ru(CO)3Cl2]2 (Sigma). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed using the dual luciferase reporter system (Promega Corp.), and light emission was quantified using a BG1 Optocomp I, GEM Biomedical luminometer (Sparks, NV). Western Blot—HA-HO1 and GFP-HO-1 were detected by Western blotting with anti-HA and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies (HA.11, Covance, Inc. and Clontech, respectively). Endogenous HO-1 and HO-2 from cell lysates and tumor microsomes were detected by rabbit and mouse monoclonal specific antibodies (StressGen Biotechnologies). Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was detected with a specific anti PDI rabbit antibody (4Salinas M. Diaz R. Abraham N.G. Ruiz de Galarreta C.M. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13898-13904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) using goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Indirect Immunofluorescence—NIH3T3 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected by Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h, washed twice with 1× PBS, and then fixed and permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde and 0.05% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti HO-1 (StressGen Biotechnologies), anti-AU5, or anti-HA antibodies (Covance, Inc.) as primary antibodies for 1 h. Following incubation, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and then incubated for an additional hour with the corresponding secondary antibodies (1:200) conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate and fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes) in the last wash. Coverslips were mounted in Fluorosafe mounting medium (Calbiochem) and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence. Immunohistochemistry—Tumor, skin, and liver tissues were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS, transferred to 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were hydrated in a graded xylene/ethanol series. Antigens were retrieved by heat, and sections were incubated with the anti HO-1 antibody (StressGen Biotechnologies) (1:500). The antibody was recognized by labeled polymer-AP (DakoCytomation) and alkaline phosphatase activity was developed using Fast Red (DakoCytomation). Slides were also stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in Glycergel mounting medium (DakoCytomation). Focus-forming Assays—NIH3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation technique with different indicated expression plasmids as described previously (22Marinissen M.J. Servitja J.M. Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46814-46825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The day after transfection, cells were washed three times with DMEM and kept in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum alone or with 50-100 m m SnPP for 2-3 weeks until foci were scored. Alternatively, 5 × 104 NIH-vGPCR, NIH-vGPCRshRNA, or NIH-vGPCRshRNAHO-1 cells were seeded on a 50% confluent monolayer of NIH3T3 cells and cultured as above until foci were detected. Cells were fixed with methanol for 20 min, washed with water, dried, and stained with Giemsa (Sigma). Measurement of HO Activity in Tumors—HO activity in microsomes from solid tumors or livers of control and SnPP-treated mice was assayed following the protocol described previously (23Abraham N.G. Lavrovsky Y. Schwartzman M.L. Stoltz R.A. Levere R.D. Gerritsen M.E. Shibahara S. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Briefly, tumors and livers were homogenized by a Polytron homogenizer in ice-cold homogenization buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After brief sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and supernatants ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Microsomal fractions were resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2. Protein concentration was determined using a small aliquot of these suspensions (Bio-Rad). The HO-1 activity assay was carried out by mixing microsome proteins (1 mg), cytosol fraction of rat liver as a source of biliverdin reductase (2 mg), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm hemin, 2 mm glucose-6-phosphate, 0.2 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.8 mm NADPH. All chemical reagents were commercially obtained (Sigma). The reaction was conducted in the dark for 1 h at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 1 ml chloroform (Sigma). The amount of extracted bilirubin was calculated by the difference in absorption between 464 and 530 nm using an extinction coefficient of 40 mm-1cm-1 for bilirubin. In Vitro Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was determined by staining cells with the annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well plates (250,000 cells/well), serum-starved for 48 h, and simultaneously treated with vehicle or 100 μm SnPP in Me2SO. Attached cells were harvested and stained with anexin V-PE as a marker for early apoptosis, and 7-AAD, a vital dye, for 15 min in the dark. The number of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry (FACSVantage SE with Digital DiVa, BD Biosciences). Cell Proliferation and [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates, at 100,000 cells per well. After overnight growth, the cells were serum-starved for 48 or 96 h, harvested, and counted in a New Bauer chamber. Alternatively, after 48-h serum starvation, cells were incubated with [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. Monolayers were washed 3 times with PBS, twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed in 1 n NaOH. Aliquots were counted by liquid scintillation, and parallel protein samples were quantified (Bio-Rad) for normalization. Tumor Allografts in Athymic Nude Mice and Antitumor Effect of SnPP—SVEC, NIH, SVEC-vGPCR, NIH-vGPCR, NIH-vGPCRshRNA, and NIH-vGPCRshRNAHO-1 stable cell lines were used to induce tumor allografts in 7-week athymic (nu/nu) nude female mice. Cells were harvested, washed, counted, and resuspended in PBS. 1 × 106 viable cells were transplanted subcutaneously into the right flank of the mouse. Mice were monitored twice weekly until each animal developed one tumor in the area of the cell injection. Tumors were noticeable and reached a diameter of ∼3 mm 20 days after cell injection. At this point, mice were separated in groups of five animals and were treated with vehicle (control), SnPP, or CoPP (10 μmol/kg of body weight dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH in PBS, pH 7.5) administered subcutaneously in the right flank daily for the indicated times. Tumor volume and body weight were measured every other day during the period of investigation. Tumor volumes (V) were determined by the formula V = L × W2 × 0.5, with L being the longest cross-section and W the shortest. Statistical Analysis—Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical difference of tumor volumes was calculated by the two-tailed impaired t test. A p value <0.05 (*) was considered statistically significant. Image Analysis and Quantification—Different band intensities corresponding to ethidium bromide detection of DNA samples or Western blot detection of protein samples were quantified using the Scion Image program. Transient Expression of vGPCR from the Kaposi Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus Induces ho-1 Promoter Activity and HO-1 Protein Expression—As one of the first observations of the transforming activity of vGPCR derived from its overexpression in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (16Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), we used this cell line to investigate whether the receptor was able to induce the transcriptional activity of a 15-kb murine ho-1 promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (pHO1-Luc). Indeed, vGPCR activated pHO1-Luc in a dose-dependent manner in a range between 2- and 6-fold, as shown in Fig. 1A. The effect of vGPCR on the ho-1 promoter activity was comparable with that of the receptor on the activity of a reporter gene driven by the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) promoter (pVEGF-Luc), a known target DNA regulatory sequence for the viral receptor (16Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), which served as a control (Fig. 1B). vGPCR, unlike its cellular homologue CXCR2, has ligand-independent activity. It has an Asp142 → Val mutation in a highly conserved Asp-Arg-Lys (DRY) sequence that enables it constitutive ligand-independent activity and its capacity to induce foci, tumors, and VEGF secretion (16Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Raaka E.G. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 24Montaner S.

Although some initial reports indicate that vGPCR can be further activated by IL-8 or GROa (25Gershengorn M.C. Geras-Raaka E"
https://openalex.org/W1968458797,"Substrate transport by the plasma membrane glutamate transporter EAAC1 is coupled to cotransport of three sodium ions. One of these Na+ ions binds to the transporter already in the absence of glutamate. Here, we have investigated the possible involvement of two conserved aspartic acid residues in transmembrane segments 7 and 8 of EAAC1, Asp-367 and Asp-454, in Na+ cotransport. To test the effect of charge neutralization mutations in these positions on Na+ binding to the glutamate-free transporter, we recorded the Na+-induced anion leak current to determine the Km of EAAC1 for Na+. For EAAC1WT, this Km was determined as 120 mm. When the negative charge of Asp-367 was neutralized by mutagenesis to asparagine, Na+ activated the anion leak current with a Km of about 2 m, indicating dramatically impaired Na+ binding to the mutant transporter. In contrast, the Na+ affinity of EAAC1D454N was virtually unchanged compared with the wild type transporter (Km = 90 mm). The reduced occupancy of the Na+ binding site of EAAC1D367N resulted in a dramatic reduction in glutamate affinity (Km = 3.6 mm, 140 mm [Na+]), which could be partially overcome by increasing extracellular [Na+]. In addition to impairing Na+ binding, the D367N mutation slowed glutamate transport, as shown by pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of transport currents, by strongly decreasing the rate of a reaction step associated with glutamate translocation.

To understand the relative importance of each lipid transfer activity, we compared the ability of hMTP and its Drosophila ortholog (dMTP) to assemble apoB lipoproteins and to transfer various lipids. apoB48 secretion was induced when co-expressed with either hMTP or dMTP in COS cells, and oleic acid supplementation further augmented secretion without altering particle density. C-terminal epitope-tagged dMTP (dMTP-FLAG) facilitated the secretion of apoB polypeptides in the range of apoB48 to apoB72 but was ∼50% as efficient as hMTP-FLAG. Comparison of lipid transfer activities revealed that although phospholipid transfer was similar in both orthologs, dMTP was unable to transfer neutral lipids. We conclude that the phospholipid transfer activity of MTP is sufficient for the assembly and secretion of primordial apoB lipoproteins and may represent its earliest function evolved for the mobilization of lipid in invertebrates.

Lipoproteins are lipid-protein complexes that transport lipids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other hydrophobic molecules in the plasma.

The signature activity of MTP is its ability to transfer lipids between membranes. It has been demonstrated that MTP lipid transfer activity is necessary for apoB lipoprotein assembly and secretion (for reviews, see Refs. 2Hussain M.M. Shi J. Dreizen P. J. Lipid.

More recent evidence suggests that MTP lipid transfer activity is also responsible for lipid accretion within the secretory pathway and that MTP potentially stabilizes lipid vesicles in the endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Refs. 2Hussain M.M.

It has been suggested that MTP transiently interacts with a membrane, extracts lipids, and then delivers them to another lipid acceptor or to nascent apoB lipoproteins (15Atzel A. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10444-10450Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies indicate the presence of two lipid-binding sites: one site binds triacylglycerols, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids with a preference for neutral lipids, whereas a second site binds only phospholipids (16Atzel A. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15382-15388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether all MTP lipid transfer activities are required for lipoprotein assembly.Recently, we identified a human MTP (hMTP) ortholog from the genome of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that supported the secretion of human apoB34 and apoB41 (17Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H. Hussain M.M. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20367-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms involved in the secretion of apoB lipoproteins by the Drosophila MTP (dMTP) have not been elucidated. In this paper, we show that although dMTP is defective in triacylglycerol transfer activity, the phospholipid transfer activity is equivalent to that of hMTP. Thus, phospholipid, but not the triacylglycerol transfer, activity may be necessary for the assembly of primordial lipoproteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of MTP-FLAG Chimeras—hMTP and dMTP expression vectors have been previously described (17Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H. Hussain M.M. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20367-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). C-terminal FLAG-tagged forms of Drosophila and hMTP were produced by PCR, utilizing 3′ antisense primers encoding the FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) followed by an in-frame termination codon.Cell Culture and apoB Secretion—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CellGrow) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BSA) supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotics. The cells were initially dislodged from the plate with trypsin and seeded in six-well plates (400,000 cells/well). Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For sequential transfections, apoB expression vectors were initially introduced into COS cells using FuGENE 6 in T175 flasks (7.2 × 106 cells). After 8 h, the cells were detached by trypsin treatment, seeded in six-well plates, and transfected with MTP expression plasmids. At 48 h post-transfection, the media were aspirated and either 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or 1 ml of lipid-containing medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium including 0.4 mm oleic acid complexed with 1.5% BSA and 1 mm glycerol) were added. Following additional 18 h of incubation, the media were collected, protease inhibitors (Sigma) were added, the samples were centrifuged (2,500 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) to pellet cell debris, and the apoB contents were measured in the supernatants by ELISA (18Hussain M.M.

Lipids. 1997; 32: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The media were also subjected to ultracentrifugation to separate lipoproteins (20Iqbal J. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Conditioned media (4 ml) were adjusted to 1.30 g/ml with KBr and overlaid with 2 ml each of 1.24, 1.15, and 1.063 g/ml KBr solutions and 1 ml each of 1.019 and 1.006 g/ml. After ultracentrifugation (SW41 rotor, 40,000 rpm, 17 h, 15 °C), 1-ml fractions were collected, and their apoB content was determined by ELISA. The density in each fraction was measured using a refractometer (Fisher).Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells grown on coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates were transfected with apoB48 and either hMTP- or dMTP-FLAG expression plasmids. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol for 15 min at -20 °C. The fixed cells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 3% BSA, and 1% goat serum and incubated with antibodies diluted 1:100 (unless stated otherwise) in the same buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and either rabbit anti-calnexin (Stressgen) or anti-α-mannosidase II (USBiological; 1:25) followed by treatment with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and Alexa Fluor 594 (red fluorescence)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG1 (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol and 12% triethyldiamine (Sigma) to prevent fluorescent bleaching and visualized using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal microscope.Affinity Purification of MTP-FLAG—COS-7 cells in 150-mm dishes were transiently transfected with either hMTP- or dMTP-FLAG expression plasmids, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by incubating in hypotonic buffer (1 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture) as previously described (13Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 764-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Rava P. Athar H. Johnson C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The lysates were then centrifuged (SW55 Ti rotor, 50,000 rpm, 1 h, 4 °C), and the supernatants were adjusted to 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and mixed by rotation with M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 s) and washed three times with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor. To elute the bound proteins, the beads were rotated with 300 ng/μl of FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) in the same buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 s), and the supernatants containing MTP-FLAG were collected.Lipid Transfer Assays—Radiolabeled lipid transfer assays were performed according to the method described by Wetterau and Zilversmit (11Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10863-10866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To prepare unilamellar donor vesicles 1800 nmol of phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids), 3.6 nmol of either [14C]triacylglycerol, [14C]phosphatidylcholine (New England Nuclear), or [3H]cholesterol ester (Amersham Biosciences), and 135 nmol of cardiolipin (Sigma) were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 4.5 ml of buffer (15 mm Tris, 40 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4), and sonicated. Acceptor vesicles containing 10,800 nmol of phosphatidylcholine were prepared similarly. The vesicles were then centrifuged (50,000 rpm, 15 °C, 1 h, SW55 Ti rotor), and the top 4-ml fraction was collected for activity determinations. The reaction mixture (final volume, 0.5 ml) contained 100 μl each of donor and acceptor vesicles in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, and 150 mm NaCl. M2 affinity-purified MTP (100 μl) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of DE52 anion exchange resin (1:1, v/v, suspension in 15 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4.), rotated at 4 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). Radiolabeled lipids in supernatants (500 μl) were measured by scintillation counting. Blank assays were performed in the absence of purified proteins. Total radioactivity present in the assays was measured by omitting DE52 from the stop buffer. Lipid transfer (% transfer/2 h) was determined.Transfer of fluorescently labeled lipids was assayed as described previously (13Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 764-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Rava P. Athar H. Johnson C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, donor vesicles containing nitrobenzoaxadiazole-labeled triacylglycerols (Chylos, Inc.) and phosphatidylethanolamine (14Rava P. Athar H. Johnson C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were incubated with acceptor vesicles in the presence of equal amounts of total cell protein lysates or purified hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG proteins for the indicated times. Increases in fluorescence during transfer were recorded, and the percentage of transfer was calculated.MTP Gene Deletion Studies—MTPfl/flMx1Cre mice (21Lieu H.D. Withycombe S.K. Walker Q. Rong J.X. Walzem R.L. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Fisher E.A. Young S.G. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1315-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and bred at SUNY Downstate Medical Center. The mice were injected once with either phosphate-buffered saline or pIpC (250 μg). After 48 h, the livers were collected and used to measure lipid transfer activities of MTP as described before (13Athar H. Iqbal J. Jiang X.C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 764-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Rava P. Athar H. Johnson C. Hussain M.M. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1779-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).RESULTSWe previously showed that dMTP promotes human apoB34 and apoB41 secretion (17Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H. Hussain M.M. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20367-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we explored how dMTP aids in the secretion of apoB. First, we asked whether apoB secretion supported by dMTP is modulated by oleic acid (OA) supplementation. Transfection of COS cells with apoB48 expressing plasmids resulted in barely detectable apoB levels in the media with or without OA supplementation (Fig. 1, A and B). However, co-transfection with hMTP significantly increased (∼20-fold) the secretion of apoB48, and OA supplementation further enhanced its secretion by 25.6 ± 6.9% (p = 0.003) (Fig. 1A). Similar to hMTP, co-expression of dMTP and apoB48 resulted in increased secretion of apoB48 (∼7-fold) that was further augmented (80.8 ± 21.6%, p = 0.004) by OA supplementation (Fig. 1B). Next, we explored the effect of OA supplementation on the density of secreted lipoproteins. In the absence of OA, apoB secreted from COS cells expressing hMTP or dMTP was present in fractions 3-6 corresponding to a density of 1.1-1.15 g/ml (Fig. 1, C-E). Although OA increased the total apoB secreted, it did not change the density of the secreted lipoproteins (Fig. 1, compare C and D). These studies indicate that apoB secretion driven by dMTP expression is responsive to OA supplementation and produces lipoproteins with properties similar to those secreted in the presence of hMTP.We observed that dMTP can render apoB48 secretion-competent, but cells expressing dMTP consistently secreted less apoB than those expressing hMTP (Fig. 1). To understand why dMTP was less efficient in promoting apoB secretion, we considered two possibilities. First, the reduction might be due to the lower expression of dMTP compared with hMTP in COS cells. Second, different levels of apoB expression might be due to variations in co-transfection efficiency. To obtain equal expression, the cells were transfected with expression plasmids containing sequences for apoB18 through apoB72 and subsequently transfected with expression vectors containing either hMTP-FLAG or dMTP-FLAG. The relative expression of the different MTPs was determined by Western blotting. apoB18-expressing cells synthesized similar amounts of hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG (Fig. 2A, inset), and apoB18 secretion was not affected by the co-expression of either MTP (Fig. 2A) consistent, with previous studies (22McLeod R.S. Zhao Y. Selby S.L. Westerlund J. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2852-2862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Graham D.L. Knott T.J. Jones T.C. Pease R.J. Pullinger C.R. Scott J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5616-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Next, COS cells were transfected with apoB48 and subsequently transfected with either hMTP- or dMTP-FLAG. The amount of apoB48 secreted by dMTP-transfected cells was ∼33% of the level observed in hMTP-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). However, after correcting for MTP protein levels (Fig. 2B, inset), we calculated that dMTP was ∼50% as effective as hMTP in promoting apoB48 secretion. Utilizing similar correction methods it was calculated that dMTP-FLAG was ∼50 and ∼40% as efficient as the hMTP-FLAG in assisting apoB53 (Fig. 2C) and apoB72 (Fig. 2D) secretion, respectively. These studies suggest that dMTP can support the secretion of longer apoB polypeptides; however, it is less efficient compared with hMTP.FIGURE 2Drosophila MTP is less efficient than human MTP at supporting secretion of various apoB polypeptides. COS-7 cells were first transfected with either apoB18 (A), apoB48 (B), apoB53 (C), or apoB72 (D) and then with FuGENE 6 alone (no MTP), hMTP-FLAG (hMTP), or dMTP-FLAG (dMTP) expression plasmids. Following 48 h incubation, growth media was aspirated and replaced with oleate-containing media as described in the legend to Fig. 1. After a further 18-h incubation, the media were collected, and apoB content was determined by ELISA. The mean concentration of apoB is depicted by bar graphs ± S.D. (n = 3). The cells were then lysed, and equal amounts of protein were applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blotting using M2 anti-FLAG antibody. The protein bands are shown in insets. Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image software and used to normalize apoB secretion to cellular MTP content.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consideration was given to the possibility that dMTP is less proficient in supporting apoB secretion because of incorrect subcellular distribution. MTP is present in the endoplasmic reticulum due in part to association with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (24Rehberg E.F. Samson-Bouma M.E. Kienzle B. Blinderman L. Jamil H. Wetterau J.R.

The subcellular distribution of the hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG proteins was determined using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3). No staining with anti-FLAG antibodies was seen in nontransfected cells (Fig. 3A, panel a). However, punctate staining was observed in cells transfected with hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG expression plasmids (Fig. 3A, panels d and g). Calnexin, also detected as punctate cytoplasmic staining (red), provides a marker for endoplasmic reticulum localization (Fig. 3A, panels b, e, and h). In transfected cells, both hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG staining showed extensive co-localization with calnexin as illustrated in the merged images (Fig. 3A, panels c, f, and i, yellow fluorescence). In addition to endoplasmic reticulum, hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG (Fig. 3B, panels a and d) co-localized with the Golgi marker protein α-mannosidase II (Fig. 3B, panels b and e). This was confirmed in the merged images (Fig. 3B, c and f, yellow fluorescence). These studies indicate similar distribution of dMTP- and hMTP-FLAG chimeras in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.FIGURE 3Subcellular localization of human and Drosophila MTP-FLAG. COS cells transfected with apoB48 and either hMTP-FLAG (d-f) or dMTP-FLAG (g-i) were grown on coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes. After 48 h, the cells were fixed and treated as described under “Materials and Methods.” A, cells were stained with anti-FLAG M2 to label MTP (panels a, d, and g; green fluorescence) and anti-calnexin (panels b, e, and h; red fluorescence) as a marker for endoplasmic reticulum. Co-localization of MTP with the endoplasmic reticulum was demonstrated in the merged images (panels c, f, and i; yellow fluorescence). B, cells were incubated with anti-FLAG (panels a and d; green) and anti-α-mannosidase II (panels b and e; red) to label the Golgi.

We therefore determined whether dMTP also associates with endogenous PDI. hMTP-FLAG and dMTP-FLAG were affinity-purified using M2 (anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody)-agarose from transiently transfected COS cell lysates (Fig. 4). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining demonstrated two predominant protein bands of ∼95 and 55 kDa in dMTP- and hMTP-transfected cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 4A, compare control lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4). These were shown to be the M subunit and PDI by Western blotting using specific antisera (Fig. 4B), indicating that dMTP interacts with endogenous PDI similarly to hMTP.FIGURE 4Purification and characterization of hMTP and dMTP. A, MTP-FLAG chimeras were affinity-purified from transiently expressing COS cells. The cell homogenates were applied to M2-agarose beads and washed, and bound proteins were eluted as described under “Materials and Methods.” Eluted proteins were applied to polyacrylamide gels, subjected to electrophoresis, and stained. Lane 1 (Marker), molecular weight markers; lane 2 (COS), proteins eluted from nontransfected cells; lane 3 (Drosophila), proteins eluted from cells expressing dMTP-FLAG; lane 4 (Human), proteins eluted from cells expressing hMTP-FLAG. The arrowhead and arrow point to the M and P subunits of MTP, respectively. Differences in the migration of M subunits are in agreement with previous studies (17Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H.

Although the lysates from cells that transiently expressed hMTP demonstrated a measurable ability to transfer triacylglycerols (0.71 ± 0.04% triacylglycerol transfer/μg of protein/h), no significant increase was observed using lysates obtained from cells that expressed dMTP (0 ± 0.04% triacylglycerol transfer/μg of protein/h) (Fig. 5A). The lack of triacylglycerol transfer activity in dMTP is similar to what we previously reported (17Sellers J.A. Hou L. Athar H. Hussain M.M. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20367-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that dMTP was expressed, we performed similar experiments using lysates from hMTP- or dMTP-FLAG-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Once more, the lysates from cells expressing hMTP-FLAG, but not dMTP-FLAG transferred triacylglycerols. Furthermore, equal amounts of MTP were present in the lysates as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 5B, inset). Thus, dMTP appeared to lack the ability to transfer triacylglycerols.FIGURE 5Determination of lipid transfer activities of dMTP and hMTP using fluorescence assays. COS cells transiently expressing hMTP and dMTP (A) or hMTP- and dMTP-FLAG (B) were hypotonically lysed, and soluble proteins (30-36μg) were assayed for triacylglycerol transfer activity using the radiolabeled vesicle transfer assay. In B (inset), amounts of MTP present in the microsomal contents were visualized by Western blotting.

Eight of the isolated repeats are largely unfolded at physiological temperature. Constructs comprising two or more adjacent repeats show inter-repeat coupling with coupling free energies of several kcal mol-1. Constructs comprising five successive repeats from the β-chain displayed cooperativity and strong temperature dependence in forced unfolding by atomic force microscopy.

This inference was borne out by the properties of mutants in which the critical residues have been replaced. The marginal stability of the tertiary structure at several points in the spectrin chains is moderated by energetic coupling with adjoining structural elements but may be expected to permit adaptation of the membrane to the large distortions that the red cell experiences in the circulation.

The marginal stability of the tertiary structure at several points in the spectrin chains is moderated by energetic coupling with adjoining structural elements but may be expected to permit adaptation of the membrane to the large distortions that the red cell experiences in the circulation. Spectrin, an elongated flexible tetrameric molecule, defines the unusual shear resistance and elasticity of the red cell membrane (1Mohandas N. Evans E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 787-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 2Discher D.E. Carl P. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2001; 6: 593-606PubMed Google Scholar). The tetramers are made up of two αIβI heterodimers, associated head-to-head (3Shotton D.M. Burke B. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 302-329Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Both the α and the β chain are characterized by a series of homologous repeating units of about 106 amino acids, each with the structure of a loose triple-stranded α-helical coiled-coil (4Yan Y.

Nature. 1984; 311: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Repeats of this nature also characterize the many proteins that comprise the spectrin superfamily (6Muse S.V. Clark A.G. Thomas G.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 7Baines A.J. Cell Mol. Biol. Lett. 2003; 8: 195-214PubMed Google Scholar, 8Djinovic-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M.

Successive spectrin repeats are joined by a continuous α-helix, of which the N-terminal half forms the C-terminal helix (C-helix) of the three-helix bundle of one repeat and the other half forms the first helix (A-helix) of the adjoining repeat; 5 residues in the center of the helix are not part of the repeating structure and are referred to as a “linker” region (9Grum V.L.

It has been suggested (10Kusunoki H. Minasov G. Macdonald R.I. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Ortiz V. Nielsen S.O. Klein M.L. Discher D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that the flexibility of the spectrin chain under physiological conditions may be governed by kinks resulting from a low conformational stability of some of the linkers. On the other hand, the folding of individual repeats is cooperative, which implies that thermal “melting” of a linker would cause the repeats on either side to unfold. It has indeed been found that some isolated repeats have only marginal stability and are partly or largely unfolded at 37 °C (12Kusunoki H. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13MacDonald R.I. Cummings J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At the same time, the thermal, solvent-induced, or forced unfolding of constructs containing contiguous repeats has been found in some cases to display a conformational coupling between them (14MacDonald R.I. Pozharski E.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3974-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To establish how repeats of low stability are distributed through the spectrin molecule, we have examined the thermal unfolding of all of the 36 repeats that make up the two chains of erythroid spectrin. Some of the repeats show exceptionally high stability, the structural origins of which we have tried to identify. We have additionally compared thermal unfolding profiles of single repeats with those of several two-repeat fragments and with two five-repeat constructs to investigate the extent of conformational coupling within the chains. Where discrete unfolding transitions of contiguous repeats can be observed, analysis of the propagation of conformational cooperativity along the polypeptide chain becomes possible. Implications for the mechanical function of spectrin in the cell are considered. Materials—pGEX-4T-2 vector and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. pET-31b(+) vector and nickel resin were from Novagen (Madison, WI). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and BL21 (DE3) bacteria were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Proteinase inhibitor mixture set II was from Calbiochem. Reduced form glutathione, thrombin, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad, and GelCode staining reagent was from Pierce. All other chemicals were reagent grade from standard sources. Design and Subcloning of Recombinant Spectrin Polypeptides—The boundaries of all repeats were defined by the SMART data base, with two exceptions; β-spectrin repeat 1 (here designated βIR1+) starts 8 residues before the predicted repetitive segment (15Ursitti J.A. Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas α-spectrin fragment 9-10 contains a triple helix βIR9 interrupted by an SH3 domain (segment 10) between helices B and C. We expressed these as a single polypeptide and did not attempt to make a separate construct of βIR9 without the SH3 domain. To ensure proper folding, we extended the N and C termini of our single-repeat constructs by 5 residues. The residue numbers of all sequences are given in Table 1. αIR14, αIR18, and αIR19 were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector, using BamHI and SalI. All other spectrin single repeats and two-repeat fragments were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector, using EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes upstream and downstream, respectively. αIR18 was also subcloned into the pET-31b(+) vector, using NsiI and XhoI upstream and downstream, respectively. One five-repeat fragment βIR5-9 was subcloned as described previously (16An X. Guo X. Sum H. Morrow J. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and another five-repeat fragment βIR6-10 was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector, using EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes. The template used to amplify α-spectrin single repeats and tandem-repeat fragments was full-length α-spectrin cDNA. Similarly, full-length β-spectrin cDNA was used to amplify β-spectrin single repeats and tandem-repeat fragments. Mutations found in αIR14, αIR15, βIR3, and βIR7 constructs were corrected by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. The fidelity of all the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutations were incorporated into repeat sequences using the Stratagene QuikChange kit and verified by sequencing.TABLE 1Information of erythrocyte spectrin single repeatsNameAmino acidsNucleotidesNameAmino acidsNucleotidesαIR145-163133-489βIR1+293-422877-1266αIR2154-269460-807βIR2426-5321276-1596αIR3260-375778-1125βIR3523-6411567-1923αIR4365-4811093-1443βIR4632-7471894-2241αIR5472-5871414-1761βIR5738-8522212-2556αIR6578-6921732-2076βIR6843-9582527-2874αIR7683-7982047-2394βIR7949-10652845-3195αIR8789-9022365-2706βIR81056-11713166-3513αIR9-10893-10872677-3261βIR91162-12783484-3834αIR111078-11883232-3564βIR101269-13823805-4149αIR121179-12943535-3882βIR111374-14724120-4446αIR131285-14003853-4200βIR121473-15884417-4764αIR141391-15054171-4515βIR131579-16944735-5082αIR151496-16114486-4833βIR141685-18015053-5403αIR161602-17174804-5151βIR151792-19075374-5721αIR171708-18225122-5466βIR161898-20135692-6039αIR181813-19325437-5796αIR191923-20475767-6141αIR202038-21556112-6465αIR212146-22646436-6792 Open table in a new tab Preparation of Recombinant Spectrin Polypeptides—The cDNA encoding the desired polypeptide was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Because some of the polypeptides were insoluble when expressed at 37 °C, all the fragments were expressed at 16 °C. This greatly improved the yield of soluble product and ensured that all the polypeptides were folded under the same conditions. All the polypeptides were satisfactorily expressed and soluble, although the yields varied from 1 to 50 mg/500 ml bacterial culture. Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 16 °C for 3-4 h. Glutathione S-transferase fusion polypeptides were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column. Glutathione S-transferase was cleaved with thrombin. The exception was αIR18, which could not be recovered after thrombin cleavage and was therefore expressed in His-tagged form and purified on a nickel column. Concentrations of most polypeptides were determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficients calculated from the tryptophan and tyrosine contents (17Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). βIR9 does not contain tryptophan and βIR11 does not contain tyrosine, and because of their low absorbances, an approximate concentration of these two repeats was obtained by the Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) method, with bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and clarified before use by ultracentrifugation at 230,000 × gav for 30 min at 4 °C. Mass Spectrometric Analyses—Mass spectrometric analyses were performed in an Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) Voyager DE MALDI mass spectrometer. Samples at a concentration of 10 μm were mixed with an equal volume of sinapinic acid matrix solution in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), and 1-2 μl of each mixture was spotted onto a sample plate and dried. The results were externally calibrated against aldolase (Sigma; [M+H]+= 39, 212.28) and bovine serum albumin ([M+H]+= 66,430.09). Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—The molecular weights of proteins were measured by sedimentation equilibrium in a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab™ XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at a rotor speed of 20,000 rpm. Equilibrium distributions were scanned at 280 and 235 nm. Partial specific volumes were calculated from amino acid compositions. Circular Dichroism Spectra and Thermal Unfolding—Far-UV CD spectra were recorded in a Jasco 700 spectropolarimeter, equipped with a thermostated cell housing, in cells of 1-mm path length. For determination of unfolding profiles, the temperature was increased from 4 to 90 °C at a rate of 0.4 °C/min, and the ellipticity was recorded at 2o intervals. To test for reversibility, several of the samples were cooled back to 4 °C, and the CD spectrum was recorded. To estimate fractional unfolding from the ellipticity temperature profiles, corrections were made for the effectively linear changes in ellipticity in the temperature ranges above and below the sigmoidal transition region. Molecular Modeling—To assign individual residues to the a, d, and e positions in the heptad hydrophobic repeats, we aligned all the sequences with Protein Data Bank entry 1S35 (tandem-repeat fragment βIR8-9), for which the heptad repeats have been defined (9Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 10Kusunoki H. Minasov G. Macdonald R.I. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), with the aid of T-coffee (19Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5464) Google Scholar). For generation of three-dimensional models of individual or tandem repeats, we used the automated Swiss-Model server (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9578) Google Scholar). Models were displayed and analyzed in Pymol. Surface accessibility of side chains was estimated using STRIDE (21Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). Forced Unfolding by AFM—AFM 3The abbreviation used is: AFM, atomic force microscopy. measurements were made on βIR5-9 and βIR6-10 using recently described methods and analyses (22Law R. Liao G. Harper S. Yang G. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3286-3293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In particular, a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) was equipped with a liquid cell and a heater to maintain hydration and control temperature. For any one temperature, 5,000 surface-to-tip contacts were collected and thoroughly analyzed with the aid of a semiautomated visual analysis program, customwritten in C++. Since protein unfolding events are stochastic and the experiment is intrinsically random in many ways, collecting and analyzing thousands of events is necessary to provide an accurate statistical survey of the unfolding possibilities. Design and Characterization of Recombinant Spectrin Fragments—The spectrin fragments examined here are defined in Table 1. All contain an additional 6 residues from the vector at the N terminus. All products had the expected chain length and composition, as measured by mass spectrometry. Sedimentation equilibrium revealed each of the products to be monodisperse and monomeric. Circular dichroism spectra of all expressed fragments presented the typical appearance of proteins of high α-helicity, with the exception only of αIR9-10, which contains the SH3 domain and therefore has a lower α-helix content, estimated from the molar residue ellipticity at 222 nm (23Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3319) Google Scholar) as 40%. As the cooperative thermal unfolding transitions also showed, all fragments had entered the folded state at low temperature. Temperature-induced Unfolding of Recombinant Spectrin Single Repeats—Fig. 1A shows representative thermal transition profiles of single repeats of α-spectrin. In all cases, we observed a sigmoidal transition, suggestive of a two-state unfolding equilibrium, with no stable intermediates. Fig. 1B displays the Tm of all individual α-spectrin repeats, and Fig. 1, C and D, display those of the β-chain repeats. For all polypeptides examined, the transition was almost entirely (not less than 90%) reversible. There are, however, much smaller, more or less linear, changes in ellipticity below and above the cooperative region of unfolding, as also observed by others. As in the earlier work, we have applied a linear correction to obtain the presumptive fraction of tertiary structure unfolded at each temperature. Our results show that the thermal stabilities of the individual repeats from both spectrin chains differ widely, with transition mid-points (Tm) ranging from 21 and 72 °C (Fig. 1, B and D). Of the 36 repeats making up the two chains, 8 have Tm below 37 °C. Basis of Differential Stability of Repeats—The accumulation of unfolding data for all 36 erythroid spectrin repeats allows us to search for structural features that determine the very wide range of observed stabilities. Earlier studies have pointed to interactions between the 2 tryptophan residues, conserved through most of the repeats (12Kusunoki H. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as a stabilizing feature. In one instance, reduced stability has been linked to the loss of intrahelical hydrogen bonds in helix B of the three-helix bundle (12Kusunoki H. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have focused on the exceptionally stable repeat, βIR16. Here the second of the tryptophans is replaced by arginine. This apposition is not a stabilizing feature for it is found also in repeat αIR13 (Tm 36 °C); neither could we discern any relation in our sequence alignments between stability and the hydrophobicity of the residues at positions a and d of the heptad hydrophobic repeat. On the other hand, there was a trend toward increasing hydrophobicity in stable repeats at other positions in the heptads; this was particularly evident when the data were combined with analyses (not shown) of αII- and βII-spectrin repeats. At the second and third e positions (e2 and e3) in helix A, the most stable repeats typically have at least 1 hydrophobic residue. Overall, about half the helix A e2 and e3 positions have charged residues (17/36 are Glu, Asp, Lys, or Arg at e2 and 19/36 at e3). In the highly stable βIR16, these positions are occupied by Leu and Ile (Fig. 2A). Molecular modeling of βIR16 indicates that helix A residues Leu-1916 (e2) and Ile-1923 (e3) are close to residues Val-1987 and Met-1994 in helix C and may thus form a hydrophobic cluster (Fig. 2B). In the unstable repeat βIR8 (12Kusunoki H. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), glutamine residues at e2 and e3 in helix A are apposed to glycines in helix C, presumably precluding significant interhelix contacts. Mutations of the Leu and Ile at e2 and e3 in βIR16, such as would disrupt the hydrophobic cluster, are therefore predicted to reduce the stability. We accordingly prepared the mutants L1916A and I1923A and the double mutant L1916A,I1923A. At low temperatures, the helicities of the wild-type and mutant polypeptides were indistinguishable, indicating that the alanine side chains are compatible with folding of the triple helix. Fig. 2C shows the effects of these mutations on their thermal stabilities. The single mutations reduce the Tm of 72 °C in the wild type to 61 °C in L1916A and 56 °C in I1923A. The double mutant has Tm 47 °C, the median Tm for all repeats. The corresponding free energies of destabilization (see below), due to the two single mutations and the double mutation, at the Tm of the wild-type polypeptide are about 2.8, 2.5, and 4.3 kcal mol-1. In considering whether alanine might be an especially unfavorable residue in the e2 and e3 positions, we noted that alanines do indeed appear at these locations in a few repeats. In preparing an additional mutant, L1916E,I1923E, we selected glutamic acid because this is the charged residue often seen in these positions and evidently compatible with high Tm (e.g. Tm 60 °C in αIR16). Again, as Fig. 2C shows, βIR16 L1916E,I1923E has Tm of 60 °C, with a corresponding free energy of destabilization at the wild-type Tm of about 2.1 kcal mol-1. Thus the double glutamic acid mutant is more stable than the double alanine mutant, but glutamic acid in both positions cannot reproduce the stability engendered by leucine and isoleucine in the wild type. We conclude that a high hydrophobicity of the side chains in these positions may account for the unusually high Tm of the repeat. Temperature-induced Unfolding of Tandem-Repeat Fragments—To examine whether structural stabilities of contiguous repeats are cooperatively linked, we prepared three fragments, each of two tandem repeats, αIR3-4, αIR7-8, and βIR9-10. Fig. 3, A and B, show the thermal melting profiles of αIR7-8 and βIR9-10 together with the calculated profiles for the summed constituent repeats. It can be seen that in both cases, there is stabilization of the less stable by the more stable folding unit. Within the limits of error, the higher temperature transition is unaffected (as expected, since it is attached at this stage to an unfolded segment of polypeptide chain). The elevations of Tm (δTm), due to coupling with the attached repeat, of αIR4 in αIR3-4, αIR8 in αIR7-8, and βIR9 in βIR9-10 were, respectively, 6.6, 11, and 13 °C. The corrected melting profiles allow the evaluation of the equilibrium constant for unfolding at each temperature within the transition range (K = α/(1 - α), where α is the fractional unfolding at the given temperature), and thus from a van't Hoff plot, of the free energy change of a perturbed (conformationally coupled) repeat at the Tm of the unperturbed (isolated) repeat (where ΔG = 0), with the assumption that ΔCp remains unchanged. The difference in free energy of unfolding is also easily derived by the reasoning of Becktel and Schellman (25Becktel W.J. Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1859-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), as δ(ΔG) =ΔS × δTm, where ΔS is the entropy of unfolding and δTm is the change in Tm. This assumes that ΔS (=-d(ΔG)/dT) is the same for both fragments and that within the limited temperature range in question, d(ΔG)/δT can be regarded as linear. We found both conditions to be fulfilled, and the two methods gave concordant results, namely that the free energies of stabilization, at the transition mid-points, of αIR4 by αIR3, of αIR8 by αIR7, and of β IR9 by IR10 were, respectively, 1.7, 3.6, and 2.4 kcal mol-1. The extensive nature of conformational coupling between the repeats along the spectrin chains is most graphically expressed by a comparison of the summed unfolding profiles of the single repeats with that of the intact chains. We show (Fig. 3C) only the result for the αβ-dimer; the data for the separated α- and β-chains are very similar to this, implying that no significant conformational stabilization derives from lateral interactions between the chains. It is at once apparent that there is little unfolding in any part of the unperturbed spectrin dimer at physiological temperature. The derivative of the dimer melting profile shows that unfolding predominantly occurs within a narrow temperature range centered at about 50 °C. This is in satisfactory agreement with the result of scanning calorimetry of spectrin, both in solution and on the membrane, which displays a maximum at 49 °C (26Brandts J.F. Erickson L. Lysko K. Schwartz A.T. Taverna R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3450-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); this is also the temperature at which the red cell membrane vesiculates (27Zarkowsky H.S. Mohandas N. Speaker S.B. Shohet S.B. Br. J. Haematol. 1975; 29: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mechanism of Unfolding in a Multirepeat Construct—A fragment of five successive repeats, βIR5-9, was also prepared. We took advantage of this larger fragment to examine in more detail the mechanism of unfolding. Fig. 4 shows two resolved phases in the unfolding profile by circular dichroism. A relatively broad transition with a mid-point close to 40 °C and accounting for about 40% of the change in helicity presumably reflects the unfolding of βIR8-9. We also followed the unfolding by changes in forced unfolding extension curves, using AFM to probe the presence of folded units at different temperatures. At 23 °C, up to five unfolding peaks were observed in AFM as the construct was subjected to forced unfolding (see inset for representative sawtooth pattern). This indicates that up to five structural modules resist pulling at low temperature. At 30 °C, only four transitions were observed in AFM; thus only four modules resist pulling, which suggests loss of integrity of βIR9. Another module is lost between 30 and 33 °C, consistent with loss of βIR8 integrity. Between 33 and 42 °C (the highest temperature obtainable with our instrument), no further loss of modules was observed. To determine whether the unstable terminal repeat, βIR9, may be significantly perturbed by interaction with the adjacent repeat on the C-terminal side in the intact β-spectrin chain, we also prepared the overlapping construct βIR6-10. This proved to behave almost identically to βIR5-9 in tests of both thermal and forced unfolding (not shown). We have defined the entire conformational stability profile along both the α-chain and the β-chain of the erythroid spectrin, revealing structurally weak regions. The apposition of unstable domains in the two laterally associated chains of the αβ-dimer, noted by MacDonald and Cummings (13MacDonald R.I. Cummings J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), is not a general feature when the entire chains are compared. Nevertheless, the marginal stability of some repeats at points along the chains is presumably a functional characteristic of the protein. It can be expected to allow for the large membrane deformations induced by shear stresses. As many other studies, based on thermal, solvent-induced, and mechanical unfolding (10Kusunoki H. Minasov G.

We have quantified the coupling free energies between three pairs of tandem repeats, and we have shown that coupling prevails within a fragment of five successive repeats. It appears then that stabilization through interaction of successive repeats is widely propagated along the two chains and that the instability of some isolated repeats at physiological temperature is mitigated by this effect. However, it should also be remarked that for a more complete description of the stability profile of the spectrin chains, the effect of temperature on inter-repeat coupling must be taken into account. Batey et al. (29Batey S. Randles L.G. Steward A. Clarke J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 1045-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) found a breakdown of cooperativity in denaturant-induced unfolding with increasing temperature, but the opposite is the case in the forced unfolding transitions observed here. Some insight into the factors governing the stability of the spectrin repeats results from an examination of βIR16. We have identified 2 hydrophobic residues, Leu-1916 and Ile-1923, at the e positions in the heptad repeats of helix A, that are evidently inseparable from its exceptional stability. Modeling suggests that they form a hydrophobic cluster with residues Val-1987 and Met-1994 in the opposing helix C. The hydrophobicity of these residues appears to be critical for function since in all βI-spectrin sequences from fish to human, the positions equivalent to Leu-1916 and Ile-1923 are occupied by Leu, Ile, Val, or Met. Indeed, Leu-1916 is conserved, or changed only to methionine, in all known β-spectrins from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. Repeat 16 strengthens interaction of the adjacent partial repeat 17 with the α-spectrin N terminus (31Lecomte M.C. Nicolas G. Dhermy D. Pinder J.C. Gratzer W.B. Eur. Biophys. J. 1999; 28: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the stability of its conformation may therefore be demanded by the α-β interaction. As yet, no naturally occurring mutations are known in βIR16 that could test this inference. The AFM measurements on βIR5-9 and βIR6-10 reveal that by about 33 °C, repeats 8 and 9 of β-spectrin are incapable of resisting mechanical pulling, yet CD indicates that most helical melting occurs above this temperature. In native spectrin in situ, we may infer that these repeats readily adopt an extended conformation under mechanical strain. The question remains whether the degree of unfolding of spectrin repeats in solution at physiological temperature, and their stability with respect to mechanical unfolding applies equally to tetramers in the very different environment of the red cell. We have not found any significant displacement of thermal melting profiles of phospholipid-binding repeats 4X. An, X. Guo, and N. Mohandas, unpublished observations. in the presence of phosphatidylserine vesicles. That the Tm of spectrin is practically the same in red cell ghosts as in solution (26Brandts J.F. Erickson L. Lysko K. Schwartz A.T. Taverna R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3450-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) also argues for the relevance of solution data to physiological function. In the cells of solid tissues such as muscle, spectrin is presumed to stabilize membrane structures against forces arising from animal movement and to control protein localization at membranes (32Hammarlund M. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Moorthy S. Chen L. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 915-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It seems likely that tissue spectrins (such as the abundant αIIβII-spectrin) will be more resistant to mechanical deformation, and this may manifest itself in high thermal stability of the repeats. Spectrin isolated from brain is markedly stiffer than erythrocyte spectrin (34Davis J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7757-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Brain spectrin is a mixture of different gene products but gives the impression of a structure generally more resistant to deformation than its erythrocyte counterpart. Further studies are needed to determine whether and how the rigidity of αIIβII-spectrin is related to the conformational stability of its constituent repeats."
https://openalex.org/W1979699722,"The mechanisms involved in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) via the cAMP pathway are not yet completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate cAMP-mediated ENaC regulation in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing the three subunits (αβγ) of rat ENaC and to determine the ENaC regions important for mediating the stimulatory effect of cAMP. In oocytes treated for about 24 h with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 μm forskolin (FSK) so as to increase intracellular cAMP, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current (ΔIAmi) was on average 10-fold larger than ΔIAmi in matched control oocytes. This effect on ΔIAmi was paralleled by an increase in ENaC surface expression caused by a reduced rate of ENaC retrieval. In addition, IBMX/FSK also enhanced ENaC open probability from about 0.2 to 0.5. The stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK was dependent on the presence of intact PY motifs in the C termini of the channel. Mutagenesis of putative protein kinase A and CK-2 consensus motifs in the cytosolic domains of the channel did not reveal critical sites involved in mediating the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis of two putative ERK-consensus motifs (T613A in βENaC and T623A in γENaC) largely reduced the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. Phosphorylation of these ERK sites has previously been reported to enhance the interaction of ENaC and Nedd4 (Shi, H., Asher, C., Chigaev, A., Yung, Y., Reuveny, E., Seger, R., and Garty, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13539–13547). Using co-expression experiments we demonstrated that mutating the two ERK sites attenuates the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC currents. We conclude that an increase in intracellular cAMP favors the dephosphorylation of the two ERK sites, which reduces channel retrieval and increases PO by modulating ENaC/Nedd4 interaction. This defines a novel regulatory pathway likely to be relevant for cAMP-induced stimulation of ENaC in vivo.

Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 2Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). ENaC is composed of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ) that contain two transmembrane domains, a large extracellular loop, and short intracellular amino and carboxyl termini. The functional importance of a highly conserved PPXY sequence (the PY motif) in the carboxyl terminus of each subunit was recognized in Liddle syndrome (3Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M. Williams C. Nelson Hansson J.H. Schambelan M. Gill Jr., J.R. Ulick S. Milora R.V. Findling J.W. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). The PY motifs mediate ENaC binding to WW domains of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4/Nedd4-2. This binding of Nedd4/Nedd4-2 to ENaC leads to ubiquitination of lysine residues in the N terminus of the channel and to channel internalization and proteasomal degradation (4Staub O. Gautschi I.

Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 334-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In Liddle syndrome, mutations and/or deletions of the PY motif in β or γ ENaC reduce the Nedd4/Nedd4-2-mediated endocytic retrieval of ENaC from the membrane. This results in an increase in the number of ENaC channels in the membrane, which in turn causes enhanced sodium absorption and hypertension in patients with Liddle syndrome (6Firsov D. Schild L.

Schild L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ENaC phosphorylation by kinases and dephosphorylation by phosphatases has long been thought to contribute to ENaC regulation (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). In cultured renal epithelial cells, aldosterone, the main hormonal regulator of ENaC activity, and insulin have been shown to increase the phosphorylation of the C termini of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of ENaC (8Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y.H. Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Hayslett J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C141-C147Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C termini of ENaC subunits expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were found to be phosphorylated by cytosolic fractions derived from rat colon (10Chigaev A. Lu G. Shi H. Asher C. Xu R. Latter H. Seger R. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1030-F1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is thought to involve at least three different types of kinases, including the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and casein kinase 2 (CK-2) (11Shi H. Asher C. Yung Y. Kligman L. Reuveny E. Seger R. Garty H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4551-4558Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence that the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase isoform 1 (SGK1) is an important contributing factor in the signal transduction cascade of aldosterone action on epithelial sodium transport (12Pearce D. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, ENaC activation by SGK1 is rather complex and not yet completely understood (13Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Münster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.-D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38134-38142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, the molecular mechanisms involved in ENaC stimulation by the cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are not yet fully understood. It is well established that the antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) enhances sodium absorption in isolated cortical collecting tubules and that the effect of antidiuretic hormone is synergistic to that of aldosterone (17Schafer J.A. Hawk C.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 255-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Vasopressin functions by binding to V2 receptors and activating adenylate cyclase. Its effect on sodium transport is mimicked by membrane permeable cAMP analogues, phosphodiesterase inhibition with IBMX or adenylate cyclase activation with forskolin (FSK). Recent evidence suggests that V2 receptor stimulation reduces sodium excretion in healthy humans. This indicates that the cAMP pathway of ENaC regulation is indeed relevant for sodium homeostasis in humans (18Bankir L. Fernandes S. Bardoux P. Bouby N. Bichet D.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1920-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that the response to antidiuretic hormone is mediated by the activation of PKA and subsequent phosphorylation events. Whereas it has been proposed that PKA may directly phosphorylate ENaC (8Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), definitive proof for this has not yet emerged and as far as we know a functionally relevant PKA site has not yet been identified in any of the three ENaC subunits. Alternatively, PKA may modify other not yet identified proteins involved in ENaC regulation. Moreover, cAMP may affect ENaC via the recently identified EPaC pathway (19Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Considerable efforts have been made to address the question whether cAMP primarily increases the open probability of ENaC or its surface expression. Whereas there is convincing experimental evidence for both mechanisms, the relative importance of the two mechanisms remains a matter of debate and may vary under different experimental conditions and from tissue to tissue. There is little doubt that cAMP can have major effects on ENaC surface expression. Indeed, data from a quantitative approach, using a combination of short circuit current (ISC) measurements and antibody detection of epitope-tagged ENaC expressed at the cell surface, indicate that in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing ENaC, the increase in ISC produced by cAMP, can be accounted for entirely by a proportional increase in the surface density of ENaC (20Morris R.G. Schafer J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Enhanced surface expression may be caused by stimulation of channel insertion or by inhibition of channel retrieval, and there is evidence that both mechanisms contribute to a cAMP-mediated increase in ENaC surface expression. It has been reported that acute ENaC stimulation by cAMP is mediated by exocytotic insertion from a recycling channel pool (21Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and that cAMP-mediated stimulation of ENaC translocation to the cell surface is dependent on the C-terminal PY motifs (22Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a mechanism for the inhibition of ENaC retrieval by cAMP, it has been proposed that PKA phosphorylates Nedd4-2 in a similar manner as SGK (13Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Münster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.-D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 14Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting Need4-2-mediated channel ubiquitination, retrieval, and subsequent proteasomal degradation (23Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Kabra R. Zhou R. Steines J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45753-45758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several groups including our own (24Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2003; 445: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have previously failed to demonstrate ENaC stimulation by increasing intracellular cAMP in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing ENaC. These findings suggested that activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway may not be sufficient for ENaC activation in the oocyte system and that in the native tissue additional factors may be involved that are missing in the oocytes. However, a 2–3-fold stimulation of ENaC currents has recently been reported in oocytes heterologously expressing rat ENaC that had been exposed to a mixture containing the membrane permeant cAMP analogue chlorophenylthio-cAMP and IBMX for 1 h (25Segal A. Cucu D. Van Driessche W. Weber W.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This finding led us to hypothesize that a prolonged increase in intracellular cAMP may be necessary to obtain a robust stimulatory effect on ENaC in the oocyte expression system. Exposure times to drugs, to increase intracellular cAMP, may well have been too short in previous studies and a potential stimulatory effect of cAMP may have been obscured by concomitant channel “run down” (24Konstas A.A. Koch J.P. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2003; 445: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Volk T. Konstas A.A. Bassalay P. Ehmke H. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 447: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the present study we demonstrate that a prolonged exposure (about 24 h) of oocytes to 1 mm IBMX and 1 μm FSK resulted on average in a 10-fold increase in ENaC currents. This was associated with a concomitant increase in channel surface expression, caused by an inhibition of channel retrieval. In addition, an increase in channel open probability contributed to the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified ENaC regions that are functionally relevant for the stimulatory effect of cAMP. We found no evidence for a role of putative PKA or CK-2 sites in mediating the stimulation. Instead, our results indicate that two putative ERK consensus motifs in the C termini of β and γ ENaC are critically involved in the regulatory pathway, by which cAMP activates the channel. Molecular Biology—The full-length cDNAs encoding the three subunits of wild-type (WT) rat ENaC (α, β, and γ ENaC) (27Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D.

Mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis extension overlap PCR or the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, The Netherlands). Mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. The following mutant channel subunits were generated (sequences of the forward and reverse primers are given in parentheses): αS617A-ENaC (5′-CTACGCCGGTTCCGGGCCCGGTACTGGTCTCCA-3′; 5′-TGGAGACCAGTACCGGGCCCGGAACCGGCGTAG3′), αS617A/S621A-ENaC (5′-CGGTTCCGGGCCCGGTACTGGGCCCCAGGACGAGGG-3′; 5′-CCCTCGTCCTGGGGCCCAGTACCGGGCCCGGAACCG-3′), αS621A-ENaC (5′-CGGAGCCGGTACTGGGCCCCAGGACGAGGGGCC-3′; 5′-GGCCCCTCGTCCTGGGGCCCAGTACCGGCTCCG-3′), αY673A-ENaC (5′-CCTCCACCTGCCGCCGCTACTCTAGGC-3′; 5′-GCCTAGAGTAGCGGCGGCAGGTGGAGG-3′), αT67A-ENaC (5′-CCGGCAGCCCGCGGAGGAGGAGGAG-3′; 5′-CTCCTCCTCCTCCGCGGGCTGCCGG-3′), αT109A-ENaC (5′-ACAACCGCATGAAGGCCGCCTTCTGGGCG-3′; 5′-CGCCCAGAAGGCGGCCTTCATGCGGTTGT-3′), βT575A-ENaC (5′-CCCGCCGCCCGCAGTGGCCGAGC-3′; 5′-GCTCGGCCACTGCGGGCGGCGGG-3′), βT613A-ENaC (5′-CCCATTCCGGGCGCCCCACCTCCCAAC-3′; 5′-GTTGGGAGGTGGGGCGCCCGGAATGGG-3′), βY618A-ENaC (5′-CCACCTCCCAACGCCGACTCCCTGAGG-3′; 5′-CCTCAGGGAGTCGGCGTTGGGAGGTGG-3′), βS631A-ENaC (5′-CTGGACACCATGGAGGCCGACAGCGAGGTGGAG-3′; 5′-CTCCACCTCGCTGTCGGCCTCCATGGTGTCCAG-3′), βS633A-ENaC (5′-CCATGGAGTCTGACGCCGAGGTGGAGGCCATC-3′; 5′-GATGGCCTCCACCTCGGCGTCAGACTCCATGG-3′), βS631A/S633A-ENaC (5′-CCATGGAGGCCGACGCCGAGGTGGAGGCC-3′; 5′-GGCCTCCACCTCGGCGTCGGCCTCCATGG-3′), γT579A-ENaC (5′-CGTAGGCAGGCCCCGCCCTCCACTGAG-3′; 5′-CTCAGTGGAGGGCGGGGCCTGCCTACG-3′), γT599A-ENaC (5′-GGATAATCCAGCTCTGGATGCCGACGATGACCTGC-3′; 5′-GCAGGTCATCGTCGGCATCCAGAGCTGGATTATCC-3′), γT623A-ENaC (5′-GGTGCCTGGCGCACCACCTCCCA-3′; 5′-TGGGAGGTGGTGCGCCAGGCACC-3′), γY628A-ENaC (5′-CCACCTCCCAGAGCCAATACCTTGCGC-3′; 5′-GCGCAAGGTATTGGCTCTGGGAGGTGG-3′), γT630A-ENaC (5′-CCCAGATACAATGCCTTGCGCTTGGATAGAGCC-3′; 5′-GGCTCTATCCAAGCGCAAGGCATTGTATCTGGG-3′), γS638A-ENaC (5′-GGATAGAGCCTTTGCCTCCCAGCTCACAGAC-3′; 5′-GTCTGTGAGCTGGGAGGCAAAGGCTCTATCC-3′). Isolation of Oocytes and Two-electrode Voltage-clamp Experiments—Isolation of X. laevis oocytes, injection of cRNA, and two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed essentially as described previously (29Konstas A.-A.

Defolliculated stage V–VI oocytes were co-injected with an equal amount of cRNA per ENaC subunit (αβγ) ranging from 0.0125 to 0.3 ng. To study the effect of mutations, individual wild-type ENaC subunits were replaced by mutant subunits as indicated. Injected oocytes were kept in “high sodium” (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) or in “low sodium” (in mm: 1 NaCl, 60 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 40 KCl, 0.3 Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 CaCl2, 0.8 MgSO4, 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) modified Barths saline supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin (sodium salt) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Unless stated otherwise, oocytes were studied 2 days after cRNA injection. Oocytes were routinely clamped at a holding potential at –60 mV. The amiloride-sensitive current (ΔIAmi) was determined by subtracting the corresponding current value measured in the presence of 2 μm amiloride from that measured prior to the absence of amiloride in a NaCl solution (in mm: 95 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, adjust to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Data are given as mean ± S.E.; n indicates the number of oocytes; N indicates the number of different batches of oocytes used; significance was evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for not normally distributed data. Surface Labeling of Oocytes—Experiments were essentially performed as described previously (30Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C.

Peroxidase-conjugated affinity sheep anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Boronia Victoria, Australia) was used as secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence of individual oocytes placed in 50 μl of Power Signal ELISA solution (Pierce) was quantified in a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA) by integrating the signal over a period of 15 s. Results are given in relative light units (RLU). Western Blotting—Oocytes were homogenized in ice-cold buffer solution (containing in mm: 100 β-glycerolphosphate, 1.5 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 1 dithiothreitol, 20 HEPES (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 NaF prior to use) by pipetting them up and down several times and passing them five times through a 27-gauge needle. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteins in the supernatant were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by electrophoretical transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a semi-dry blotting chamber. The blot was processed according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer of the rabbit anti-MAPK (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) and phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) was used as secondary antibody. Bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus™ Western blotting Detection Reagent, Amersham Biosciences). Solutions and Chemicals—3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), FSK, brefeldin A (BFA), PD 98059, U0126, SB 203580, roscovitine, SP 600125, progesterone, and amiloride hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma. To prepare stock solutions, BFA and progesterone were dissolved in ethanol, whereas amiloride was dissolved in water. All other substances were dissolved in Me2SO. Stock solutions were stored as recommended by the manufacturer and were diluted in aqueous solutions immediately prior to use in the experiments. Me2SO and ethanol were added to control solutions as appropriate. The sulfhydryl reagent MTSET (((2-trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate bromide) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Increasing Intracellular cAMP by Prolonged Exposure to IBMX/FSK Stimulates ENaC Currents in X. laevis Oocytes—One day after cRNA injection, oocytes heterologously expressing the three subunits (αβγ) of rat ENaC were exposed to a combination of 1 mm IBMX and 1 μm forskolin (IBMX/FSK) to increase intracellular cAMP. ENaC activity was assessed by measuring the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current (ΔIAmi). Fig. 1A summarizes data from a representative set of experiments performed in one batch of oocytes. One group of oocytes was exposed to IBMX/FSK for 24 h, the other group served as a time-matched control. Exposure to IBMX/FSK largely increased ΔIAmi, as illustrated by the average I/V plots shown in Fig. 1A. The I/V plots also demonstrate that in both groups of oocytes the reversal potential of ΔIAmi was close to zero. This is consistent with the well known fact that ENaC-expressing oocytes, kept in the presence of high extracellular Na+, will become severely Na+ loaded with an intracellular Na+ concentration approaching that of the extracellular solution (27Canessa C.M.

A significant stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK on ENaC currents was observed in all batches of oocytes tested. On average a 24-h exposure to IBMX/FSK increased ΔIAmi by a factor of 9.7 ± 0.8 (n = 88, Fig. 1B). A time course of the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK is shown in Fig. 1C. The stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK persisted up to 30 h and became increasingly prominent with prolonged exposure. Fig. 1C also demonstrates that the effect of IBMX/FSK was reversible after washout. IBMX/FSK Stimulates ENaC Currents by Increasing the Surface Expression of the Channel—The stimulation of ΔIAmi in oocytes exposed to IBMX/FSK may be caused by an increase in channel open probability (PO) of ENaC, by an increase in the number of ENaC channels expressed at the cell surface, or by a combination of both effects. To investigate this question we assessed ΔIAmi and surface expression of extracellular FLAG-tagged ENaC (ENaC-FLAG) using a chemiluminescence assay (30Konstas A.-A. Bielfeld-Ackermann A. Korbmacher C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 752-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 1D demonstrate that surface expression and ΔIAmi were concomitantly increased in oocytes treated with IBMX/FSK. These findings indicate that an increase in the number of ENaC channels expressed at the cell surface is an important mechanism underlying the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK on ΔIAmi. IBMX/FSK Also Increase the Open Probability of ENaC—To address the question whether IBMX/FSK also alters channel open probability, we performed experiments using the S518C mutant of the β-subunit of rat ENaC (βS518C). This mutant channel can be converted from a channel with a normal open probability to a channel with an open probability of nearly one by exposing the channel to the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET, which destabilizes the closed state of the channel (28Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. J. Physiol. 2002; 543: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As illustrated by two representative whole cell current traces in Fig. 2, A and B, application of MTSET caused a substantial increase in ΔIAmi, in both control and IBMX/FSK-treated oocytes. On average, MTSET increased ΔIAmi about 6-fold in control oocytes and about 2-fold in IBMX/FSK-treated oocytes (Fig. 2C). If MTSET converted the open probability of all active ion channels present at the cell surface to one, these findings indicate that the average open probability of the channels prior to the application of MTSET must have been about 0.17 and 0.5 in control and IBMX/FSK-treated oocytes, respectively. This finding indicates that in addition to stimulating the surface expression of ENaC, treatment with IBMX/FSK also increases the average channel open probability by about 3-fold. However, a 3-fold increase in open probability is not sufficient to account for the 7-fold increase in ΔIAmi observed in IBMX/FSK-treated oocytes expressing the βS518C mutant channel (Fig. 2C), which is of similar magnitude to the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK on ΔIAmi in oocytes expressing wild-type ENaC (see above). Indeed, the finding that after stimulation by IBMX/FSK the application of MTSET causes a further 2.4-fold increase in ΔIAmi indicates that the open probability of the channel is only moderately increased by IBMX/FSK. Thus, our MTSET data confirm"

We have previously shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) activate the E2F1-Bim apoptotic pathway, leading to efficient cell killing in cancer cells with deregulated E2F1 activity. To identify additional gene cassettes that might contribute HDACI-induced apoptosis upon E2F1 activation, we investigated the apoptotic transcriptional network affected by HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in cancer cells with inducible E2F1. Data analysis focusing on 220 apoptosis-related genes identified apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) as one of a few genes in addition to Bim that are substantially up-regulated by SAHA upon E2F1 activation. We show that ASK1 is directly regulated by E2F1 and that prevention of ASK1 induction by RNA interference decreases SAHA-induced apoptosis. We further show that the role of ASK1 in the SAHA apoptotic response is not associated with its downstream effectors p38 or JNK. Instead, ASK1 knockdown results in reduced E2F1 transcriptional activity, leading to decreased Bim induction by SAHA. Moreover, ASK1 expression reverses the negative effect of Rb on E2F1 activity. These results indicate that ASK1 induction by E2F1 provides positive feedback regulation of E2F1 activity via Rb inhibition, which allows an efficient E2F1-Bim activation. Thus, the concomitant induction of E2F1 targets ASK1 and Bim by HDACIs warrants an effective activation of E2F1-dependent apoptosis in response to SAHA.

The E2F family of transcription factors plays a critical role in overall cell cycle control. Members of the E2F family of transcription factors control cell proliferation by regulating the expression of genes required for S-phase entry and progression (1Dyson N.

Thus, pharmacologic activation of E2F1-mediated apoptosis in p53-deficient tumors can be explored to overcome the chemoresistance in these tumors.E2Fs activity is negatively modulated by pRB tumor suppressor. Hypophosphorylated Rb binds to and sequesters the activating E2Fs (E2F1-3) (19Attwooll C. Denchi E.L. Helin K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4709-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), resulting in the repression of proliferation-associated genes. Inactivation of pRB through phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases and other kinases results in increased E2F1 activity and subsequent transactivation of genes required for cell cycle progression, leading to aberrant cell proliferation (20Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4944) Google Scholar). Although Rb disruption primarily occurs in retinoblastoma, Rb inactivation can be caused in many tumor types by alterations of other components in this regulatory machinery, such as loss of p16(INK4) or overexpression of Cyclin D1 or cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (21Sherr C.J.

We previously showed that HDAC inhibitors such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and trichostatin A can promote oncogene E2F1-mediated apoptosis through the induction of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bim and that this apoptosis does not require p53 or p73 (26Zhao Y.

As a result, cancer cells with deregulated E2F1 activity are sensitive to HDACIs. In this study, we interrogated the transcriptional response of the apoptotic network to HDAC inhibitor SAHA that is affected by E2F1 activity and identified ASK1 as an additional target of E2F1 that participates in HDACI-induced cell death. Contrary to an established role of ASK1 in regulating its downstream apoptotic signaling pathways, we have shown that ASK1 induction contributes to SAHA-induced apoptosis through positive feedback regulation of E2F1 apoptotic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Chemicals—p53 null HCT116 cells expressing inducible E2F1 were described previously (26Zhao Y.

IMR90-E1A cells were kindly provided by Dr. Claudio Brancolini (University of Di Udine, Italy). All cell culture reagents and media were from Invitrogen. SAHA was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA).Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with the use of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturers' instructions. For all experiments, universal human reference RNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate a reference probe for drug-treated and untreated samples. 30 μg of total RNA from experimental samples or an equal amount of universal human reference RNA were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The microarray hybridization, image process, and data normalization were as described previously (27Yu Q. He M. Lee N.H. Liu E.T. J. Biol.

The log 2 ratios of each time point were then normalized for each gene to that of untreated cells (time 0) to obtain the relative expression pattern. Gene expression values of 220 apoptosis-related genes were extracted and analyzed using clustering and display programs (rana.stanford.edu/software) developed by Eisen et al. (28Eisen M.B.

Cells were grown to 50% confluence and infected with recombinant adenovirus. Twenty-four hours after the infection, cells were treated with drugs for indicated times.Flow Cytometry Analysis of DNA Content and Caspase-3 Activity—Cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) after treatment with RNase (100 μg/ml). The stained cells were analyzed for DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle fractions were quantified using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To measure caspase-3 activity, cells were fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) as instructed and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-active caspase-3 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Quantification of cells positive for the caspase-3 detection was performed by flow cytometry.Reverse Transcription-PCR—One microgram of total RNA from each sample was subjected to PCR with reverse transcription using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was carried out for 20-30 cycles, with each cycle consisting of a denaturing step for 1 min at 94 °C, an annealing step for 2 min at 58 °C, and a polymerization step for 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was separated on a 2.0% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet light. The primer sequences are available upon request.Western Blotting—Cells were scraped, collected, and lysed. Protein samples (50 μg) were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Antibodies against the following proteins were used: E2F1, ASK1, p73, Cyclin E, α-tubulin, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bim (BD Biosciences), phospho-p38, p38, phospho-JNK, and JNK (Cell Signaling Technologies). Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence signal by x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY).Luciferase Reporter Assay—Genomic DNA containing the human ASK1 promoter elements -1000/+125, -1000/-256, and -273/+125 were cloned into pGL3-luciferase construct (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase system (Promega). HCT116 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well of a 24-well plate and transfected with a mixture containing luciferase reporter plasmid, E2F1, ASK1, or Rb expression vectors. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the luciferase activities were analyzed using the Dual Luciferase system.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described previously for E2F1 (29Urist M. Tanaka T. Poyurovsky M.V. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, ER-E2F1-expressing cells treated with SAHA in the presence or absence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was inactivated by addition of 125 mm glycine. Chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments of 500-bp average size were immunoprecipitated using anti-E2F1 polyclonal antibody (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform Isoamyl alcohol (Ambion). The DNA recovered was subjected to amplification by PCR using HotStarTaq Master Mix kit (Qiagen). Approximately 20 ng of the input and the ChIP samples were used as template in each reaction. Reaction mixtures were initially melted at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 27 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 60 °C/30 s, 72 °C/30 s, and a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. The primers used in the PCR were: ChIP-ASK1-F, TAATCGCTTGCGCTCCAGGT, and ChIP-ASK1-R, GAGTTTAGAGTACAAGGGGT.RNA Interference—SMARTpool® E2F1, ASK1 siRNA, and negative control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc.(Lafayette, CO). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of siRNAs.RESULTSTranscriptional Apoptotic Network Regulated by SAHA and E2F1—In the previous study, we reported that HDACIs activate E2F1-dependent apoptosis and that the E2F1 target Bim plays a crucial role in this process. To fully characterize the genomic program and to identify additional molecular events that might participate in E2F1-dependent apoptosis in response to HDAC inhibition, we employed DNA microarray analysis and an E2F1-inducible HCT116 p53 null cell line (26Zhao Y. Tan J. Zhuang L. Jiang X. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 106: 16090-16095Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this cell system, E2F1 is fused to the estrogen receptor (ER)-binding domain (30Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and ER-E2F1 is activated by ER ligand 4-OHT. As described previously (26Zhao Y. Tan J. Zhuang L. Jiang X. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 106: 16090-16095Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and as shown here in Fig. 1A, HDAC inhibitor SAHA induced markedly increased apoptosis upon E2F1 activation by 4-OHT.To determine the apoptotic program that contributes to SAHA-induced apoptosis as a result of E2F1 activation, we focused on 220 well annotated apoptosis-related genes represented in the 19k gene array. We began by defining apoptotic genes activated by 4-OHT over a 4-, 8-, and 24-h time course in ER-E2F1-expressing cells or cells expressing the empty vector that contain ER-binding domain only (ER). Gene expression data from each time point were cluster analyzed and displayed in TreeView software (28Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, 42 of 220 apoptosis-related genes showed increased expression after 4-OHT treatment in ER-E2F1 cells, but not in ER cells, indicating these apoptotic genes are potentially regulated by E2F1. Among E2F1-regulated apoptotic genes, BCl2L11, TP73, and CASP3 are previously known E2F1 targets and were strongly up-regulated by E2F1. In addition, we found for the first time that RUNX3, ATM, TP53BPL, and RPS6KA1 were also substantially activated by E2F1.To identify SAHA-responsive genes that reflect the E2F1 apoptotic activity, we next compared the expression patterns of apoptosis genes commonly and selectively activated by SAHA treatment in the presence and absence of 4-OHT. 49 genes were found to be up-regulated by SAHA for at least one time point regardless of the presence of 4-OHT (Fig. 1C). As previously described, we found that SAHA strongly activated multiple genes implicated in the apoptosis program. Among them are those involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (31Peart M.J. Smyth G.K. van Laar R.K. Bowtell D.D. Richon V.M. Marks P.A. Holloway A.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3697-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), such as Bcl2-family members (BCl2L11, BNIP3L, BCL10), APAF1 and CASP3. Genes belonging to the receptor-mediated death pathway (TNFRSF1B, TNFRSF10D, and TNFSF13) were also induced by SAHA, albeit to lesser extents. Among them, 15 were E2F1 targets as marked in Fig. 1C. We reasoned that, if SAHA activates the E2F1 apoptotic program, then we should find a set of genes whose expression can be further induced by SAHA upon E2F1 activation. Indeed, cluster analysis revealed a subset of genes whose expression was markedly enhanced by SAHA upon E2F1 activation by 4-OHT (Fig. 1C, cluster A). Notably, in cluster A MAP3K5, which encodes apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1(ASK1) and appeared to be weakly induced by E2F1 alone, was strongly unregulated by SAHA upon E2F1 activation. In the same cluster were BCl2L11 (Bim) and CASP3, which had been described in our previous study (26Zhao Y. Tan J. Zhuang L. Jiang X. Liu E.T. Yu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 106: 16090-16095Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These observations support two conclusions: 1) SAHA activates E2F1 apoptotic activity in a target gene-specific manner, and 2) ASK1 is an E2F1-regulated target and its expression can be activated by SAHA.Both Exogenous and Endogenous E2F1 Regulate ASK1 Expression—To confirm the results obtained from the gene expression analysis, reverse transcription PCR experiments were performed to examine the ASK1 mRNA levels in HCT116 cells expressing ER-E2F1, ER, or a DNA binding-defective mutant of E2F1 (E132) fused to ER. In agreement with the microarray data, activation of E2F1 by 4-OHT resulted in an increase in ASK1 mRNA level, but not in cells expressing ER or ER-E132 (Fig. 2A, left panel). Consistently, ASK1 protein accumulated following 4-OHT treatment in ER-E2F1-expressing cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). To investigate whether ASK1 expression is associated with the endogenous E2F1, we arrested the human osteosarcoma cells U2OS in G0/G1 phase by serum starvation (Fig. 2B, left panel). Expression of E2F1 was elevated when serum-starved U2OS cells reentered the cell cycle following serum addition (Fig. 2B, right panel). Corresponding to the enhanced E2F1 activity, we detected an increase in ASK1 expression as cells entered S-phase, together with the bona-fide E2F1 targets p73 and Cyclin E. Thus, ASK1 expression correlated with endogenous E2F1 expression. To further substantiate this conclusion, we also used the adenovirus-expressing oncoprotein E1A (Ad-E1A) to infect U2OS and IMR90 cells. E1A binds to and inactivates Rb family members (1Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 32Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), resulting in the activation of endogenous E2F1 (9Macleod K.F. Hu Y. Jacks T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6178-6188Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33Hurford Jr., R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Thus, cells overexpressing E1A will have enhanced E2F1 activity and therefore increased expression of E2F1 target genes. Indeed, we found that Ad-E1A infection resulted in the up-regulation of ASK1 and p73 in both U2OS and IMR90 cells (Fig. 2C). These observations suggest that activation of endogenous E2F1 is able to induce the expression of ASK1.FIGURE 2E2F1 induces ASK1 mRNA and protein accumulation. A, p53 null HCT116 cells were infected with an empty retrovirus (ER), a retrovirus expressing ER-E2F1 (E2F1) or ER-E2F1-E132 (E132). Cells were left untreated (-) or treated with 4-OHT (+) for the indicated duration. ASK1 mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (left panel) and Western blot (right panel), respectively. B, U2OS cells had been synchronized in G0 (0h) by serum starvation for 48 h and then reentered the cell cycle after serum stimulation. The corresponding cell cycle distribution is shown (left panel). Proteins were extracted from cells at different times after release into the cell cycle. E2F1, ASK1, and Cyclin E were analyzed by Western blotting (right panel). C, Western blot analysis of ASK1, p73, and α-tubulin protein in U2OS and IMR90 cells infected with the control adenovirus (-) or an adenovirus expressing E1A (+).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ASK1 Is a Direct Target of E2F1—To determine whether the E2F1 induction of ASK1 is regulated at the level of transcription, the ASK1 promoter was isolated and subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid. Fig. 3A illustrates the promoter region of the ASK1 gene, including the putative E2F-binding sites as well as the deletion mutant for reporter constructs. As shown in Fig. 3B, the promoter activity of the 1.0-kb 5′-proximal region of the ASK1 gene can be markedly activated by increasing amounts of E2F1 plasmid. To determine the potential E2F binding region that mediates the induction, we next measured ASK1 promoter activity using various deletion mutants. The deletion constructs containing the region between -1000 and -256 were not responsive to E2F1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, E2F1 can activate the -273/+125 promoter up to 12-fold, suggesting that the putative E2F1-binding site within -273/+125 is a functional E2F1-responsive element in the ASK1 promoter.FIGURE 3E2F1 binds to and activates ASK1 promoter. A, schematic representation of the human ASK1 promoter. Putative E2F-binding sites and the deletion constructs used in this study are indicated. B, HCT116 cells were transfected with PGL3-basic and E2F1 (50 or 100 ng), together with a luciferase reporter construct containing the ASK1 promoter (-1000/+125). Relative luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection. Results are depicted as fold induction after normalization to Renilla luciferase activity. C, mapping of the E2F1 DNA binding region. HCT116 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing the indicated ASK1 promoter deletions and 100 ng of E2F1. D, ER-E2F1- and ER-E132-expressing cells were treated with or without 4-OHT for 16 h. ChIP assay was performed using anti-E2F1 antibody or nonspecific IgG. The ASK1 promoter region containing the functional E2F1-responsive element was amplified by PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the in vivo recruitment of E2F1 to the ASK1 gene promoter, we used ER-E2F1- or a DNA binding-deficient mutant (ER-E132)-expressing cells to perform the ChIP assay. In the absence of 4-OHT, anti-E2F1 immunoprecipitated the proximal region of the ASK1 gene promoter containing the E2F1 motif in both ER-E2F1- and ER-E132-expressing cells, whereas control IgG did not (Fig. 3D). This indicates that endogenous E2F1 binds to the ASK1 promoter. In the presence of 4-OHT, which activates ER-E2F1, recruitment of E2F1 to the ASK1 promoter was substantially increased in ER-E2F1 cells, whereas the activation of binding mutant ER-E132 failed to do so. In light of these results, we conclude that E2F1 activates ASK1 transcription and ASK1 is a direct target of E2F1.ASK1 Regulates E2F1 Activity through a Positive Feedback Mechanism—E2F1 activity is negatively regulated by pRB. pRB hyperphosphorylation inactivates Rb, resulting in increased E2F1 activity. ASK1 has been recently shown to interact with and inactivate pRB (34Dasgupta P. Betts V. Rastogi S. Joshi B. Morris M. Brennan B. Ordonez-Ercan D. Chellappan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38762-38769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This observation raises the possibility that ASK1 induction by E2F1 might lead to pRB inhibition and thus provide a positive feedback loop on E2F1 activity. Given this possibility, we determined whether ASK1 knockdown by siRNA could impair the activation of E2F1 targets. In ER-E2F1-expressing cells, activation of E2F1 by 4-OHT resulted in the induction of ASK1 as well as other E2F1 targets p73, Bim, and Cyclin E. We found that depletion of ASK1 by siRNA not only prevented its own induction by 4-OHT but also substantially impaired the induction of p73, Bim, and Cyclin E (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that E2F1-mediated ASK1 induction permits a positive feedback effect on E2F1 activity, leading to the sufficient induction of E2F1 target genes.FIGURE 4ASK1 regulates E2F1 target gene expression through Rb inactivation. A, ER-E2F1-expressing cells were transfected with nonspecific control siRNA (NC siRNA) or ASK1-specific siRNA for 48 h and then either left untreated (-) or treated with 4-OHT. The expression of ASK1, Bim, Cyclin E, and p73 was analyzed by Western blotting. B, HCT116 cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the Bim promoter, together with E2F1, Rb, or ASK1 expression vector. In addition, ASK1 expression plasmid was cotransfected with E2F1 to determine the effect of ASK1 on E2F1-mediated activation of the Bim promoter in the presence or absence of Rb overexpression. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. from three experiments. *, p <0.01, E2F1 +ASK1 versus E2F1; **, p <0.01, E2F1+Rb+ASK1 versus E2F1+Rb, based on Student's t-test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate whether ASK1 activates E2F1 activity through inhibition of Rb, we used the E2F1-responsive Bim promoter to test the effect of ASK1 on E2F1/Rb-mediated regulation of Bim promoter activity. In the luciferase reporter assay, ectopic expression of E2F1 activated the Bim promoter; as expected, this E2F1 function was inhibited by coexpression of pRB (Fig. 4B). Further introduction of the ASK1 expression plasmid reversed the negative effect of Rb on E2F1-mediated activation of the Bim promoter (Fig. 4B). Thus, these results support the conclusion that ASK1 induction by E2F1 results in Rb inactivation and thereby increases E2F1 activity through a positive feedback loop.SAHA Promotes E2F1-mediated ASK1 Induction—Microarray analysis as shown in Fig. 1 indicates that ASK1, like Bim, is weakly regulated by E2F1; however, this"
https://openalex.org/W2069554407,"DNA ligase D (LigD) is a large polyfunctional enzyme involved in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) in mycobacteria. LigD consists of a C-terminal ATP-dependent ligase domain fused to upstream polymerase and phosphoesterase modules. Here we report the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the ligase domain of Mycobacterium LigD, captured as the covalent ligase-AMP intermediate with a divalent metal in the active site. A chloride anion on the protein surface coordinated by the ribose 3′-OH and caged by arginine and lysine side chains is a putative mimetic of the 5′-phosphate at a DNA nick. Structure-guided mutational analysis revealed distinct requirements for the adenylylation and end-sealing reactions catalyzed by LigD. We found that a mutation of Mycobacterium LigD that ablates only ligase activity results in decreased fidelity of NHEJ in vivo and a strong bias of mutagenic events toward deletions instead of insertions at the sealed DNA ends. This phenotype contrasts with the increased fidelity of double-strand break repair in ΔligD cells or in a strain in which only the polymerase function of LigD is defective. We surmise that the signature error-prone quality of bacterial NHEJ in vivo arises from a dynamic balance between the end-remodeling and end-sealing steps.

We surmise that the signature error-prone quality of bacterial NHEJ in vivo arises from a dynamic balance between the end-remodeling and end-sealing steps. DNA ligases are essential for the maintenance of genome integrity. As nick-sealing enzymes, they are responsible for joining the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the DNA replication fork and for restoring the continuity of the DNA backbone subsequent to nucleotide excision and base excision repair. Nick sealing entails a series of three nucleotidyl transfer reactions (1Lehman I.R. Science. 1974; 186: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In the first step, a lysine nucleophile in the ligase active site attacks the α-phosphorus of ATP or NAD+ to form a covalent lysyl-N-AMP intermediate and expel either pyrophosphate or nicotinamide mononucleotide. In the second step, the 5′-phosphate of the DNA nick attacks the phosphorus of lysyl-AMP to form a DNA-adenylylate (A(5′)pp(5′)DNA) intermediate and expel the lysine. The third step is the attack of the nick 3′-OH on the DNA-adenylylate to form a 3′-5′-phosphodiester and release AMP. DNA ligases comprise one branch of the covalent nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, which includes RNA ligases and mRNA capping enzymes (2Shuman S. Lima C.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The superfamily members catalyze chemically similar NMP addition reactions at polynucleotide 5′ ends via lysyl-N-NMP intermediates.

Many organisms have more than one DNA ligase, suggesting that a division of labor has evolved whereby individual ligase isozymes have taken on specialized functions in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. This specialization is often correlated with the fusion of new structural modules to the “ancestral” ligase catalytic core, either upstream of the NT domain or downstream of the OB domain, or both (reviewed in Ref. 20Martin I.V. MacNeill S.A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 3005.1-3005.7Crossref Google Scholar). Eukaryal organisms typically have at least two DNA ligases, of which one is devoted to DNA replication/repair functions (e.g. mammalian DNA ligase I or its yeast homolog Cdc9), whereas the other ligase (named DNA ligase IV) is dedicated to the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of double-strand break repair (21Wilson T.E. Grawunder U. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 22Teo S.H. Jackson S.P.

The specialization of eukaryal ligases I and IV has progressed to the degree that neither protein can perform the in vivo functions normally executed by the other (24Teo S.H. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This situation reflects a loss of pluripotency, insofar as a minimal eukaryotic viral DNA ligase containing only the core NT and OB modules is capable of performing an apparently full repertoire of replicative, repair, and NHEJ functions in yeast when it is the only ligase available (15Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Odell M. Malinina L. Sriskanda V. Teplova M. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5090-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recent studies have highlighted an unexpected complexity of the DNA ligase menu in bacteria. Although all bacterial species have an essential NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (LigA), quite a few have either a second NAD+-dependent ligase (e.g. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia pestis, and Pseudomonas putida) (26Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4930-4934Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or an additional ATP-dependent ligase (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) (27Cheng C.

At the extreme end of the spectrum are Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, which have multiple nonessential ATP-dependent DNA ligases (named LigB, LigC, and LigD) in addition to the NAD+-dependent LigA enzyme (30Gong C.

Interest in LigD is fueled by evidence that it functions together with a bacterial Ku homolog in an NHEJ pathway characterized by a high incidence of frameshift mutations at the sites of DSB repair (30Gong C.

The fact that LigD and Ku are jointly present in the proteomes of many diverse bacteria hints that NHEJ is broadly relevant to bacterial physiology, perhaps as a mechanism to repair chromosome breaks in nondividing cells. LigD is distinguished from all other DNA ligases insofar as its enzymatic activity is not limited to sealing DNA strands. Rather, it is a polyfunctional enzyme consisting of an ATP-dependent ligase (LIG) domain fused to a polymerase (POL) domain and a phosphoesterase module (29Zhu H. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Biochemical characterization of the POL and phosphoesterase components suggests that they provide a means of remodeling the 3′ ends of broken DNA strands prior to sealing by the LIG component. The LigD POL domain catalyzes either nontemplated single-nucleotide additions to a blunt-ended duplex DNA or fill-in synthesis at a 5′-tailed duplex DNA; these are the molecular signatures of mutagenic mycobacterial NHEJ in vivo at blunt-end and 5′-overhang DSBs, respectively (31Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Although LigD is a relatively poor nick-sealing enzyme in vitro compared with LigA or LigB, its strand joining activity is stimulated by Ku, which interacts physically with LigD, likely via the LigD POL domain (30Gong C.

To gain a better understanding of LigD and its role in NHEJ, we have begun to determine the structures and structure-activity relationships of the three component domains and to interrogate genetically their contributions to the efficiency and fidelity of DSB repair in vivo. The crystal structure of the POL domain of Pseudomonas LigD revealed a minimized polymerase with a two-metal mechanism and a fold similar to that of archaeal DNA primase (38Zhu H. Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J. Wang L.K. Glickman M.S. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The role of the LigD POL during NHEJ in vivo was examined by allelic replacement in M. smegmatis. A mutant ligD gene encoding a polymerase-defective, ligase-active full-length MsmLigD protein was introduced at the ligD locus. Ablating the polymerase activity resulted in increased fidelity of blunt-end DSB repair in vivo by virtue of eliminating nucleotide insertions at the recombination junctions (38Zhu H. Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J. Wang L.K. Glickman M.S. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, LigD POL is a direct catalyst of +1 frameshifting during NHEJ in vivo. Here we focus on the LIG domain of Mycobacterium LigD. We report the 2.4 Å crystal structure of the ligase-AMP intermediate with a divalent cation cofactor and a chloride anion (a putative mimetic of the DNA 5′-phosphate) coordinated in the active site. Structure-guided mutational analysis illuminates distinct roles for individual side chains during the three steps of the ligation reaction. We report surprising effects on NHEJ outcomes in M. smegmatis when only the LIG function of LigD is ablated. LigD Mutants—Plasmid pET-MtuLigD encodes the M. tuberculosis LigD polypeptide fused to an N-terminal His10 tag (30Gong C. Martins A. Bongiorno P. Glickman M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20594-20606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Alanine mutations were introduced into the ligD gene by the two-stage PCR overlap extension method (62Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar) using pET-MtuLigD as the template. The PCR products were digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b (Novagen). The inserts of the mutant pET-MtuLigD-Ala plasmids were sequenced completely to exclude the acquisition of unwanted changes during amplification and cloning. LigD Purification—Wild-type and Ala mutant pET-MtuLigD plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). One-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-MtuLigD were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached ∼0.6. The cultures were chilled on ice for 30 min, adjusted to 0.1 mm isopropyl d-thiogalactoside and 2% ethanol, and then incubated at 17 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were applied to 1-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 8 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 4-ml aliquots of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 25, 50, and 200 mm imidazole. Polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. LigD was recovered predominantly in the 200 mm imidazole fraction. The wild-type and mutant LigD preparations were stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of serial dilutions of the LigD preparations in parallel with serial dilutions of a BSA standard. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the staining intensities of the LigD and BSA polypeptides were quantified using a Digital Imaging and Analysis System from Alpha Innotech Corp. LigD concentrations were determined by interpolation to the BSA standard curve. LIG Domain Purification—A gene segment encoding the MtuLigD LIG domain (amino acids 452-759) was cloned into a pET-28b plasmid so as to fuse the LIG open reading frame to a leader sequence encoding an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The resulting plasmid (pAEB1120) was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) codon plus (RIL). A culture derived from a single transformant was grown to an A600 of 0.4-0.6 at 37 °C, at which point production of the LIG domain was induced by incubation for 3-5 h after addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl d-thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A), and stored at -80 °C. Production of selenomethioninyl LIG domain was performed according to Van Duyne et al. (39Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). For purification, thawed cells were sonicated and centrifuged, and soluble His-tagged LIG was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (His-Trap, Amersham Biosciences). LIG-containing fractions were pooled and subjected to cleavage of the His tag by hexahistidine-tagged tobacco etch virus protease, followed by a second nickel affinity step. The tag-free LIG domain recovered in the flow-through was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Centriprep-10; Amicon) and further purified using an S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The elution profile of the LIG protein was consistent with a monomeric quaternary structure (data not shown). Protein purity as assessed by SDS-PAGE indicated that the preparation was greater than 95% pure. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy indicated that the major purification product had a mass of 331 Da larger than expected from the polypeptide sequence. From this datum, we surmised that the major portion of the purified protein was in the adenylylated form. Crystallization of the LIG Domain—Purified LIG domain was dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, and 2 mm DTT for 3-5 h at room temperature. ATP and magnesium acetate were included in the dialysis conditions to further ensure that the protein was fully adenylylated. Protein concentration was then determined by A280 in a 6 m guanidine-HCl solution (40Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar), and crystallization trays were set at concentrations ranging from 10 to 15 mg/ml. Dialyzed LIG was mixed in a 2:1 (v/v) ratio with a precipitant solution containing 6% PEG 3000, 25 mm ZnCl2, and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6. After incubating on ice for 20 min, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was equilibrated at 18 °C by the hanging drop method against a well solution that contained 500 μl of precipitant solution and 200-500 μlof dialysis buffer. Crystals typically took 3-7 days to reach maximal size. Crystal-containing trays were slow-cooled to 4 °C for 24 h, after which crystals were transferred stepwise through precipitant solutions supplemented with 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% xylitol. Crystals were allowed to equilibrate in 25% xylitol cryoprotectant for at least 1 h before harvesting and flash-freezing.

Nandakumar J. Aniukwu J. Wang L.K. Glickman M.S. Lima C.D. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1711-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). pMSG346 contains 503 bp of genomic DNA 5′ of the ligD open reading frame and 490 bp of genomic DNA 3′ of the open reading frame, with an NdeI site introduced at the start codon and a BamHI site introduced 37 bp 3′ of the stop codon. The ligD-(K484A) gene encoding a LIG-defective, POL-active M. smegmatis LigD protein was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pMSG346. The resulting plasmid was transformed into the ΔligD strain. Allelic exchange was executed by the two-step selection/counterselection strategy (31Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A control allelic exchange was performed using pMSG346 containing a wild-type M. smegmatis ligD insert. Restoration of the ligD locus was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The K484A mutation was verified by PCR-amplifying and sequencing the LIG coding region from the LIG-defective ligD strain. Plasmid-based NHEJ—Assays were performed as described previously (31Gong C.

For calculation of fidelity values presented in Fig. 7B, the blue and white colony counts from three independent experiments (comprising nine independent transformations) were pooled. The total numbers (n) of colonies scored for the EcoRV-cut plasmid were as follows: wild-type ligD, n = 9194; ligD-K484A, n = 1850; ΔligD, n = 820. The numbers of colonies scored for the Asp 7181-cut plasmid were as follows: wild-type ligD, n = 7514; ligD-K484A, n = 2239; ΔligD, n = 1646. NHEJ efficiencies are normalized to that of the wild-type strain (defined as 100%); the data shown are the mean values of three independent transformations. Crystal Structure of the LIG Domain of MtuLigD—The C-terminal ligase domain of selenomethioninyl-substituted MtuLigD (residues 452-759) was crystallized by vapor diffusion using a precipitant solution containing PEG-3000 and ZnCl2. Crystals belonged to the space group P3221 (a = b = 57.1 Å, c = 369.0 Å) and contained two LIG protomers per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by MAD methods and refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å with an Rwork of 20.3% and an Rfree of 24.8%. The polypeptides displayed good geometry with no Ramachandran outliers (Table 1). Continuous electron density was apparent for all amino acids of both protomers, except for residues 652-659 in molecule A and 655-656 in molecule B. The structures of the two protomers were virtually identical (Cα r.m.s.d. = 0.31 Å). As expected, the MtuLIG protein consists of an NT domain (amino acids 452-639) and an OB domain (amino acids 640-759). The tertiary structure is depicted in Fig. 2A; the secondary structure elements are shown over the amino acid sequence in Fig. 1. Comparisons to the structural data base (via D"

In this study, we investigated the role of EFNB1 and the Ephs it interacts with (collectively called EFNB1 receptors) in mouse T-cell development. In the thymus, CD8 single positive (SP) and CD4CD8 double positive (DP) cells expressed high levels of EFNB1 and EFNB1 receptors, whereas CD4 SP cells had moderate expression of both. Soluble EFNB1-Fc in fetal thymus organ culture caused significant subpopulation ratio skew, with increased CD4 SP and CD8 SP and decreased DP percentage, while the cellularity of the thymus remained constant. Moreover, in EFNB1-treated fetal thymus organ culture, CD117+, CD25+, DP, CD4 SP, and CD8 SP cells all had significantly enhanced proliferation history, according to bromodeoxyuridine uptake. In vitro culture of isolated thymocytes revealed that EFNB1-Fc on solid-phase protected thymocytes from anti-CD3-induced apoptosis, with concomitant augmentation of several antiapoptotic factors, particularly in CD4 SP and CD8 SP cells; on the other hand, soluble EFNB1-Fc promoted anti-CD3-induced apoptosis, as was the case in vivo.

Protein-tyrosine kinases are essential components in lymphocyte signaling pathways. Thus, receptor tyrosine kinases have dual pivotal functions in lymphocytes. The Eph kinases are the largest receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family. According to sequence homology, Eph kinases are classified into EphAs (EphA1-EphA9) and EphBs (EphB1-EphB6) (1Committee Eph Nomenclature Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at cbweb.med.harvard.edu/eph-nomenclature/cell_letter.html).

EFNAs (EFNA1-EFNA6) are glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins and bind to EphA members with loose specificity; EFNBs (EFNB1-EFNB3) are transmembrane proteins and bind to EphBs, again with loose specificity (1Committee Eph Nomenclature Cell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).

Since Eph kinases and their ligands are all cell surface molecules, they can only interact with each other when expressed on adjacent cells.

We have reported previously that a kinase-defective Eph family member, EphB6, is capable of transducing signals into T cells, probably through adaptor molecules associated with its intracellular tail (14Luo H.

Patterns. 2002; 2: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and some EphAs and EFNAs interfere with T-cell development in thymic organ culture (21Munoz J.J. Alonso C. Sacedon R. Crompton T.

Roifman C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The thymus is the cradle of T cells. Early T-lineage cells in the thymus are usually described as triple negative (TN; CD3+CD8-CD4-) cells. Through the rearrangement of TCR, TN cells become immature double positive (DP, CD4-CD8+) and express a low level of CD3. After this DP transition, the thymocytes undergo extensive positive and negative selections to ensure that the mature T cells are functional and self-tolerant. Positive and negative selection of thymocytes has been reported to occur either in the cortex at the cortex-medullary junction or within the medulla (23Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After selection, the DP cells transiently express high levels of CD3-associated TCR to form mature DP cells and then rapidly differentiate into mature CD4 or CD8 single positive (SP) T cells that express high levels of TCR (25Middlebrook A.J.

Jenkinson E. Immunol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6602-6607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the late stage of positive selection and associated post-selection events seems independent of the peptide-major histocompatibility complex complexes, which are responsible for the initiation of positive selection (31Hare K.J. Jenkinson E.J. Anderson G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3978-3983PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hare K.J. Jenkinson E.J. Anderson G. Cell Mol. Biol. (Noisy-Le-Grand). 2001; 47: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar); it is possible that cells adjacent to the T cells under selection express certain cell surface-associated molecules that provide additional signals needed for this stage. In this study, we investigated the expression of EFNB1 and its receptors in thymocytes and its role in modulating T-cell development. In Situ Hybridization—A 534-bp cDNA fragment of mouse EFNB1 cDNA from position 336 to 890 (accession number U12983) was fetched with PCR from a mouse embryonic tissue cDNA library and cloned into pGEM-4Z (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, pGEM-4Z-mB1, served to transcribe antisense probes with SP6 RNA polymerase or to transcribe sense probes with T7 RNA polymerase, using digoxigenin RNA labeling kits (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization was carried out according to instructions from the kit manufacturer. Fetal Thymus Organ Culture (FTOC)—Thymuses were sterilely isolated from embryonic day 17 (e17) BALB/c fetuses and cultured in FTOC medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2, as described by DeLuca et al. (33DeLuca D. Bluestone J.A. Shultz L.D. Sharrow S.O. Tatsumi Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, the isolated thymic lobes were placed on the surface of a white plain Millipore (Bedford, MA) filter membrane (ISOPORE; 0.4-μm pore size), which was supported underneath by surgical gel foam (ETHICON, Somerville, NJ) in 24-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY). Each well contained 0.8 ml of culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (250 units/ml). Nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), 2-mercaptoethanol (20 nm), and 3.4 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate were added to the medium as supplements. EFNB1-Fc (19Yu G. Luo H. Wu Y. Wu J. J.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), EFNB3-Fc (18Yu G. Luo H. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47209-47216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), normal human IgG, and BrdUrd were also included in the medium as indicated in the different experiments. Half of the medium was replaced every 2-3 days until harvesting. Flow Cytometry—For the measurement of EFNB and EFNB receptor expression in different thymocyte subpopulations and of the percentage of different thymocyte subpopulations, thymocytes from fresh e17 thymuses or from FTOC were stained with EFNB-Fc/goat anti-human IgG-FITC or with goat anti-EFNB (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), followed by donkey anti-goat IgG-FITC (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada); anti-CD4-biotin/streptavidin-Quantum Red and anti-CD8-PE, anti-CD25-PE, or anti-CD117-PE (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) were employed to gate different thymic subpopulations. To assess cell proliferation, anti-BrdUrd-Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used for staining. Annexin V-FITC (PharMingen) was used to stain apoptotic cells. Reverse Transcription-Real Time PCR—Total RNA from cultured thymocytes was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with Omniscript reverse transcription kits from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Real time PCR was performed using Quanti Test SYBR Green PCR kits (Qiagen). The primers for Bcl-2 were 5′-ctcgtcgctaccgtcgtgacttcg and 5′-gtggcccaggtatgcacccag; primers for Bcl-XL were 5′-tggagtaaactggggcgcatc and 5′-agccacagtcatgcccgtcagg; primers for Flip were 5′-gtggaagagtgtcttgatgaag and 5′-gagcgaagcctggagagtatt; and primers for β-actin were 5′-tcgtaccacaggcattgtgatgga and 5′-tgatgtcacgcacgatttccctct. The PCR program started with 15 min of holding at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of amplification: denaturing, 15 s at 94 °C; annealing, 30 s at 55 °C; extension, 30 s at 72 °C. PCR was conducted in triplicate, and signal ratios (mean ± S.D.) of Bcl-2 versus actin, Bcl-XL versus actin, and Flip versus actin from their linear amplification stage were presented. EFNB1 and EFNB1R Expression in the Thymus—Expression of EFNB1 mRNA in the adult thymus was detected by in situ hybridization. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cortex was highly positive; sparse signals were present in the medulla; and the subcapsule region was negative. Expression of EFNB1 and its receptors on various thymocyte subpopulations at the protein level was then investigated by flow cytometry. The adult and e17 thymus had similar expression patterns, and representative histograms of e17 thymocytes are shown in Fig. 1B. CD8 SP and CD4CD8 DP cells had the highest percentage of EFNB1-positive cells at 29.9 and 29.4%, respectively (upper row of Fig. 1B); DN (double negative) cells had a lower percentage (13.5%); CD4 SP cells had the lowest (6.2%). In comparison, another EFNB family member, EFNB3 (upper row of Fig. 1B), had a low percentage of positive cells in all of these subpopulations (3.3% in DN, 1.2% in DP, 2.3% in CD4 SP, and 7.4% in CD8 SP). Such differential expression of EFNB1 versus EFNB3 suggests that the former plays a more important role in T-cell development in the thymus. EFNB1 promiscuously binds to multiple EphB family members (2Gale N.W. Holland S.J. Valenzuela D.M. Flenniken A. Pan L. Ryan T.E. Henkemeyer M. Strebhardt K. Hirai H. Wilkinson D.G. Pawson T. Davis S.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The receptor binding of EFNB1 to thymocytes was assessed by EFNB1-Fc staining, which was produced as a recombinant molecule between the EFNB1 extracelluar sequence and the human IgG Fc sequence with the Fc receptor binding site mutated, as described in our previous publication (19Yu G. Luo H. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55531-55539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); such binding revealed the interaction of EFNB1 with the ensemble of all of its receptors, which are collectively referred to as EFNB1R, on thymocytes. As shown in the lower row of Fig. 1B, the percentage of EFNB1R-positive cells was highest in CD8 SP (40.7%), followed by DP (31.5%) and CD4 SP (8.5%); DN contained no EFNB1R-positive cells (0%). In contrast, the percentage of EFNB3R-positive cells (lower row of Fig. 1B), as measured by EFNB3-Fc (18Yu G. Luo H. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47209-47216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) binding, was low in most subpopulations (0% in DN, 3.2% in DP, and 0.3% in CD4 SP), with the exception of CD8 SP (11.4%), suggesting a more prominent role of EFNB1R than that of EFNB3 receptors in thymic T-cell development. We next asked whether EFNB1 and EFNB1R were expressed in the same or different cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, in CD4 SP, CD8 SP, or total thymocytes, among which 80% were DP cells, EFNB1 and EFNB1R expression was a continuum, with some cells expressing EFNB1 alone, some cells expressing EFNB1R alone, and some cells expressing both. It is worth mentioning that we have previously reported that about 30% of CD4 and CD8 cells in the periphery express EFNB1 and EFNB1R (19Yu G. Luo H. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55531-55539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Soluble EFNB1 Disturbs Subpopulation Ratios in FTOC—FTOC was employed to investigate the role of EFNB1 and EFNBR interaction in thymocyte development in a setting relatively close to a physiological condition; various recombinant proteins were added to the culture. We first verified whether EFNB1-Fc could enter the thymus easily. FTOC was conducted in the presence of EFNB1-Fc (10 μg/ml) for 24 h; thymocytes were flushed out, extensively washed, and then reacted with PE-conjugated anti-human IgG; 31.3% of the thymocytes were positive for EFNB1R (Fig. 2A, right), and this percentage was comparable with that of fresh thymocytes stained with EFNB1-Fc followed by PE-conjugated anti-human IgG (Fig. 2A, left). This indicates that EFNB1-Fc can effectively enter the FTOC within 24 h. Next, the effect of EFNBs on FTOC was investigated. We examined FTOC on different time points, such as days 5, 7, and 10, and changes in thymocyte subpopulations in EFNB1-Fc-treated FTOC were not apparent before day 10 (data not shown). Thus, all of the rest of the experiments were conducted with 10-day FTOC. EFNB1-Fc, EFNB2-Fc, EFNB3-Fc, or NHIgG (all at 10 μg/ml) was present in culture, and the CD4 and CD8 expression of cells from FTOC was assessed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2B, in comparison with thymocytes from NHIgG-treated FTOC, there was a consistent and obvious decrease of DP (from 69.9 to 37.2%) but an increase of CD4 SP (from 16.0 to 30.1%) and CD8 SP (from 5.4 to 10.9%) percentage. On the other hand, EFNB2-Fc and EFNB3-Fc did not drastically alter the ratios of these subpopulations. Therefore, for the rest of this study, our attention was focused on EFNB1 and EFNB1R; EFNB3-Fc was used for comparison only. The ratios of thymocyte subpopulations were determined by a combination of factors, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and extinguishing of CD4 or CD8 expression on DP cells. To gain insight into the reasons for the observed ratio disturbance in EFNB1-Fc-treated FTOC, we measured the proliferation history of each subpopulation by BrdUrd uptake during the 10-day culture period (Fig. 3A). There was a significant increase of BrdUrd-positive cell percentage in DN (from 31.7 to 61.3%), DP (from 11.3 to 54.5%), CD4 SP (from 10.2 to 48.0%), and CD8 SP (from 4.4 to 89.7%) subpopulations in EFNB1-Fc-treated FTOC compared with that of NHIgG-treated FTOC. In DN cells, CD117+ cells represent the earliest subpopulation, followed by CD25+ cells (35Varas A. Hager-Theodorides A.L. Sacedon R. Vicente A. Zapata A.G. Crompton T. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); both of these subpopulations had significantly increased proliferation history in the presence of EFNB1-Fc, in comparison with NHIgG (from 17.4 to 53.6% for CD117+ and from 31.7 to 63.2% for CD25+). EFNB3-Fc treatment increased the BrdUrd-positive percentage in these subpopulations to a much lesser extent, consistent with the lower degree of EFNB3 and EFNB3R expression in thymocytes. It is to be noted that the thymocytes continuously differentiate from CD117+CD25- DN to CD117-CD25+ DN to CD117-CD25- DN to DP to CD4+ SP or CD8+ SP cells; therefore, BrdUrd in cells of a later stage could be inherited from their predecessors or incorporated from proliferation during the said stage or both. Regardless, this experiment clearly demonstrated that soluble EFNB1-Fc enhanced thymocyte proliferation. What is the effect of the increased proliferation on thymocyte cellularity? The results (Fig. 3B) revealed that the numbers were similar in EFNB1-Fc-, EFNB3-Fc-, or NHIgG-treated FTOC after 5, 10, or 12 days. This suggests that there must be increased apoptosis in situ in FTOC to keep the constant cellularity in the presence of enhanced thymocyte proliferation after soluble EFNB1-Fc treatment. EFNB1 and EFNB1R Interaction Regulates Thymocyte Survival—It is difficult to assess the actual rates of apoptosis of thymocyte subpopulations in FTOC, because apoptotic cells are constantly and rapidly removed, and the efficiency of this process cannot be accurately determined. We therefore employed an in vitro system, in which the apoptotic cell removal was no longer effective, to assess the effect of EFNB1 on thymocyte apoptosis. In FTOC, soluble EFNB1 probably blocked the natural interaction between EFNB1 and its receptors, both of which were present on thymocyte subpopulations examined. This implied that thymocytes would normally receive survival signals through their EFNB1 receptors by interacting with solid-phase EFNB1 expressed on neighboring thymocytes or stroma cells. To prove this point, we cultured e20 thymocytes in wells coated with EFNB1 or control NHIgG (10 μg/ml for coating in both cases), and thymocyte apoptosis was induced by solid-phase anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml for coating). As shown in Fig. 4A, DP, CD4 SP, and CD8 SP cells in control samples suffered apoptosis at 45.0, 30.4, and 28.8%, respectively, after overnight culture; in contrast, the apoptosis of these cells decreased to 33.7, 15.2, and 21.4%, respectively, in the presence of solid-phase EFNB1-Fc. This result was very reproducible in more than eight experiments and clearly demonstrated that when EFNB1R on thymocytes were cross-linked, the cells received survival signals. Since cross-linking EFNB1R could promote thymocyte survival, it followed that soluble EFNB1-Fc should interfere with the endogenous interaction between EFNB1 and EFNB1R on fraternal thymocytes, disrupt the survival signals delivered to EFNB1R, and increase apoptosis. This possibility was tested in vitro using thymocytes from 1-day-old mice (Fig. 3B). The cells were cultured in the presence of suboptimal soluble anti-CD3 to trigger minimal apoptosis (30.2% in DP cells, 6.9% in CD4 SP cells, and 10.9% in CD8 SP cells). In the presence of soluble EFNB1-Fc, the percentage of apoptotic cells was consistently increased in all of the three subpopulations (40.5% in DP cells, 16.1% in CD4 SP cells, and 14.5% in CD8 SP cells). Again, such an effect was very reproducible and conversely corroborated the findings above based on solid-phase EFNB1-Fc. To elucidate the survival mechanism, we tested the expression of several antiapoptotic factors, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Flip (36Kim R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37Kataoka T. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 25: 31-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), in these cells. DP, CD4 SP, and CD8 SP cells from e20 thymuses were sorted by flow cytomery and then cultured in the presence of solid-phase anti-CD3 and EFNB1-Fc, as described above. After overnight culture, the cells were harvested, and their Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Flip mRNA levels were assayed with reverse transcription-real time PCR (Fig. 4C). Cells treated with solid-phase anti-CD3 and NHIgG were used as controls. In the EFNB1-treated CD4 SP cells, mRNA of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Flip was augmented; in CD8 SP cells, mRNA of the former two molecules was increased, whereas Flip mRNA remained unchanged. This result is, in general, consistent with the antiapoptotic effects of these molecules and the"

In this study, we demonstrate that the Polo box domain of Plk3 is sufficient for subcellular localization of this kinase to the centrosomes, the spindle poles, and the midbody when ectopically expressed in HeLa and U2OS cells. Both Polo boxes are required for the subcellular localization. Overexpression of the Polo box domain, not the kinase domain, of Plk3 causes significant cell cycle arrest and cytokinesis defects, eventually leading to mitotic catastrophe/apoptosis. Interestingly, the Polo box domain of Plk3 is more potent in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis than that of Plk1, suggesting that this domain can provide an additional structural basis for discovery of new anticancer drugs given the current emphasis on Plk1 as a therapeutic target.

Reversible phosphorylation and protein degradation are two major molecular mechanisms that control progression of the cell cycle. Among known gene products that regulate the cell cycle, Plks are a group of protein serine/threonine kinases important for monitoring various transitions during the cell cycle (1Barr F.A. Sillje H.H.

Extensive research in the past demonstrates that Plks have multiple functions in mitosis including modulating the activity of Cdk1/cyclinB (3Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase domain at the N terminus, Plks share one or two stretches of conserved amino acid sequences termed Polo box (9Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Without affecting the kinase activity, mutations in the Polo boxes of Cdc5, a Plk ortholog in the budding yeast, result in its inability to complement temperature-sensitive phenotypes (10Song S.

Specific phosphopeptides fit into a conserved and positively charged pocket formed at the edge of the Polo box interface; mutations that interfere or disrupt the phosphodependent interaction impair cell cycle-dependent localization, thus strongly suggesting that the binding of phospholigands to the PBD is essential for mitotic progression (13Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Given that overexpression of mammalian Plks is closely associated with cell proliferation and oncogenesis (15Takai N. Hamanaka R. Yoshimatsu J. Miyakawa I.

Mammalian Plk3 was originally identified as an immediate early response gene product (17Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Lu L. Dai W. J. Biol.

Subsequent studies show that this protein is functionally conserved and involved in the regulation of mitosis (19Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol.

On the other hand, Plk3 behaves differently from that of Plk1 in human cells in terms of its regulation during the cell cycle and response to stimulation by growth factors and stresses (17Li B.

More prominently, ectopic expression of Plk3 or its mutants perturbs microtubule integrity, resulting dramatic morphological changes, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K.

Stambrook P.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6826-6831PubMed Google Scholar). Plk3 appears to be also involved in the regulation of Golgi dynamics during the cell cycle perhaps through interaction with MEK1, functioning as a downstream mediator of the kinase in the Golgi fragmentation signaling pathway (6Xie S. Wang Q. Ruan Q. Liu T. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Guan K. Dai W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3822-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the biological function of Plk3 PBD by making a series of Plk3 mutants. We find that the C terminus of Plk3, which contains two Polo boxes, is sufficient for subcellular localization to the centrosomes, the spindle poles, and the midbody. Mutations in the PBD cause abnormal subcellular localization, which affects cell division and viability. Moreover, the Plk3 PBD is more potent in the induction of apoptosis than that of Plk1. Given that many new anticancer compounds that target Plk1 are being developed in pharmaceutical companies, our studies suggest that Plk3 PBD would provide additional structural basis for discovery of more effective compounds targeting cell cycle kinases for cancer intervention. Cell Culture—HeLa and U2OS cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in dishes or on Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Fisher Scientific) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 μg of penicillin and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml) with 5% CO2. Plasmid Construction—Plk3 and its mutants were expressed as enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion products (all fused at the C terminus). Constructs of pEGFP-Plk3-full-length (pEGFP-Plk3-FL, amino acids 1-652), pEGFP-Plk3-Polo box domain (pEGFP-Plk3-PBD, amino acids 312-652), pEGFP-Plk3-kinase domain (pEGFP-Plk3-KD, amino acids 1-334), pEGFP-Plk3-Polo box 1 (pEGFP-Plk3-PB1, amino acids 471-491), pEGFP-Plk1-full-length (pEGFP-Plk1-FL, amino acids 1-603), pEGFP-Plk1-Polo box domain (pEGFP-Plk1-PB-D, amino acids 294-603), pEGFP-Plk1-kinase domain (pEGFP-Plk1-KD, amino acids 1-307), were generated by inserting respective PCR fragments into multiple cloning sites of pEGFP-N3 (BD Biosciences Clontech). The full-length of Plk3 cDNA construct was obtained by ligating the synthetic fragment coding for Plk3 N-terminal 1-39 amino acids to the corresponding cutting site of Plk3-A cDNA (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Various kinase or PBD mutant constructs (e.g. pEGFP-Plk3-WV467FA, pEGFP-Plk3-DHF589AAA, pEGFP-Plk3-T219D, and pEGFP-Plk3-T219E) were made through site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kits from Stratagene. Plk3-Polo box domain and its corresponding mutant were also fused at the C terminus with a FLAG tag (Flag-Plk3-PBD and Flag-Plk3-WV467FA). Plk3 cDNAs of deletion or mutation constructs were thoroughly sequenced to confirm the mutation status as well as the insertion site. Transfection—HeLa and U2OS cells cultured in dishes or on chamber slides were transfected with plasmid constructs for either 16 or 36 h using the Lipofectamine method. Untransfected control cells or cells transfected with vector alone or with various constructs were processed for analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy. In some experiments, transfected cells were lysed, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Each transfection experiment was repeated at least three times. Immunoblotting—Cultured cells were lysed as described earlier (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to GFP (Invitrogen, 1:1000), procaspase 3 (Cell Signal, 1:100), or cyclin B (DAKO, 1:10,000). Specific signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—Subcellular localization of Plk3 was determined by double immunofluorescence analysis. Cells were quickly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with methanol for 7 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 15 min on ice, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the rabbit monoclonal GFP antibody (Invitrogen, 1:5000) and/or mouse anti-γ-tubulin IgG (Sigma, 1:250) in a 2% bovine serum albumin solution, washed with PBS, and then incubated with rhodamine red X-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs and/or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Cells were finally stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Fluka, 1 μg/ml) for 2 min. Fluorescence microscopy was performed, and images were captured using a digital camera (Optronics) using Optronics MagFire and Image-Pro Plus softwares. The living cells ectopically expressing EGFP fusion proteins or GFP alone were visualized under a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Flow Cytometry—HeLa cells transfected with or without Plk3 or its mutants for 36 h were analyzed for the cell cycle and apoptotic statuses. Briefly, cells were fixed with methanol, treated with Triton X-100 (0.25% in PBS) for 5 min, washed with PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 1 h with a rabbit monoclonal GFP antibody (Invitrogen, 1:5000). Cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated with a second antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate for 1 h, rinsed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). Fluorescence of cells processed for flow cytometry was measured by the ELITE.ESP cytometer/cell sorter (Coulter) as described previously (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Although the PBD of human Plk1 is known to guide its subcellular localization to the centrosomes, the spindle poles, and the midbody (8Arnaud L. Pines J. Nigg E.A. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Lee K.S. Grenfell T.Z. Yarm F.R. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32282-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), no studies have been performed to determine whether PBDs of other mammalian Plk homologs would function in the same manner as that of Plk1. Both Plk1 and Plk3 share a similar structural organization in which the KD is at the N-terminal region and the PBD is located at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). However, they do exhibit some functional differences, especially in DNA damage responses and induction of apoptosis (2Xie S. Xie B. Lee M.Y. Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we asked whether Plk3 PBD would behave differently from that of Plk1. We first made a serial of plasmid constructs that code for various mutant forms of Plk3 as EGFP fusion proteins (Fig. 1B). To determine whether these constructs could be efficiently expressed, HeLa cells transfected with various Plk3 plasmid constructs for 16 h were blotted with an anti-GFP antibody. We observed that Plk3 mutant proteins, as well as the wild-type Plk3, were highly expressed with expected sizes and that the levels of expression among various constructs were comparable except for pEGFP-Plk1-KD (Fig. 1C). The low yield of pEGFP-Plk1-KD on the immunoblot was partly because of its nuclear localization, which somehow made it insoluble during lysis; on the other hand, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that it was expressed at a level comparable to other Plk plasmid constructs (data not shown). As our early studies show that endogenous Plk3 is localized at the centrosome/spindle pole regions (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we attempted to map the region that was responsible for the subcellular localization of Plk3 by expressing various EGFP-Plk3 mutant constructs. The examination of live cells under a fluorescence microscope revealed that whereas EGFP showed no specific subcellular localization when ectopically expressed, a significant amount of EGFP-Plk3-FL formed distinct foci (Fig. 2A), reminiscent of centrosomal localization. Supporting this, ectopically expressed EGFP-Plk1 and EGFP-Plk1-PBD also exhibited a focal pattern similar to that of EGFP-Plk3 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, expression of EGFP-Plk3-PBD and kinase-defective Plk3 (EGFP-Plk3-T219E) also resulted in the formation of foci similar to that of full-length Plk3, suggesting that the PBD but not the kinase domain was sufficient for the subcellular localization. Consistently, the kinase domain (EGFP-Plk3-KD) alone or a PBD mutant (EGFP-Plk3-WV467FA) failed to form the foci in living HeLa cells (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Centrosomal localization of Plk3. A, living HeLa cells transfected various constructs as indicated were directly observed under a fluorescence microscope 16 h post-transfection. B, HeLa cells transfected with EGFP-Plk1-PBD plasmid construct for 16 h were fixed and stained with antibodies to GFP (green) and γ-tubulin (red).

Pines J. Nigg E.A. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Double immunofluorescence microscopy showed that ectopically expressed EGFP-Plk1-PBD formed distinct foci co-localizing with γ-tubulin, confirming its role in centrosomal localization (Fig. 2B). Co-staining with γ-tubulin also confirmed that Plk3-PBD (Fig. 2C) and several other Plk3 mutant proteins, such as Plk3-T219D (data not shown), localized to the centrosomes and the spindle poles. Furthermore, similar to EGFP-Plk1-PBD, EGFP-Plk3-PBD also localized at the midbody during cytokinesis (Fig. 3A, arrows). It was interesting to note that γ-tubulin was also detected at the midbody (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with an early report that γ-tubulin takes part in the formation of the midbody in mammalian cells (24Julian M. Tollon Y. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Moisand A. Mazarguil H. Puget A. Wright M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 145-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of cells with centrosome, spindle pole, or the midbody localization when they were transfected with Plk3 and its mutant constructs was summarized in Fig. 3B. Without PBD, the kinase domain alone (EGFP-Plk3-KD) was insufficient for centrosome, spindle pole, and midbody localization; consistently, mutations at either PBs (EGFP-Plk3-WV467FA and EGFP-Plk3-DHF589AAA that disrupt PB1 and PB2, respectively) significantly impaired or abolished its subcellular localization (Fig. 3B). Again, additional mutations in the kinase domain (e.g. pEGFP-Plk3-T219E) failed to disrupt its proper subcellular localization, indicating that the kinase domain is not essential for guiding its subcellular localization (Fig. 3B). We then examined the consequence of expressing Plk3 and its mutants on the cell cycle status, because it is involved in mitotic functions (19Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As expected, ectopic expression of Plk3-FL enriched G2/M cell population (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the expression of Plk3 PBD (Plk3-PBD) alone further enriched G2/M cells, whereas the kinase domain (Plk3-KD) significantly reduced the ability of Plk3 to induce cell cycle arrest, suggesting that it is the C-terminal domain containing Polo boxes but not the kinase domain that positively regulates G2/M arrest. Supporting this, expressing Plk3-T219D with a defective kinase activity did not reduce its ability to induce G2/M arrest, whereas knocking out the function of the PBD through expressing Plk3-WV467FA almost completely abolished the ability (Fig. 4, A and B). To determine whether Plk3 PBD was capable of inducing mitotic arrest, we measured cyclin B levels in HeLa cells transfected with various expression constructs (Fig. 4C). Immunoblotting revealed that compared with control cells cyclin B was significantly accumulated in the cells ectopically expressing Plk3-PBD and Plk3-FL (Fig. 4C). Disruption of the PBD (Plk3-WV467FA) failed to enrich cyclin B compared with that of control cells expressing EGFP (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the elevated cyclin B, we observed that cells expressing Plk3-PBD exhibited defects in cytokinesis including chromosome mis-segregation, cytokinesis defects, and formation of binucleated and polyploid cells (Fig. 5, A and B). A quantitative analysis revealed that cells expressing Plk3-PBD caused significant failures (up to 24% of cells) in mitosis (Fig. 5, A and B). The mitotic defects were closely associated with the presence of a functional PBD because disruption of the domain or expressing the kinase domain alone failed to cause significant mitotic defects (Fig. 5B). Deregulated mitotic processes often results in mitotic catastrophe, a special form of apoptosis occurring during mitosis. To examine the consequence of cell cycle arrest and mitotic defects induced by the Plk3 PBD, we first examined cellular and nuclear morphologies of HeLa cells extopically expressing transfected Plk3 and its mutants after a 36-h transfection. We observed that although few morphological alterations in cells expressing EGFP alone or EGFP-Plk1-PBD were noticed, dramatic cellular changes (e.g. cell condensation and fragmentation, or shrunken morphology) occurred in those expressing Plk3-FL and Plk3-PBD (Fig. 6A). The nuclei of these cells as revealed by DAPI staining also became condensed (Fig. 6B), which is suggestive of apoptosis. To further confirm the cell death induced by Plk3 PBD, we analyzed the cleavage of procaspase-3, an event occurring during apoptosis, in cells transfected with Plk3-PBD. Immunoblotting revealed that procaspase-3 levels were significantly decreased in cells transfected with Plk3-PBD compared with that of control cells transfected with EGFP alone or with Plk1-PBD (Fig. 6C), thus confirming that the cell cycle arrest and mitotic defects induced by Plk3 PBD lead to apoptosis. Consistently, a significant fraction of sub-G1 (apoptotic) cells, as revealed by flow cytometry, was present when they expressed Plk3-FL (18%) and Plk3-PBD (24%); in contrast, a much smaller amount sub-G1 cells, if any, was present when the cells were transfected with constructs expressing Plk3-KD, Plk3-WV467FA, Plk1-PBD, or EGFP (Fig. 6D). To determine whether the Polo box domain of Plk3 also dictates centrosome localization in other human cell types, we examined subcellular localization patterns of ectopically expressed Plk3-PBD and Plk3-WV467FA in osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Consistent with those observed in HeLa cells, concentrated signals of Plk3-PBD, but not the PBD mutant (Plk3-WV467FA) superimposed with γ-tubulin (Fig. 7A), indicating centrosome localization. We also observed that Plk3-PBD but not its mutant localized to the midbody in U2OS cells (data not shown). Sustained expression of Plk3-PBD but not of Plk3-WV467FA also caused dramatic shrinkage of the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus of U2OS cells (Fig. 7B), indicative of apoptosis. To exclude the remote possibility that the GFP moiety may modify the function of Plk3-PBD, we made both FLAG-tagged Plk3-PBD and FLAG-tagged Plk3-WV467FA. We observed that ectopically expressed Flag-Plk3-PBD, but not Flag-Plk3-WV467FA, localized to centrosomes (Fig. 7C), indicating that it is the Polo box domain but not a specific tag that functions as a centrosomal localization signal. Consistently, ectopic expression of the functional PBD of Plk3 caused cells to condense and fragment, which are morphological signs of programmed cell death (Fig. 7D). Together, these lines of experimental evidence indicate that the Polo box domain of Plk3 truly functions as a centrosome localization signal and deregulated expression of this domain induces apoptosis. The PBD is very much conserved throughout the evolution, suggestive of critical cellular functions mediated by this unique structure. Extensive studies of mammalian Plk1 and budding yeast homology Cdc5 suggest that the PBD consisting of two identifiable Polo boxes functions as an intact unit (12Seong Y.S. Kamijo K. Lee J.S.

Interestingly, Plk4 contains only one Polo box that is also functional and capable of targeting the kinase to proper subcellular localizations during the cell cycle (25Leung G.C. Hudson J.W. Kozarova A. Davidson A. Dennis J.W. Sicheri F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined the structural basis of Plk3 that guides its subcellular distributions during the cell cycle and biological consequences of expressing Plk3 and various Plk3 mutants. We have shown that Plk3 localizes to the centrosomes during interphase and to the spindle poles during mitosis and that a significant amount of Plk3 is also present at the midbody during cytokinesis. The subcellular distributions of Plk3 are dependent on a functional PBD but not the catalytic domain; both polo boxes are required for the subcellular localizations because disruption of either PB1 (Plk3-WV467FA) or PB2 (Plk3-DHF589AAA) causes mislocalization of Plk3 (Fig. 3B). These observations thus support the notion that the PBD from various Plks may share similar functions in regulating cell division. Structural analyses reveal that two polo boxes of Plk1, exhibiting similar tertiary structures, fold together and form the interface that may provide a site for ligand binding (13Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Given the conserved primary amino acid sequences and its distinct function in DNA damage response (2Xie S. Xie B. Lee M.Y. Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Lu L. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it is predicted that the Plk3 PBD may have a tertiary structure similar to but not identical to that of Plk1. It is an important task to identify phosphoprotein ligands that specifically bind to Plk3 if the cellular function of this kinase can be fully appreciated. Overwhelming evidence indicates that the PBD dictates the subcellular localization of Plks to the centrosomes and the spindle poles. It is tempting to speculate that this domain may function as a centrosome-targeting signal because the structural bases that determine centrosomal localization remain unclear. However, our preliminary studies show that core sequences of Polo box one (Plk3-PB1 in Fig. 1A) failed to target EGFP to the centrosomes, suggesting that the minimal sequence required for centrosomal localization requires Polo box two as well. Supporting this, Plk3-DHF589AAA, a PB2 mutant, does not localize to the centrosomes and the midbody (Fig. 3B). Recently, Matsumoto et al. (26Matsumoto Y. Maller J.L. Science. 2004; 306: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have reported that a stretch of 20 amino acids in cyclin E may serve as a centrosomal localization signal. However, the significance of this centrosomal localization signal remains to be determined because this sequence appears to be present in few molecules other than cyclin E, and no known centrosome-specific proteins contain the centrosomal localization signal. Plks are involved in the regulation of a variety of events during the cell cycle (9Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Extensive studies suggest that Plk1 and Plk3 are essential for mitotic progression and cytokinesis. In mammalian cells, depletion of Plk1 by RNA interference largely impairs cytokinesis, resulting in mitotic arrest and formation of dumbbell-like DNA structures (2Xie S. Xie B. Lee M.Y. Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the PBD of Plk1 leads to spindle checkpoint failure and defective cytokinesis (12Seong Y.S. Kamijo K. Lee J.S. Fernandez E. Kuriyama R. Miki T. Lee K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32282-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our early studies show that overexpression of Plk3 interferes with cell division and cytokinesis (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our current study strongly suggests that the Plk3 PBD is important for not only subcellular localization but also mitotic events such as cytokinesis. To date, several proteins have been identified that may mediate the function of Plk1 in cytokinesis (28Neef R. Preisinger C. Sutcliffe J. Kopajtich R. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29Liu X. Zhou T. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3233-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MKLP1/CHO1, a kinesin-like protein, co-localizes with Plk1 at the midbody, and it can be phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro (29Liu X. Zhou T. Kuriyama R. Erikson R.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3233-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, MKLP2, a mitotic kinesin, co-localizes with Plk1 to the spindle poles during late mitosis; the physical interaction between these two proteins and phosphorylation of MKlp2 by Plk1 are necessary for cytokinesis (28Neef R. Preisinger C. Sutcliffe J. Kopajtich R. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Moreover, NudC, a dynein-associated nuclear protein, interacts with and is phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro (30Zhou T. Aumais J.P. Liu X. Yu-Lee L.Y. Erikson R.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is thus interesting to see whether Plk3 also regulates these proteins during late mitosis. The PBD, but not the kinase domain, of Plk3 appears to function as a dominant negative mutant interfering with mitotic progression, resulting in cytokinesis failure and apoptosis. At this moment, we cannot exclude the possibility that Plk3 PBD when overexpressed may also compete with Plk1 for phospholigands, thus leading to the phenotypes similar to those induced as a result of loss of Plk1 functions. However, our observation that Plk3 PBD is much more effective than that of Plk1 in induction of cytokinesis failure and apoptosis (Figs. 5B and 6C) may argue against the notion. Plk1 is known to be a proliferation marker (31Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Plk1 is detected in a majority of human tumor cells and tumor cell lines (15Takai N. Hamanaka R. Yoshimatsu J. Miyakawa I. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 31Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In fact, enhanced Plk1 expression is closely associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients and metastatic potential of certain tumors (31Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It is believed that Plk1 may play a causative role in malignant transformation (15Takai N. Hamanaka R. Yoshimatsu J. Miyakawa I. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 31Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Plk3 shares certain functions with Plk1 (19Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) although it also plays distinct roles during DNA damage responses (2Xie S. Xie B. Lee M.Y. Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The fact that ectopic expression of kinase-active or kinase-defective Plk3 results in mitotic arrest and apoptosis (22Wang Q. Xie S. Chen J. Fukasawa K. Naik U. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Dai W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3450-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) suggests that the PBD may be a critical component that triggers mitotic catastrophe. Consistently, Plk3 PBD induces apoptosis with potency stronger than that of Plk1 PBD (Fig. 6, C and D). This suggests that Plk3 PBD can serve as a better prototype from which effective chemical mimetics of the PBD can be developed for cancer treatment. At present, major effects in developing inhibitors for various kinases are directed to the ATP-binding pocket. It is known that the ATP-binding pockets of kinases are unstable and susceptible to mutations leading to drug resistance during cancer treatment. In addition, compounds targeting the ATP-binding pocket have to compete with high concentrations of endogenous ATP in cells. Thus, it is expected that drugs aimed at the non-ATP-binding regions (such as the PBD) of Plks would be more efficacious than those ATP competitors (34Levitzki A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38 (Suppl. 5): S11-S18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, a short peptide derived from wild-type Plk1 PBD, but not its mutant form, significantly inhibits cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis when it is introduced into tumor cells (32Yuan J. Kramer A. Eckerdt F. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4186-4190PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our further understanding of structural and functional relationship of Polo-like domains of various Plks will facilitate the development of highly selective yet potent inhibitors of Plk1 for clinical uses.

https://openalex.org/W2164900051,"Myogenic vasoconstriction, an intrinsic response to elevated transmural pressure (TMP), requires the activation of sphingosine kinase (Sk1) and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesized that pressure-induced Sk1 signaling and ROS generation are functionally linked. Using a model of cannulated resistance arteries isolated from the hamster gracilis muscle, we monitored vessel diameter and smooth muscle cell (SMC) Ca2+i (Fura-2) or ROS production (dichlorodihydrofluorescein). Elevation of TMP stimulated the translocation of a GFP-tagged Sk1 fusion protein from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, indicative of enzymatic activation. Concurrently, elevation of TMP initiated a rapid and transient production of ROS, which was enhanced by expression of wild-type Sk1 (hSk(wt)) and inhibited by its dominant-negative mutant (hSk(G82D)). Exogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) also stimulated ROS generation is isolated vessels. Chemical (1 micromol/L DPI), peptide (gp91ds-tat/gp91ds), and genetic (N17Rac) inhibition strategies indicated that NADPH oxidase was the source of the pressure-induced ROS. NADPH oxidase inhibition attenuated myogenic vasoconstriction and reduced the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the SMC contractile apparatus, without affecting Ca2+-independent, RhoA-mediated vasoconstriction in response to exogenous S1P. Our results indicate a mandatory role for Sk1/S1P in mediating pressure-induced, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS formation. In turn, ROS generation appears to increase Ca2+ sensitivity, necessary for full myogenic vasoconstriction."

When HEK293 cells stably expressing each of these PLA2s were mixed with non-transfected HEK293 cells, group V and X PLA2s showed strong transcellular lipolytic activity, whereas group IIA PLA2 exhibited much lower transcellular activity. The transcellular activity of group V PLA2 was highly dependent on the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans of acceptor cells. Activation of RBL-2H3 and DLD-1 cells that express endogenous group V PLA2 led to the secretion of group V PLA2 and its transcellular action on neighboring human neutrophils and eosinophils, respectively. Similarly, activation of human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, caused large increases in arachidonic acid and leukotriene C4 release from neighboring human eosinophils.

The involvement of gVPLA2 in inflammation was further supported by a recent gene knock-out study (16Satake Y. Diaz B.L. Balestrieri B. Lam B.K. Kanaoka Y. Grusby M.J. Arm J.P. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a recent study suggested that the agonist-induced AA release from gIIAPLA2- and group X PLA2 (gXPLA2)-transfected CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells occurs predominantly during the secretory process (i.e. before secretion) and with the involvement of cPLA2α (25Mounier C.M.

These findings raised a fundamental question as to whether sPLA2s function transcellularly by a paracrine mechanism or act on their originating cells by an autocrine mechanism or simply function intracellularly before secretion under physiological conditions. Previous studies have indicated that sPLA2s can work transcellularly to induce AA production in distal cells (11Murakami M. Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol.

However, no direct experimental evidence has been reported for the transcellular action of sPLA2s under physiological conditions. In this study we systematically measured the intracellular, autocrine, and paracrine actions of various sPLA2s under different conditions by means of a new real-time cellular PLA2 activity assay using two orthogonal fluorogenic phospholipid substrates. Our results provide direct evidence for the transcellular activity of sPLA2s both in model cell systems and under physiologically relevant conditions. The results also indicate that the relative importance of paracrine, autocrine, and intracellular pathways significantly varies depending on the nature of donor and acceptor cells as well as the biochemical properties of sPLA2.

Apreparativethinlayer chromatography was performed to purify 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine N-[6-[(2,4-dinitrophenyl)amino]hexanoyl] using CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (65:25:4; v/v/v) as eluent (Rf = 0.7). 8 mg of this compound was dissolved in 8 ml of dry CH2Cl2 and 5.5 mg of succinimidyl 4,4-difluoro-5-(2-pyrrolyl)-4-bora-3a,4a,diaza-s-indacene-3-propionate (Invitrogen), and 1.39 μl of triethylamine (molar ratio 1:1.2:1) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 48 h, and solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in a minimal volume of CH2Cl2, and the product was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography using CHCl3: CH3OH:H2O (65:25:4; v/v/v) as eluent (Rf = 0.85). The product is referred to as Red-PED6 hereafter. The concentrations of PED6 and Red-PED6 were determined spectrophotometrically using the known extinction coefficients of 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoic acid (BODIPY®; ϵ = 96,000 m-1 cm-1) and 4,4-difluoro-5-(2-pyrrolyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionic acid (BODIPY 576/589®; ϵ = 83,000 m-1 cm-1), respectively (Invitrogen). Preparation of HEK293 Cell Lines Stably Expressing sPLA2s—The cDNAs for human gIIAPLA2, gVPLA2, and gXPLA2 were cloned from the human brain cDNA library (Clontech) and ligated into the pFLAG vector (Sigma) to yield sPLA2s with C-terminal FLAG tags. Two μg of each plasmid was mixed with 4 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 in 250 μlof Opti-MEM medium for 30 min and then added to cells that had attained 40-60% confluence in 6-well plates (Nunc) containing 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM medium. After incubation for 16 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh culture medium. After overnight culture, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in an incubator flushed with 5% CO2 in humidified air. The cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates in the culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). After culture for 3-4 weeks, wells containing a single colony were chosen, and the expression of each sPLA2 was assessed by Western blotting using the FLAG antibody. The established clones were expanded and used for further experiments. Western Blotting Analysis—HEK293 (or BEAS-2B) cells were collected from a 100-mm culture dish (Nunc). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the pellet was collected by centrifugation, then lysed in 70 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid. After 10 min on ice, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 3 min to remove the cell debris. The supernatants were then mixed with 14 μl of gel loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.005% bromphenol blue), and the mixtures were boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions using 16% acrylamide gels. The electrotransfer of proteins from the gels to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was achieved using a semidry system (400 mA, 120 min). The membrane was blocked with 2% BSA for 60 min, then incubated with 1 μg/ml amounts of either the anti-human gVPLA2 monoclonal antibody (30Munoz N.M. Kim K. Han S.-K. Boetticher E. Sperling A.I. Sano H. Zhu X. Cho W. Leff A.R. Hybridoma. 2000; 19: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or FLAG antibody diluted in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) overnight. The membranes were washed 3 times for 20 min with TBS-T. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was diluted 3000-fold in TBS-T and incubated with polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 60 min. The membrane was washed 3 times with TBS-T and assayed with a Super-Signal West Femto enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). AA Release from HEK293 Cells—Radiolabeling of non-transfected HEK293 cells was achieved by incubating the cells (106) with 0.05 μCi/ml [3H]AA (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 h at 37 °C. Unincorporated [3H]AA was removed by washing the cells 3 times with Dulbecco's modified eagles medium (DMEM) containing 0.2% BSA. These radiolabeled HEK293 cells were detached from the culture dishes by gentle agitation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm EDTA and added to HEK293 cells stably expressing gIIAPLA2, gVPLA2, and gXPLA2, respectively. Mixed cells were stimulated by 10 μm ionomycin for 20 min, and the stimulation was quenched by adding 3 ml of ice-cold DMEM. Cells and the medium were separated by centrifugation, and the radioactivity of pellet and supernatant was separately measured by liquid scintillation counting. Spectrofluorometric sPLA2 Activity Assay Using PED6 and Red-PED6 Substrates—The PLA2-catalyzed hydrolysis of PED6 and Red-PED6 in sonicated mixed vesicles of POPS/cholesterol/POPG/PED6 (or Red-PED6) (107:31:20:1 in mole ratio; 50 μm final concentration) was carried out at 37 °C in 2 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl and 1.2 mm Ca2+. The progress of hydrolysis was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission at 520 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 488 nm for PED6. For Red-PED6, excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 579 and 589 nm, respectively. Spectral bandwidth was set at 10 nm for both excitation and emission. Values of specific activity were determined from the initial rates of hydrolysis. Spectrofluorometric Assay of Transcellular sPLA2 Activity—sPLA2-transfected HEK293 cells (donor cells; 106 cells/ml) and non-transfected HEK293 cells (acceptor cells; 106 cells/ml) were seeded into each of six wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass filled with 2 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Both sPLA2-transfected and non-transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 day. After the cells were washed once with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), non-transfected cells were overlaid with 50 μl of 2 mm POPS/cholesterol/POPG/PED6 (107:31:20:1)-sonicated mixed vesicles in HBSS, whereas sPLA2-transfected HEK293 cells were overlaid with the corresponding Red-PED6 vesicle solution. After both types of cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C with 5% CO2, labeled cells were rinsed 6 times with HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+ and resuspended in DMEM without phenol red containing 10% fetal bovine serum. This medium was selected to minimize background fluorescence signals. sPLA2-transfected (106 cells/ml) and non-transfected (1 to 5 × 106 cells/ml) cells were mixed in a cuvette, and 1.2 mm Ca2+ (final concentration) was added to the medium. 10 μm ionomycin (final concentration) was then added to the mixture to initiate the sPLA2 release. The progress of hydrolysis of Red-PED6 was monitored as an increase in fluorescence emission (F) at 589 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 579 nm using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. For the same cell mixture, the progress of hydrolysis of PED6 was separately measured with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 488 and 520 nm, respectively. The relative fluorescence intensity was then calculated as F/Fmax where Fmax was the fluorescence emission intensity (F) value obtained when cells were treated with an excess amount (0.1 μm) of N. n. atra PLA2. Transcellular Activity of gVPLA2 in Heparinase-treated HEK293 Cells— Non-transfected HEK293 cells and gVPLA2-transfected HEK293 cells were seeded into 6-well plates (106 cells/ml) as described above. Both transfected and non-transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 day and were separately treated with heparinase I (1 unit/ml) for 90 min in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. Heparinase-treated cells were washed 6 times with HBSS. gVPLA2-transfected and non-transfected HEK293 cells were then labeled with PED6 and Red-PED6, respectively, and mixed for sPLA2 activity measurements, as described above. Confocal Microscopy Imaging of Transcellular sPLA2 Activity—BEAS-2B, RBL-2H3, and DLD-1 cells (106 cells/ml) were seeded into each of 8 wells on a sterile Nunc Lak-TeKII™ chambered cover glass that was placed with filled with 400 μl of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 day. Separately, human neutrophils or eosinophils were overlaid with 10 μl of POPS/cholesterol/POPG/PED6 (107:31:20:1) vesicle solution and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After rinsing the labeled cells 6 times with HBSS containing 1.2 mm Ca2+, these cells were added to BEAS-2B, RBL-2H3, or DLD-1 cells in each chamber, and the mixed cells were incubated for 10 min. After cell stimulants (1 μm endothelin-1 for BEAS-2B or DLD-1 activation and 1 μg/ml 2,4-dinitrophenyl-specific IgE and 10 ng/ml 2,4-dinitrophenyl-conjugated BSA for RBL-2H3 activation) were added, imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope with the detector gain adjusted to eliminate the background autofluorescence. The fluorescence from the hydrolyzed PED6 was monitored with a 568 helium/neon laser and with a 580 line-pass filter. A63× (1.2 numerical aperture) water immersion objective was used for all experiments. The images were analyzed using the analysis tools provided in the Zeiss biophysical software package. Taking into account the diffusion of hydrolyzed products of PED6, the green fluorescence intensity value at a given time was determined as average value (Fav) over the total focal area. The relative fluorescence intensity was then calculated as Fav/Fmax where Fmax was the Fav value obtained when cells were treated with an excess amount (0.1 μm) of N. n. atra PLA2. Purification of Human Neutrophils and Eosinophils—Human peripheral blood neutrophils were isolated as described previously (13Kim K.P. Rafter J.D. Bittova L. Han S.K. Snitko Y. Munoz N.M. Leff A.R. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11126-11134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood eosinophils were purified by negative selection using magnetic-activated cell sorting (AutoMACS, anti-CD16 magnetic beads, Miltenyi Biotec) from the blood (up to 1 unit) of normal, nonallergic, healthy donors under their informed consent and according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Illinois at Chicago as described previously (31Du J.

Total cell counts and eosinophil counts were performed using Randolph's stain, and the purity and the viability of purified eosinophils were assessed by Wright's/Giemsa differential staining and trypan blue dye exclusion, respectively. Both the purity and viability of isolated eosinophils was routinely >98%. Measurement of AA and LTC4 Release from Eosinophils—Human eosinophils (106 cells/group) were labeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]AA for 4 h at 37 °C. The unincorporated AA was washed 3 times with HBSS containing 1.2 mm CaCl2 and 0.2% BSA. Radiolabeled cells (106) were resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer and placed onto 1 well of 12-well plates (Nunc) containing BEAS-2B cells (1-2 × 106 cells) and then stimulated with 1 μm endothelin-1, 3 μm ionomycin or 1 μm endothelin-1 plus 40 ng of anti-gVPLA2 antibody (or anti-gIIAPLA2 or anti-gXPLA2 antiserum) for 30 min. As a control, eosinophils were also activated with 3 μm ionomycin without BEAS-2B cells. The reaction was quenched by centrifugation, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet and the supernatant was separately measured by a two-channel liquid scintillation counter. LTC4 levels (pg/106 cells) in the supernatant were determined using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Cayman). Transcellular AA-releasing Activity of sPLA2s in a Model Cell System— To systematically and quantitatively analyze the relative activities of various sPLA2s on originating versus neighboring cells under well defined conditions, we employed a model system in which those cells that release a sPLA2 isoform (donor cells) and those that do not (acceptor cells) can be readily distinguished. Specifically, we prepared as donor cells HEK293 cells stably expressing human gIIAPLA2, gVPLA2, and gXPLA2, and these cell lines were separately mixed with non-transfected HEK293 cells acting as acceptor cells. The three sPLA2s were selected in this investigation because of their unique properties. gIIAPLA2 has high affinity for HSPG but low activity on the phosphatidylcholine-rich outer plasma membrane of mammalian cells; as a result, secreted gIIAPLA2 is known to enter donor or acceptor cells through HSPG binding and show activities at intracellular locations (10Murakami M.

On the other hand, gXPLA2 has no detectable HSPG affinity but has high activity on the outer plasma membrane. Consequently, it is known to act mainly on the outer plasma membrane cells of either donor or acceptor cells when secreted (32Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K.

Unlike these proteins, secreted gVPLA2 has been shown to be able to not only catalyze the lipolysis at the plasma membrane due to its affinity for and activity on phosphatidylcholine but also enter the cells through HSPG binding to act on intracellular membranes (13Kim K.P.

https://openalex.org/W2144781085,"Existing crystal structure data has indicated that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2 D3) and its analogues bind the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of the human vitamin D receptor in a very similar fashion. Because docking of a ligand into the LBP is a more flexible process than crystallography can monitor, we analyzed 1α,25(OH)2D3, its 20-epi derivative MC1288, the two side-chain analogues Gemini and Ro43-83582 (a hexafluoro-derivative) by molecular dynamics simulations in a complex with the vitamin D receptor ligand-binding domain and a co-activator peptide. Superimposition of the structures showed that the side chain of MC1288, the first side chain of the conformation II of Gemini, the second side chain of Ro43-83582 in conformation I and the first side chain of Ro43-83582 in conformation II take the same agonistic position as the side chain of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Compared with the LBP of the natural hormone MC1288 reduced the volume by 17%, and Gemini expanded it by 19%. The shrinking of the LBP of MC1288 and its expansion to accommodate the second side chain of Gemini or Ro43-83582 is the combined result of minor movements of more than 30 residues and major movements of a few critical amino acids. The agonist-selective recognition of anchoring OH groups by the conformational flexible residues Ala-303, Leu-309, and His-397 was confirmed by in vitro assays. In summary, variations in the volume of agonists lead to adaptations in the volume of the LBP and alternative contacts of anchoring OH-groups.

The nuclear receptor for the seco-steroid 1α,25(OH)2D3, VDR, 2The abbreviations used are: VDR, 1α,25(OH)2D3 receptor; CoA, co-activator; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MD, molecular dynamics; RXR, retinoid X receptor; LBD, ligand-binding domain; LBP, ligand-binding pocket; SOM, self-organizing map; TIF2, transcription intermediary factor 2; VDRE, 1α,25(OH)2D3 response element; wt, wild type; Gemini, 21-(3-OH-methyl-butyl)-1α,25(OH)2D3; Ro43-83582, 21-(3-OH-methyl-butyl)-23-yne-26,27-F6-1α, 25(OH)2D3. is one of the classic 11 endocrine members of the nuclear receptor super-family, which binds its ligand with high affinity (Kd value of 0.1 nm) (1Chawla A. Repa J.J. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1866-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Like most nuclear receptors, VDR has a highly conserved DNA-binding domain and a structurally conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD). The 12 α-helices of the LBD form a three-layered anti-parallel sandwich, which comprises a central core layer of the helices 5, 9, and 11 that is sandwiched between two additional layers of helices creating a LBP (2Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The interior surface of the LBP is mostly made up of non-polar amino acids and thereby complements the hydrophobic character of VDR ligands. Specificity is achieved through a limited number of hydrogen bonds between the 1-OH group and Ser-237 (helix 3)/Arg-274 (helix 5), the 3-OH-group and Ser-278 (helix 5)/Tyr-143 (helix 1), and the 25-OH-group and His-305 (loop between helices 6 and 7)/His-397 (helix 11) (3Väisänen S. Ryhänen S. Saarela J.T. Peräkylä M. Andersin T. Maenpää P.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). VDR acts preferentially as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) on specific DNA sequences in promoter regions of 1α,25(OH)2D3 target genes, referred to as 1α,25(OH)2D3 response elements (VDREs) (4Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). VDR ·RXR ·VDRE complexes are the molecular cores of DNA-dependent 1α,25(OH)2D3 signaling (5Carlberg C. Quack M. Herdick M. Bury Y. Polly P. Toell A. Steroids. 2001; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the stabilization of the agonistic VDR LBD conformation is the most critical step in this signaling process. Comparison of the structure of the apo-RXR (6Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) with the ligand-bound retinoid acid receptor (7Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) suggested that receptors undergo a specific switch between two conformations, which involves a major rearrangement of helix 12 as well as a number of more subtle changes. In the agonistic conformation the LBD interacts with co-activator (CoA) proteins, such as SRC-1, TIF2, and RAC3 (8Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). CoA proteins contain multiple, short receptor interaction domains, with the central sequence LXXLL (9Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). The receptor interaction domain of the CoA makes contacts with helices 3, 4, and 12 of the LBD, which are stabilized by a charge clamp between Glu-420 (helix 12) and Lys-246 (helix 3) (10Jimenez-Lara A.M.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 1α,25(OH)2D3 is a key player in calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization (12Suda T. Ueno Y. Fujii K. Shinki T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) but also has anti-proliferative and pro-differentional effects on various cell types (13Mørk Hansen C. Binderup L. Hamberg K.J. Carlberg C. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 820-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 3000 synthetic analogues of 1α,25(OH)2D3 are presently known, and the majority of them carry a modification in their aliphatic side chain (14Carlberg C. Mouriño A. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents. 2003; 13: 761-772Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogues have been developed with the goal of improving the biological profile of the natural hormone for therapeutic application either in hyperproliferative diseases, such as psoriasis and different types of cancer, or in bone disorders, such as osteoporosis (15Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the analogues described to date are agonists, with a few having been identified as antagonists. An interesting exception is Gemini, which is the first 1α,25(OH)2D3 analogue that carries two side chains (16Herdick M. Bury Y. Quack M. Uskokovic M. Polly P. Carlberg C. Mol.

The most detailed information about the molecular mechanisms of the analogues can be obtained from crystal structures. The human VDR LBD has been crystallized with the natural hormone, its 20-epi analogue MC1288, and a few other synthetic agonists (18Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol.

Rochel N. Mitschler A. Kouzmenko A. Moras D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89-90: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Gemini-VDR showed that the analogue can bind the VDR LBD in two different conformations (23Väisänen S. Peräkylä M. Kärkkäinen J.I. Uskokovic M.R. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In one of these conformations Gemini acts as an agonist with one side chain taking the same position as that of the natural hormone. In contrast, in its other conformation Gemini acts as an inverse agonist, because both of its side chains take alternative positions to that of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (24Macias Gonzalez M. Samenfeld P. Peräkylä M. Carlberg C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2028-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In analogy to a number of one side-chain analogues, the addition of fluorine atoms improved the potential of Gemini even more (23Väisänen S. Peräkylä M. Kärkkäinen J.I. Uskokovic M.R. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Weyts F.A. Dhawan P. Zhang X. Bishop J.E. Uskokovic M.R. Ji Y. Studzinski G.P. Norman A.W. Christakos S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Taken together, the LBP of the VDR seems to be flexible enough to accommodate large ligands, such as Gemini and its derivatives. The docking of a ligand into the LBP is probably a much more dynamic process than “static” crystallography can monitor. In this study we therefore analyzed 1α,25(OH)2D3, MC1288, Gemini, and Ro43-83582 by MD simulations in a complex with VDR and a CoA peptide. Superimposition of the structures revealed details about the position of the side chains of the ligand and the amino acids forming the LBP. These investigations led to the observation that MC1288 reduced the volume of the LBP by 17%, whereas Gemini expanded it by 19%. We also found agonist-selective recognition of anchoring groups by the conformational flexible residues Ala-303, Leu-309, and His-397 and confirmed them by in vitro assays. VDR Ligands—1α,25(OH)2D3 and MC1288 (20-epi-1α,25(OH)2D3) were a gift from Dr. L. Binderup (Leo Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark), and Gemini (21-(3-OH-methyl-butyl)-1α,25(OH)2D3) and Ro43-83582 (21-(3-OH-methyl-butyl)-23-yne-26,27-F6-1α,25(OH)2D3), a Gemini derivative (23Väisänen S.

The VDR ligands were dissolved in 2-propanol and further dilutions were made in Me2SO (for in vitro experiments) or in ethanol (for cell culture experiments). Protein Expression Vectors—Full-length cDNAs for human VDR (26Carlberg C. Bendik I. Wyss A. Meier E. Sturzenbecker L.J. Grippo J.F. Hunziker W. Nature. 1993; 361: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and human RXRα (27Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the T7/SV40 promoterdriven pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The point mutants of human VDR were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The same constructs were used for both T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription/translation of the respective cDNAs and for viral promoter-driven overexpression of the respective proteins in mammalian cells. GST Fusion Protein Constructs—The receptor interaction domain of human TIF2 (spanning residues 646-926) (28Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Gene Constructs—Four copies of DR3-type VDRE of the rat atrial natriuretic factor gene (core sequence AGAGGTCATGAAGGACA) (29Kahlen J.P. Carlberg C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were fused with the thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Structural Modeling and MD Simulations—The initial coordinates of VDR were obtained from the crystal structure of the VDR ·LBD ·1α, 25(OH)2D3 complex (Protein Data Bank code 1DB1) (18Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). The amino acids missing from the x-ray structure (residues 118, 119, 375-377, and 424-427) were built using the Quanta98 molecular modeling package (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The four residues missing from the C terminus (residues 424-427) were built in an α-helical conformation (φ = -57°, ψ =-47°). The CoA peptide KNHPMLMNLLKDN was added to the simulation system and placed on the surface of the VDR LBD on the basis of rat VDR ·LBD ·1α,25(OH)2D3 complex crystal structure (1RK3) (11Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Bauer C.B. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 1α,25(OH)2D3 was placed to the LBP using the VDR ·LBD ·1α, 25(OH)2D3 crystal structure as a model. Gemini and Ro43-83582 were docked in two different conformations to VDR on the basis of earlier MD simulation results (23Väisänen S. Peräkylä M. Kärkkäinen J.I. Uskokovic M.R. Carlberg C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the energy minimizations and MD simulations the VDR complexes were hydrated with TIP3P water molecules in a periodic box of ∼61 × 69 × 86 Å. Crystallographic water molecules were included in the simulation systems. The water molecules of the complexes were first energy-minimized for 1000 steps, heated to 300 K in 5 ps, and equilibrated by 10 ps at constant volume and temperature of 300 K. After that the simulation systems were minimized for 1000 steps, the temperature of the systems was increased to 300 K in 5 ps, and equilibrated for 100 ps. The equilibration was carried out at constant pressure (1 atm) conditions. After that production simulations of 1 ns were started. In the simulations the electrostatics were treated using the particle-mesh Ewald method. A time step of 1.5 fs was used, and bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained to their equilibrium lengths using the SHAKE algorithm. The simulations were done using the AMBER8.0 simulation package (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and the parm99 parameter set of AMBER. The parameters of the ligands were generated with the Antechamber suite of AMBER8.0 in conjunction with the general amber force field. The atomic point charges of the ligands were calculated with the two-stage RESP fit (30Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5694) Google Scholar) at the HF/6-31G* level using ligand geometries optimized with the semi-empirical PM3 method using the Gaussian03 program (Gaussian Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Self-organizing Maps (SOMs)—Visual Data software (Visipoint Oy, Kuopio, Finland) is based on SOMs, which are artificial neural network algorithms in the unsupervised learning category that can visualize and interpret large high dimensional data sets (31Kohonen T. Self-Organizing Maps. 2nd Edition. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995Crossref Google Scholar). The map consists of a regular grid of processing units, so-called “neurons.” A model of some multidimensional observation, eventually a vector consisting of features, is associated with each unit. The map attempts to represent all of the available observations with optimal accuracy using a restricted set of models. At the same time the models become ordered on the grid so that similar models are close to each other and dissimilar models far from each other. The input data for SOM are the distances of amino acid residues in the complexes of VDR with MC1288, Gemini (in conformations I and II), and Ro43-83582 (in conformations I and II) compared with that with 1α,25(OH)2D3. All values were used as the training pattern. At the beginning, each neuron of the SOM was randomly assigned a weight vector with five variables using 1024 as a starting maximal resolution. The weight vectors of the best matching neuron and its neighbors are moved toward the values of the input vectors such that neurons come to represent a group of amino acids with similar conformational flexibility. During the training the adjustment of weight vectors diminished. Then each amino acid is placed into a neuron, which best describes its flexibility pattern profile, and the value of difference is displayed on each neuron as a bar graph. The resulted map with matrix resolution 16 × 16 was changed to 4 × 4 to exclude empty clusters in the matrix. Finally, a Sammon's mapping algorithm (Visipoint Oy) was applied to visualize the clustered groups in n-dimensional space in two dimensions. LBP and Ligand Volume Calculations—The volume of the LBP was calculated with Voidoo software (Uppsala Software Factory, Uppsala, Sweden). The probe radius in the calculations was set to 1.9 Å. For mesh representation the grid for plot files was set as 0.5 Å and for iso-surfaces as 0.2 Å. The obtained graphical representation EZD file output was converted with MAPMAN software (Uppsala Software Factory) to DSN6 FRODO format electron density maps. The maps were loaded, visualized, and rendered in MacPyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). Ligand volumes were calculated by the molecular modeling software SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) from the Connolly surfaces of the ligands that were created using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. In Vitro Translation and Bacterial Overexpression of Proteins—In vitro translated wild type or mutated human VDR and RXR proteins were generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein batches were quantified by test translations in the presence of [35 S]methionine. The specific concentration of the receptor proteins was adjusted to ∼4 ng/μl after taking the individual number of methionine residues/protein into account. Bacterial overexpression of GST-TIF2646-926 was obtained from the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS strain (Stratagene) containing the respective expression plasmids. Overexpression was stimulated with 0.25 mm isopropyl-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside for 3h at 37°C, and the proteins were purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were eluted in the presence of glutathione. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were seeded into 6-well plates (200,000 cells/well) and grown overnight in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA containing liposomes were formed by incubating 100 ng of an expression vector for wild type or mutant VDR and 1μg of reporter plasmid with 10 μg of N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 100μl. After dilution with 900μl of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the liposomes were added to the cells. Phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 500 μl of 15% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added 4 h after transfection. Also at this time, VDR agonists (final concentration 1 nm) or solvent was added. The cells were lysed 16 h after the onset of stimulation using reporter gene lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics), and the constant light signal luciferase reporter gene assay was performed as recommended by the supplier (Canberra-Packard, Groningen, The Netherlands). The luciferase activities were normalized with respect to protein concentration. Limited Protease Digestion Assay—In vitro translated, 35S-labeled wild type or mutated human VDR (20 ng) was incubated with Me2SO or VDR agonists (final concentration 1 μm) for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 10 μl. Trypsin (Promega, final concentration 100 ng/μl) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature. The limited proteolysis was stopped by adding one volume of protein gel loading buffer (0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.025% bromphenol blue). The samples were denatured for 3 min at 95 °C, resolved by electrophoresis through 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized on a FLA3000 reader (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) using ScienceLab99 software (Fuji). Supershift Assays—Supershift assays were performed with equal amounts (10 ng) of in vitro translated wild type or mutant human VDR and RXRα. The proteins were incubated for 15 min with Me2SO or VDR agonists (final concentration 1 μm) in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol). Bacterially expressed GST-TIF2646-926 fusion protein was added to the reaction mixture. Approximately 1 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (50,000 cpm) corresponding to one copy of the DR4-type VDRE of the rat pit-1 gene (core sequence GAAGTTCATGAGAGTTCA) (32Rhodes S.J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 913-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min at room temperature. Protein ·DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and visualized on a FLA3000 reader using ScienceLab99 software. Side Chain Orientations of VDR Agonists—The VDR ligand 1α,25 (OH)2D3, its 20-epi derivative MC1288 (33Peleg S. Sastry M. Collins E.D. Bishop J.E. Norman A.W. J. Biol.

In contrast, Ro43-83582 contains six electronegative fluorine atoms at C-31 and C-32 and carries a triple bond between C-28 and C-29 (Fig. 1A). We performed MD simulations for each of the four ligands in a complex with the VDR LBD and a CoA peptide. The simulations were started on coordinates of the crystal structure of the human VDR LBD (18Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), which has been completed by molecular modeling with the residues 118, 119, 375-377, and 424-427. The coordinates of the CoA peptide were obtained from a complex with the rat VDR LBD (1RK3 (11Vanhooke J.L. Benning M.M. Bauer C.B. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4101-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar)). As expected, for both Gemini and Ro43-83582 two conformations, I and II, were obtained. The MD simulation structures of the complexes with MC1288, Gemini, and Ro43-83582 (both in two conformations) were individually superimposed with the simulated VDR ·1α,25(OH)2D3 complex. From these superimpositions only the ligand structures are shown (Fig. 1B). A superimposition of the VDR ·1α,25(OH)2D3 (1DB1 (18Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar)) and the VDR ·MC1288 (1IE9 (19Tocchini-Valentini G. Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Moras D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5491-5496Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar)) crystal structures served as a reference for the quality of the MD simulations. However, it should be noted that the latter crystal structure complexes did not contain any CoA peptide. In general, all four agonists took similar positions within the LBP of the receptors, although Gemini and Ro43-83582 had to find space for their additional side chains. For a more detailed analysis the distances between the C-25 atoms of the (first) side chains of all four ligands and, in case of Gemini and Ro43-83582, also that to the C-30 atoms of the second side chain were determined (Fig. 1B). The distances between the C-25 atoms of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and MC1288 were found to be 0.4 Å based on the crystal structures and 1.0 Å according to our MD simulations. When Gemini was in conformation I (Fig. 1B,orange) the C-25 atom resident in the first side chain had a distance of 3.7 Å compared with that of 1α,25(OH)2D3, whereas the C-30 atom of the second side chain of Gemini showed only a distance of 2.1 Å compared with the C-25 atom of the natural ligand. In conformation II (Fig. 1B,blue) the first side chain of Gemini took nearly the same position as the side chain of 1α,25(OH)2D3 with a deviation of only 0.7 Å in their C-25 atoms. In contrast, in the conformation II of Gemini the C-30 atom of the second side chain showed the large distance of 6.9 Å to the C-25 atom of the natural ligand. Interestingly, in conformation I of Ro43-83582 (orange) the C-25 atom of the first side chain was in a distance of even 7.4 Å to the respective carbon atom of 1α,25(OH)2D3, whereas the C-30 atom of the second side chain deviated only by 0.9 Å. The C-25 atom of first side chain of conformation II of Ro43-83582 (blue) had only a distance of 0.6 Å to that of the natural ligand, whereas the C-30 atom of the second side chain was in a distance of 7.3 Å. For each of the four VDR agonists the distances between their anchoring OH-groups are indicated in supplemental Table S1. Taken together, the side chain of MC1288, the first side chain of the conformation II of Gemini, the second side chain of Ro43-83582 in conformation I, and the first side chain of Ro43-83582 in conformation II take nearly the same position as the side chain of the natural ligand. An Analysis of the Amino Acids Lining the VDR LBP—We determined the impact of individual amino acids on the shape of the LBP of the VDR with the program Voidoo. In the five superimpositions of the MD simulation structures of VDR with MC1288, Gemini (in conformations I and II), and Ro43-83582 (in conformations I and II) with that of the VDR ·1α,25(OH)2D3 complex, we measured for each of the 40 amino acid residues forming the LBP the average distance between the respective most terminal atoms (excluding hydrogens). In the case of aromatic residues we considered the average distance of all ring atoms and in the case of branched residues, the average of both terminal atoms. These 200 values (between 0.08 and 6.13 Å, see supplemental Table S2) form a five-dimensional data set. SOM clustering allowed the sorting of the 40 residues of the LBP into 16 groups (Fig. 2). In each group are those amino acids that showed comparable ligand-induced movements. Amino acids with more profound conformational flexibility were found in the peripheral groups I-X, whereas groups XI-XVI form the center of the map and contain residues that show only minor differences in their positions in the different VDR-agonists structures. The location of all 40 amino acids is shown in supplemental Fig. S3. Taken together, SOM clustering allows us to sort the amino acids forming the LBP into a group of a few more flexible repres"
https://openalex.org/W2080098971,"Polypeptide release factor 2 (RF2) in <i>Escherichia coli</i> is known to be synthesized by a +1 frameshift at the 26th UGA codon of RF2 mRNA. Polyamines were found to stimulate the +1 frameshift of RF2 synthesis, an effect that was reduced by excess RF2. Polyamine stimulation of +1 frameshift of RF2 synthesis was observed at the early logarithmic phase, which is the important phase in determination of the overall rate of cell growth. A Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence was necessary for an efficient +1 frameshift of RF2 synthesis, but not for polyamine stimulation. Spectinomycin, tetracycline, streptomycin, and neomycin reduced polyamine stimulation of the +1 frameshift of RF2 synthesis. The results suggest that a structural change of the A site on 30 S ribosomal subunits is important for polyamine stimulation of the +1 frameshift. The level of mRNAs of ribosomal proteins and elongation factors having UAA as termination codon was enhanced by polyamines, and OppA synthesis from OppA mRNA having UAA as termination codon was more enhanced by polyamines than that from OppA mRNA having a UGA termination codon. Furthermore, synthesis of ribosomal protein L20 and elongation factor G from the mRNAs having a UAA termination codon was enhanced by polyamines at the level of translation and transcription. The results suggest that some protein synthesis from mRNAs having a UAA termination codon is enhanced at the level of translation through polyamine stimulation of +1 frameshift of RF2 synthesis. It is concluded that <i>prfB</i> encoding RF2 is a new member of the polyamine modulon."

https://openalex.org/W2083370868,"Pancreatic cancer exhibits profound chemoresistance resulting either from pre-existing (intrinsic) mechanisms, or from anticancer drug treatment itself (acquired chemoresistance). To identify molecular alterations leading to acquired chemoresistance, the chemosensitive pancreatic carcinoma cell line PT45-P1 was exposed to low-dose treatment with etoposide for 6 weeks. Afterwards, these cells (PT45-P1res) were much more resistant to high-dose treatment with anticancer drugs than parental cells. Among several differentially expressed genes in PT45-P1res cells, IL-1β was most significantly upregulated, a finding in line with our previous observation that IL-1β accounts for intrinsic chemoresistance of pancreatic carcinoma cells. Elevated IL-1β expression in PT45-P1res cells was confirmed by real-time PCR and ELISA, and treatment with the IL-1 receptor antagonist restored drug-induced apoptosis. The increased IL-1β secretion was accompanied by an elevated formation of nitric oxide (NO) and a NO-dependent inhibition of the etoposide-induced caspase-3/-7/-8/-9 activity. Caspase activation was restored either by the iNOS inhibitor 1400W, the reducing agent dithiothreitol or the IL-1 receptor antagonist, resulting in greater sensitivity towards anticancer drug treatment. Conversely, IL-1β or the NO-donor SNAP decreased caspase activation and apoptosis in etoposide-treated PT45-P1 cells. These data confirm IL-1β and NO as determinants of chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer, and indicate that the intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance rely to some extent on common molecular targets beneficial for improved therapeutical strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1991127121,"Regulation of cell surface molecules by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as well as MMPs-catalyzed degradation of extracellular matrix, is important for tumor invasion and metastasis. Our previous study (Kioi, M., Yamamoto, K., Higashi, S., Koshikawa, N., Fujita, K., and Miyazaki, K. (2003) Oncogene 22, 8662–8670) demonstrated that active matrilysin specifically binds to the surface of colon cancer cells and induces notable cell aggregation due to processing of the cell membrane protein(s). Furthermore, these aggregated cells showed a dramatically enhanced metastatic potential. To elucidate the mechanism of matrilysin-induced cell aggregation, we attempted to identify the matrilysin-binding substance on the cell surface. Here, we demonstrate that cholesterol sulfate on the cell surface is a major matrilysin-binding substance. We found that active matrilysin bound to the cell membrane and cholesterol sulfate incorporated into liposomes with similar affinities. Treatment of colon cancer cells with β-cyclodextrin significantly reduced not only matrilysin binding to the cell surface but also matrilysin-dependent proteolysis and cell aggregation. Interestingly, replenishment of cholesterol sulfate, but not cholesterol, neutralized the effects of β-cyclodextrin.

Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 2Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). The association of MMPs with cancer cell invasion and metastasis has suggested that these proteinases represent attractive targets for the development of novel anti-tumor therapies. Recently, it has been suggested that the biological functions of various cell surface proteins are proteolytically modulated by several MMPs (1Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 3Li S. Chow L.H. Pickering J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35384-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Higashi S. Miyazaki K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6514-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), including MT-MMPs, gelatinase A (MMP-2), gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin (MMP-3), and matrilysin (MMP-7). These metalloproteinases are thought to regulate cellular functions by activating, inactivating, or releasing membrane proteins. Such regulation of cell surface molecules as well as MMP-catalyzed degradation of the extracellular matrix is important for tumor invasion and metastasis. Matrilysin is the smallest member of the MMP family, which lacks the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. In cancer tissues, various MMPs are overexpressed both in stromal and tumor cells. In contrast, matrilysin has been detected specifically in tumor cells but not in stromal cells (5Miyazaki K. Hattori Y. Umenishi F. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7758-7764PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nagashima Y. Hasegawa S. Koshikawa N. Taki A. Ichikawa Y. Kitamura H. Misugi K. Kihira Y. Matuo Y. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among many MMPs, matrilysin appears to be one of the most important MMPs in human colon cancers because it is almost always overexpressed in colon cancers. Expression of matrilysin is also correlated well with malignancy and metastasis of cancers, especially in liver metastasis of colon cancer (7Ishikawa T. Ichikawa Y. Mitsuhashi M. Momiyama N. Chishima T. Tanaka K. Yamaoka H. Miyazaki K. Nagashima Y. Akitaya T. Shimada H. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that matrilysin contributes to tumor malignancy by cleaving cell surface proteins (8Powell W.C. Fingleton B. Wilson C.L. Boothby M. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), such as Fas ligand. Another study suggested that degradation of IgG by matrilysin protects tumor cells from the immune system (9Gearing A.J. Thorpe S.J. Miller K. Mangan M. Varley P.G. Dudgeon T. Ward G. Turner C. Thorpe R. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 81: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that active matrilysin efficiently binds to the surface of human colon cancer cells and induces E-cadherin-mediated cell aggregation by processing a cell membrane protein(s). The aggregated cells showed dramatically enhanced metastatic potential in the nude mice model (10Kioi M. Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Koshikawa N. Fujita K. Miyazaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8662-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The advantage of aggregation of colon cancer cells in their metastasis is also supported by other studies (11Topal B. Roskams T. Fevery J. Penninckx F. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 112: 31-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We speculate the following three possibilities to explain how cell aggregation facilitates the liver metastasis: first, the aggregated colon cancer cells are able to survive in the bloodstream due to E-cadherin-mediated intracellular signals, which are required for anchorage-independent survival and growth of tumor cells (12Mueller S. Cadenas E. Schonthal A.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 60: 156-163Google Scholar). Second, aggregated cancer cells are easily trapped in microvascular vessels, which facilitates their extravasation and subsequent invasion into tissues. Third, formation of cell aggregation protects the cells from the immune system. It is believed that localization of secreted MMPs on the cell surface is required for processing or degradation of cell surface molecules (13Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 14Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar). The anchoring of the soluble MMPs with the cell membrane is probably a benefit not only in preventing rapid diffusion of the proteinases but also in their efficient interaction with cell surface substrates. The C-terminal, hemopexin-like domains of MMPs are thought to be possible sites for cell association (15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we reported that matrilysin, which lacks the C-terminal, hemopexin-like domain, efficiently binds to the cell surface. Previous studies suggested that rat matrilysin binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cells in rat uterine tissue (16Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4183-4191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is speculated that optimal interaction between matrilysin and its cell surface substrates are mediated by the third molecules, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In this study, we tried to identify the matrilysin-binding substance on the cell surface to elucidate the mechanism of matrilysin-induced cell aggregation. We demonstrate that cell surface cholesterol sulfate, but not heparan sulfate proteoglycans, is the major and specific substance to which human active matrilysin binds. Moreover, binding of matrilysin to cholesterol sulfate was found to be essential for matrilysin-catalyzed modulation of cell surface protein(s) that is involved in the induction of prominent cell aggregation. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Human colon cancer cell lines Colo201, WiDr, DLD-1, and Lovo, human gastric cancer cell line STKM-1, human oral cancer cell line HSC-4, human bladder cancer cell line EJ-1, and human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resources Bank. These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies and Other Reagents—The sources of materials used were as follows: the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, heparinase, heparitinase, chondroitinase ABC, sodium selenate, fumonisin B1, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), polyhydroxylethyl methacrylate, cholesterol, cholesterol sulfate, and phospholipids mixture from Sigma; SM4, ganglioside mixture, cardiolipin, ceramide, and cerebroside from Avanti (Alabaster, AL); human recombinant matrilysin and heparin from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); the anti-enolase polyclonal antibody sc-15343 was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA); the anti-human E-cadherin monoclonal antibody HECD-1 from Takara (Shiga, Japan); anti-human stromelysin monoclonal antibody from Daiichi Fine Chemicals (Toyama, Japan); anti-human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) monoclonal antibody PL05 from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA); human recombinant stromelysin from Biogenesis Inc.

The anti-lamin A/C polyclonal antibody (N-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Fujii (Yokohama City University). The anti-human matrilysin monoclonal antibody 11B4G was a kind gift from Dr. Y. Matsuo (Nagahama Institute of Oriental Yeast Co., Shiga, Japan). SM3 was prepared as described previously (17Kobayashi T. Honke K. Kamio K. Sakakibara N. Gasa S. Miyao N. Tsukamoto T. Ishizuka I. Miyazaki T. Makita A. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human gelatinase A was prepared as described previously (18Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10497-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The anti-human gelatinase A was prepared in our laboratory. All other chemicals used for the experiments were of analytical grade or the highest quality commercially available. Construction of Expression Vector of FLAG-tagged Human Recombinant Matrilysin—cDNA of human pro-matrilysin cloned into the pλPR vector (19Kihira Y. Mori K. Miyazaki K. Matsuo Y. Urol. Oncol. 1996; 2: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. T. Tanaka, Oriental Yeast. cDNA encoding human pro-matrilysin was ligated into pGEM-3zf(+) (Promega), using EcoRI and BamHI sites. The C-terminal FLAG-tagged pro-matrilysin (pGEM-pro-matrilysin-FLAG) was constructed by mutagenic polymerase chain reaction, using a pair of primers (5′-TGATGATAAATAGTACTGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACC-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-TCATCTTTATAATCCTTTTTACGAGAGTTAGAACG-3′ (antisense primer)), containing the sequence encoding FLAG, an in-frame stop codon, and ScaI restriction site, and the pGEM-pro-matrilysin as a template. For point mutagenesis of pro-matrilysin, the C-terminal FLAG-tagged E215A pro-matrilysin (pGEM-pro-E215A-FLAG) was constructed by mutagenic polymerase chain reaction, using a pair of primers (5′-ATGCGCTGGGTCATTCTCTG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-GGGTTGCAGCGTACAGGAAG-3′ (antisense primer)). The primers were designed in inverted tail-to-tail directions to amplify the cloning vector together with the pro-matrilysin-FLAG sequence. The coding region of both mature pro-matrilysin and pro-E215A containing the C-terminal FLAG tag were then amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using a pair of primers: 5′-GGATCCCTGCCGCTGCCGCAAG-3′ (sense primer containing the BamHI site) and 5′-GAATTCTACTATTTATCATCATCATC-3′ (antisense primer containing the EcoRI site), and the pGEM-pro-matrilysin-FLAG or pGEM-E215A pro-matrilysin-FLAG as a template. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then cloned into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences), an expression vector for glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Matrilysin—Expression of glutathione S-transferase-pro-matrilysin-FLAG, glutathione S-transferase-pro-E215A-FLAG, and solubilization of inclusion bodies with guanidine-HCl followed by refolding were performed as described previously (20Oneda H. Inouye K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To remove the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase region, the refolded proteins were incubated with thrombin, and resultant pro-matrilysin and pro-E215A were purified, using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose column. The purified pro-matrilysin was activated by incubation with 1 mm p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate at 37 °C for 1 h. To remove the propeptide from the E215A mutant, the mutant pro-matrilysin was mixed with active matrilysin-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads and incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline; TBS), containing 10 mm CaCl2 (TBSC) and 1 mm p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate at 4 °C overnight with rotation, and then, the mature form of the mutant was collected by filtration. Western Blotting Analysis and Immunofluoresence Staining—Western blotting analysis and immunofluoresence staining were carried out using the anti-matrilysin antibody 11B4G as described previously (10Kioi M. Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Koshikawa N. Fujita K. Miyazaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8662-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14020-14028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Assay of Matrilysin-binding Ability of Cell Membrane—Each cell line (1 × 106) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium was incubated without or with 50 nm matrilysin on polyhydroxylethyl methacrylate-coated 35-mm dishes at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, cells were collected, washed three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium, and then homogenized in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm sucrose by a Potter-Elvehjem-type homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 7 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant precipitate was used as the cell membrane. The membrane fraction was dissolved in a SDS sample buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% 2-meraptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Matrilysin bound to the cell membrane was detected by Western blotting with the anti-matrilysin antibody 11B4G. Phase Separation of Membrane-associated Substances in Triton X-114 Solution—To separate membrane-associated substances from soluble ones, we used phase separation of the Triton X-114 solution, according to Brusca and Radolf (22Brusca J.S. Radolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Then, the binding of matrilysin to the membrane-associated substance was examined. Briefly, the membrane fraction of WiDr cells dissolved in TBSC containing 1% Triton X-114 was incubated with 100 nm active matrilysin at 4 °C for 3 h. The temperature of the sample was then transferred to 37 °C and the sample was further incubated for 3 min. The resultant detergent and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation at 25 °C. Matrilysin partitioned in the aqueous and detergent phases were separately precipitated by adding an excess 10-fold volume of cold acetone. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dried, and subjected to Western blotting analysis. Sucrose Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—WiDr cells (1 × 108) were lysed in 1 ml of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei. The resultant supernatant (1 ml) was then mixed with 1 ml of TBS containing 80% sucrose. A linear sucrose gradient (5–30% in 10 ml of TBS) was layered on the mixture. The sample was centrifuged at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 18 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor and fractionated from the bottom (1 ml each, total 12 fractions). Aliquots of each fraction were dialyzed with TBS and adjusted to 1% Triton X-114 and 8 m urea to destroy the lipids structure. Each sample was dialyzed against TBS, and its matrilysin-binding activity was analyzed by the phase separation method followed by Western blotting. PLAP in each sample was detected by Western blotting with the anti-PLAP antibody. β-CD Treatment of Cells, Replenishment of Cholesterol and/or Cholesterol Sulfate, and Supplement of SM3 or Cardiolipin—Each cell line (1 × 106) was incubated without or with 10 mm β-CD dissolved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium at 37 °C for 30 min. To prepare β-CD saturated with cholesterol and/or cholesterol sulfate, cholesterol (2 mm) and cholesterol sulfate (2 mm) dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1) were dried in vacuum, and then 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm β-CD was added. The mixture was sonicated and then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. To remove insoluble lipids, the sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm Millipore filter. To replenish cells with cholesterol or cholesterol sulfate, the β-CD-treated cells were washed three times, and then incubated in the presence of 250 μm β-CD saturated with cholesterol or cholesterol sulfate at 37 °C for 1 h. To supply cells with SM3 or cardiolipin, the β-CD-treated cells were washed three times, and then incubated in the presence of 100 μm SM3 or 100 μm cardiolipin at 37 °C for 1 h. Cell Aggregation Assay—The cell aggregation assay was carried out as described previously (10Kioi M. Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Koshikawa N. Fujita K. Miyazaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8662-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The degree of cell aggregation was quantified by the following equation: (1 – Nt/Nc) × 100, where Nt (test) and Nc (control) represent the number of single cells in the presence or absence of a test sample, respectively. Extraction and Analysis of Lipids from Cancer Cells—Total lipids were extracted from WiDr cells (1 × 108) or Colo201 cells (1 × 108) with 20 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by 10 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2). For separation by high performance liquid chromatography, the lipids from cells (5 × 108) were applied to a TSK-GEL DEAE-2SW column. After washing the column, absorbed lipids were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium acetate (0–0.16 m) in chloroform/methanol/water (30:60:8). Each fraction was desalted using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters) and applied to a high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plate (Silica Gel 60; Merck) and then developed with solvent systems: I, chloroform/methanol/0.2% CaCl2 (60:35:7); or II, chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (8:2:4:2:1). The separated lipids were visualized with iodine vapor or azure A reagent. Liposome Binding Assay—The sample lipids dissolved in volatile solvents were dried and suspended in 100 μl of pure water by a 1-min sonication. The liposome (COATSOME EL-N-01; NOF, Tokyo, Japan) consisting of 27 μmol of phosphatidylcholine, 20 μmol of cholesterol, 3 μmol of phosphatidylglycerol was suspended in 1 ml of water and 100 μl of the suspension was mixed with the sample lipids. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the combined lipids were washed with TBSC containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin (TBSCB), and then 500 μl of matrilysin solution, which contained the active form of matrilysin (200 nm), gelatinase A (200 nm), or stromelysin (200 nm) in TBSCB were added and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant precipitate was washed three times with TBSCB and then dissolved in the SDS sample buffer. The proteases bound to lipsome and those in the supernatant were detected by Western blotting. β-CD Treatment of Liposomes—Cholesterol sulfate (250 μm), SM3 (40 μm), or cardiolipin (100 μm) were incorporated into liposomes that consisted of 5.2 mm phosphatidylcholine, 4 mm cholesterol, and 0.6 mm phosphatidylglycerol. These liposomes suspended in TBSCB were incubated without or with 10 mm β-CD at 37 °C for 1 h. Determination of Dissociation Constants for Binding of Matrilysin to Cell Membrane or Standard Lipids Incorporated into Liposome—Various concentrations of active matrilysin were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with a fixed number of WiDr cells (2 × 106) or fixed concentrations of cholesterol sulfate (250 μm), SM3 (40 μm), or cardiolipin (100 μm) incorporated into liposome that consisted of 5.2 mm phosphatidylcholine, 4 mm cholesterol, and 0.6 mm phosphatidylglycerol. After a 3-h incubation, cells and liposomes were collected by centrifugation. The cell precipitates were washed three times, and then dissolved in the SDS sample buffer. Matrilysin bound to cells or liposome and various amounts of authentic matrilysin were analyzed simultaneously by Western blotting. The intensities of the matrilysin bands were measured by NIH Image and the amounts of bound matrilysin were determined in comparison with authentic matrilysin. The concentrations of free matrilysin were also calculated by subtracting the concentrations of bound matrilysin from the initial concentration of matrilysin. The data were subjected to Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plot analysis to determine the apparent dissociation constants (Kd(app)). In this analysis, [F]/[B] versus [F] were plotted: where [F] and [B] are concentrations of free and bound matrilysin, respectively. The data were fitted to linear regression curves. The –Kd values were obtained from the x axis intercept. Binding of Matrilysin to the Surface of Various Cells—Previously, we reported that human matrilysin binds to the surface of human colon cancer cell lines (Colo201, WiDr), whereas stromelysin and gelatinase A fail to bind. We also showed that only the active form, not pro-form, of matrilysin efficiently binds to the cell surface (10Kioi M. Yamamoto K. Higashi S. Koshikawa N. Fujita K. Miyazaki K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8662-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that a substance(s) capable of specifically binding to active matrilysin is present on the cell surface. In this study, to analyze the cell-bound matrilysin, we prepared membrane fractions of WiDr cells by the differential centrifugation method as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first examined the distribution of matrilysin endogenously produced by WiDr cells because WiDr cells express the highest amounts of matrilysin in our tested cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, when cells were incubated for 36 h, pro-matrilysin was detected only in the conditioned medium but not in other fractions. When the cells were incubated for 3 h, we could not detect (pro)matrilysin in any fraction. To analyze the binding of active matrilysin to the cell surface, WiDr cells were incubated with active matrilysin for 3 h. After incubation, cells were washed and fractionated. We found that active matrilysin was detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1A). As the cells did not produce a detectable amount of (pro)matrilysin during the 3-h incubation, it is unlikely that endogenous matrilysin was detected in the fraction. E-cadherin, which is a cell membrane protein, was mainly detected in the membrane fraction. Lamin and enolase, which are nuclear membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, were mainly detected in the nucleus-rich and cytoplasm fractions, respectively, as expected. These results suggest that exogenously added active matrilysin bound to the cell surface and was fractionated into the membrane fraction. Next, we examined the marilysin-binding abilities of various cell lines, including Colo201, WiDr, DLD-1, Lovo, STKM-1, HSC-4, EJ-1, and HT1080. When these cells were incubated with active matrilysin, the binding of matrilysin to the cell surface was observed in all of the tested cell lines (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we found that matrilysin bound to the cell surface of human glioma cell line T98G, human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, and the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 (data not shown). These results suggest that the matrilysin-binding substance is ubiquitously expressed. The binding of matrilysin to the cell surface was further confirmed by immunofluorescense staining of WiDr cells after matrilysin treatment (Fig. 1C). We found that matrilysin bound to the cell surface was distributed like patches. Similar results were also observed in Colo201 cells (data not shown). We also found that matrilysin bound to the suspended cells 4–5 times more efficiently than the attached ones (data not shown). Characterization of the Matrilysin-binding Substance on Cell Membrane—Previous reports indicated that rat pro-matrilysin binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of rat uterine cells (16Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4183-4191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23Yu W.H. Woessner Jr., J.F. McNeish J.D. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To test whether the matrilysin-binding substance in WiDr cells is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan or not, we examined the effect of heparin on the binding of matrilysin to WiDr cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, heparin failed to inhibit the binding of matrilysin to the cell membrane. In contrast, two hydroxamate inhibitors, KB-8301 and TAPI-1, inhibited completely the binding of matrilysin. To examine whether the proteolytic activity of matrilysin is required for the binding of matrilysin to the cell membrane, we prepared a mutant matrilysin that has Ala-215 in place of the catalytically essential residue Glu-215 of matrilysin (E215A). We found that the E215A mutant also had the ability to bind to the surface of WiDr cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting that proteolytic activity of matrilysin is not necessary for its interaction with the cell surface. Localization of the Matrilysin-binding Substance on the Cell Surface—To identify the matrilysin-binding substance, we first attempted to solubilize cell-bound matrilysin using the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. As shown in Fig. 2A, matrilysin was partitioned into an insoluble fraction when cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. On the other hand, matrilysin was efficiently solubilized when cells were lysed at 37 °C. These results suggest that the matrilysin-binding substance is localized in distinctive microdomains such as rafts, because rafts are isolated based on their insolubility in the Triton X-100-containing buffer at 4 °C. Localization of the matrilysin-binding substance in the lipid rafts was further examined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, which separates detergent-resistant membranes from the bulk of cellular membranes and cytosolic proteins (Fig. 2B). The matrilysin-binding activity was detected in low density fractions of the sucrose gradient (fractions 3–5). In general, these fractions contain raft-associated proteins and/or caveolins. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored PLAP, which is known to be located in raft, was indeed detected in the low density fractions (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Therefore, it is likely that the matrilysin-binding substance is localized in rafts or caveolae on the cell surface. β-CD is a cyclic heptasaccharide consisting of β(1–4)-glucopyranose units that stimulate efflux of cholesterol from the cell membrane. Rafts are tightly packed, ordered membrane microdomains that are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol (24Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus"

https://openalex.org/W2101248722,"We compared the biochemical properties of a wild type recombinant normal human cellular prion protein, rPrPc, with a recombinant mutant human prion protein that has three additional octapeptide repeats, rPrP8OR. Monoclonal antibodies that are specific for the N terminus of rPrPc react much better with rPrP8OR than rPrPc, suggesting that the N terminus of rPrP8OR is more exposed and hence more available for antibody binding. The N terminus of PrPc contains a glycosaminoglycan binding motif. Accordingly, rPrP8OR also binds more glycosaminoglycan than rPrPc. In addition, the divalent cation copper modulates the conformations of rPrPc and rPrP8OR differently. When compared with rPrPc, rPrP8OR is also more susceptible to oxidative damage. Furthermore, the abnormalities associated with rPrP8OR are recapitulated, but even more profoundly, in another insertion mutant, which has five extra octapeptide repeats, rPrP10OR. Therefore, insertion mutants appear to share common features, and the degree of abnormality is proportional to the number of insertions. Any of these anomalies may contribute to the pathogenesis of inherited human prion disease.

All prion diseases are believed to share the same pathogenic mechanism based on the conversion of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) 2The abbreviations used are: PrPc, cellular prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, the infectious and pathogenic scrapie PrP; rPrPc, recombinant wild type PrP; rPrP8OR, recombinant PrP with 8 octapeptide insertions; rPrP10OR, recombinant PrP with 10 octapeptide insertions; rPrPΔ23–35, recombinant PrP with deletions of residues 23–35; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 2The abbreviations used are: PrPc, cellular prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, the infectious and pathogenic scrapie PrP; rPrPc, recombinant wild type PrP; rPrP8OR, recombinant PrP with 8 octapeptide insertions; rPrP10OR, recombinant PrP with 10 octapeptide insertions; rPrPΔ23–35, recombinant PrP with deletions of residues 23–35; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin. into the infectious and pathogenic scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) (1Prusiner S.B.

Approximately, 10–15% of human prion disease is caused by mutations in the coding region of the germ line prion gene, PRNP. The mechanisms by which a mutant prion protein (PrP) causes neurodegeneration are not completely understood. It is thought that the mutant protein is inherently unstable leading to self-association to produce an oligomeric structure (5Griffith J.S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1043-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 6Huang Z. Prusiner S.B. Cohen F.E. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 207: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar). This structure acts as a “seed” recruiting additional mutant PrP, eventually leading to the formation of PrPSc. The accumulation of PrPSc in the central nervous system is then thought to impair function, induce structural damage, and cause disease. At least 20 different pathogenic mutations in the human PRNP gene have been identified (7Prusiner S.B. Science. 1997; 278: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These are either insertional or point mutations. Insertion mutation occurs solely in the octapeptide repeat region, which is involved in the binding of divalent cations such as copper and zinc. Human PrPc has five octapeptide repeats. In pathogenic mutations, the number of additional octapeptide repeats ranges from one to nine (8Owen F. Poulter M. Lofthouse R. Collinge J. Crow T.J. Risby D.

A transgenic mouse line with nine additional octapeptide repeats spontaneously develops neurodegeneration but does not produce infectious PrPSc (10Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A.

Although it is clear that mutation in the prion gene causes human prion diseases, very little is known about the mechanisms by which the mutant protein causes disease. Prion proteins with pathogenic mutations may cause disease because of gain of toxic functions, loss of normal physiologic functions, or both. Recently, we identified a novel insertion mutation in a Chinese family, whose PRNP has three additional octapeptide repeats (12Yu S.L. Jin L. Sy M.S. Mei F.H. Kang S.L. Sun G.H. Tien P. Wang F.S. Xiao G.F. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 12: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Subsequently, another family with the identical mutation was identified in Europe (13Grasbon-Frodl E. Schmalzbauer R. Weber P. Krebs B. Windl O. Zerr I. Kretzschmar H.A. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 249-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we report studies comparing the conformation of insertion mutant recombinant protein with wild type recombinant protein using a panel of well characterized anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies. We also studied the effects of the mutation on binding to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and copper, two known ligands of PrPc, as well as susceptibility to oxidative insults. Finally, we investigated whether our findings with the three extra octapeptide repeat mutant proteins are applicable to another insertion mutant protein with five extra octapeptide repeats. Plasmid Constructions—The human wild type rPrPc cDNA gene corresponding to the putative mature fragment (23–231) and the human pathogenic mutant rPrP8OR with three extra octapeptide repeats encoding residues (23–255) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human genomic DNA templates (12Yu S.L. Jin L. Sy M.S. Mei F.H. Kang S.L. Sun G.H. Tien P. Wang F.S. Xiao G.F. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 12: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The primers were 5′-ATCCATATGAAGAAGCGCCCGAAGCCTG-3′ (forward sequence) and 5′-ACCGGAATTCCTAGCTCGATCCTCTCTGG-3′ (reverse sequence). The PCR product was cloned between restriction sites NdeI and EcoRI of the vector pET42(+) (Novagen) termed pET-rPrPc and pET-rPrP8OR. A similar procedure was also carried out to obtain pET-rPrP10OR, which contains five extra octapeptide repeats, using the human prion insertion mutant DNA template (14Chen S.G. Parchi P. Brown P. Capellari S. Zou W. Cochran E.J. Vnencak-Jones C.L. Julien J. Vital C. Mikol J. Lugaresi E. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gambetti P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A deletion mutant of rPrPc, which lacks the N-terminal GAG binding motif (residues 23–35) (15Pan T. Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), designated as rPrPΔ23–35 was constructed from pET-rPrPc using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit. Primers were 5′-TACATATGGGCAGCCGATACCC-3′ (forward sequence) and 5′-CGGGTATCGGCTGCCCATATGTATATCTCC-3′ (reverse sequence). The insertion sequences were verified by using an Applied Biosystems 373A automated sequencer. Generation and Purification of Recombinant Human rPrPC, rPrP8OR, and rPrP10OR—The purification and refolding process was carried out on a nickel ion-charged Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Yin S.M. Zheng Y. Tien P. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 32: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly transformed Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) containing the plasmid pET-rPrPc or pET-rPrP8OR was transferred to 1 liter of Luria broth (LB) medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the A600 reached 1.0 and induced overnight with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated at 21 °C for 2 h before further lysis by sonication. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein pellets were extensively washed using 1% Triton X-100 and then resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m urea, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The inclusion bodies were purified and refolded on a nickel ion-charged Sepharose column by decreasing urea gradient concentrations. rPrP was eluted by 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0) followed by dialysis against PBS (pH 7.4). A similar procedure was used to obtain rPrP10OR and rPrPΔ23–35. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Antibodies—Nine affinity-purified anti-PrP mAbs were used in this study (17Li R. Liu T. Wong B.S. Pan T. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. O'Rourke K. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Sy M.S. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 8812-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). mAb 8B4 recognizes an epitope at residues 35–45; 5B2 recognizes residues 34–52; SAF32 reacts with residues 63–94 covering the octapeptide repeat sequences (19Feraudet C. Morel N. Simon S. Volland H. Frobert Y. Creminon C. Vilette D. Lehmann S. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11247-11258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); 7A12 interacts with helix A between residues 143–155; 7H6 recognizes residues 130–140; 11G5 reacts with residues 115–130 covering β-sheet 1; 2C2 reacts with residues 153–165 covering β-sheet 2; 8H4 recognizes residues 175–185 of helix B; and 8F9 reacts with residues 220–231. mAbs 8B4, 5B2, SAF32, 7A12, 2C2, 8H4, and 8F9 are IgG1, whereas mAbs 11G5 and 7H6 are IgG2b. Biotinylation of mAbs was performed using the EZ-linked sulfo-NHS-biotin kit (Pierce Endogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—For SDS-PAGE, samples were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer (160 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8), heated for 10 min at 95 °C, and then loaded onto SDS-polyacryl-amide gels (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, 12% SDS-PAGE slabs were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted as described (20Pan T. Colucci M. Wong B.S. Li R. Liu T. Petersen R.B. Chen S. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37284-37288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transferred rPrP was detected using anti-PrP mAbs in combination with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific antibody as the secondary antibody. rPrP visualization was performed using the chemiluminescence blotting system (Roche Applied Science). Capture ELISA—Capture antibody (8H4 or 11G5) was coated at 50 ng/well in flat-bottomed, 96-well Costar plates (Corning) overnight at 4 °C. Excess antibody was removed, and wells were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% BSA (Sigma) for 3 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and recombinant human rPrPc, rPrP8OR, or rPrP10OR (1 μg/ml) in PBS was added in triplicate to respective wells overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T, and appropriate dilutions of biotinylated mAbs were added to designated wells for further 6 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS-T, and HRP-conjugated streptavidin at 1:10,000 was added for 1 h. ELISA plates were washed twice with PBS-T before adding the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate at 0.5 mg/ml. ELISA plates were read at 405 nm on a Beckman Coulter AD340 micro-ELISA plate reader. To study the effects of divalent copper on the mAb binding profiles to rPrPc or rPrP8OR, ELISA plates were coated overnight with 50 ng/well mAb 8H4, and unbound sites were blocked using 3% BSA. After washing three times, rPrPc or rPrP8OR (1 μg/ml) was added for 6 h. Plates were washed three times, and different concentrations of CuSO4 were added for overnight incubation at room temperature with gentle agitation (21Wong B.S. Li R. Sassoon J. Kang S.C. Liu T. Pan T. Greenspan N.S. Wisniewski T. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The plates were washed with PBS-T, and biotinylated SAF32, 11G5, 2C2, or 7A12 (0.1 μg/ml) was added for 6 h. After extensive washing, HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added for reading at 405 nm. Antibody binding is given as a percentage of the increased binding signal compared with untreated sample. Detection of rPrP Binding to GAG—GAG binding experiments were performed as described previously (15Pan T. Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, chondroitin sulfate (from bovine trachea), heparin sulfate (from porcine intestinal mucosa), and heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa) (all from Sigma) were coated on plates at 10 μg/well at 4 °C overnight and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 3 h. Plates coated with BSA were used as controls. Appropriate dilutions of rPrPc, rPrP8OR, and rPrP10OR were incubated with the coated plates for 2 h. After three washes with PBS-T, bound rPrP was detected with mAb 8H4. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Detection of Carbonyl Groups on rPrP—Protein oxidation was measured by assaying carbonyl groups on proteins using the OxyBlot® protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) as described (22Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Pan T. Petersen R.B. Smith M.A. Gambetti P. Perry G. Manson J.C. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To produce oxidative damages, equal amounts of rPrPc, rPrP8OR, or rPrP10OR (1 μg) was incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were then derivatized to 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP) by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH) at room temperature for 30 min before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electrotransferred, probed with a rabbit antiserum against DNP-modified carbonyl groups, and visualized using the chemiluminescence blotting system (Roche Applied Science). No immunoreactivity was detected in non-DNPH-modified samples. Characterization of Recombinant Wild Type Prion Protein (rPrPC) and Mutant Prion Protein (rPrP8OR)—We analyzed the two recombinant proteins by SDS-PAGE under either non-reducing or reducing conditions. In both conditions, rPrPc appears as a single band with a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa, which is the expected molecular mass of full-length rPrPc protein. rPrP8OR also appears as a single band but migrates a bit slower, with a molecular mass of 25 kDa, reflecting the addition of 24 amino acids in the octapeptide repeat region (Fig. 1A). Neither rPrPc nor rPrP8OR preparation contains larger molecular species. To further characterize the two recombinant proteins, we immunoblotted them with three different anti-PrP mAbs. The binding epitopes of these mAbs are presented diagrammatically in Fig. 1B. The three mAbs, 8B4 (residues 35–45), 8H4 (residues 175–185), and 8F9 (residues 220–231), reacted equally with rPrPc and rPrP8OR (Fig. 1C). Conformational Differences between rPrPC and rPrP8OR; N terminus of rPrP8OR Is More Available for mAb Binding—We next studied the conformations of rPrPc and rPrP8OR by comparing their mAb binding profiles, using a panel of mAbs in a capture ELISA format (Fig. 2). mAb 8H4 (Fig. 2, A–G) or mAb 11G5 (Fig. 2H) was immobilized on ELISA plates to capture either rPrPc or rPrP8OR. Biotinylated anti-PrP mAbs with dissimilar specificities were then added in different concentrations to react with the captured proteins. Two biotinylated mAbs, 8B4 and 5B2, with epitopes at the N terminus reacted much stronger with rPrP8OR than rPrPc (Fig. 2, A and B). mAb SAF32 reacts with an epitope within the octapeptide repeat region. At lower concentrations, biotinylated SAF32 reacted stronger with rPrPc than rPrP8OR (Fig. 2C). Five other biotinylated mAbs, 7A12, 7H6, 11G5, 2C2, and 8H4, which react with epitopes in either the central region or the C terminus, reacted similarly with rPrPc and rPrP8OR (Fig. 2, D, E, F, G, and H, respectively). Overall, these results suggest that the N terminus of rPrP8OR is more exposed and thus more available for binding of N terminus-specific mAbs. The addition of three octapeptide repeats also altered the conformation of the octapeptide repeat region but in a more subtle way. Binding of rPrPc and rPrP8OR to GAGs—All mammalian PrPc contains a GAG binding motif, KKRPK, the first five aminoacids at the N terminus (15Pan T. Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). If the N terminus of rPrP8OR is more exposed, it should bind better to GAG. To test this hypothesis, ELISA plates were coated with three different GAGs: chondroitin sulfate B (Fig. 3A), heparin sulfate (Fig. 3B), and heparin (Fig. 3C). After extensive washing, different amounts of rPrPc, rPrP8OR, or a deletion mutant protein, rPrPΔ23–35 lacking the N-terminal GAG binding motif, were added. mAb 8H4 was then used to detect bound proteins. It is clear that rPrP8OR binds the three GAGs much better than rPrPc. On the other hand, rPrPΔ23–35, which lacks the KKRPK motif, failed to bind any of the GAGs (Fig. 3). These results provide additional support for our conclusion that the N terminus of rPrP8OR is more exposed and thus more available for ligand binding. Furthermore, these results provide conclusive evidence that the N terminus of PrPc contains the predominant GAG binding motif. Cu2+ Has Different Effects on the Conformations of rPrPC and rPrP8OR—Addition of Cu2+ increases the binding of mAbs 11G5 and 2C2 to brain-derived mouse PrPc suggesting that binding of Cu2+ results in conformational changes in PrPc (21Wong B.S. Li R. Sassoon J. Kang S.C. Liu T. Pan T. Greenspan N.S. Wisniewski T. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether Cu2+ also alters the binding profiles of these mAbs to rPrPc and rPrP8OR (Fig. 4). Similar to our findings with native, brain-derived mouse PrPc, the addition of Cu2+ also significantly increased the binding of mAbs 11G5 and mAb 2C2 (Fig. 4, B and C) but not the binding of mAb SAF32 or mAb 7A12 to rPrPc (Fig. 4, A and D). In contrast, adding Cu2+ did not increase the binding of mAb 11G5 or mAb 2C2 to rPrP8OR (Fig. 4, B and C). We next investigated whether Cu2+ also influences the conformation of the N terminus. In the presence of Cu2+, rPrPc but not rPrP8OR binds more mAb 8B4 and GAG in a Cu2+ concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, E and F). These results suggest that Cu2+ affects the conformation of rPrPc and rPrP8OR differently. rPrP8OR Is More Susceptible to Oxidative Damage—Protein oxidation results in the generation of carbonyl groups that can be chemically modified with DNPH. The degree of DNPH modification correlates with the level of protein oxidation (23Chevion M. Berenshtein E. Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33 (suppl.): S99-S108PubMed Google Scholar). Histidine residues in rPrPc are highly susceptible to oxidation (24Requena J.R. Groth D. Legname G. Stadtman E.R. Prusiner S.B. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7170-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the additional histidine residues in the octapeptide repeat region of rPrP8OR may render the mutant protein more susceptible to oxidation. We determined whether rPrP8OR is indeed more prone to oxidation. Equal amounts of rPrPc and rPrP8OR were modified with DNPH, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with an anti-DNP antibody (22Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Pan T. Petersen R.B. Smith M.A. Gambetti P. Perry G. Manson J.C. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Anti-DNP immunoreactivity was detected only on rPrP8OR but not on rPrPc (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 5). Therefore, rPrP8OR contains carbonyl groups, which are signatures of prior protein oxidation. We next investigated whether rPrP8OR is also more susceptible to the oxidation agent, H2O2. Equal amounts of rPrPc or rPrP8OR was incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 ranging from 1 to 100 μm and subjected to DNPH modification. Subsequently, each sample was divided into three aliquots: one was immunoblotted with anti-DNP antibody; one was immunoblotted with anti-PrP mAb 8B4; and the third one was immunoblotted with anti-PrP mAb 7A12. DNP immunoreactivity was detected only on rPrP8OR and in an H2O2 concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A, lanes 6–8). All samples reacted equally with anti-PrP mAbs 7A12 and 8B4 indicating that they had comparable amounts of protein (Fig. 5, B and C). Selective Modification of the N terminus by High Concentrations of H2O2—In subsequent experiments, we found that mAb 8B4 was unable to bind rPrP8OR when rPrP8OR was exposed to very high concentrations of H2O2 (such as 1 m) (Fig. 6A). Under identical conditions, the epitopes of mAbs 7A12 and 8F9, which were located at the central region and the C terminus respectively, remained intact (Fig. 6, B and C). Similar treatment did not alter the binding of mAb 8B4 to rPrPc (Fig. 6A). These results are consistent with our interpretation that the N terminus of rPrP8OR is more exposed and thus is more susceptible to oxidation. Findings with rPrP8OR Are Applicable to rPrP10OR—We next sought to determine whether some of the aberrant features found in rPrP8OR are applicable to another insertion mutant protein that has five extra octapeptide repeats, rPrP10OR. When immunoblotted with mAb 8B4, rPrP10OR migrates a bit slower than rPrP8OR, reflecting the addition of more octapeptide repeats (Fig. 7A). Similar to rPrP8OR, rPrP10OR also reacts more strongly with N terminus specific mAb 8B4 in captured ELISA (Fig. 7B), binds more GAG (Fig. 7C), and is more susceptible to oxidative damage (Fig. 7D). In all cases, the levels of abnormality are more profound in rPrP10OR than in rPrP8OR. At 1 mm H2O2, aggregates with higher molecular masses were detected in rPrP10OR but not in rPrP8OR suggesting that aggregate formation may depend on the number of octapeptide inserts. Collectively, these findings suggest that all prion proteins with insertion mutations share common features, and the degrees of abnormality are proportional to the number of insertions. In this study, we describe four new findings on the biochemical properties of a recombinant human prion protein with three extra octapeptide repeats, rPrP8OR. The mutant protein shows the following aberrant features: 1) its N terminus is more exposed; 2) it binds better to GAG; 3) it behaves differently after binding to Cu2+; and 4) it is more susceptible to oxidative attack. Importantly, some of the aberrant properties associated with rPrP8OR are also observed in another insertion mutant prion protein with five extra repeats, rPrP10OR, and the aberrations are even more profound in rPrP10OR. NMR analyses of rPrPc at pH 4.5 and 5.5 show that the N terminus is highly flexible and unstructured; in contrast, the C-terminal region has a well structured globular domain (25Zahn R. Liu A. Luhrs T. Riek R. von Schroetter C. Lopez Garcia F. Billeter M. Calzolai L. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The finding that half of PrPc lacks considerable secondary and tertiary structure is unusual and intriguing. Earlier transgenic mouse studies suggested that the N terminus of PrPc is not required for pathogenesis (27Fischer M. Rulicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies suggest that the N terminus of PrPc is important in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. The N terminus modifies disease phenotypes (28Zanusso G. Farinazzo A. Prelli F. Fiorini M. Gelati M. Ferrari S. Righetti P.G. Rizzuto N. Frangione B. Monaco S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38936-38942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and influences the conformations of protease-resistant PrPSc generated in vivo and in vitro (29Lawson V.A.

Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2154-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the N terminus of PrP is structured if the studies are carried out at pH values between 6.5 and 7.8, i.e. the pH at cell membrane (32Zahn R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, the roles the N terminus plays in the pathogenesis of prion diseases are complex and not completely understood. Our finding that the N termini of rPrP8OR and rPrP10OR are more available for mAb 8B4 binding suggests that the octapeptide repeat region of PrPc also influences the conformation of the N terminus. Furthermore, the effect is proportional to the number of insertions; the longer the insertion, the greater the effect. Insertion of three extra octapeptide repeats definitely alters the conformation of the octapeptide repeat region. The epitope for mAb SAF32 resides between amino acid residues 63 and 94 (19Feraudet C. Morel N. Simon S. Volland H. Frobert Y. Creminon C. Vilette D. Lehmann S. Grassi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11247-11258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). When the concentration of SAF32 is limiting, SAF32 binds much less rPrP8OR than rPrPc. This result suggests that binding of SAF32 is a cooperative phenomenon. There is more than one SAF32 binding site within the octapeptide repeat region; binding of one SAF32 may alter the conformation of the PrP molecule, allowing additional SAF32 to bind more readily. By using synthetic peptides, we reported that the first five amino acids, KKRPK, at the N terminus of PrPc are essential for binding of GAG (15Pan T. Wong B.S. Liu T. Li R. Petersen R.B. Sy M.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, other investigators using recombinant protein fragments have reported that there are additional GAG binding motifs; fragments containing residues 53–93 or 110–128 also bind GAG (33Warner R.G. Hundt C. Weiss S. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18421-18430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34Gonzalez-Iglesias R. Pajares M.A. Ocal C. Espinosa J.C. Oesch B. Gasset M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We found that when the first 12 amino acids of the N terminus are deleted, the recombinant protein is no longer able to bind GAG. Therefore, the N-terminal end that contains the KKRPK motif is the predominant GAG binding site on PrPc. The reason that rPrP8OR and rPrP10OR bind GAG better is because the N termini of these two proteins are more exposed and thus more available for GAG binding. We propose a model in which the octapeptide repeat region is the “neck” of PrPc.As the length of this region increases, the N-terminal “head” increasingly protracts from the C-terminal globular domain, rendering it more available for ligand binding. Whether binding of PrPc to GAG is important in prion disease is not known. PrPSc particles in vivo contain GAG (35Snow A.D. Kisilevsky R. Willmer J. Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Acta Neuropathol. 1989; 77: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vitro, GAG facilitates the conversion of PrPc to PrPSc (36Wong C. Xiong L.W. Horiuchi M. Raymond L. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. Caughey B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cell surface GAG has also been reported to be the receptor for PrPSc (37Hijazi N. Kariv-Inbal Z. Gasset M. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17057-17061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). GAG may function as a scaffold for concentrating PrPc, creating a reservoir of PrPc for conversion. Because rPrP8OR and rPrP10OR bind GAG better, they will be more prone to be concentrated in the scaffold. Our findings with recombinant prion proteins may have implications for pathogenesis. It has been reported that patients with more octapeptide repeats have earlier disease onset and shorter disease duration (9Croes E.A. Theuns J. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Dermaut B. Sleegers K. Roks G. Van den Broeck M. van Harten B. van Swieten J.C. Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. van Duijn C.M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2004; 75: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, by using the N terminus-specific mAb 8B4, we found that the amounts of full-length PrP species are greatly increased in the brain of patients as well as in mice with prion diseases (38Pan T. Wong P. Chang B. Li C. Li R. Kang S.C. Wisniewski T. Sy M.S. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 934-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Presumably, these full-length PrP species are able to bind GAG. The octapeptide repeat region of PrPc binds divalent cations such as Cu2+ and Zn2+ (39Bonomo R.P. Imperllizzeri G. Pappalardo G. Rizzarelli E. Tabbi G. Chemistry. 2000; 6: 4195-4202Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 40Brown L.R. Harris D.A. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, whether such interactions are important in the pathogenesis of prion disease is not clear. We reported earlier that binding of Cu2+ to native mouse rPrPc changes the binding profiles of two anti-PrP mAbs, 11G5 and 2C2, which react with epitopes that are downstream of the octapeptide repeat region (21Wong B.S. Li R. Sassoon J. Kang S.C. Liu T. Pan T. Greenspan N.S. Wisniewski T. Brown D.R. Sy M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we provided new evidence that binding of Cu2+ to rPrPc also alters the conformation of the N terminus, rendering the N terminus more available for antibody and GAG binding. However, these changes do not occur when Cu2+ binds to rPrP8OR. Although the physiologic significance of these findings is not clear, it is obvious that this modulation is non-operational in rPrP8OR. The failure to modulate the conformation of the PrP molecule is not because rPrP8OR binds more Cu2+ than rPrPc. Irrespective of the number of octapeptide repeats, the maximum number of Cu2+-ions a PrP molecule binds is five. 3D. Brown, personal communication. Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance in the levels of reactive oxygen species, which are the byproducts of normal cellular metabolism (41Andreyev A.Y. Kushnareva Y. Starkov A.A. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2005; 70: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress causes modification of amino acids and fragmentation and/or aggregation of proteins, eventually leading to cell death. The brain is very sensitive to reactive oxygen species because of the amount of oxygen it consumes. Oxidative stress has been speculated to play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases such as prion diseases and Alzheimer disease (42Kim J.I. Choi S.I. Kim N.H. Jin J.K. Choi E.K. Carp R.I. Kim Y.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whether PrPc is directly involved in regulating reactive oxygen species remains controversial (43Hutter G. Heppner F.L. Aguzzi A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1279-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that both rPrP8OR and rPrP10OR are more prone to oxidative damages. An increase in oxidative damage can be observed with 1 μm H2O2, a level that is physiologically relevant (44Hyslop P.A. Zhang Z. Pearson D.V. Phebus L.A. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress cross-links amino acids, resulting in aggregation of proteins (45Nagano S. Huang X. Moir R.D. Payton S.M. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14673-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). When incubated with 1 mm H2O2, rPrP10OR but not rPrP8OR begins to form aggregates of various sizes. Therefore, a minimum number of octapeptide repeats is required for aggregate formation under these conditions. The increase in the number of histidine residues within the octapeptide repeat region is the most likely explanation why rPrP8OR and rPrP10OR are more susceptible to oxidative attack. The epitope of mAb 8B4 is no longer available for antibody binding when rPrP8OR is incubated in 1 m H2O2, a level that is most likely unfeasible in vivo. Nevertheless, this phenomenon occurs only with rPrP8OR and mAb 8B4 epitope. Identical treatment does not alter the binding of either mAb 7A12 or 8F9 to rPrP8OR or the binding of mAb 8B4 to rPrPc. The reasons that mAb 8B4 fails to bind rPrP8OR under this condition may be: the N terminus of rPrP8OR is truncated; the amino acid residues within the mAb 8B4 epitope have been altered; or the mAb 8B4 epitope is buried because of conformational changes in other regions of the molecule. It is unlikely that the phenomenon is caused by N-terminal truncation because we did not observe a reduction in the molecular mass of rPrP8OR after incubation with 1 m H2O2 and immunoblotting with mAb 7A12 or 8F9. On the other hand, the mAb 8B4 epitope includes amino acid residues RYPGQGSPG (18Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C. Brown P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8812-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Other than cysteine and methionine, the amino acids that are most susceptible to oxidation include histidine, arginine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and glutamine (46Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). We speculated that because the N terminus of rPrP8OR is more exposed, it would be more susceptible to oxidative modification. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the failure of mAb 8B4 to bind to rPrP8OR is caused by conformational changes in the other regions of the molecule, resulting in sequestration of the epitope. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that an increase in the number of octapeptide repeats renders the PrP molecule more susceptible to oxidative attack and that conformational changes at the N terminus enhance the binding of mutant PrP to GAG, which further promotes PrP aggregation. Because these aberrant features are proportional to the number of the insertions, our findings provide a biochemical explanation for the observation that patients with more octapeptide repeat insertions have earlier disease onset and shorter disease duration (9Croes E.A. Theuns J. Houwing-Duistermaat J.J. Dermaut B. Sleegers K. Roks G. Van den Broeck M. van Harten B. van Swieten J.C. Cruts M. Van Broeckhoven C. van Duijn C.M. J. Neurol. Neurosurg.

MarA functions as an activator or repressor of transcription utilizing similar degenerate DNA sequences (marboxes) with three different binding site configurations with respect to the RNA polymerase-binding sites. We demonstrate that MarA down-regulates rob transcripts both in vivo and in vitro via a MarA-binding site within the rob promoter that is positioned between the –10 and –35 hexamers. As for the hdeA and purA promoters, which are repressed by MarA, the rob marbox is also in the “backward” orientation. Protein-DNA interactions show that SoxS and Rob, like MarA, bind the same marbox in the rob promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses with a MarA-specific antibody demonstrate that MarA and RNA polymerase form a ternary complex with the rob promoter DNA. Transcription experiments in vitro and potassium permanganate footprinting analysis show that MarA affects the RNA polymerase-mediated closed to open complex formation at the rob promoter.

Transcription experiments in vitro and potassium permanganate footprinting analysis show that MarA affects the RNA polymerase-mediated closed to open complex formation at the rob promoter. The Rob protein is an abundant nucleoid protein that was initially discovered bound to the right origin of replication of the Escherichia coli chromosome (1Skarstad K. Thony B. Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5365-5370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its association with the origin of replication, no experimental evidence supports the role of Rob in chromosome replication, chromatin structure, and superhelicity (2Azam T.A. Hiraga S. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Rob is, however, a member of a subgroup within the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators, which includes the MarA and SoxS proteins that are involved in a wide range of regulatory functions (3Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Rob shares similarity with MarA and SoxS, which is in contrast to the other members of the subgroup that share homology within the C-terminal domain (3Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When induced by bile salts and dipyridyl, the C-terminal domain undergoes post-transcriptional modification that results in the conversion of Rob from a low to a high activity state in the cell (4Rosner J.L. Dangi B. Gronenborn A.M. Martin R.G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of these compounds, overexpression of either the full or C-terminal domain deleted protein is sufficient for activity and promoter binding in vitro (5Ariza R.R. Li Z. Ringstad N. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jair K.W. Yu X. Skarstad K. Thony B. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2507-2513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (5Ariza R.R. Li Z. Ringstad N. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakajima H. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi M. Asako H. Aono R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2302-2307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with structural data derived from the Rob-micF complex, where only the N-terminal domain makes DNA-specific contacts (8Kwon H.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Overexpression of rob confers multidrug, organic solvent and heavy metal resistance (6Jair K.W. Yu X. Skarstad K. Thony B. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2507-2513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakajima H. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi M. Asako H. Aono R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2302-2307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in accord, some experimental data indicate that rob null mutants are hypersensitive to antibiotics, organic solvents, and heavy metals (5Ariza R.R. Li Z. Ringstad N. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nakajima H. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi M. Asako H. Aono R. Appl. Environ.

Transposon mutagenesis experiments aimed at defining the Rob regulon revealed eight Rob-regulated targets, namely inaA, marRAB, aslB, ybaO, mdlA, yfhD, ybiS, and galT (10Bennik M.H. Pomposiello P.J. Thorne D.F. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3794-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), some of which are also known members of the mar and sox regulons (11Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, studies demonstrate that Rob induced by decanoate or bile salts results in the increased expression of acrAB in the absence of both the mar and sox loci (12Rosenberg E.Y. Bertenthal D. Nilles M.L. Bertrand K.P. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The expression levels of rob do not vary dramatically during different growth phases, unlike other nucleoid-associated proteins (e.g. Fis) (2Azam T.A. Hiraga S. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Ali Azam T. Iwata A. Nishimura A. Ueda S. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is, however, some evidence that increased rob expression occurs in glucose- and phosphate-limited media and in the stationary phase of cell growth, attributable to activation by the σ factor rpoS (13Kakeda M. Ueguchi C. Yamada H. Mizuno T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have shown that rob is subject to down-regulation by MarA and SoxS (11Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 15Michan C. Manchado M. Pueyo C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that all three transcriptional factors (MarA, SoxS, and Rob) regulate the expression of themselves (16Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Li Z. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7492-7494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martin R.G. Jair K.W. Wolf Jr., R.E. Rosner J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2216-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and each other (15Michan C. Manchado M. Pueyo C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Li Z. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7492-7494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martin R.G.

Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1773-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This cross- and auto-regulation strongly suggest the presence of putative binding sites within the mar, sox, and rob promoters. Thus far, only the MarA/SoxS/Rob-binding site within the mar promoter has been identified and shown to be responsible for activation by all three transcription factors (17Martin R.G. Jair K.W. Wolf Jr., R.E. Rosner J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2216-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, the repression of both soxS and rob by SoxS, Rob, or MarA occurs via a yet to be identified binding site(s) within the sox and rob promoter regions (15Michan C. Manchado M. Pueyo C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Li Z. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7492-7494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive genetic and crystallographic analyses have shown that the interaction of MarA/SoxS/Rob with activated promoters involves a degenerate DNA sequence known as the “marbox/soxbox” (3Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These binding sites are asymmetric and exist in two possible orientations (class I and II promoters) (3Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with respect to the RNA polymerase-binding sites. Generally at class I promoters, the marbox lies upstream of the –35 hexamer in the backward orientation with the exception of the zwf promoter (19Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and at the class II promoters the marbox overlaps the RNA polymerase-binding site and lies in the forward orientation (19Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Direct transcriptional repression by MarA has been linked more recently to a similar degenerate marbox that lies in the “backward” orientation with partial or complete overlap of the –35 hexamer (20Schneiders T. Barbosa T.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9037-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This configuration is unlike that of either the class I or class II marboxes necessary for activation (19Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized the MarA-binding site within the rob promoter in relation to the RNA polymerase-binding sites and have studied the mechanism of MarA-mediated transcriptional repression. Down-regulation of rob mediated by MarA (and also SoxS and Rob) adds to the regulatory cross-talk already reported (15Michan C. Manchado M. Pueyo C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4733-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Nunoshiba T. Hidalgo E. Li Z. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7492-7494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Martin R.G.

This PCR product was purified using the Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany) prior to cloning into the pGEMT vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The presence of inserts was verified by digesting with the restriction enzymes NdeI and NcoI (New England Biolabs). Plasmids containing the inserts were subsequently sequenced at the Tufts University Core Facility, and the junction between the C-tail and the start of the rob gene promoter sequence was taken to be the transcriptional start site. Transcription Studies in Vitro with MarA, SoxS, and Rob—Transcription experiments in vitro were carried out as described previously (20Schneiders T. Barbosa T.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7100-7104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany). The location of the marbox was determined using DNA fragments that consisted of sequential truncations of the rob promoter region and/or selective mutations (see Fig. 2). The mechanism of repression was examined by preincubation experiments with either purified MarA (Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Boston; see Fig. 3A) or RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme (Epicenter, Madison, WI). Briefly, each protein (RNAP or MarA) was preincubated for 5 min at 0 or 37 °C before the addition of the second protein. Following a further 10 min of incubation, the initiating nucleotide mixture with heparin was added and allowed to proceed for another 5 min. The effect of MarA on blocking reinitiation by RNA polymerase in vitro at the rob promoter was assessed by multiple-round transcription experiments. The DNA fragment (2 nm) was initially incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of RNA polymerase (40 nm) to allow for open complex formation. This was followed by the addition of 200 nm MarA and incubation at 37 °C for a further 5 min. The levels of transcription were assessed by adding initiating nucleotide mixture without heparin and allowed to proceed for different times (shown in Fig. 6B). The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of Gel Loading Buffer II (Ambion). The products were separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea denaturing gel and visualized after exposure to a phosphorimaging screen. The quantification of the levels of repression was determined as described previously (20Schneiders T. Barbosa T.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Biol.

The rob promoter fragment (pRobF4) was incubated with RNA polymerase (40 nm) at either 0 (lanes 1–4) or 37°C (lanes 5–8) for 5 min before the addition of increasing concentrations of MarA (100–800 nm) and transfer to 37 °C for a further 10 min before the addition of initiating nucleotides.

The transcription mix was added at time 0, and the reaction was terminated after the different times indicated above the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophoretic Mobility Assays (EMSA)—EMSA experiments were performed with the wild type, truncated, and mutated rob promoter fragments. To define the marbox sequence, annealed oligomers representing four sequential nonoverlapping promoter sequences of 20–21 bps each were incubated with MarA, SoxS, or Rob (Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Boston; see Fig. 3A). The promoter fragments (only the coding strands of the oligomer sequences are shown here) used were as follows: RobO1, 5′-CTAAAACATACTCTACTAAG-3′; RobO2, 5′-GAAAAAAACACTGAATGCTAA-3′; RobO3, 5′-AACAGCAAAAAATGCTATTAT-3′; and RobO4, 5′-CCAATTACCTGATGTCAGGT-3′ (see Fig. 2). The orientation of the marbox was examined using amplified PCR fragments harboring mutations within recognition elements (RE1 and RE2) of the MarA-binding site in both the forward (RbO3F6) and backward (RbF7M6, RbF7M5) marboxes (see Fig. 3 legend for mutation descriptions). The annealed oligomers and DNA fragments were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All binding reactions were performed with 32P-end-labeled DNA oligomers (2 nm), purified MarA (200–400 nm), and competitor DNA (100 mg/ml, poly[d(I-C)]). The binding reactions were performed at 25 °C for 15 min before the addition of loading buffer (0.25× TBE, 60%; glycerol, 40%). The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature for 2 h on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The formation of closed complexes was determined as described by Nechaev and Severinov (22Nechaev S. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions with MarA (200–1000 nm) and the rob promoter fragment (pRobF4) were performed at 0 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of RNAP (40 nm). Both proteins were incubated on ice for a further 10 min. For the supershift experiments, 1 μl of neat penta-His antibody (Qiagen, Germany) was added directly to the reactions, which were performed as described above. Following the addition of loading buffer, products were loaded immediately onto a 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C for 4 h. The gel was then dried and exposed for PhosphorImager analysis. Potassium Permanganate Footprinting—The footprinting experiments were performed as described previously (23Savery N. Belyaeva T. Busby S. Essential Techniques: Gene Transcription.in: Docherty K. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1996: 1-33Google Scholar). Briefly, the promoter fragment (pRobF4 at 1 × 106 dpm) and MarA (400 nm) or RNAP (40 nm) only or MarA and RNAP together were incubated in 5× binding buffer (25% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) for 15 min at 37 °C. One microliter of 200 mm potassium permanganate was added to each reaction, mixed, and incubated for a further 4 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μl of Stop solution (3 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 m 2-mercaptoethanol). After extraction with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol at –80 °C for 15 min. The pellet was then resuspended in 10% piperidine and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μl of 1 m LiCl and cold absolute ethanol. The pellet was washed in ethanol before resuspension in 5 μl of sequencing gel loading buffer (Epicenter, Madison, WI). The resulting products were then analyzed by electrophoresis in an 8% denaturing urea gel. Analysis of rob Expression Under Different Conditions—Microarray analyses have demonstrated that either salicylate induction of MarA or overexpression of MarA or SoxS results in decreased expression of rob (11Pomposiello P.J. Bennik M.H. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3890-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To confirm that the decrease in rob expression was a result of MarA expression, we analyzed the levels of the rob transcript by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-PCR under different conditions. Levels of the rob transcript were determined in a strain deleted for the marRAB locus (JHC1096 ((24Greenberg J.T. Chou J.H. Monach P.A. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4433-4439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), but which was transformed with an IPTG-inducible plasmid either with (pMB102) or without (pJPBH) marA. As expected, the levels of rob remained unaffected in the vector only control (JHC1096/pJPBH), but a decrease was observed under IPTG induction of MarA (JHC1096/pMB102) (Fig. 1). The levels of repression at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mm IPTG were 0.43, 0.28, and 0.21, respectively (all ratios were normalized to the amounts of rRNA present on the membrane; see Fig. 1). Using both Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR analyses, the salicylate induction of marA decreased levels of rob expression in AG100 to 0.67 relative to the uninduced sample (data not shown). Thus both plasmid-mediated expression and salicylate induction of MarA, directly or indirectly, reduced the levels of rob expression 2–4-fold in vivo. Identification of the Transcriptional Start Site of rob—It was necessary to map the transcriptional start site of the rob gene to determine the positions of the RNA polymerase-binding sites and subsequently the location of the MarA-binding site (marbox) relative to these signals. PCR analysis using the anchor primer (see “Materials and Methods”) and a rob gene-specific primer yielded a 180-bp product that was subsequently cloned into the pGEMT vector. Four clones were selected, sequenced, and found to harbor the same rob and dC-tailed primer junction sequence. The transcriptional start site was mapped to 43 nucleotides upstream of the open reading frame with the 5′-RACE method (Fig. 2). The experimentally defined position of the transcriptional start site is consistent with the size of the transcripts obtained in both the Northern blot and in vitro transcription experiments (see below). Based on the position of the transcriptional start site, potential –10 and –35 sequences within the rob promoter sequence could also be deduced (Fig. 2). Binding of MarA, SoxS, and Rob to the rob Promoter—MarA, SoxS, and Rob bound to the full-length rob promoter (spanning –234 to +110) (data not shown). Because previous studies have shown that the MarA-binding sites of two other repressed promoters (hdeA and purA) lie in a backward orientation (20Schneiders T. Barbosa T.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9037-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and either partially or completely overlap the –35 hexamer, we examined whether the putative rob marbox might be in a similar configuration and position. The promoter fragment pRobF5 (–55 to +110), which contains the putative marbox region, and pRobF6 (–26 to +110), which does not, were used in the initial binding experiments with MarA (see Fig. 2). Most unexpectedly, MarA bound to both fragments, indicating that the rob marbox was in a different position from those described previously (20Schneiders T. Barbosa T.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9037-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, MarA binding was tested with four pairs of nonoverlapping 20–21-bp annealed oligomers that sequentially span –67 to +15 (see Fig. 2) within the rob promoter region (Fig. 3B). The only oligomer pair (RobO3) to which MarA specifically bound corresponded to the DNA sequence between the –35 hexamer with a partial overlap of the –10 hexamer (Fig. 3B). As expected, this promoter region (spanning –27 to –7) was also bound by SoxS and Rob (Fig. 3C). We next attempted to determine the orientation of the binding site. Close analysis of the marbox sequence to which all three regulatory proteins bound showed that there were two putative marboxes, one in the forward and one in the backward orientation. The forward and the backward marbox had 17/20 (14/17) and 15/20 (12/17) matches to the revised consensus marbox sequence, respectively (A≠GRGCACRWWNNRYYAAA≠GN where ≠ indicates any base except G) (25Martin R.G. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The crucial determinants of a marbox include two 4-bp sequences known as recognition elements (RE). Mutations in RE1 (GCAC) or RE2 (CAAA) can either reduce affinity or abolish binding to MarA and SoxS (19Martin R.G. Gillette W.K. Rhee S. Rosner J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20Schneiders T. Barbosa T.M. McMurry L.M. Levy S.B"
https://openalex.org/W2103090484,"The yeast myosins I Myo3p and Myo5p have well established functions in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the endocytic uptake of the G protein-coupled receptor Ste2p. A number of results suggest that phosphorylation of the conserved TEDS serine of the myosin I motor head by the Cdc42p activated p21-activated kinases Ste20p and Cla4p is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the role of this signaling cascade in the endocytic uptake has not been investigated. Interestingly, we find that Myo5p TEDS site phosphorylation is not required for slow, constitutive endocytosis of Ste2p, but it is essential for rapid, ligand-induced internalization of the receptor. Our results strongly suggest that a kinase activates the myosins I to sustain fast endocytic uptake. Surprisingly, however, despite the fact that only p21-activated kinases are known to phosphorylate the conserved TEDS site, we find that these kinases are not essential for ligand-induced internalization of Ste2p. Our observations indicate that a different signaling cascade, involving the yeast homologues of the mammalian PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent-protein kinase-1), Phk1p and Pkh2p, and serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, Ypk1p and Ypk2p, activate Myo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function.

Myosins I constitute a well characterized and ubiquitous group of unconventional myosins, which participate in a variety of cellular processes, including endocytosis, phagocytosis, cell motility, secretion, and cell polarity (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). As other myosins, myosins I bear an N-terminal actin-activated ATPase, which can translocate actin filaments in vitro (3Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). A short positively charged tail that binds acidic phospholipids and targets the myosin to the appropriate cellular membranes follows the conserved motor domain (1Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 4Pollard T.D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The fungal and the protozoal myosins I bear an additional C-terminal extension that participates in the activation of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (6Idrissi F.Z. Wolf B. Geli M.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4074-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Evangelista M. Klebl B.M. Tong A.H. Webb B.A. Leeuw T. Leberer E. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Boone C. J.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two highly homologous genes encode myosins I: MYO3 and MYO5. Deletion of either gene does not result in any obvious phenotype, whereas, depending on the strain background, a double knock-out is lethal or very sick, suggesting functional redundancy (11Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis indicates that the yeast myosins I participate in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and in endocytosis. Cortical actin patches, which concentrate in the daughter cells in wild type budding yeast, partially redistribute to mother cells in a double myo3Δ myo5Δ null mutant generated in a permissive strain background (11Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Besides, Myo3p and Myo5p have a well established function in the ligand-induced internalization of the α-factor pheromone receptor Ste2p. Ste2p is a G protein-coupled receptor that triggers the mating response in the presence of α-factor (13Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Binding of the pheromone to its receptor accelerates its internalization and degradation rate as part of a pheromone desensitization program (14Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive myosin I mutants are blocked in their capacity to internalize radioactively labeled α-factor immediately upon a shift to restrictive temperature (11Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The endocytic α-factor uptake requires the most C-terminal domain of the myosins I, which participates in the induction of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (8Geli M.I. Lombardi R. Schmelzl B. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4281-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and it might also require its motor activity (12Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A number of results suggest that the actin-activated ATPase of the protozoal and the fungal myosins I is induced by phosphorylation of a conserved serine or threonine positioned on a surface loop that contacts the actin filament (15Redowicz M.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this residue induces a conformational change that accelerates phosphate release during ATP hydrolysis in vitro (16Ostap E.M. Lin T. Rosenfeld S.S. Tang N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12450-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The unconventional mammalian myosins VI also bear a serine or a threonine at this position, and therefore, they might also be regulated by phosphorylation (2Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Other myosins have a glutamate or an aspartate at this site, suggesting that a negative charge is required there for full myosin ATPase activity (17Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because only threonine, glutamate, aspartate, or serine is present at this position in the myosin motor domain, this site is named the TEDS site (17Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 31: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A number of results illustrate the physiological relevance of the myosin I TEDS site phosphorylation. In vivo phosphorylation of this residue has been demonstrated for the protozoal myosins I (18Baines I.C. Corigliano-Murphy A. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Gliksman N.R. Santoyo G. Novak K.D. Titus M.A. J. Biol.

Consistently, the yeast MYO3 TEDS site serine to alanine mutant (myo3-S357A) fails to complement the synthetic lethal phenotype of a double myo3Δ myo5Δ null strain (20Novak K.D. Titus M.A. Mol. Biol.

Interestingly, however, not all fungal myosin I functions require phosphorylation of this residue and/or full ATPase activity, since a TEDS site to alanine mutation in the Aspergillus nidulans MYOA only causes slight defects when compared with the null mutation (22Liu X.

Among many cellular tasks, PAKs participate in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the development of cell polarity (31Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Three genes encode PAKs expressed during vegetative growth in yeast: STE20, CLA4, and SKM1. Deletion of STE20 and CLA4 within the same cell is synthetically lethal, suggesting that they share an essential function (28Eby J.J. Holly S.P. van Drogen F. Grishin A.V. Peter M. Drubin D.G.

The cellular role of the third PAK Skm1p is still unknown (36Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Numerous results demonstrate that the yeast myosins I are targets of the Cdc42p-activated PAKs controlling actin assembly and polarization (see Ref. 37Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Cla4p and Ste20p phosphorylate the Myo3p TEDS site in vitro (21Wu C. Lytvyn V. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30623-30626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and, most strikingly, a Myo3p bearing a TEDS serine to aspartate substitution (Myo3-S357Dp) suppresses the actin depolarization defects of a cdc42-1 mutant (9Lechler T. Shevchenko A. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have investigated the role of the yeast myosin I TEDS site phosphorylation in the endocytic uptake. Interestingly, we find that myosin I phosphorylation is required for fast, ligand-induced internalization of Ste2p but not for slow, constitutive endocytosis of the receptor. Further, we show that a Myo5p mutant that mimics the TEDS site phosphorylated state significantly accelerates constitutive Ste2p internalization. Our results suggest that activation of the myosin I ATPase can control the endocytic uptake rate in yeast and that a kinase or kinases activate the myosins I to sustain fast internalization. Surprisingly, although only PAKs are known to phosphorylate the conserved myosin TEDS site, we found that sustained activity of Cdc42p and the yeast PAKs Ste20p, Cla4p, and Skm1p is dispensable for α-factor-induced Ste2p internalization. Our results suggest that a different signaling cascade that involves the yeast PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) and serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) homologues (Pkh1/2p and Ypk1/2p, respectively) activates Myo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function. Strains, Genetic Techniques, and Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Unless otherwise mentioned, strains without plasmids were grown in complete YPD medium and strains with plasmids were selected on SDC minimal medium (14Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Sporulation, tetrad dissection, and scoring of genetic markers were performed as described (38Sherman S. Fink G. Lawrence C. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was accomplished by the lithium acetate method (39Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed information about yeast strain generation is available by request. Dot spots were prepared from fresh saturated cultures. Cells were diluted to 107 cells/ml, and 5 μl of 4 × 1-10 serial dilutions were spotted on plates with the adequate solid medium. Cells were grown for 2 days at the indicated temperature. The interaction trap two-hybrid system was used (40Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Plasmids pEG202, pJG4-5, pRFHM-1, and pSH18-34 and the strain EGY48 were obtained from R. Brent (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). To measure β-galactosidase activity, EGY48 bearing the lexAop-lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 was co-transformed with the appropriate pEG202- and pJG4-5-derived plasmids and streaked out on X-gal-containing SGC-His-Trp-Ura plates.

In Vivo 32PO43- Labeling, in Vitro Kinase Assays, Protein Extracts, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblots—To determine protein expression, cells grown to log phase were harvested and glass bead-lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain). Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoblots were performed as described (44Geli M.I. Wesp A. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For in vivo 32PO43- labeling of yeast, 108 log phase cells were harvested, resuspended in low phosphate SD medium (50 μm KH2PO4) and incubated at 23 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 1 ml of low phosphate SD medium containing 1 mCi/ml radioactive 32PO43- (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Cells were harvested, and glass bead-lysed in 100 μl of IP buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm NaF, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm NaVO3, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 2 μm cyclosporin A, 0.5 μm okadaic acid). After the addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, unbroken cells and debris were removed, and Myo5p was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myo5p polyclonal serum (44Geli M.I. Wesp A. Riezman H.

Beads were recovered, and associated proteins were separated using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblot using a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10; Chemicon Hofheim). For in vitro kinase assays, a Myo5p fragment containing the wild type or the S357A mutated TEDS site fused to GST was purified from Escherichia coli BL21 bearing pGST-myo5-TEDS and pGST-myo5-TEDS-SA as described (6Idrissi F.Z. Wolf B. Geli M.I. Mol. Biol.

Beads were washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of phosphorylation buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2). Purified GST-Ypk1p or wild type or mutant GST-Ypk2p (100 ng (for experiments with [γ-32P]ATP) or 300 ng (for experiments with [γ-33P]ATP)) were added to 10 μl of GST-myo5-TEDS- or GST-myo5-TEDS-SA-coated beads in a final 20-μl volume in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-33P]ATP. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer to a final concentration of 0.8% and ATP to a final concentration of 10 mm. The resulting samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were analyzed by autoradiography. GST-Ypk1p, GST-Ypk2p, GST-Ypk2-H459Yp, and GST-Ypk2-K373Ap were purified from yeast YC123 as described (45Zhu H. Klemic J.F. Chang S. Bertone P. Casamayor A. Klemic K.G. Smith D. Gerstein M.

Fluorescence Microscopy Techniques—Phalloidin staining was performed on 4% formaldehyde-fixed cells in the presence 300 nm TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) as described (47Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Samples were visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 fluorescence microscope. For the experiments with the analogue-sensitive mutants, cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 100 μm 1NM-PP1 or mock-treated before fixation. The percentage of unpolarized cells was calculated by counting the number of small budded cells exhibiting more than two actin patches in the mother cell. More than 100 cells were examined per experiment. For staining of cells with FM4-64, SCMIG275 transformed with plasmids encoding the green fluorescent protein-tagged wild type and mutant Myo5p were grown to 107 cells/ml, harvested, resuspended in 25 μl of YPD, and incubated on ice for 15 min. FM4-64 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added to 8 μm, and cells were further incubated on ice for 15 min.

https://openalex.org/W2070663007,"We identified in breast cancer cases two germline alterations, R62H and R71W, in presenilin-2 (PS-2), a gene involved in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). The role of these alleles in FAD is unclear, but neither allele affected Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratio. However, both R62H and R71W alterations compromised PS-2 function in Notch signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans and cell growth inhibition in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and these effects were dependent on gene dosage. We found that both alterations enhanced the degradation of the PS-2 full-length protein, indicating that they may have a loss-of function effect. The effect of the R71W alteration was noticeably stronger, and we observed an almost threefold higher frequency of this allele in breast cancer cases versus controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, these results collectively suggest that the novel PS-2 alleles described here, especially R71W, affect PS-2 function and may potentially confer a moderate risk of susceptibility to breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2112104000,"In the absence of bound peptide ligands, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are unstable. In an attempt to determine the minimum requirement for peptide-dependent MHC class I stabilization, we have used short synthetic peptides derived from the Sendai virus nucleoprotein epitope (residues 324-332, 1FAPGNYPAL9) to promote its folding in vitro of H-2D(b). We found that H-2D(b) can be stabilized by the pentapeptide 5NYPAL9, which is equivalent to the C-terminal portion of the optimal nonapeptide and includes both the P5 and P9 anchor residues. We have crystallized the complex of the H-2D(b) molecule with the pentamer and determined the structure to show how a quasi-stable MHC class I molecule can be formed by occupancy of a single binding pocket in the peptide-binding groove."
https://openalex.org/W2127363445,"Tauopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD) probably involve a type of phosphorylation imbalance causing the accumulation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons and/or glias. Investigation of R406W tau mutation may provide insight into such abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation, since this mutation causes AD-like dementia and tauopathy in humans and because it has the unique ability to reduce tau phosphorylation in vitro and in cultured cells. Here we show that R406W mutation primarily disrupts tau phosphorylation at Ser404, a priming phosphorylation site of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), thereby reducing subsequent GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation at the PHF-1 site (mostly Ser396). In contrast, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as activated in the mitotic phase directly hyperphosphorylates R406W tau at the PHF-1 site. This was confirmed by PHF-1 hyperphosphorylation of R406W tau in mitotic cells, its association with cytoplasmic JNK activation, and its inhibition by a JNK inhibitor, SP600125. These data unveil the unknown mechanisms of physiological tau phosphorylation at the PHF-1 site and suggest that cytoplasmic JNK activation may play an important role in the abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation associated with R406W tau mutation and in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2130706106,"The SV40 capsid is composed primarily of 72 pentamers of the VP1 major capsid protein. Although the capsid also contains the minor capsid protein VP2 and its amino-terminally truncated form VP3, their roles in capsid assembly remain unknown. An in vitro assembly system was used to investigate the role of VP2 in the assembly of recombinant VP1 pentamers. Under physiological salt and pH conditions, VP1 alone remained dissociated, and at pH 5.0, it assembled into tubular structures. A stoichiometric amount of VP2 allowed the assembly of VP1 pentamers into spherical particles in a pH range of 7.0 to 4.0. Electron microscopy observation, sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, and antibody accessibility tests showed that VP2 is incorporated into VP1 particles. The functional domains of VP2 important for VP1 binding and for enhancing VP1 assembly were further explored with a series of VP2 deletion mutants. VP3 also enhanced VP1 assembly, and a region common to VP2 and VP3 (amino acids 119-272) was required to promote VP1 pentamer assembly. These results are relevant for controlling recombinant capsid formation in vitro, which is potentially useful for the in vitro development of SV40 virus vectors. The SV40 capsid is composed primarily of 72 pentamers of the VP1 major capsid protein. Although the capsid also contains the minor capsid protein VP2 and its amino-terminally truncated form VP3, their roles in capsid assembly remain unknown. An in vitro assembly system was used to investigate the role of VP2 in the assembly of recombinant VP1 pentamers. Under physiological salt and pH conditions, VP1 alone remained dissociated, and at pH 5.0, it assembled into tubular structures. A stoichiometric amount of VP2 allowed the assembly of VP1 pentamers into spherical particles in a pH range of 7.0 to 4.0. Electron microscopy observation, sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis, and antibody accessibility tests showed that VP2 is incorporated into VP1 particles. The functional domains of VP2 important for VP1 binding and for enhancing VP1 assembly were further explored with a series of VP2 deletion mutants. VP3 also enhanced VP1 assembly, and a region common to VP2 and VP3 (amino acids 119-272) was required to promote VP1 pentamer assembly. These results are relevant for controlling recombinant capsid formation in vitro, which is potentially useful for the in vitro development of SV40 virus vectors. Viral capsids are highly organized protein complexes that assemble and disassemble depending on environmental conditions during the viral life cycle. An elucidation of the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of viral capsids may greatly help in understanding these highly organized protein complexes. SV40 is a small, nonenveloped DNA tumor virus that belongs to the family Polyomaviridae. Its capsid is formed by 72 copies of pentamers of the VP1 major capsid protein (360 molecules in total) and 72 molecules of the VP2 or VP3 minor capsid proteins. VP1 pentamers are arranged in a T = 7d icosahedral lattice, and the carboxyl-terminal arm of VP1 mediates inter-pentameric contacts that hold the capsid together (1Garcea R.L. Salunke D.M.

The properties of VP1-VLPs are very similar to those of wild type virions in that they dissociate into pentamers following treatment with a calcium-chelating agent (EGTA) under reducing conditions in vitro (22Brady J.N.

Such particles include T = 7d (triangulation number 7 dextro) spherical particles, small T = 1 (triangulation number 1) particle composed of 12 pentamers, and long tubular structures of 40-45 nm in diameter (26Kanesashi S.N.

However, under physiological salt and pH conditions, pentamers do not assemble into particles in vitro (26Kanesashi S.N. Ishizu K.I. Kawano M.A. Han S.I. Tomita S. Watanabe H. Kataoka K. Handa H. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that component(s) that promote proper assembly are lacking. The purpose of the present study was to determine the precise role of the minor coat protein VP2 in the assembly of VP1 pentamers. We found that VP2 promotes VP1 assembly into particles under physiological salt and pH conditions, although these particles are somewhat irregular. We also identified the functional domains of VP2 that promote VP1 assembly. These results provide information on the mechanism of SV40 virus assembly and suggest a new approach to construct SV40 viral vectors in vitro. Plasmid Construction—A bacterial expression plasmid, pET-HF-VP2, containing amino-terminal fusions of VP2 with the His (HHHHHH) and FLAG (DYKDDDDK) tags was constructed as follows. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were introduced into the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of a DNA fragment encoding VP2 by PCR amplification using SV40 genomic DNA as a template. This fragment was ligated to an SpeI-BamHI fragment encoding the FLAG peptide, and the resulting fragment was inserted into SpeI-EcoRI-digested pBluescript to make pBS-F-VP2. The SpeI-EcoRI fragment encoding FLAG-tagged VP2 was inserted into the BamHI site of pET14b after 5′ overhangs were blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment. All HF-VP2 deletion mutants were generated from pET-HF-VP2. Sequences of primers and linkers used for PCR and construction will be given upon request. All mutants were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing analysis. The construction of recombinant VP1 displaying the FLAG tag on the capsid surface will be described elsewhere. 3R.-u.

In brief, a FLAG tag sequence with glycine spacers (GGG-DYKDDDDK-GGG) was inserted between amino acids 273 and 274 of VP1. Expression and Purification of Capsid Proteins—The construction of the SV40 VP1-expressing baculovirus and expression of the VP1 protein in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells have been described (9Ishizu K.I.

Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, VP1 protein assembled into particles (VP1-VLPs) in Sf9 cells was purified in two successive fractionations by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. The purified particles were dissociated into pentamers by incubation in a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm EGTA, and 30 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 1 h. The pentamers were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200, Amersham Biosciences) to enrich for completely dissociated VP1 pentamers. His-FLAG-tagged VP2 protein and deletion mutants were produced in the BL21 (RIL) strain of Escherichia coli (Novagen) harboring pET-HF-VP2 or corresponding plasmids after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 500 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin). The suspension was sonicated on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Recombinant proteins in the supernatant were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer, except that they were washed with binding buffer containing 20 mm imidazole instead of 10 mm imidazole. The eluate was further dialyzed against binding buffer lacking imidazole and containing 100 mm KCl. In Vitro Assembly and Electron Microscopic Observation—The purified recombinant VP1 pentamer fraction (0.44 μm as pentamer and 2.2 μm as monomer), alone or mixed with recombinant HF-VP2 proteins (0.44 μm or as otherwise described), was placed into mini-dialysis units (molecular weight cut-off, 3,500; Pierce) and dialyzed at 22 °C for 16 h against a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2 at various pH values (pH 7.0-10.0 with 20 mm Tris-HCl or pH 4.0-6.0 without Tris). VP1 assembly was observed by electron microscopy as described previously (9Ishizu K.I. Watanabe H. Han S.I. Kanesashi S.N. Hoque M. Yajima H. Kataoka K. Handa H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation Analysis—Twenty microliters of in vitro assembly reactions (∼600-1,000 ng of VP1 protein) or 800 ng of control VP1-VLPs were loaded onto a 0.6-ml preformed 20-40% sucrose gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) in a 5 × 41-mm open-top tube (Beckman) and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4°C in an SW 55Ti rotor with appropriate adapters. After centrifugation, fractions (55 μl each) were collected from the top of the tube. The bottom of the tube was washed with 55 μl of sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1% sodium deoxycholate) and used as the pellet fraction. Aliquots of each fraction (30%) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-SV40 VP1 polyclonal antibody (courtesy of M. Ikeda and I. Tamai, MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Native Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Twenty microliters of purified pentamers (20 ng), HF-VP2 proteins (20 ng), assembled samples (200 ng), VP1-VLPs (60 ng), or VLP-FLAG (60 ng) was mixed with 5 μl of loading buffer (250 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1), 25% glycerol, 0.125% bromphenol blue). When indicated, the samples were preincubated with 49 and 490 ng or 4.9 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). The samples were loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel, run in 50 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.1) for 2 h at 4°C, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane in 50 mm NaOH by a standard capillary transfer method (9Ishizu K.I. Watanabe H. Han S.I. Kanesashi S.N. Hoque M. Yajima H. Kataoka K. Handa H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). VP1, HF-VP2, and the anti-FLAG antibody were detected by immunoblotting with anti-VP1, anti-FLAG, and anti-mouse IgG antibodies, respectively. In Vitro Binding Assay for VP1 and HF-VP2 Proteins—To examine the abilities of the HF-VP2 and their derivatives to bind VP1 pentamers, purified VP1 pentamer or bovine serum albumin (BSA) was cross-linked to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instruction. Approximately 170 ng of VP1 or BSA was immobilized onto 1 μl of beads. The immobilized beads (40 μl) were mixed with 6.48 μg of recombinant HF-VP2 protein or derivatives in 0.2 ml of binding assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed with binding assay buffer, and eluted with 40 μl of SDS loading dye (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 4.1% SDS, 284 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). Aliquots of the input and eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and detected by Western analysis using mouse anti-FLAG antibody as the primary antibody followed by ECL detection. Minor Capsid Protein VP2 Promotes Assembly of VP1 into Virus-like Particles—We have established a system to evaluate conditions for the assembly of highly purified recombinant VP1 pentamers into particles by dialyzing a VP1-containing solution against various buffers, with subsequent EM observation (9Ishizu K.I. Watanabe H. Han S.I. Kanesashi S.N. Hoque M. Yajima H. Kataoka K. Handa H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Kosukegawa A. Arisaka F. Takayama M. Yauima H.

Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1899-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As we showed previously, VP1 pentamers do not assemble into particles under physiological salt and pH conditions (150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) (Fig. 1A, top panel). The minor capsid proteins are integral aspects of virion structure (5Barouch D.H. Harrison S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3982-3989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gharakhanian E. Takahashi J. Clever J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3233-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), although their role in virion assembly has yet to be established. To examine their effects on the in vitro assembly of VP1 pentamers, we used recombinant VP2 protein tagged with the His and FLAG motifs at its amino terminus (HF-VP2). Addition of HF-VP2 to VP1 pentamers resulted in particle formation under physiological salt and pH conditions (Fig. 1A, middle panel). We compared the morphology of these particles to that of recombinant VP1 particles assembled in vivo (Fig. 1, A, bottom panel, and B). As shown previously (27Rayment I. Baker T.S. Casper D.L. Murakami W.T. Nature. 1982; 295: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Anderer F.A. Schlumberger H.D. Koch M.A. Frank H. Eggers H.J.

J. 1989; 56: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the in vivo preparation contained two types of particles as follows: large virus-like particles (VP1-VLPs) of ∼45 nm in diameter (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, arrows), and T = 1 tiny particle of ∼20 nm (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, arrowheads). In contrast, particles assembled from VP1 and HF-VP2 in vitro were more heterogeneous. They included T = 1 tiny particle (Fig. 1A, middle panel, arrowheads) and somewhat irregularly shaped larger particles (Fig. 1A, middle panel, arrows). The mean diameter of the larger particles was smaller than that of VP1-VLPs, ranging from 25 to 40 nm (Fig. 1B, upper panel). It should be noted that, in contrast to VP1-VLPs that were internally stained by uranium acetate and that appeared to be empty, the interior of the particles assembled in vitro did not retain uranium acetate and appeared to be occupied, suggesting that the VP2 protein is enclosed within these particles (compare arrows in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 1A). We then analyzed assembly reactions by sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by Western analysis using anti-VP1 and anti-FLAG antibodies. VP1 alone remained in the top fraction (Fig. 1C, panel 1), indicating that VP1 pentamers do not assemble. HF-VP2 alone was detected in fractions 1-4 (Fig. 1C, panel 4). In contrast, the addition of HF-VP2 led to a dramatic change in the VP1 sedimentation profile, and VP1 and HF-VP2 co-migrated (Fig. 1C, panels 2 and 3), suggesting that VP2 stimulates the assembly of VP1 pentamers by directly interacting with VP1. Also, VP1 and HF-VP2 were distributed more broadly throughout the sedimentation gradient than were VP1-VLPs assembled in vivo (Fig. 1C, panels 2 and 5), which is consistent with EM observations. These results indicate that HF-VP2 allows VP1 pentamers to form imperfectly shaped particles. Effects of Solvent pH on Assembly of VP1 Pentamers and HF-VP2—We next examined the assembly of VP1 pentamers at various pH values in the presence or absence of HF-VP2. VP1 alone did not assemble at pH 4.0 or 6.0 (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Under these conditions, the addition of HF-VP2 resulted in particle formation (Fig. 2A, lower panels). At pH 5.0, VP1 alone assembled into extremely long tubular structures as reported previously (Fig. 2A, upper panel, pH 5.0, open arrowheads) (9Ishizu K.I. Watanabe H. Han S.I. Kanesashi S.N. Hoque M. Yajima H. Kataoka K. Handa H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The diameter of these tubes was ∼40-45 nm, and they were apparently infinitely long although disrupted during preparation. Sucrose gradient sedimentation also indicated large structure formation, as most VP1 protein was found in the bottom fraction (Fig. 2B, panel 1). Even under this condition, the addition of HF-VP2 resulted in the formation of particles that are morphologically similar to those formed at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2A, see also Fig. 1A). Sucrose gradient sedimentation also supports this conclusion (Fig. 2B, panels 2 and 3). At pH 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0, VP1 pentamers alone assembled into spherical structures (Fig. 2A). Close examination by EM indicated that these particles are not completely closed (Fig. 2A, upper panels, arrows). Upon sucrose gradient sedimentation, some VP1 protein was found to be incorporated into VP1-VLPs (fractions 7-10) but most was in the top fraction (Fig. 2B, panel 4). The addition of HF-VP2 did not change the extent of large particle formation and did not alter particle shape (Fig. 2A, lower panels, arrows), but it did resulted in the appearance of T = 1 tiny particle (Fig. 2A, lower panels, arrowheads). Sucrose sedimentation (Fig. 2B, panels 5 and 6) showed that HF-VP2 was associated with both T = 1 tiny particle (fractions 3-5) and large particles (fractions 7-10) at pH 9.0. From these results, we conclude that HF-VP2 enhances 25-40 nm particle formation by VP1 pentamers at pH values below 7.0. Molar Ratio of VP1 Pentamers and HF-VP2 in the Assemblies—In the above experiments, we mixed VP1 pentamers and HF-VP2 at a 1:1 ratio, because this is the ratio of VP1 pentamers to minor capsid proteins in wild type SV40 virions. We asked if HF-VP2 enhances VP1 assembly by acting as a chaperone or by acting as a structural component that must be present at stoichiometrically appropriate levels. To address this issue, we varied the level of HF-VP2 and maintained a constant level of VP1 pentamers. When HF-VP2 and VP1 pentamers were mixed at a 12:72 molar ratio, most VP1 assembled into tubular structures, and only a small number of large particles were formed (Fig. 3A, top panel). The formation of tubular structures is indicative of insufficient HF-VP2. At a 22:72 molar ratio, large particles increased in number, although some tubular structures were still observed (Fig. 3A, 2nd panel). When equimolar amounts of HF-VP2 and VP1 pentamers (72:72) were mixed, most of the assemblies were large particles, with a few tubes (Fig. 3A, 3rd panel). A further increase in HF-VP2 decreased the formation of large particles and tubular structures and instead increased particle aggregation (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). Sucrose sedimentation analyses were consistent with these EM observations (Fig. 3B). It is of note that excess amounts of aggregated HF-VP2 protein were detected in fraction 12 (Fig. 3B, panels 8 and 10), whereas HF-VP2 alone was detected only in the top fractions (see Fig. 1C, panel 4). These results suggest that VP2 self-association is promoted in the presence of VP1 pentamers. Overall, the results show that large particle formation of VP1 pentamers occurs most efficiently in the presence of HF-VP2 at a 1:1 molar ratio under these conditions. These results suggest that HF-VP2 enhances VP1 assembly not by a chaperone-like activity but as a structural component. Enclosure of HF-VP2 into the VP1 Capsid—The results described above suggested that the enhancement of VP1 assembly by HF-VP2 involves the direct interaction of VP2 with VP1. To determine whether VP2 is in the assembled VP1 capsid, we used native agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, purified VP1 pentamers and reconstituted VLP particles could be separated by native agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 4). VP1 structures assembled at pH 5.0 (tubular structures) were detected at the top of the gel (Fig. 4A, lane 2). On the other hand, VP1 reassembled in the presence of HF-VP2 at pH 5.0 migrated to a position similar to that of VP1-VLPs (Fig. 4A, lane 3, upper panel). HF-VP2 protein was detected at the same position as VP1 (Fig. 4A, lane 3, bottom panel). These results are consistent with those obtained by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis (Fig. 1C). We then examined if HF-VP2 is incorporated within VP1 particles. If HF-VP2 is externally associated with VP1 particles, preincubation of particles with the anti-FLAG antibody should change their electrophoretic mobility. However, preincubation with the anti-FLAG antibody did not affect the mobility of the band that corresponds to VP1 plus HF-VP2 particles (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4), and the band did not contain anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 5). In contrast, preincubation of HF-VP2 protein alone with the anti-FLAG antibody resulted in the appearance of a new band that contains both HF-VP2 and anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4B, lanes 6-8). As another control, we used recombinant FLAG-VP1 capsids, which display the FLAG epitope on the surface. When capsids were mixed with anti-FLAG antibody, their mobility was shifted in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that the HF-VP2 FLAG epitope and thus HF-VP2 itself are inside the particles. This interpretation is consistent with EM observations indicating that VP1-HF-VP2 particles are filled (Fig. 1A). Functional Domains in HF-VP2 that Promote VP1 Assembly—The results described above suggest that, upon promoting VP1 particle assembly, HF-VP2 associates with and is enclosed in the particles. Previous structural and biochemical studies have proposed that VP2 proteins form complexes with VP1, via amino acid 273-309 of polyomavirus VP2 (5Barouch D.H. Harrison S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3982-3989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen X.S. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3233-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and via the carboxyl-terminal 40 residues of SV40 (6Gharakhanian E. Takahashi J. Clever J. Kasamatsu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6607-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). However, the functional domains involved in promoting VP1 particle formation are not known. To address this issue, HF-VP2 deletion mutants were generated and examined for their ability to promote VP1 particle assembly (Fig. 5B). Equimolar amounts of HF-VP2 fragments were mixed with purified VP1 pentamers and dialyzed at pH 5.0 to allow VP1 assembly formation. The samples were observed by EM (Fig. 5C). It was expected that the appearance of tubular structures reflects an inability of HF-VP2 to promote VP1 particle assembly and that the absence of assemblies suggests that the HF-VP2 fragment inhibits the assembly of VP1.FIGURE 5Domain analysis of HF-VP2. A, schematic representation of SV40 VP2. Previously defined domains of VP2 are indicated as follows: the VP2 unique region (1-118), the VP1-binding region (273-309 and 312-352), the nuclear localization signal (NLS, 318-324), and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (339-352). B, structures of VP2 deletion mutants used in this study. The effect of each mutant on VP1 assembly is summarized at right: particles, T = 1, pentamers, and tubes indicate 25-40 nm particle assembly, T = 1 tiny particle assembly, mostly pentamers, and mostly tubular structures, respectively. The effect of each mutant on VP1 binding is summarized at right. Yes and no indicate detectable and undetectable VP1 binding activity, respectively. C, morphologies of VP1 pentamers assembled in the presence of various HF-VP2 mutants. Purified VP1 pentamers were incubated with each HF-VP2 mutant (at an ∼1:1 ratio) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by dialysis at 22 °C for 16 h against buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 5.0). The samples were visualized by negative staining using uranium acetate. Scale bar, 50 nm. D, size distributions of assembled particles. The diameters of a group of randomly selected 50 particles in the electron micrographs of each assembly were measured. E, electron micrographs of the assemblies after dialysis at pH 5.0.

CDK4-cyclin D complexes then persist through the latter phases of the cell cycle, although little is known about their potential roles. We have developed small molecule inhibitors that are highly selective for CDK4 and have used these to define a role for CDK4-cyclin D in G2 phase. The addition of the CDK4 inhibitor or small interfering RNA knockdown of cyclin D3, the cyclin D partner, delayed progression through G2 phase and mitosis. The G2 phase delay was independent of ATM/ATR and p38 MAPK but associated with elevated Wee1. The mitotic delay was because of failure of chromosomes to migrate to the metaphase plate. However, cells eventually exited mitosis, with a resultant increase in cells with multiple or micronuclei. Inhibiting CDK4 delayed the expression of the chromosomal passenger proteins survivin and borealin, although this was unlikely to account for the mitotic phenotype. These data provide evidence for a novel function for CDK4-cyclin D3 activity in S and G2 phase that is critical for G2/M progression and the fidelity of mitosis.

Its role in this pathway is to phosphorylate and inactive members of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) family, which includes Rb, p107, and p130 (1Kato J.Y. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11513-11517Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 2Ezhevsky S.A. Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Gius D.R. Wei M.C. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10699-10704Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation allows the release and activation of E2F transcription factors, which in turn up-regulates the genes required for S phase. CDK4 is regulated by cyclin D binding, phosphorylation, and association with inhibitory protein subunits of the INK4 family. Unlike other CDK-cyclin complexes, it is present at constant levels throughout the cell cycle in continuously proliferating cells, although its activity varies. Mutations in the CDK4-cyclin D/Rb pathway are commonly found in many types of cancer. A number of viral oncogenes directly target the inactivation of Rb, and overexpression of cyclin D is common in breast cancer. This is particularly relevant in melanoma, where germ line mutations of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4A or CDK4 mutations that disrupt p16 binding are carried in melanoma-prone kindred (for review, see Ref. 3Hayward N.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3053-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, somatic p16INK4A loss or mutation occurs in up to 30% of melanomas (3Hayward N.K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3053-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K. Sparrow L.E. Down L.M. Gabrielli B.G. Parsons P.G. Hayward N.K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4868-4875PubMed Google Scholar), and a small proportion of melanomas carry somatic CDK4 mutations that disrupt p16INK4A binding (4Castellano M. Pollock P.M. Walters M.K.

This points to the importance of the cyclin D/CDK4/Rb pathway in controlling G0/G1 cell cycle progression. However, the role of CDK4-cyclin D in the phosphorylation and inactivation of Rb can in some cases be effectively substituted by cyclin E-CDK2 (6Keenan S.M. Lents N.H. Baldassare J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5387-5396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and knockout mouse models have shown redundancy of CDK4 and CDK6, whereas knock-out of both had only minimal effect on the cell cycle of cells (7Kozar K. Sicinski P. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 388-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Malumbres M. Sotillo R. Santamaria D. Galan J. Cerezo A. Ortega S. Dubus P. Barbacid M. Cell. 2004; 118: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). These data indicate that CDK4 is not essential for cell cycle progression, so then why is the CDK4-cyclin D pathway often de-regulated in cancer? An explanation may be that CDK4 has important functions in addition to the G1 phase phosphorylation of Rb. A peak of CDK4-cyclin D3 activity has been demonstrated during S/G2 phase (9Gabrielli B.G. Sarcevic B. Sinnamon J. Walker G. Castellano M. Wang X.Q. Ellem K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13961-13969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are likely to be additional functions and substrates for CDK4 outside of G1 phase. This hypothesis is strengthened by the finding that CDK4-cyclin D3 can phosphorylate nucleolin, a protein that is implicated in the transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA and nucleolar structure as well as additional unidentified proteins (10Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To define the role for CDK4-cyclin D, we have produced small molecule inhibitors of CDK4-cyclin D and used siRNA knockdown of cyclin D3 to demonstrate specificity of the inhibitors. Using these, we demonstrate here that CDK4 plays a critical role in G2/M phase progression. Loss of CDK4-cyclin D3 activity produced a transient delay in early G2 phase before to the activation of CDK2-cyclin A in G2 phase and CDK1-cyclin B1 at G2/M. This delay does not appear to operate through the known G2/M checkpoints mechanisms, the ATM/ATR, and the p38 MAPK mediated pathways that operate in response to a variety of cellular stresses. Inhibition of CDK4 also delayed transit through mitosis, with 30% of cells progressing through an aberrant mitosis to produce cells with multiple nuclei or containing micronuclei. We also observed a delay in the G2/M phase expression of two gene products critical for the fidelity of partitioning of the replicated genome in mitosis, the chromosomal passenger proteins survivin and borealin. However, these proteins accumulated to relatively normal levels in cells that reached mitosis, suggesting that these were unlikely to contribute significantly to the aberrant mitosis observed. Our data indicate that inhibition of CDK4 activity during S and G2 phase delays G2/M progression and reduces the fidelity of mitosis, providing strong evidence that CDK4 plays an important role outside of G1 and Rb phosphorylation. Materials—Caffeine, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and etoposide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CDK4 inhibitors (RO 0506220 and RO 0505124) and two structurally similar compounds that show no CDK4 kinase inhibition (RO 0507574 and RO 0507304) were synthesized by Discovery Chemistry Group (Hoffmann-La Roche). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Cell Culture and Synchrony—All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) Serum Supreme (BioWhittaker) in tissue culture incubators set at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Hydroxyurea and double thymidine block release synchronizations were performed as described in Gabrielli et al. (11Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with CDK4 inhibitors 1 h after release from synchrony unless stated otherwise and harvested at the indicated times. Growth assays were performed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described previously (12Burgess A.J. Pavey S. Warrener R. Hunter L.J. Piva T.J. Musgrove E.A. Saunders N. Parsons P.G. Gabrielli B.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 828-837PubMed Google Scholar). Assays for mycoplasma were carried out monthly to ensure that all of the cultured cells were free of contamination. CDK4 Inhibitor Kinase Screen—Kinase assays were performed by FlashPlate™ assays (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). FlashPlate assays were performed using recombinant human cyclin B-CDK1, human cyclin E-CDK2, or human cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-cyclin E, CDK2, GST-cyclin B, CDK1, GST-CDK4k, and cyclin D1 cDNA clones in baculovirus vectors were provided by Dr. W. Harper at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. Proteins were co-expressed in High Five™ insect cells, and the complex was purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). A 6×histidine-tagged truncated form of Rb protein (amino acid 386–928) was used as the substrate for the cyclin D1-CDK4, cyclin B-CDK1, and the cyclin E-CDK2 assays (the expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Veronica Sullivan, Department of Molecular Virology, Roche Research Centre, Welwyn Garden City, UK). Protein expression was under the control of an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter in an M15 Escherichia coli strain. Cells were lysed by sonication, and purification was carried out by binding lysates at pH 8.0 to a nickel-chelated agarose column pretreated with 1 mm imidazole. The resin was then washed several times with incrementally decreasing pH buffers to pH 6.0 and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Purified Rb fusion protein stocks were quantitated for protein concentration, separated into aliquots, and stored at –70 °C. For all three kinase assays, 96-well FlashPlates were coated with Rb protein at 10 μg/ml using 100 μl/well. Plates were incubated at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 3 h on a shaker. To control for nonspecific phosphorylation, one row of wells was coated with 100 μl/well coating buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.2 m NaCl). Plates were then washed twice with wash buffer (0.01% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). Compounds to be tested were added to the wells at 5× final concentrations. Reactions were initiated by the immediate addition of 40 μl of reaction mix (25 mm HEPES, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.002% Tween 20, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm ATP, 4 nm [33P]ATP) and a sufficient amount of enzyme to give counts that are at least 10-fold above background. Plates were incubated at room temperature on a shaker for 30 min. Plates were washed four times with the wash buffer, sealed, and counted on the TopCount Scintillation Counter. The protein kinase B, p38, and MAPK and tyrosine kinases were assayed in-house at Roche. Assays for these kinases are based on IMAP Technology™ (Molecular Device Corp.) that enables quantitation of kinase activity via preferential binding of phosphorylated fluorescent peptide substrates to immobilized metal beads. These reactions were carried out at ATP concentrations of 3× the Km for the respective enzyme. Counter-screening against the other kinases was carried out using fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays at the Km for ATP. siRNA Design and Transfection—The Ambion Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) was used to produce siRNAs against cyclin D3 and D1. The following target sequences were identified and appropriate oligonucleotides were constructed as per manufacturer's instructions. Three cyclin D3 target sequences were identified, and Blast searches were performed to ensure that the sequences did not contain significant homology to any other known genes. The sequences were: Sequence 1, AAGGATCTTTGTGGCCAAGGA; sequence 2, AAGATGCTGGCTTACTGGATG; sequence 3, AATTGGATACATACACCAGCA. All three produced similar levels of specific cyclin D3 knockdown, and siRNA against sequence 1 was then used for all remaining experiments. In addition, a scrambled version of sequence 1 (NS sequence, AAGAAGTTAGTCCGATGCGTG), which contained no homology to CDK4 or any known genes, was used as a control. siRNA transfection were performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, cells were synchronized by blocking overnight with 2 mm hydroxyurea, and released into S phase the following day. They were then analyzed by live cell imaging, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Cells were lysed using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer's instruction. The RNA was quantified by a Smart Spec spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad) at a wavelength of 260/280 nm, and the extract was stored at –70 °C until cDNA synthesis. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instruction. An equal amount of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis in each set of experiment. Quantitative PCR—Quantitation of survivin cDNA and an internal reference cDNA (β-actin) was performed using a fluorescence based real-time detection method (ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Taqman), Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, a dual-labeled fluorescent oligonucleotide probe was used that annealed specifically within the forward and reverse primers. The PCR reaction consisted of 600 nm concentrations of each primer, 200 nm probe, 1× Taqman Universal PCR master mix containing 200 μm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 400 μm dUTP, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of AmpErase uracil N-glycosylase to a final volume of 20 μl (all reagents PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The sequences for the PCR primers area as follows. Survivin: forward primer, 5′-TGCCCCGACGTTGCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGTTCTTGAATGTAGAGATGCGGT-3′; probe, 5′-(6-Fam)CCTGGCAGCCCTTTCTCAAGGACC-(Tamra)-3′. β-Actin: forward primer, 5′-AGCCTCGCTTTGCCGA-3′, reverse primer, 5′-CTGGTGCCTGGGGCG-3′, probe, 5′-(6-Fam)CCGCCGCCCGT CCACACCCGCC(Tamra)-3′. Biochemical Analysis—Cells were lysed in NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). After 20 min on ice, the DNA was pelleted, and lysates were resolved on appropriate SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis plates, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted for proteins using antibodies against borealin (a gift from Professor Earnshaw, Edinburgh (13Gassmann R. Carvalho A. Henzing A.J. Ruchaud S. Hudson D.F. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. J.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection. Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells were grown on glass coverslips. For immunostaining, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 100% –20 °C methanol, and stored at –20 °C until required. Coverslips were allowed to air-dry and then rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were stained with anti-α-tubulin, survivin, human autoimmune serum (h-ACA) to detect kinetochores, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml) for DNA. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides supplemented with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to maintain fluorescence. Cells were visualized using a Carl Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope, and images were captured using a Carl Zeiss AxioCam 2 camera and Axiovision and Adobe Photoshop software. Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometric analysis (FACS), floating and attached cells were collected for analysis. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored at –20 °C. Samples were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in DNA staining solution consisting of 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline. The stained cells were filtered through 37-μm silk gauze, and the single-cell suspensions were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest, with the proportion of cells in each cell cycle stage and subdiploid population calculated using the ModFit analysis package (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining was performed as described previously (14Qiu L. Burgess A. Fairlie D.P. Leonard H. Parsons P.G. Gabrielli B.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2069-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) as was MPM-2 staining (15Krauer K.G. Burgess A. Buck M. Flanagan J. Sculley T.B. Gabrielli B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1342-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Live Cell Imaging—Cells were seeded the day before the experiment on 6- or 12-well plates at ∼50% confluence. Live cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss Cell Observer. Images were captured every 10 min for the duration of the cell cycle using Zeiss Axiovision software. Single cell analysis was performed by individually following each cell through each frame and observing the number of frames required to complete each distinct phase. Entry into mitosis was identified when the cells rounded up, and exit from mitosis was when anaphase and cytokinesis were observed. Identification of Highly Selective Small Molecule Inhibitors of CDK4—The diaminothiazole series of compounds were identified as a result of a screen for cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of the screen). Modifications to the compound class produced two potent and selective CDK4 inhibitors with IC50 values of 20 nm for recombinant CDK4-cyclin D in vitro that were >100-fold more potent for CDK4 compared with CDK1 and 2 in vitro (Fig. 1, Table 1). The inhibitors are reversible and bind the ATP pocket of the kinases. A screen of 128 protein kinases was performed commercially using RO0505124 at a 1 μm concentration to assess the potential number of kinases that may be inhibited by these compounds. Eleven kinases from different families were inhibited >90% at this dose, demonstrating the relatively high degree of selectivity of the drugs but indicating that other kinases may also be targets. To demonstrate that these compounds inhibit CDK4 in cells, a number of cell lines with or without functional Rb were tested. Inhibition of CDK4 should produce a G1 delay and reduction in Rb phosphorylation in cells that contain functional Rb. HeLa cells that do not contain functional Rb did not display a G1 arrest after 24 h of treatment with 2 μm RO0506220, whereas SK-Mel-13 cells that have functional Rb had a strong G1 arrest (Fig. 2A). Similar data were obtained with both RO0506220 and RO0505124, whereas the inactive analogues had no effect on either cell lines. Later experiments were performed with RO0506220 and RO0505124 and are denoted as CDK4 inhibitor (CDK4i). Asynchronously growing HCT-116 cells, which contain functional Rb, were treated for 24 h with increasing doses of CDK4i. Cells were then either pulsed with BrdUrd and harvested for FACS analysis, or samples were collected to examine Rb phosphorylation status. A dose of 3.9 μm was required to reduce S phase to 50% of control levels (IC50), with a significant reduction in the level of Rb phosphorylation also observed (Fig. 2, B and C). Higher doses further inhibited BrdUrd incorporation and Rb phosphorylation. These data demonstrated that drug treatment arrested cells in G1 phase, blocking progression into S phase. Interestingly, the proportion of G2/M phase cells appeared to either remain constant or increased after CDK4i treatment, whereas it would be expected to decrease if the drugs caused only a G1 phase arrest. An additional 9 cell lines were tested, and the IC50 values for inhibition of S phase in these cells ranged from 0.5 to 8 μm (Table 2). The much higher drug concentrations required for the in vivo inhibition of CDK4 activity compared with in vitro is likely to be a consequence of nonspecific binding of the drugs reducing their effective concentrations. At IC50 concentrations the drugs caused little toxicity even after 3 days of treatment. Higher doses caused a moderate increased toxicity. To avoid any potentially nonspecific toxic effects, a dose of 2–4 μm CDK4i was chosen as an appropriate concentration for the remainder of the experiments, as this provided strong in vivo inhibition of CDK4 without affecting CDK1 or CDK2 activity.TABLE 1In vitro inhibition of kinases by CDK4iKinaseInhibition IC50RO0505124RO0506220nMCDK4-cyclin D2020CDK2-cyclin E2,3604,144CDK1-cyclin B3,0421,973c-Met>20,000>20,000Src3,2103,480Lck>100,000>100,000Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor22,00020,000Insulin receptor71,00024,000p38 MAPK29,000>100,000Protein kinase B/AKT>200,000>200,000c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase>50,000>50,000Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1>100,000>100,000 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2CDK4 Inhibitors Causes a G1 arrest in an Rb-dependent manner.

To analyze the effects of the CDK4 inhibitors on cell cycle progression beyond the Rb-dependent G1 arrest, cells were synchronized and then treated during early S phase with CDK4i. The progression of cells through the remainder of the cell cycle was monitored using flow cytometry, biochemical analysis, and time-lapse microscopy. Upon release, cells were treated at various stages through S phase with or without 2 μm CDK4i or inactive control. Treatment 2 h post-release during early S phase resulted in HeLa cells delaying progression through mitosis by 4 h. These cells remained in G2/M at 12 h post-release when the untreated controls had progressed through mitosis to the subsequent G1 phase (Fig. 3A). A dose of 4 μm increased the G2/M delay to >4 h. The ability of CDK4i to inhibit G2/M progression was also observed with two other cell lines, the melanoma cell lines A2058 and SK-Mel-13 (Fig. 3B). The latter has a functional Rb-dependent G1 arrest, whereas the former is defective for the checkpoint. There was little effect on S phase progression observed with any of the cell lines examined. The G2/M delay was dependent on the addition of CDK4i during early S phase. The addition during mid-S phase (4 h) produced a shorter delay of up to 2 h, whereas the addition in late S/G2 phase (6 h) had no effect on progression through G2/M (Fig. 3A, data for A2058 and SKMel-13 not shown). Treatment with inactive analogues had no effect on cell cycle progression. To determine whether the G2/M delay was during G2 phase or mitosis, MPM-2 FACS was performed to specifically define the mitotic population. Control HeLa cells had begun to enter into mitosis by 8 h and returned to G1 by 12 h, whereas cells treated with CDK4i delayed entry into mitosis until 12 h post-release. This indicated that CDK4i-treated cells were delayed in G2 phase (Fig. 3C). This G2 delay was confirmed by cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B1-CDK1 kinase assays. The delay corresponded to an accumulation of phosphotyrosine 15 CDK1 and CDK2 observed by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 3D). Cyclin B1 accumulated normally in the CDK4i-treated cultures (Fig. 3D) as did cyclin A (see Fig. 7A); thus, the blockade was due to failure to dephosphorylate the inhibitory phosphotyrosine 15 residue on CDK2 and CDK1. The activation of the G2 phase pool of cyclin A-CDK2 and G2/M cyclin B1-CDK1 in CDK4i-treated cultures was also delayed compared with untreated controls (data not shown). The inhibition of phosphotyrosine 15 dephosphorylation on both CDK1 and CDK2 was similar to that observed in the G2 arrests imposed by DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation, etoposide, and ultraviolet radiation (16Goldstone S. Pavey S. Forrest A. Sinnamon J. Gabrielli B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which utilize stress checkpoint signaling pathways involving either ATM, ATR, or p38 MAPK (17O'Connell M.J. Walworth N.C. Carr A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 296-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 18Bulavin D.V. Amundson S.A. Fornace A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The addition of either caffeine to inhibit ATM/ATR signaling or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 had no effect on the G2 delay observed with CDK4i addition. However, both these drugs did advance entry into mitosis in the controls by 1 h (Fig. 3E). The lack of effect of either inhibitor on the CDK4i-induced G2 delay suggests that does not operate through known DNA damage or stress checkpoint pathways. When the level of the Wee1 kinase, which phosphorylates the inhibitory tyrosine 15 residue on CDK1 and CDK2, was examined, it was found to decrease in inactive compound-treated controls as they progressed into mitosis as expected, but in CDK4i-treated samples Wee1 levels appeared to increase and stabilize for the duration of the G2 phase delay, which may represent an alternative mechanism by which the G2 delay was imposed (Fig. 3F). The fate of individual cells after CDK4i treatment as they progressed into and through mitosis was examined using time-lapse microscopy. Control cells entered mitosis at 8–9 h post-release with a high degree of synchrony. In contrast, CDK4i-treated cells began entry into mitosis 11 h post-release (Fig. 4A). There was also a difference in the time the cells remained in mitosis, with control cells requiring 78 ± 51 min to reach anaphase/telophase, whereas CDK4i-treated cells required 152 ± 97 min. The broader spread of time required to reach anaphase was due to a subpopulation of cells that delayed longer in mitosis (Fig. 4B). In addition, 20% of cells failed to undergo cytokinesis correctly in the CDK4i-tr"

Mammals have 14 calpain genes, half of which are predominantly expressed in specific organ(s); the rest are expressed ubiquitously. A defect in calpains causes lethality/pathogenicity, indicating their physiological indispensability. nCL-2/calpain-8a was identified as a stomach-specific calpain, whose physiological functions are unclear. To elucidate these, we characterized nCL-2 in detail. Unexpectedly, nCL-2 was localized strictly to the surface mucus cells in the gastric epithelium and the mucus-secreting goblet cells in the duodenum. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified several nCL-2-interacting molecules. Of these, the beta-subunit of coatomer complex (beta-COP) occurs in the stomach pit cells and is proteolyzed by nCL-2 in vitro. Furthermore, beta-COP and nCL-2 co-expressed in COS7 cells co-localized in the Golgi, and Ca2+-ionophore stimulation caused the proteolysis of beta-COP near the linker region, resulting in the dissociation of beta-COP from the Golgi. These results strongly suggest novel functions for nCL-2 that involve the membrane trafficking of mucus cells via interactions with coat protein."
https://openalex.org/W1974304724,"The influence of the heme iron coordination on nitric oxide binding dynamics was investigated for the myoglobin mutant H93G (H93G-Mb) by picosecond absorption and resonance Raman timeresolved spectroscopies. In the H93G-Mb, the glycine replacing the proximal histidine does not interact with the heme iron so that exogenous substituents like imidazole may coordinate to the iron at the proximal position. Nitrosylation of H93G-Mb leads to either 6- or 5-coordinate species depending on the imidazole concentration. At high concentrations, (imidazole)-(NO)-6-coordinate heme is formed, and the photoinduced rebinding kinetics reveal two exponential picosecond phases (∼10 and ∼100 ps) similar to those of wild type myoglobin. At low concentrations, imidazole is displaced by the trans effect leading to a (NO)-5-coordinate heme, becoming 4-coordinate immediately after photolysis as revealed from the transient Raman spectrum. In this case, NO rebinding kinetics remain bi-exponential with no change in time constant of the fast component whose amplitude increases with respect to the 6-coordinate species. Bi-exponential NO geminate rebinding in 5-coordinate H93G-Mb is in contrast with the single-exponential process reported for nitrosylated soluble guanylate cyclase (Negrerie, M., Bouzhir, L., Martin, J. L., and Liebl, U. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 46815-46821). Thus, our data show that the iron coordination state or the heme iron out-of-plane motion are not at the origin of the bi-exponential kinetics, which depends upon the protein structure, and that the 4-coordinate state favors the fast phase of NO geminate rebinding.

Numerous hemoproteins are involved in diatomic ligand binding, such as CO, O2, and NO, and their regulation closely depends upon the dynamic behavior of these ligands. We have shown that the dynamics of nitric oxide, and hence the geminate rebinding to the heme, are closely related to the protein function and subtly controlled by the protein structure. This control is evident when comparing endothelial NO synthase (5Negrerie M. Berka V. Vos M.H. Liebl U. Lambry J.C. Tsai A.L. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24694-24702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and soluble guanylate cyclase (6Negrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46815-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which are the source and the receptor of NO in cells, respectively, in which NO acts as a second messenger for signal transduction. These two proteins display a very contrasting behavior with respect to geminate rebinding of NO, which is multiphasic and relatively slow for endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, including important nanosecond phases correlated with the release of newly synthesized NO. On the other hand, NO recombination is mono-exponential and ultrafast for sGC, revealing a high trapping efficiency. The picosecond and nanosecond phases of the geminate recombination of a diatomic ligand to the heme (and its release from the heme) are modulated by several structural features linked to the intrinsic properties and function of hemoproteins. These features include the heme coordination state and protein structure whose respective contributions must be investigated for understanding the protein mechanism and regulation at the molecular level. Here we focus on the role of the iron proximal coordination in modulating the various phases of NO recombination.NO is a particularly versatile and intriguing ligand because it can give rise either to 5-coordinate or to 6-coordinate adducts, the latter having the proximal histidine involved in the second axial coordination, and both conformations presenting biological importance. Although the NO adducts of wild type myoglobin or hemoglobin are observed to be 6-coordinate, binding of NO to sGC leads to an NO-5-coordinate Fe2+ complex after breaking the bond between the proximal His and the heme iron by a trans effect, which corresponds to a weakening of the axial Fe-X bond following the trans-coordination of a sixth ligand with ferrous iron (7Ignarro L.J.

A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The geminate recombination of NO to Mb or Hb always exhibits multiexponential kinetics on the picosecond time scale with two dominant phases (∼10 and ∼100 ps) for both proteins (9Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 10Petrich J.W. Lambry J.C. Kuczera K. Karplus M. Poyart C. Martin J.L.

The origin of this multiphasic behavior has led to several hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive. The first one attributes the dynamics to relaxation of the protein structure initiated by the iron motion after NO dissociation (10Petrich J.W. Lambry J.C. Kuczera K. Karplus M. Poyart C. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3975-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The second hypothesis suggests that distal side chains present energy barriers to rebinding (14Gibson Q.H. Regan R.

Contrary to Mb and Hb, a mono-exponential recombination of NO to the 4-coordinate Fe2+ after photodissociation is observed in sGC (6Negrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46815-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the effects of distal mutations on the rebinding of NO to Mb (15Petrich J.W.

Chem. B. 2003; 107: 9122-9127Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) suggest an important role for the amino acids in the distal pocket in governing the NO recombination rate. Thus, both the coordination state of the heme iron and the structure of the heme protein may influence the picosecond phases of NO geminate recombination and its bi-exponential character as suggested by the previous examples.The H93G-Mb mutant provides a unique opportunity to investigate these effects in more detail. The H93G mutant lacks the proximal histidine that normally coordinates to the iron, and glycine does not interact with the heme so that exogenous substituents such as imidazole, phenol, or thiophene may coordinate to the heme iron (19Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Imidazole mimics the proximal His coordination of WT Mb but is not covalently attached to the protein backbone. Moreover, the nitrosylation of H93G-Mb leads to either the 5- or the 6-coordinate form, depending on the concentration of exogenous imidazole. At imidazole concentrations less than 1 mm, the nitrosylated H93G-Mb is NO-5-coordinated, whereas above 1 mm it is 6-coordinated with spectroscopic properties similar to that of WT Mb (20Decatur S.M. De Pillis G.D. Boxer S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3925-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21DePillis G.D. Decatur S.M. Barrick D. Boxer S.G. J. Am. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4939-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The H93G-Mb mutant is thus capable of mimicking both a 5-coordinate-NO complex like nitrosylated sGC and a 6-coordinate-NO form like Mb.In this study, we have measured the fast rebinding kinetics of NO to H93G-Mb on the picosecond time scale by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy, and we identified the transient species by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. The results are compared with WT Mb and to sGC and provide insight into the structural factors that affect the geminate rebinding process. The experiments were followed by electronic potential energy surface calculations using DFT methods (23Franzen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16754-16759Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The potential surfaces of 5- and 6-coordinate heme were calculated as a function of the distance between the free diatomic ligand NO and the heme iron.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTo avoid confusion, the term “substituent” refers to the molecule bound at the proximal side of the heme in mutant Mb, replacing the coordinating histidine of WT Mb, although “ligand” refers to the diatomic molecule NO binding on the distal side.Preparation of the Samples—The H93G-Mb mutant of sperm whale was overexpressed and purified as described (19Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The expression was performed in the presence of imidazole. Removing of imidazole was achieved by ultrafiltration with successive concentration and dilution cycles in 5-kDa cut-off filters (Amicon). For exchange of the proximal substituents, the dilution was achieved with buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing the new substituent at final concentration that was 20 mm for imidazole, thiophene, and phenol, yielding the NO-6-coordinate heme, and it was 0.1 mm for the sample depleted in imidazole yielding an NO-5-coordinate heme. The samples were kept frozen (-80 °C) with a high concentration of imidazole, and the buffer exchange was performed immediately prior to the spectroscopic measurements.The solution of ferric Mb mutant (100 μl at a concentration of 50 μm) was put in a 1-mm optical path length quartz cell (Hellma 110-QX) sealed with a rubber stopper and degassed by means of four successive cycles of vacuum and purging with pure argon. The heme iron was reduced by the addition of 10 μl of degassed sodium dithionite solution (5 mm final concentration). For preparing the NO-liganded species, gas phase NO diluted to 1% in N2 (Alphagaz) was directly introduced into the spectroscopic cell by a syringe connected to the gas manifold, and a second silicone rubber stopper was stacked over the first one. The resulting NO concentration was 20 μm in the aqueous phase. Equilibrium spectra were recorded at each step for monitoring the evolution of ligation. Wild type myoglobin was similarly prepared from lyophilized powder (Sigma) dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The absorbance of the sample was in the range 0.7-1 at the Soret maximum of liganded protein for 1 mm.Soluble guanylate cyclase was purified from beef lung as described previously (6Negrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46815-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because it is directly purified in its ferrous state, no reducing agent was added. The final buffer was 25 mm triethanolamine, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and it was equilibrated with 1% NO gas phase in the same manner as Mb.Picosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy—Transient spectra were recorded simultaneously to kinetics as a time-wavelength matrix data, using the pump-probe laser system described previously (24Martin J.L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and allowing the use of a white light continuum for generating the broad band probe pulse. The photodissociation of NO was achieved with an excitation wavelength in the a band at 560 nm with a pulse duration of about 40 fs and a repetition rate of 30 Hz. The transient absorption spectrum after a variable delay between pump and probe pulses was recorded by a CCD detector. The same 1-mm sample cell was used for recording the equilibrium spectra and the kinetics. The sample was continuously moved perpendicularly to the laser beam during the recording, and the temperature was 18 °C. The 100-ps time window was scanned with a dwell time of 1 sat each time point, and up to 40 scans were averaged. The two first spectra containing the cross-phase modulation artifact were removed. Analyses of the data were performed by a singular value decomposition of the time-wavelength matrix (25Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, New York1988: 59-70Google Scholar), and the kinetics associated with the SVD components having the highest singular value were fit to a minimum number of exponential components. The maximum entropy method analysis was performed on the kinetics obtained from SVD analysis.Time-resolved Raman Spectroscopy—For sub-picosecond Raman spectroscopy, we used a femtosecond Ti:Sapphire oscillator pumped by a solid-state laser and producing 50-fs pulses (λ = 810 nm) subsequently amplified with a repetition rate of 1 kHz (26Cianetti S. Negrerie M. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13932-13933Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Negrerie M. Cianetti S. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The output beam was frequency doubled at 405 nm and used to provide tunable pump and probe beams by means of an optical parametric generator and two optical parametric amplifiers based on BBO crystals. The photodissociating pulse energy was about 2 μJ in a sample cell with a 100-fs duration and had a wavelength centered at 560 nm. Narrow band interference filters allowed us to obtain probe pulses at a wavelength of either 420 nm (for 5C species) or 435 nm (for 6C species) and to achieve the best compromise between spectral (30 cm-1) and temporal (0.6 ps) resolutions in time-resolved Raman measurements. The probe pulse energy was 20-30 nJ in the sample cell. The pump and probe beams were colinearly superimposed and focused on the sample, and the optical delay time between both pulses was controlled by a translation stage. Raman scattering light was collected through a spectrograph (Jobin-Yvon) by a CCD (Roper Scientific). The sample (100 μl) was placed in a cylindrical spinning cell whose gas phase contained the NO diluted in nitrogen. The integrity of the sample was verified after the experiment by recording its absorption spectrum in anaerobic conditions. Measurements were performed at 18 °C.The spectrum before photodissociation at -5 ps (in the presence of the pump pulse) is that of the pure liganded species and was subtracted from that after NO dissociation (at +3 ps). It was multiplied by a coefficient (0.6 for these measurements) to suppress the contribution from still liganded species and to obtain a difference spectrum corresponding to the pure transient H93G Mb photoproduct.Potential Energy Surfaces DFT Calculation—We have modeled potential energy surfaces by means of density functional calculations using the generalized gradient approximation (28Perdew J.P. Chevary J.A. Vosko S.H. Jackson K.A. Pederson M.R. Singh D.J. Fiolhais C. Phys. Rev.

Phys. 2000; 113: 7756-7764Crossref Scopus (8213) Google Scholar). To calculate the potential energy surface accurately, an extended basis set was used corresponding to a double-ζ plus two polarization functions (DNPP) as described elsewhere (23Franzen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16754-16759Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All calculations were performed at the High Performance Computing resource at the North Carolina State University. The potential energy surfaces were generated for low spin S = 1/2, intermediate spin S = 3/2, and high spin S = 5/2 forms for Im-FeP-NO and FeP-NO (used in the geometry optimization). The potential energy surface of the total higher spin states of the system is assumed to be relevant for the dissociated form at the transition state, although the low spin forms correspond to the ground bound state (23Franzen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16754-16759Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Franzen S. J. Phys. Chem. 2002; 106: 4533-4542Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The transition state is assumed to be in the geometry where the iron is in the heme plane of the (Im)-FeP-NO structures. The structures from the Protein Data Bank were compared by using the software Raster3D (33Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J.

The superposition of WT (35Kachalova G.S. Popov A.N. Bartunik H.D. Science. 1999; 284: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and mutant Mb (19Barrick D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) structures reveals only a slight rotation of the distal His-64. The absence of the proximal coupling between the heme and the backbone induces a relaxation of the helix end, leading to a slight change of the position of the peptide bonds 92-93 and 93-94. Compared with His-93, the exogenous imidazole, free from the constraint exerted by the helix F, appears rotated. The absorption spectra of unliganded WT and H93G-Mb(imidazole) are identical in both ferric and ferrous states. Fig. 2 depicts the five species depending upon the imidazole concentration, which are involved in the photodissociation experiments, and the steady-state spectra of the corresponding NO-liganded species are compared in Fig. 3A. When imidazole is the proximal substituent, the position of the maximum of the Soret band of NO-liganded mutant Mb depends upon concentration. In the presence of 20 mm imidazole (i.e. a concentration high enough for saturating the H93G-Mb at 50 μm), the absorption maximum is located at 418 nm when NO is bound (Fig. 3A). This wavelength is characteristic for an NO-6-coordinate species and is similar to that of WT Mb. Conversely, in the presence of 100 μm imidazole the binding of NO gives rise to a Soret maximum located at 399 nm, indicating that the equilibrium is displaced toward almost 100% NO-5-coordinate population. Indeed, this wavelength was observed for the endogenous NO receptor guanylate cyclase (6Negrerie M. Bouzhir L. Martin J.L. Liebl U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46815-46821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which is a 5-coordinate nitrosylated species. The spectrum of the sample containing 100 μm imidazole exhibits an isosbestic point at 408 nm and a shoulder around 420 nm because of a very minor remaining population of 6-coordinate nitrosylated species. These observations are in agreement with the value of KD = 0.7 mm for imidazole binding to the heme of the H93G-Mb at 295 K (22Decatur S.M. Franzen S. De Pillis G.D. Dyer R.B. Woodruff W.H. Boxer S.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4939-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2a, the five species of ferrous H93G Mb involved in this study are represented. The mutant H93G is purified in the presence of imidazole that remains bound at the proximal side of the heme both at 20 mm and 100 μm (a). However, because of the so-called “trans effect,” the affinity for imidazole changes after NO binding to Fe2+.At2 mm imidazole, it remains bound as the proximal substituent and the heme iron is 6-coordinate (b) giving a transient 5-coordinate species (d) after NO release. When the imidazole concentration is lower, the ligation of NO results in a 5-coordinate iron (c) that leads to a transient 4-coordinate species after photodissociation of NO (e). Fe* denotes an excited heme iron immediately after photodissociation (t < 1 ps), and GR stands for the geminate rebinding process.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Comparison of the absorption spectra of H93G mutant myoglobin reconstituted with three different proximal substituents and liganded with 1 mm CO and 2 μm NO. A, different imidazole concentrations were used, 100 μm and 20 mm for the NO-liganded species and 20 mm for the CO-liganded mutant. B, spectra of mutants in buffer containing 20 mm thiophene and 20 mmphenol and incubated either with [NO] = 20 μm or [CO] = 1mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the influence of the nature of the proximal substituent itself, we replaced imidazole by phenol and thiophene in H93G-Mb. The absorption spectra of the corresponding NO-liganded H93G-Mb are compared in Fig. 3B. Included are the spectra of the CO-liganded mutant to compare the influence on both NO- and CO-6-coordinate species. Dialyzing the H93G-Mb with either thiophene or phenol even at concentrations as high as 20 mm always leads to a 5-coordinate species in the presence of NO (Soret band at 398 nm) because of a weaker bond strength between these proximal substituents and the heme iron; this indicates a much larger KD value for these two substituents. The binding of CO to the imidazole-containing mutant only gives rise to the 6-coordinate species with a Soret band located at 421 nm. Similarly, CO does not displace thiophene or phenol but induces a slight shift to the Soret maximum at 418 nm, like for the 6C-NO species, indicating that whatever the substituent the proximally uncoupled 6-coordinate heme is slightly electronically perturbed, which is likely due to the relaxation of constraints within the heme pocket.Geminate Rebinding of Nitric Oxide—Fig. 4 presents the transient absorption spectra associated with the geminate rebinding of NO after photodissociation from global analysis of the 100-ps data matrix. These SVD spectral components in Fig. 4 correspond to the highest singular value (27Negrerie M. Cianetti S. Vos M.H. Martin J.L. Kruglik S.G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and contain only a minor contribution from the excited electronic states relaxation that occurs in the 2-3-ps time-range (9Petrich J.W. Poyart C. Martin J.L.

The H93G mutant is supplemented with 20 and 0.1 mm imidazole yielding a 6- and a 5-coordinate heme, respectively, and is compared with wild type myoglobin and with H93G mutant in the presence of 20 mm thiophene or 20 mm phenol. Only the differential spectra in the presence of 20 mm imidazole matches the equilibrium difference absorption spectra of unliganded Mb minus NO-liganded Mb. B, comparison of transient spectra from SVD analysis associated with the geminate rebinding for three proteins: WT myoglobin (solid line), H93G mutant myoglobin with 100 μm imidazole (dashed line), and soluble guanylate cyclase (dotted line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The four substituted H93G-Mb mutants are compared with the WT Mb. More importantly, in the presence of 20 mm imidazole, the transient spectrum is very similar to that of WT Mb (Fig. 4A), with a bleaching maximum located at 418-420 nm and an induced absorption centered at 438 nm. This transient spectrum corresponds to the steady-state difference spectrum NO-liganded minus unliganded species and is thus characteristic of the photodissociation of an NO-6-coordinate ground state species with subsequent NO rebinding to a 5-coordinate photoproduct.In contrast, for the lower imidazole concentration (100 μm), the difference spectrum possesses a minimum of bleaching at 400 nm shifted with respect to H93G-Mb at high imidazole concentration and a maximum of absorption at 434 nm. The bleaching at 400 nm corresponds to an NO-5-coordinate heme before photodissociation, and the NO rebinding should therefore occur to a 4-coordinate heme. Its transient spectrum is compared with that of guanylate cyclase (Fig. 4B) for which the photodissociation of NO induces a bleaching at 394 nm and creates a 4-coordinate transient species whose induced ab"

The N terminus of the protein contains a PDZ and a proline-rich domain, two motifs known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. By using the yeast two-hybrid approach, we screened for proteins that interact with the N terminus of rPDZRhoGEF. The light chain 2 of microtubule-associated protein 1 (LC2) was the only protein identified from the screen that does not contain a type I PDZ-binding motif at its extreme C terminus (-(S/T)Xφ-COOH, where φ is a hydrophobic amino acid). However, the C terminus does conform to a type II-binding motif (-φXφ). We report here that rPDZRhoGEF interacts with LC2 via the PDZ domain, and the interaction is abolished by mutations in the carboxylate-binding loop. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed using GST fusion protein pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitations. Expression of rPDZRhoGEF mutants that are unable to interact with proteins via the carboxylate-binding loop induced changes in cell morphology and actin organization. These mutants alter the activation of RhoGTPases, and coexpression of dominant-negative RhoGTPases prevent the morphological changes. Furthermore, in cells expressing wild type rPDZRhoGEF, drug-induced microtubule depolymerization produces changes in cell morphology that are similar to those induced by rPDZRhoGEF mutants. These results indicate that modulation of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of rPDZRhoGEF through interaction with microtubule-associated protein light chains may coordinate microtubule integrity and the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton.

This coordinated action of the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons is essential for the development and maintenance of neuronal polarity. RhoGTPases play an important role in the regulation of several cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, gene transcription, and cell cycle progression. The best studied effect of RhoGTPases is the regulated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for cell motility (1Hall A.

In fibroblasts, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 induce the formation of stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (5Ridley A.J. Hall A.

In neurons, it is generally believed that activation of RhoA induces neurite retraction and growth inhibition (9Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morri N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J.

Members of the small RhoGTPase family are active in the GTP-bound form, and hydrolysis of GTP returns them to the inactive state. This cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state is controlled by regulatory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PDZ, PSD-95/DlgA/Zo-1-binding domain; MAP, microtubule associated protein; DH, Dbl homology; RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAK, p21-activated kinase; WT, wild type; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RBD, Rho-binding domain; rPDZRhoGEF, rat PDZRhoGEF; AD, activation domain. catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, whereas GTPase-activating proteins enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoGTPases, leading to GTP hydrolysis and inactivation. To date more than 30 GEFs have been identified, and they show different tissue-specific distribution patterns and distinct specificity for Rho, Rac, or Cdc42. Therefore, particular expression profiles of Rho proteins and their regulators can fine-tune the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and determine the basic morphology of specific cell types. Typically, GEFs are large multidomain proteins that are tightly regulated to control their function. They all possess a Dbl homology (DH) domain that is found in tandem with a pleckstrin homology domain. The DH domain is responsible for catalytic activity (14Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the pleckstrin homology domain directs the subcellular localization (15Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo Gonzalez G. Kay R.

Several GEF family members also contain various domains that mediate protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions, which couple GEFs to upstream regulators or downstream effectors. Rat PDZRhoGEF (rPDZRhoGEF), initially termed GTRAP48, was identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen of an adult rat cDNA library as a protein that interacts with the C terminus of EAAT4, a neuronal glutamate transporter (18Jackson M. Song W. Liu M.-Y. Jin L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Lin C.-L.G. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Sternweis P.C. Rohtstein J.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It is the orthologue of KIAA0380/PDZRhoGEF/GEF11. The presence of a regulator of the G protein signaling (RGS) domain that interacts with activated α subunits of G12/G13 classified rPDZRhoGEF as a member of the novel RhoGEF subfamily, which includes p115-RhoGEF and leukemia-associated RhoGEF. However, we previously found that the ability of rPDZRhoGEF to activate RhoA was not enhanced when combined in vitro with Gα13 (19Wells C.D. Liu M.-Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), in contrast to leukemia-associated RhoGEF (20Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and p115-RhoGEF (21Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis O.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Yet when the RGS domain of p115-RhoGEF was replaced with that of rPDZRhoGEF, Gα13 was found to increase the Rho exchange activity of the chimeric protein, similar to wild type p115RhoGEF (19Wells C.D. Liu M.-Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, differences that lie outside the RGS domains of rPDZRhoGEF and p115-RhoGEF must explain the different responses to Gα13. rPDZRhoGEF, but not p115-RhoGEF, possesses an N-terminal PDZ domain and a proline-rich domain, two motifs known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Therefore, to further elucidate how the RhoGEF activity may be regulated, we sought to identify proteins that interact with the N terminus of rPDZRhoGEF. Here we report that the PDZ domain of rPDZRhoGEF interacts with microtubule-associated light chain 2 and that the interaction can modulate the activation of RhoGTPases. Our results suggest that the rPDZRhoGEF/MAP1ALC2 interaction provides a link between microtubule dynamics and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell polarity and directed neurite outgrowth. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The N-terminal rPDZRhoGEF bait (amino acid residues 1-186) was constructed by PCR amplification using primers that introduced EcoRI restrictions sites. The fragment generated was cloned into the EcoRI site of pGBKT7 in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Clontech). The bait plasmid was introduced into yeast strain Y190 by the lithium acetate-mediated method. Yeast expressing the bait protein was sequentially transformed with an adult rat brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library constructed in pACT2 (Clontech), and plated on SD agar deficient in leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Colonies grew in 3-6 days and were picked and screened for β-galactosidase activity as per the manufacturer's instructions. pGADT7-T and pGBKT-53 were used as control prey and bait, respectively. Plasmids—The GAL4(AD)-LC2ct deletions were constructed using GAL4(AD)-LC2ct145 as template and PCR primers that introduced EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. Full-length LC2 and LC1 were amplified using Quickclone cDNA (Clontech) as template. The generated fragments were cloned into EcoRI/XhoI restriction sites of pACT in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain (AD). The GAL4(DB)-rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186) deletions were amplified using GAL4(DB)-rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186) as template and PCR primers that introduced EcoRI restriction sites. The resulting fragments were cloned into EcoRI restriction site of pGBKT7. The GAL4(DB)-rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186) and pRK5-myc-rPDZRhoGEF mutants were constructed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as directed. EcoRI/XhoI inserts of pACT-LC2ct145, -LC2ct111, and -LC2ct39 were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-3T (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain plasmids for the expression of GST fusion proteins. Plasmids encoding HA-tagged dom inant-negative RhoA(TN19), Rac1(TN17), and Cdc42(T17N) and constitutively active RhoA(G14V) were obtained from Donald Guthrie Foundation. Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-MAP1 clone HM-1, mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin TUB2.1, mouse monoclonal anti-MAP1 light chain clone E12 (LC1), anti-actin clone AC-40 (all from Sigma), goat polyclonal anti-MAP-1B (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-rPDZRhoGEF, mouse anti-c-Myc (Ab-1) (Calbiochem), monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance), mouse anti-RhoA (Pierce), and mouse anti-Cdc42 (Pierce). The secondary antibodies used were as follows: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Cappel), TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep antimouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), and horseradish peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblotting—Cerebellum from E14 to P18 Wistar rat pups were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)) with a Teflon glass homogenizer. Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie-Plus Reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). Protein samples were resolved by denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS/T, 20 mm Tris, 17 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, with 0.1% v/v Tween 20). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity-purified rabbit anti-rPDZRhoGEF (1:200), anti-MAP1A (1:1000), anti-LC1 (1:1000), anti-MAP1B (1:200), anti-tubulin (1:1000), and anti-actin (1:500) in blocking buffer. After washing with TBS/T, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG in blocking buffer (1:3000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GST Binding Assays—GST or GST-LC2 fusion proteins were expressed and extracted from Escherichia coli strain BL21 and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Adult mouse brains were rapidly dissected and homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer. Triton X-100 was added to 1% (v/v) and homogenate rotated for 2 h at 4°C before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris. The soluble material was added to GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations—Adult mouse brains were rapidly dissected and homogenized. Triton X-100 was added to 1% (v/v) and homogenate rotated for 2 h at 4 °C before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min to remove cellular debris. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and 5 μg of anti-MAP1A antibody (Sigma) or 5 μg of mouse IgG1 (Sigma) was added and rotated overnight at 4 °C. 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. 48 h after transfection HeLa cells were solubilized with 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer for 2 h at 4°C with rotation and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. 5 μg of mouse IgG1 or 5 μg of anti-HA antibody was added to 0.5 ml of supernatant and rotated overnight at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein G (Sigma) was added and mixed for 2 h at 4 °C. All beads were washed four times, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting. Cell Culture and Transfection—For microscopic observation, cells were plated onto coverslips in 35-mm dishes and transfected with 1 μg (unless stated otherwise) of each DNA construct using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For GTPase pull-down assays, cells were grown in 90-mm dishes and transfected with 4 μg of each DNA construct. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Neuro2a cells were grown in minimum essential media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Fixation and Immunofluorescence Staining—At 24 h post-transfection HeLa cells were serum-starved for 12 h and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. At 24 h post-transfection, Neuro2a cells were differentiated for 24-36 h by replacing media with Opti-MEM containing 300 nm Bt2cAMP, 10 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.4% v/v Triton X-100 for 15 min, blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with primary antibody (1:50) in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum, anti-c-Myc (Calbiochem), anti-HA (Covance), or anti-rPDZRhoGEF. Secondary antibodies used were FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech). FITC-conjugated phalloidin was used to stain F-actin (Sigma). Individual coverslips were treated with 3 μm nocodazole (Sigma) for 2 h before fixation. Data collected were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. GTPase Pull-down Assay—pRK5-myc-tagged-rPDZRhoGEF constructs were expressed in HeLa cells. After 24 h of expression, cells were serum-starved for 12 h before being lysed according to the manufacturer's instructions (EZ-Detect RhoGTPase activation assay; Pierce). Lysates were centrifuged to remove debris and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-Sepharose loaded with either 400 μg of GST-rhotekin-RBD (Rho-binding domain) or 20 μg of GST-PAK1-PBD (p21-binding domain). Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted using anti-RhoA and anti-Cdc42 antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Rat PDZRhoGEF Interacts with the Light Chains of Microtubule-associated Protein 1—To further elucidate the neuronal function of rPDZRhoGEF, we searched for N-terminal interacting proteins. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using an adult rat brain library and the first 186 amino acids of rPDZRhoGEF fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DB) as bait. We screened 1 × 106 clones and sequenced 30 of the 132 confirmed positive clones. The only clone that did not possess a type I PDZ-binding motif at the extreme C terminus (-(S/T)Xφ-COOH, where φ is a hydrophobic amino acid) corresponded to the last 145 residues of light chain 2 of microtubule-associated protein 1A (LC2). MAP1A, like MAP1B, is a multimeric protein that is translated as a polyprotein precursor and post-translationally modified to produce a heavy and a light chain (22Langkopf A. Hammarback J.A. Muller R. Vallee R.B. Garner C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The light chains of MAP1 are interchangeable, with LC1 and LC2 being able to bind to both MAP1A and MAP1B heavy chains (23Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the C terminus of LC2 (LC2ct145), the region pulled out in the yeast two-hybrid screen, shares the most extensive sequence identity with LC1 (Fig. 1A), we determined whether LC1 could also interact with rPDZRhoGEF in the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that full-length LC1 cDNA fused to the GAL4(AD) grew on dropout media, and quantification of β-galactosidase activity using the o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside assay revealed that both LC1 and LC2 interact strongly with the N terminus of rPDZRhoGEF (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the yeast interaction was confirmed as expression of T7 fused to GAL4(AD) yielded no growth on dropout media or β-galactosidase activity when coexpressed with GAL4(DB)-rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186). Similarly, no interaction was observed between the control bait pGBKT-53 and any MAP light chain construct (data not shown). It is known that expression of MAP1B increases during early stages of neuronal development and then drops to lower levels (24Binder L.I. Frankfurter A. Kim H. Caceres A. Payne M.R. Rebhun L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5613-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Calvert R. Anderton B.H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), whereas MAP1A exhibits a reciprocal pattern of expression, reaching its peak in the adult brain when neuronal differentiation is complete (23Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L. Obar R. Vallee R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1712-1730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Garner C.C. Garner A. Huber G. Kozak C. Matus A. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We determined the developmental expression pattern of rPDZRhoGEF in the cerebellum by Western blot analysis. We found that rPDZRhoGEF is expressed early in development, with levels increasing during the postnatal period and maintained into adulthood (Fig. 1C). Our results confirm the switch between LC1 and LC2 expression during development. The antibody used to detect LC2 was in fact an antibody raised against MAP1B. However, the epitope lies within the conserved C terminus of the light chains, and by using transfected cells we confirmed that the antibody does recognize both LC1 and LC2 (supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore, it is possible that rPDZRhoGEF may switch interacting partners from LC1 to LC2 during development. The C Terminus of LC2 Is Required for Interaction with rPDZRhoGEF but Is Not Sufficient—To map the region on LC2 required for interaction with rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186), we generated N- and C-terminal deletions (Fig. 2). Deletion of the last 39 residues of LC2ct145 abolished the interaction with GAL4(DB)-PDZRhoGEF-(1-186). Shortening the deleted region to just the last 18 residues did not restore the interaction, suggesting that the C terminus of LC2 is required for the interaction with rPDZRhoGEF. However, the C terminus is not sufficient for interaction as the last 39 amino acids fused to GAL4(AD) failed to show β-galactosidase activity. Deleting the N terminus of GAL4(AD)-LC2ct145 also resulted in less robust β-galactosidase activity, suggesting that a tertiary conformation of the C terminus, conferred by the N terminus, is required for a strong interaction. Confirmation of the Interaction of LC2 with rPDZRhoGEF Using in Vitro and in Vivo Pull-down Assays—To confirm the specificity of the rPDZRhoGEF-LC2 interaction in systems other than yeast, we first performed GST pull-down assays. A GST fusion protein for LC2ct145 and GST alone were expressed and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Lysates from adult mouse brain were applied to beads, and after extensive washing the bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. rPDZRhoGEF was found to bind to GST-LC2ct145 but not to GST alone (Fig. 3A). Subsequently a GST fusion protein for the N-terminally truncated construct LC2ct111, which was shown to interact with rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186) in the yeast system, was also found to pull down rPDZRhoGEF, but a GST fusion protein of the last 39 residues (GST-LC2ct39) did not (Fig. 3B). We also determined whether rPDZRhoGEF interacts with MAP1A and LC2 in vivo. rPDZRhoGEF was immunoprecipitated from adult mouse brain lysate using a specific anti-MAP1A antibody, whereas a mouse IgG1 failed to immunoprecipitate rPDZRhoGEF (Fig. 3C). Similarly, antibodies against the HA epitope were able to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged LC2 and rPDZRhoGEF from transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3D). Although in the yeast two-hybrid assay the N terminus rPDZRhoGEF was shown to interact with both LC2 and LC1, we have so far been unable to coimmunoprecipitate rPDZRhoGEF from P1 brain homogenates using the specific anti-LC1 antibody. Nevertheless, because of the poor efficiency of the anti-LC1 antibody in immunoprecipitating LC1 (data not shown), we cannot rule out the possibility that rPDZRhoGEF also interacts with LC1 in vivo. LC2 Interacts with the PDZ Domain of rPDZRhoGEF—The yeast two-hybrid assay was used to identify the region of rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186) that interacts with LC2. Deletion of the last 26 residues, which encompass the proline-rich region, failed to abolish the interaction with GAL4(AD)LC2ct145 (Fig. 4A) as did site-directed mutagenesis of the multiple proline residues to alanines (data not shown). The initial 60 N-terminal residues were not able to interact and not required for interaction, but when the PDZ domain was expressed, strong β-galactosidase activity was observed. Therefore, although the extreme C terminus of LC2 does not contain a type I PDZ-binding motif, unlike all the other interacting clones pulled out in the yeast two-hybrid screen, LC2 does interact with the PDZ domain of rPDZRhoGEF. This places the PDZ domain of rPDZRhoGEF into an expanding group of PDZ domains that can recognize more than one class of binding motif. It is known that some PDZ domains can interact with both type I- and type II-binding motifs (27Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Dev K.K. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41393-41397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), with internal type I ligands (29Shieh B.H. Zhu M.Y. Neuron. 1996; 16: 991-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and with target sequences that adopt a β-hairpin structure (30Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that the extreme C terminus of LC2 (-IEF) and LC1 (-IEL) conform to a type II consensus PDZ-binding motif (-φXφ). There are also several potential internal PDZ ligands (-STV, -TVV, and -VVM) within the last 18 residues that were identified previously as being essential for interaction (Fig. 2). Site-directed mutagenesis of the residues at positions P0 and P-2 of LC2ct145 to -AEA, -AEE, or EEE failed to abolish growth on dropout media (-L/T/H + 30 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole), but the amino acid substitutions did drastically reduce β-galactosidase activity, indicating that the interaction was severely compromised (Fig. 4B). This is in contrast to clones possessing a type I-binding motif, as both the growth on dropout media and β-galactosidase activity were completely abolished when residues at positions P0 and P-2 were mutated to alanines (data not shown). No effect on protein interaction was observed when the internal PDZ ligands were mutated. These results show that the PDZ domain of rPDZRhoGEF recognizes both type I- and type II-binding motifs, but for type II motifs a tertiary conformation appears to play a critical role. PDZ Carboxylate-binding Loop Required for Interaction with LC2—PDZ domains are believed to function by binding the target protein in a structurally conserved groove, termed the carboxylate-binding loop. The first residue of a carboxylate-binding loop is almost always an arginine or a lysine, and a conserved glycine-rich loop is also critical for C-terminal peptide binding. Specificity for type I peptide binding is determined by interaction of the S/T hydroxyl side chain at the -2 position with the positively charged histidine side chain at the base of α2 helix. In the case of the PDZ domain of rPDZRhoGEF, the carboxylate-binding loop contains a lysine residue and a GFGF motif (Fig. 5A). To identify residues that are critical for interaction with LC2, we mutated conserved residues within the PDZ domain of GAL4(DB)-rPDZRhoGEF-(1-186), and we examined the ability to interact with GAL4(AD)LC2ct145. We also investigated the ability of PDZ mutants to interact with the clones pulled out that possessed a type I-binding motif (Fig. 5B). Mutation of phenylalanine 76 to alanine (F76A) completely abolished the interaction with LC2ct145 and with proteins possessing type I PDZ ligands ((S/T)Xφ). The single lysine to alanine mutation (K69A) had no deleterious effect on any protein interaction, but the double mutant K69A/D70A interacted very weakly with LC2ct145 and PDZ type I clones. However, the histidine to glycine mutation (H119G) in the α2 helix had no effect on the interaction with LC2ct145, but it did completely abolish the interaction with clones possessing type I PDZ ligands. These results indicate that the same core residues in the carboxylate-binding loop are important for interaction with type I and type II moti"

This is consistent with its location on the periphery of the complex. Different pathways of translocation allow nucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins to be imported and sorted to their final destinations in the chloroplast. First, precursor proteins containing envelope transit peptides are recognized and translocated by the Toc (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of the chloroplast)-Tic (translocon at the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast) complex. Once in the stroma of the chloroplast and usually after processing to remove the envelope transit peptide, proteins are sorted to the different subcompartments of the chloroplast. Thylakoid lumen proteins bearing N-terminal signal peptides are translocated across the thylakoid membrane using either the Tat (twin arginine translocon) pathway or the Sec (homolog of the bacterial secretory pathway) pathway (1Jarvis P. Robinson C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1064-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The Tat translocation machinery operates by binding the twin arginine signal peptide of the substrate protein, which is then transported in a folded state, using the thylakoid ΔpH as the driving force (2Robinson C. Bolhuis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Proteins whose signal peptides lack the twin arginine motif are transported in an unfolded conformation by the Sec machinery, utilizing ATP hydrolysis (3Dalbey R.E. Chen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membrane proteins are inserted by different mechanisms: the SRP (signal recognition particle) pathway or the apparently “spontaneous” pathway (1Jarvis P. Robinson C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1064-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The SRP pathway appears to be a specialized mechanism for the insertion of many members of the light-harvesting complex superfamily and requires binding of SRP to the substrate, GTP hydrolysis, and the assistance of proteins FtsY and Alb3 (4Luirink J. Sinning I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 17-35PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the “spontaneous” insertion pathway operates without detectable assistance from other proteins and in the absence of both the thylakoidal ΔpH or nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis (5Michl D.

Nature. 2003; 426: 630-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). PSI-G is involved in the regulation of electron transport from plastocyanin to the reaction center P700, and it stabilizes the PSI complex (11Zygadlo A. Jensen P.E. Leister D. Scheller H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Study of the homologous PSI-K subunit, which has a similar structure, revealed that PSI-K inserts “spontaneously” into the thylakoid membrane (7Mant A. Woolhead C.A. Moore M. Henry R. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36200-36206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The topology of PSI-G was difficult to solve, because the stromal loop strongly resists degradation by proteases, unlike that of PSI-K (7Mant A. Woolhead C.A. Moore M. Henry R. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36200-36206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Rosgaard L. Zygadlo A. Scheller H.V. Mant A. Jensen P.E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, study of the insertion mechanism and the role of the positive charges present in the loop suggest interesting features. Insertion of PSI-G does not require proteins present in stromal extract or hydrolysis of NTPs, suggesting that SRP and its partners FtsY and Alb3 are not involved. Furthermore, PSI-G inserts into trypsin-treated thylakoids, indicating that the insertion of PSI-G does not need stromally exposed protein factors such as those involved in the Sec and Tat pathways and strongly suggesting that PSI-G inserts directly into the thylakoid membrane.Previous work on “spontaneously” inserting proteins did not investigate the influence of positive charges on the insertion in the membrane (5Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A.

We investigated the influence of the number of positive charges present in the loop upon the insertion of PSI-G in the membrane. Altering the number and distribution of positive charges clearly affected the topology and insertion of PSI-G. Correct insertion of PSI-G depends on intrinsic constraints on the cis and trans sides of the membrane. Furthermore, two-dimensional blue native gel analysis of thylakoid membranes after chloroplast import showed that the newly inserted, radiolabeled PSI-G is assembled into PSI immediately after insertion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—A full-length cDNA clone encoding the precursor of Arabidopsis PSI-G (pPSI-G) and the mature size protein (PSI-G) were previously cloned in the Promega pGEM4Z vector (12Rosgaard L. Zygadlo A. Scheller H.V. Mant A. Jensen P.E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this construct was carried out using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in the mutants shown in Fig. 4A. Each PCR product was digested with restriction enzyme DpnI before transformation of Escherichia coli cells. All mutated plasmids were sequenced to verify the mutations and integrity of the PSI-G coding sequence.In Vitro Import Assays—The various PSI-G constructs were transcribed in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase and then translated in a wheat germ lysate system (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in the presence of [3H]leucine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intact pea chloroplasts were isolated from pea seedlings (var. Kelvedon Wonder), and assays for in vitro import of precursor proteins into intact pea chloroplasts and isolated thylakoid membranes were essentially as described (14Robinson C. Mant A. Gilmartin P. Bowler C. Molecular Plant Biology. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2002: 123-146Google Scholar) except that the light intensity during import was 300 μmol of photon/m2/s. For the nigericin treatment, the proton ionophore nigericin (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and used at a final concentration of 2 μm in the presence of 10 mm KCl; control samples were identical, except they contained an equivalent volume of ethanol instead of nigericin. Assays to measure the effect of apyrase (Sigma, type VI) were carried out as described (15Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All of the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.Postimport Treatment of Thylakoid Membranes—In order to test whether PSI-G was correctly inserted in the thylakoid membrane (either after import into intact chloroplasts or after insertion into isolated thylakoid membranes), thylakoid membranes (between 10 and 20 μg of chlorophyll (Chl) depending on the experiment) were washed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2 (HM) and reisolated by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Next, the membranes were resuspended in HM and digested with 0.2 mg ml-1 trypsin (Sigma, type XIII) in a final volume of 100 μl for 30 min on ice. Trypsin digestions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 mg ml-1 trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type I-S), followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Finally, the thylakoid membranes were resuspended in 15 μl of HM containing 5 μg of trypsin inhibitor and an equal volume 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and then immediately boiled for 5 min. Urea washes of thylakoids were performed using 6.8 m urea, according to a protocol adapted from Ref. 16Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and described in detail (15Thompson S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Insertion efficiencies were analyzed using fluorography and quantification of the resulting protein bands using gel scanning densitometry.Proteolytic Treatment of Thylakoid Membranes before Insertion Assays—The protocol was as described (5Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Isolated thylakoids were resuspended in HM buffer containing 25 mm KCl and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The thylakoids were exposed to light of intensity 220 μmol of photon m-2 s-1 for 8 min at 4 °C in order to restore the ΔpH and then washed and resuspended in HM buffer for trypsin treatment. After treating the thylakoids with 60 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma, type XIII) for 10 min on ice, the digestion was stopped by the addition of 120 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma, type I-S), and the thylakoids were reisolated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The thylakoids were washed twice in HM containing 60 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and finally resuspended in stromal extract or HM buffer. Each sample contained thylakoids equivalent to 20 μg of Chl, 0.5 mm MgATP, and 10 μl of translation mixture, all buffered by HM (final volume, 50 μl). Stromal extract, when present, was at a concentration equivalent to 1.3 times the Chl concentration. The thylakoid import assay was carried out under a green safe light, for 30 min at 26 °C.Two-dimensional Blue Native Gel Analysis—After import of pPSI-G into chloroplasts, the organelles were fractionated into stromal extract and thylakoid membranes. The thylakoid fraction was centrifuged at 1700 × g for 5 min in a cooled microcentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in ACA buffer (750 mm aminocaproic acid, 50 mm bis-tris, pH 7, 0.5 mm EDTA) to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. An equal volume of 2% (w/v) β-dodecyl maltoside in ACA buffer was added, resulting in a final concentration of 1% β-dodecyl maltoside. The sample was solubilized for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and one-quarter of the final solubilized volume of loading buffer (5% (w/v) Serva blue G, 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 35% sucrose) was added to the solubilized sample. To separate the thylakoid complexes according to size (first dimension gel), solubilized thylakoids corresponding to 20 μg of Chl were loaded per lane on a 6-13.5% blue native polyacrylamide gel (17Kügler M. Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Photosynthesis Res. 1997; 53: 35-44Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). After the first dimension run, the lane was cut out of the gel and submerged in denaturing solution (2% (w/v) SDS, 2% (w/v) dithiothreitol) and denatured for 25 min at 60 °C. The denatured blue native PAGE lane was placed on top of a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were separated according to size.RESULTSATP Requirement for PSI-G Insertion—In general, membrane proteins are inserted into the thylakoid membrane by two mechanisms: an SRP-dependent mechanism that requires stromal extract containing SRP and NTPs required for the action of both SRP and FtsY or the “spontaneous” pathway (1Jarvis P. Robinson C. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1064-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the mechanism of insertion of PSI-G, direct thylakoid insertion assays were performed under varying conditions. For these assays, we used a mature sized radiolabeled PSI-G, because the extensive N-terminal envelope transit peptide would presumably interfere with the translocation of the N-terminal region across the membrane.Thylakoids and the wheat germ translation mixture were preincubated with apyrase in order to hydrolyze all NTPs present. Thylakoid insertion assays were performed in the presence of stroma (+S), in the absence of stroma (-S), and in the presence of stroma depleted of NTPs with apyrase (+S+Ap) (Fig. 1). As a positive control for apyrase activity, we analyzed the Sec-dependent import of the 33-kDa oxygen-evolving complex protein (33K), whose import into thylakoids is totally dependent on ATP hydrolysis (18Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is located in the lumen, so the protein is protected from the trypsin treatment of thylakoid membranes (Fig. 1C, T+ lanes). We used the intermediate form of 33K (i33K), which lacks the envelope transit peptide, for thylakoid imports in the presence of apyrase. During the import of i33K into thylakoids, a signal peptide was removed to yield the mature form of the protein, 33K (Fig. 1C, lane +S). The translocation of i33K through the membrane was blocked when stromal extract was treated with apyrase (Fig. 1C, lane +S+Ap), indicating that the apyrase had hydrolyzed the stromal NTPs. As a further control, we imported the Tat substrate p23K, a luminal subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex, which is transported in the complete absence of NTPs (18Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3251-3256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows a trypsin-resistant, mature sized band in all of the T+ tracks, indicating that 23K was correctly processed and transported into the lumen. A similar pattern is observed in the case of PSI-G (Fig. 1A); a trypsin-resistant, mature sized band is visible in each of the T+ tracks, suggesting that PSI-G can insert into the membrane in the presence or absence of stromal extract and in the absence of hydrolyzable NTPs. The stromal loop connecting the two transmembrane spans of PSI-G is unusually resistant to trypsin treatment (12Rosgaard L. Zygadlo A. Scheller H.V. Mant A. Jensen P.E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), in contrast to the homologous PSI-K, for which trypsin digestion of the membrane-inserted protein results in two distinct degradation products (7Mant A. Woolhead C.A. Moore M. Henry R. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36200-36206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The decrease of signal between the T and T+ lanes is due to the fact that the signal in the T lane is composed of both noninserted (peripherally bound) and inserted proteins. The noninserted fraction was associated with the membrane, probably due to the high hydrophobicity of PSI-G. This fraction was digested to a degradation product DP when the thylakoids were treated with trypsin. The remaining fraction of PSI-G in the T+ lanes was the protein that was inserted in the thylakoid membrane. Overall, this experiment demonstrates that stromal proteins and NTPs are not required for the insertion of PSI-G into the thylakoid membrane.FIGURE 1Insertion of PSI-G is not dependent on nucleoside triphosphates. A, fluorography of SDS-polyacrylamide gels after thylakoid import of PSI-G. DP, the degradation product of PSI-G. B, p23K, which is known to be transported in the absence of NTPs. C, i33K, whose transport is known to be totally dependent on NTP hydrolysis. Thylakoid proteins corresponding to 30 μg of Chl were resuspended either in stroma (+S) or HM buffer (-S) or in stroma containing 2 units of apyrase (+S+Ap). Apyrase was added to the translation mixture separately before the thylakoid import assay. After incubation for 10 min on ice, the import mixtures were transferred to an illuminated water bath, and experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples were analyzed directly (T) or after trypsin treatment of the thylakoid membrane (T+). The translation mixture (Tr) was digested by trypsin (Tr+) to distinguish the different degradation products between the inserted and noninserted proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Does PSI-G Insertion Require the Proton Gradient?—To further analyze the energetics of PSI-G targeting, we tested whether its thylakoid insertion is stimulated by the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. Intact chloroplast import assays were performed in the presence or absence of nigericin (Fig. 2), a proton ionophore that dissipates the proton gradient (ΔpH). We compared the insertion of PSI-G with that of pLhcb1 (the major light-harvesting complex apoprotein; Fig. 2B), which is a substrate for the chloroplast SRP pathway and whose insertion is partially inhibited when the ΔpH is dissipated (19Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of nigericin, insertion of Lhcb1 into the thylakoid membrane (lane T+) was reduced by ∼44% (as quantified by densitometry), in agreement with previously published data (19Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Brock I.W. Mills J.D. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1657-1662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Reduction in the amount of thylakoid inserted protein was accompanied by an accumulation of Lhcb1 in the stromal fraction (Fig. 2B, + nigericin, lane S). By contrast, the insertion of PSI-G was unaffected by the presence of nigericin (compare A, + nigericin, lane T+). Similarly, nigericin had no inhibitory effect upon the insertion of PSI-G into isolated thylakoids (data not shown). This demonstrates that the insertion of PSI-G does not depend upon the proton gradient. The nigericin completely blocked insertion of the 23K standard Tat substrate (not shown) as found in previous work (19Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol.

For this experiment, intact pea chloroplasts were incubated with in vitro translated (Tr) pPSI-G and pLhcb1 in the absence (-nigericin) or in the presence of the proton ionophore nigericin (+nigericin) at 2 μm final concentration. After the import assay of pPSI-G (panel A) and pLhcb1 (panel B), the chloroplasts (C) were digested with thermolysin (C+) to degrade the nonimported proteins. Chloroplasts were then fractionated into stromal (S) and thylakoid membrane (T) fractions. The thylakoid membranes were also treated with trypsin (T+) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Does PSI-G Use a Translocase for Its Insertion in the Thylakoid Membrane?—It has been shown previously that the Sec, Tat, and SRP pathways can all be blocked by pretreating isolated thylakoids with trypsin (7Mant A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4059-4066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As another means to test whether PSI-G utilizes any of these pathways, thylakoid membranes were treated with trypsin (lanes T+), washed, and resuspended in stroma containing trypsin inhibitor before the thylakoid import assay of mature PSI-G (Fig. 3A). As controls, pPsbW (Fig. 3B), p23K (Fig. 3C), and p33K (Fig. 3D) were also incubated with the trypsin-pretreated thylakoids. p23K is a substrate for the Tat translocase and as shown above requires the proton gradient (ΔpH) for its translocation through the thylakoid membrane. Trypsin-pretreated thylakoids can generate a proton gradient in the dark if the chloroplast ATPase is first activated by bright illumination and reduction (by dithiothreitol) and then supplied ATP during the assay (14Robinson C. Mant A. Gilmartin P. Bowler C. Molecular Plant Biology. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2002: 123-146Google Scholar). This proton gradient supports the import of p23K into non-trypsin-treated thylakoids in the dark (Fig. 3C, Control, lane T+), but import is abolished by the trypsin pretreatment (Trypsin, lane T+). Similarly, transport of the Sec substrate, p33K, into the thylakoid lumen is prevented by trypsin pretreatment of thylakoids (Fig. 3D, Trypsin, lane T+).

Despite inactivation of the known translocases, PSI-G can likewise insert into trypsin-pretreated thylakoids, suggesting that its insertion does not require a translocase (Fig. 3A, Trypsin, lane T+).FIGURE 3Insertion of PSI-G does not require a thylakoidal translocase. PSI-G (A), pPsbW, which is known to insert “spontaneously” (B), p23K, which requires the Tat translocase (C), and p33K, which uses the Sec pathway (D), were incubated with thylakoid membranes (Control) or with thylakoid membranes that had been predigested with 60 μg/ml trypsin (Trypsin) under conditions that retain the thylakoidal proton gradient (ΔpH) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” After the thylakoid import assay, thylakoid membranes were analyzed directly (T) and after tryspin treatment (T+). The translation mixture (Tr) was digested by trypsin (Tr+) to distinguish the different degradation products (DP) between the inserted and noninserted proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Positive Charge Mutants in PSI-G—The topology of PSI-G was initially difficult to establish, because the loop region is unexpectedly inaccessible to the proteases. Despite the presence of six positively charged residues in the stromal loop, trypsin does not cleave the protein even when used at high concentrations (12Rosgaard L. Zygadlo A. Scheller H.V. Mant A. Jensen P.E. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Apparently, the loop is tightly bound, presumably within the stromal face of PSI, and we considered it possible that this factor may provide an indication of the assembly state of the protein. In order to determine which part of the loop is responsible for protein-protein interactions between PSI-G and other unknown protein or the PSI-B subunit of PSI, a series of PSI-G mutants were generated with a particular focus on the six positive charges present in the loop of WT PSI-G. Positive charges play a role in electrostatic interactions between proteins and furthermore influence the topology of membrane proteins (25Gavel Y. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Five different PSI-G mutants were generated (Fig. 4A) and imported into intact chloroplasts (Fig. 4B). After import, the chloroplasts were thermolysin-treated to remove the nonimported proteins bound to the envelope membranes, and the chloroplasts were fractionated into stroma and thylakoid samples.

This first vestibular cellular model thus constitutes a valuable system to further investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling ionic transports in the inner ear and the pathophysiological consequences of their dysfunctions in vertigo and hearing loss. The inner ear or labyrinth, houses organs responsible for hearing and balance. The organ of Corti, within the cochlea, transduces sounds, whereas the maculae, in the saccule and utricle, and the ampullae of the semicircular canals, transduce linear and angular accelerations, respectively. These complex sensorineural epithelia are composed of sensory hair cells and their supporting cells, and of various nonsensory epithelia. The basolateral side of the membranous labyrinth is bathed by perilymph, an extracellular fluid whose chemical composition is similar to that of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Apically, the fluid that bathes the hair bundles of sensory cells is the endolymph that has a unique composition among mammalian extracellular fluids. It is a K+-rich fluid (170 mm), almost devoid of Na+ (1 mm), with a lumen positive transepithelial potential. Homeostasis of the volume, pressure, and electrochemical composition of endolymph is pivotal for the transformation of sound into nerve impulse through the apical transduction channels of the sensory hair cells. Thus, dysfunctions in transport systems involved in the homeostasis of K+ and Na+ concentrations in endolymph might be responsible for vertigo and hearing loss such as Ménière disease (for review, see Ref. 1Ferrary E. Sterkers O. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1998; 65: S98-S103PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular models of endolymph secretion by the stria vascularis in the cochlea (for review, see Ref. 2Wangemann P. Liu J. Marcus D.C. Hear. Res. 1995; 84: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and by the dark cells in the vestibule, have been proposed, mainly on in vitro studies. It is well estabbased lished that basolateral Na+, K+-ATPase and Na-K-2Cl cotransport are responsible of K+ entry into the endolymph secretory cells; K+ is then secreted at the apical side of the cell by a large K+ conductance, stimulated by DIDS (2Wangemann P.

The location of the cochlea, within the temporal bone, combined with the intricate structures of the stria vascularis, render it experimentally difficult to obtain data concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in the in vivo production of endolymph and the regulation of its ionic composition. Furthermore, the multicellular organization of the stria vascularis as well as the communication between different cell types, are strong limitations to study these transport systems at the cellular and molecular levels. Until now, only a few cell lines derived from the secretory cells of the inner ear have been characterized (12Achouche J. Liu D.S. Tran Ba Huy P. Huy P.T. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 1991; 100: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Agrup C. Berggren P.O. Kohler M. Spangberg M.L. Bagger-Sjoback D. Hear.

Res. 1998; 123: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and, probably because of the high specificity of these cells and their dedifferentiation in culture, no main results have been subsequently published following the first characterization of these cell lines. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a new immortalized cell line from the ampulla of the semicircular canal. In this structure, in contrast to the cochlea, the endolymph secretory cells are the dark cells that form a single cell type monolayer; the composition of endolymph (with the exception of the high positive endocochlear potential), and the transport systems involved in endolymph secretion are similar to those described in the cochlea (15Wangemann P. Audiol. Neurootol. 2002; 7: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because several immunocytochemical studies and steroid binding assays have suggested that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was expressed in the inner ear (16Rarey K.E. Luttge W.G. Hear. Res. 1989; 41: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we used a targeted oncogenesis strategy in transgenic mice using the proximal P1 promoter of the human MR (hMR) gene to drive expression of the immortalizing SV40 large T antigen (TAg) in this tissue. Thus, our transgenic animals enabled us to derive several novel cell lines originating from normally MR-expressing tissues, including brown fat, brain, lung, sweat glands, liver, and kidney (17Le Menuet D. Viengchareun S. Muffat-Joly M. Zennaro M.C. Lombes M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 217: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the EC5v cell line that constitutes to our knowledge the first differentiated cellular model derived from the ampulla of the semicircular canal. We aimed at deciphering at the cellular and molecular levels the mechanisms involved in the homeostasis of K+ and Na+ in endolymph. We showed that this new cellular model expressed mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors and that vestibular cells are direct targets of corticosteroid hormone actions. Interestingly, EC5v cells are highly differentiated polarized epithelial cells that generated a high transepithelial resistance and promoted K+ secretion and Na+ absorption. We also demonstrated the presence of a functional apical IsK/KvLQT1 potassium channel that is implicated in K+ secretion under standard culture conditions but more importantly is involved in the maintenance of the high K+ gradient when the apical side of cells were exposed to high K+, low Na+ endolymph-like fluid. Under these physiological asymmetric culture conditions, steady state levels of KvLQT1 mRNA were drastically reduced, underlying an unrecognized transcriptional control of this potassium channel expression by extra- and intracellular ionic composition of the inner ear. Generation of Transgenic Mice by Targeted Oncogenesis—P1-TAg transgene containing the immortalizing SV40 large T Antigen (TAg) under the control of the proximal promoter (P1) of the human mineralocorticoid receptor gene was generated as previously described (18Zennaro M.C.

Establishment of the EC5v Cell Line—Several cell lines were derived from the inner ear of a 4-week-old transgenic mouse. In particular, the ampulla of the semicircular canal, the lateral wall, the stria vascularis, and the organ of Corti were microdissected under a microscope, transferred into a collagen I-coated 12-well plate (Institut J. Boy, Reims, France), and cultured in the following medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 20% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). This medium was removed every 2 days for 2 weeks, until the appearance of a monolayer of cells, which were selected for their epithelioid morphology and the immunodetection of the SV40 TAg in their nucleus. Among these cells, the EC5v cell line, originating from the ampulla of the semicircular canal, was further characterized. The EC5v cell line was subcloned by limited dilution to obtain a homogeneous cell population and was routinely cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 within an epithelial medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), 2 mm glutamine, 50 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), 50 nm sodium selenite (Sigma), 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France), 2 nm triiodothyronine (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2% fetal calf serum. EC5v cells were utilized from passage 30 to 40. Hormones, Drugs, and Chemicals—Aldosterone was purchased from Acros Organics (Noisy le Grand, France), whereas amiloride, bumetanide, mifepristone (RU486), ouabain, and spironolactone were purchased from Sigma. Clofilium tosylate was obtained from ICN Biochemicals Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, except when stated. Cell Culture—EC5v cells were seeded on either collagen I-coated Transwell/Snapwell filters (Costar Corp., Brumath, France) or collagen I-coated Petri dishes with the epithelial medium. To study corticosteroid actions, epithelial medium was replaced by a minimum medium having the same composition as the epithelial medium with omission of dexamethasone and fetal calf serum. For some experiments, the medium bathing the apical surface of the cells cultivated on Transwell filters was replaced by an artificial endolymphatic medium composed of 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2,35mm KHCO3, 125 mm KCl, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Immunocytochemical Analyses—Cells were generally cultured on glass coverslides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed for 5 min with PBS, and then permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The presence of the SV40 TAg protein was detected in the nucleus using a 1:10 dilution of the monoclonal anti-SV40 TAg antibody (Ab-2; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Pan-cytokeratins (C2562, Sigma), α1 Na+, K+-ATPase, ZO-1, IsK (gift of J. Barhanin), and KvLQT1 (gift of J. Barhanin) immunodetection was performed on cells cultivated onto Transwell filters, incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:200, 1:50, 1:250, 1:2000, and 1:500 primary antibody dilutions, respectively. Secondary antibodies (Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit, or Alexa 533 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Cergy-Pontoise, France) were used at a 1:200 dilution and incubated 1 h at room temperature. Micrographs of these immunocytochemical analyses were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Electron Microscopic Analyses—EC5v cells were grown on Transwell filters with complete epithelial medium. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and fixed for 30 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in PBS, postfixed with 1% osmic acid for 15 min, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in EPON 812 (Fluka, St. Quentin, France). Ultrathin sections were realized on transversely oriented confluent cells and examined with a Jeol JEM 1010 electron microscope. Western Blot Analyses—Total protein extracts were prepared from EC5v cells cultured in the epithelial medium on collagen I-coated Petri dishes or Transwell filters. Briefly, cells were washed twice with icedcold PBS and lysed on ice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, and 2% Nonidet P-40 supplemented, just before use, with 1 μm pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were sonicated and cleared from insoluble material by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined by the modified Bradford method and 60 μg of total protein were directly submitted to SDS-PAGE. After protein blotting on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blots were incubated overnight in 5% milk-Tris buffer saline, 0.1% Tween before incubation with the rabbit anti-α,-β,-γ ENaC antibodies (1:5000), with the rabbit anti-IsK (1:750) or with the rabbit anti-KvLQT1 antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washes, membranes were incubated with a goat peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:8000) for1hat room temperature and proteins were visualized by use of the ECL+ detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Whole Cell Binding Assays—Specific binding of [3H]aldosterone and [3H]dexamethasone was determined in EC5v cells grown on a collagen I-coated 12-well plate. Cells were grown for 48 h in epithelial medium before incubation overnight in minimum medium. Then, cells were incubated for 1 h, at 37 °C, with 10 nm [3H]aldosterone (1739 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), or with 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone (1517 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of the MR antagonist spironolactone or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486. Cells were rinsed with cold 1× PBS before steroid extraction by the addition of cold ethanol (200 μl followed by 100 μl). Radioactivity of the ethanol extracts was measured with a liquid scintillation β counter (Wallac Pharmacia, Orsay, France). Specific [3H]steroid binding was determined from the difference between total and nonspecific binding and was expressed as femtomole/mg of protein. Measurement of the 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2 Catalytic Activity—EC5v cells were seeded at 6 × 105 cells per well on a collagen I-coated 12-well plate and cultured for 48 h in epithelial medium before incubation overnight in minimum medium. To permeabilize cells, plates were frozen at -80 °C and thawed at room temperature (3 cycles). Then, EC5v cells were incubated at 37 °C with 10 nm [3H]corticosterone (B) (2590 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 1 mm NAD or (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Time-dependent production of [3H]dehydrocorticosterone (A) was measured by HPLC as previously described (20 μl of supernatant was collected and 80 μl of HPLC mobile phase (methanol/H2O, 1:1) containing 100 nm unlabeled corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone as internal standards were added). The amount of steroid metabolite generated per well was normalized by the amount of protein, determined by the Bradford method after homogenization of cells in the lysis buffer. Results are expressed as femtomoles of 11-dehydrocorticosterone produced per hour per microgram of protein per well (fmol/h/μg of protein). RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations and RNA were thereafter processed for RT-PCR. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was treated using the DNase I Amplification Grade procedure. RNA was then reverse-transcribed with 200 units of reverse transcriptase using the Superscript™ II kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations using random hexamers (Promega). PCR were performed with a thermocycler (Stratagene, Paris, France) in a final volume of 25 μl, in 1× PCR buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of sense and antisense primers, 200 μm dNTP, 1 unit of Taq Platinum, and 2 μl of the reverse transcription reaction. The PCR cycles were as followed: 95 °C for 5 min, specific hybridization temperature for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, during 1 cycle; 95 °C for 45 s, specific hybridization temperature for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, during 30 cycles; 72 °C for 7 min, during 1 cycle. Amplicons were thereafter separated onto 2% agarose gels and visualized under UV excitation.

Total RNA, extracted as described above, was processed for real time PCR carried out on an ABI 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was treated using the DNase I Amplification Grade procedure. The amount of total RNA present in each sample was thereafter measured by the Ribogreen kit (Interchim). RNA was then reverse-transcribed as described above. Samples were diluted 10-fold, then 1/20 of the reverse transcription reaction was used for PCR using the qPCR™ Mastermix Plus for Sybr™ Green I (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). PCRs were performed in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, and 1.25 unit of Hot Goldstar DNA polymerase. Final primer concentrations were 300 nm for each primer (see Table 1). PCR reagents were from Eurogentec. Reaction parameters were 50 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 ° C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. For preparation of standards, amplicons were purified from agarose gel and subcloned into pGEMT-easy plasmid (Promega), then sequenced to confirm the identity of each fragment. Standard curves were generated using serial dilutions of linearized standard plasmids, spanning 5 orders of magnitude and yielding correlation coefficients >0.98 and efficiencies of at least 0.95, in all experiments. Standard and sample values were determined in duplicate from independent experiments. Relative expression within a given sample was calculated as the ratio: attomoles of specific gene/femtomol of 18 S. Results are mean ± S.E. and present the relative expression compared with that obtained with control cells, which was arbitrary set at 1. Electrophysiologic Studies—The measurement of the short-circuit current (Isc, μA/cm2), transepithelial potential (VT, mV), and transepithelial resistance (RT, Ω× cm2) were performed on EC5v cells grown on collagen I-coated Snapwell filters as described previously (20Blot-Chabaud M. Laplace M. Cluzeaud F. Capurro C. Cassingena R. Vandewalle A. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 367-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, Snapwell filters were incubated overnight in epithelial medium. They were then mounted into a voltage system (Costar Corp.). Cells were bathed on each side with 8 ml of epithelial medium thermostated at 37 °C. At time 0, the drug was added at the apical or the basolateral side of the filter; in some experiments, the apical medium was replaced by an endolymph-like solution (K = 160 mm). After a 30-min period, the voltage current was used to measure Isc by clamping the transepithelial potential to 0 mV for 1 s. Ions Measurements—Cells were seeded on collagen I-coated Transwell filters and were cultured for 5 days in the epithelial medium. Thereafter, medium was replaced for 24 h by fresh epithelial medium with or without drugs. In some experiments, the apical medium was an endolymph-like solution (see above). The day after, 400 μl of the supernatant was recovered from the medium bathing the apical and basolateral surface of the EC5v cells. K+,Na+, and Cl- ions were thereafter measured by the “Centre d'Expérimentation Fonctionnelle Intégrée” of the IFR Claude Bernard on an Olympus automate. 86Rb Transport—EC5v cells (∼106) were seeded on Transwell filters (12 mm diameter) and cultured for 5 days in the epithelial medium. The day of the experiment, medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 185 kBq/well of 86Rb (Amersham Biosciences, 18.5-370 MBq/mg of Rb), either in the basolateral (1.5 ml) or apical (0.5 ml) compartment. The time course of Rb flux was evaluated by sampling 5 μl at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min at the apical or basolateral sides for determination of basolateral to apical flux and apical to basolateral flux, respectively. For each filter, radioactivity was determined in duplicate. In some experiments, at t = 0, drugs were added at the basolateral or apical side of the epithelium. Radioactivity was counted by scintillation counting in 2 ml of scintillation liquid (Lumagel, Lumac-LSC). Fluxes (nmol/cm2) were calculated as a function of the K+ concentration and the specific radioactivity, assuming that Rb+ is a strict marker of K+ and corrected for the filter area. Results are expressed as the mean of at least 6 independent filters. Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Student's t test or analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparison posttest (indicated as ANOVA) were used to determine significant differences among groups. Regression line slopes were compared by t test. Statistical significance was achieved for a p value ≤0.05. Generation of the EC5v Cell Line and Morphological Features of the Cells—By using a targeted oncogenesis strategy, we were able to generate a new cell line derived from microdissected ampulla of a transgenic mouse. Confluent EC5v cells grown on plastic support were cuboid and formed numerous domes (Fig. 1A). Electron microscopic analyses revealed that these cells formed a monolayer of epithelial cells, when grown on filters (Fig. 1B), and presented tight junctions, desmosomes, and apical microvilli, which are typical features of polarized cells (Fig. 1C). Immunocytochemical studies also indicated that EC5v cells presented a typical network of cytokeratins (Fig. 1E) and the tight junctionassociated protein ZO-1 at the cell periphery (Fig. 1G). Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that EC5v cells expressed the α1Na+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 1F). As expected, we showed that this cell line was immortalized by the SV40 TAg, as revealed by the immunodetection of this oncoprotein in the nuclear compartment of cells (Fig. 1D). Molecular Characterization of the Transport Systems in EC5v Cells—We first examined the expression of genes known to be involved in potassium transport in the inner ear. In particular, we analyzed by RT-PCR whether EC5v cells expressed transcripts of the IsK/KvLQT1 potassium channel. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B (left panels), a 296-amplicon for IsK and a 439-amplicon for KvLQT1 were detected in EC5v cells. Western blot analysis provided evidence that IsK proteins were also detected as ∼17-, 27-, and 35-kDa species (Fig. 2A, right panel). It is worth noting that the culture conditions, i.e. filter versus Petri dish, seem to influence the relative ratio between protein band species that are likely to correspond to various glycosylated forms of IsK (21Lesage F. Attali B. Lakey J. Honore E. Romey G. Faurobert E. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Receptors Channels. 1993; 1: 143-152PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, KvLQT1 was also detected in these cells by confocal microscopy experiments, as presented in Fig. 2B (right panel) with a cytoplasmic and/or submembrane staining. Interestingly, the three subunits of ENaC were also expressed at both mRNA (Fig. 2C, left panels) and protein levels (Fig. 2C, right panels) indicating that EC5v are epithelial cells that possess all the molecular elements required to ensure both potassium and sodium transport. EC5v Cells Are Sensitive to Corticosteroid Hormone Action—Becau"
https://openalex.org/W2081105946,"Acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) gene on chromosome 21 is involved in several chromosomal translocations, including t(8;21) and t(16;21), that produce chimeric fusion proteins AML1-eight twenty-one (ETO) and AML-myeloid transforming gene chromosome 16 (MTG16), which contribute to leukemogenesis. The molecular basis for the leukemogenic effects of these fusion proteins is incompletely understood. Using gel-shift assay, we showed that AML1-ETO and AML1-MTG16 bound to a series of AML1 consensus DNA-binding sites with different affinities. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we demonstrated that a fusion of AML1 with ETO or MTG16 exhibits reduced intranuclear mobility compared with wild-type AML1 or either fusion partner. The dimerization domain (nervy homology region 2) of ETO is responsible for the reduced mobility of AML1-ETO. Dual FRAP studies revealed that CBFbeta colocalized with AML1-ETO within the nucleus, resulting in reduced mobility of CBFbeta. Therefore, AML1 fusion proteins may interfere with normal AML1 function due to aberrant nuclear dynamics, which leads to spatial and temporal sequestration of CBFbeta and perhaps other coregulators critical for myeloid differentiation."
