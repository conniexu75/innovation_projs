https://openalex.org/W1963705823,"Active nuclear import of protein is controlled by nuclear localization signals (NLSs), but nuclear export is not understood well. Nuclear trafficking of the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) is critical for regulation of gene expression. The heat-stable inhibitor (PKl) of cAPK contains a nuclear export signal (NES) that triggers rapid, active net extrusion of the C-PKl complex from the nucleus. This NES (residues 35-49), fused or conjugated to heterologous proteins, was sufficient for rapid nuclear export. Hydrophobic residues were critical. The NES is a slightly weaker signal than the SV40 NLS. A sequence containing only residues 37-46, LALKLAGLDI, is also sufficient for nuclear export. This is an example of a protein-based NES having no obvious association with RNA. A similar sequence, LQLPPLERLTL, from Rev, an RNA-binding protein of HIV-1, also is an NES."

We have studied the control of Ca(2+)-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases (CSMDHs) by monitoring mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m) and the redox state of flavoproteins and pyridine nucleotides simultaneously with [Ca2+]c in single hepatocytes. Oscillations of [Ca2+]c induced by IP3-dependent hormones were efficiently transmitted to the mitochondria as [Ca2+]m oscillations. Each [Ca2+]m spike was sufficient to cause a maximal transient activation of the CSMDHs and [Ca2+]m oscillations at frequencies above 0.5 per minute caused a sustained activation of mitochondrial metabolism. By contrast, sustained [Ca2+]c increases yielded only transient CSMDH activation, and slow or partial [Ca2+]c elevations were ineffective in increasing [Ca2+]m or stimulating CSMDHs. We conclude that the mitochondria are tuned to oscillating [Ca2+]c signals, the frequency of which can control the CSMDHs over the full range of potential activities."
https://openalex.org/W1977455576,"The results of previous in vitro experiments indicate that a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein may play an important role in the guidance of temporal retinal axons during the formation of the topographically ordered retinotectal projection. We have purified and cloned a GPI-anchored, 25 kDa glycoprotein that is a good candidate for a molecule involved in this process. During the time of innervation by retinal ganglion cells, this protein is gradedly expressed in the posterior part of the developing tectum. In two different in vitro assay systems, the recombinant protein induces growth cone collapse and repulsion of retinal ganglion cell axons. These phenomena are observed for axons of temporal as well as nasal origin, indicating that an additional activity may be necessary to confer the nasotemporal specificity observed in previous assays. We named the protein RAGS (for repulsive axon guidance signal). The sequence of RAGS shows significant homology to recently identified ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases of the Eph subfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2027151723,"The sphingomyelin pathway, which is initiated by sphingomyelin hydrolysis to generate the second messenger ceramide, signals apoptosis for tumor necrosis factor alpha, Fas, and ionizing radiation. In the present studies, the anticancer drug daunorubicin also stimulated ceramide elevation and apoptosis in P388 and U937 cells. Cell-permeable analogs of ceramide, but not other lipid second messengers, mimicked daunorubicin in inducing apoptosis. Daunorubicin-stimulated ceramide elevation, however, did not result from sphingomyelin hydrolysis, but rather from de novo synthesis via activation of the enzyme ceramide synthase. An obligatory role for ceramide synthase was defined, since its natural specific inhibitor, fumonisin B1, blocked daunorubicin-induced ceramide elevation and apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that ceramide synthase activity can be regulated in eukaryotes and constitute definitive evidence for a requirement for ceramide elevation in the induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1984755886,"Topographic maps with a defined spatial ordering of neuronal connections are a key feature of brain organization. Such maps are believed to develop in response to complementary position-specific labels in presynaptic and postsynaptic fields. However, the complementary labeling molecules are not known. In the well-studied visual map of retinal axons projecting to the tectum, the labels are hypothesized to be in gradients, without needing large numbers of cell-specific molecules. We recently cloned ELF-1 as a ligand for Eph family receptors. Here, RNA hybridization shows matching expression gradients for ELF-1 in the tectum and its receptor Mek4 in the retina. Binding activity detected with alkaline phosphatase fusions of ELF-1 and Mek4 also reveals gradients and provides direct evidence for molecular complementarity of gradients in reciprocal fields. ELF-1 and Mek4 may therefore play roles in retinotectal development and have properties predicted of topographic mapping labels."

https://openalex.org/W2000657327,"Yeast RAD51 gene functions in genetic recombination and DNA double-strand break repair. In vitro, in the presence of ATP and replication protein A, RAD51 protein pairs single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and catalyzes strand exchange between the synapsed DNA partners. Electron microscopic analyses show that RAD51 forms helical filaments on both ssDNA and dsDNA, in which the DNA is highly extended. However, results presented here indicate that only the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is functionally relevant. Strand exchange is arrested when heterology is encountered in the duplex partner, and analysis of the configuration of the terminal joint thus formed reveals that pairing and strand exchange initiate at the 5' end of the complementary strand in the linear duplex, a reaction polarity opposite to that of the bacterial prototype RecA."
https://openalex.org/W1966083612,"Pollen tubes elongate directionally in the extracellular matrix of pistil tissues to transport the male gametes from the apically located stigma to the basally located ovary for fertilization. The molecular mechanisms underlying directional pollen tube growth in the pistil are poorly understood. We have purified a glycoprotein, TTS, from tobacco stylar transmitting tissue, which supports pollen tube growth between the stigma and the ovary. TTS proteins belong to the arabinogalactan protein family, and they polymerize readily in vitro in a head-to-tail fashion into oligomeric forms. TTS proteins stimulate pollen tube growth in vitro and attract pollen tubes grown in a semi-in vivo culture system. In vivo, the pollen tube growth rate is reduced in transgenic plants that have significantly reduced levels of TTS proteins as a result of either antisense suppression or sense cosuppression. These results identify TTS protein as a pistil component that positively contributes to pollen tube growth."

https://openalex.org/W2110789340,"HIV-1 Rev is the prototype of a class of retroviral regulatory proteins that induce the sequence-specific nuclear export of target RNAs. This function requires the Rev activation domain, which is believed to bind an essential cellular cofactor. We report the identification of a novel human gene product that binds to not only the HIV-1 Rev activation domain in vitro and in vivo but also to functionally equivalent domains in other Rev and Rex proteins. The Rev/Rex activation domain-binding (Rab) protein occupies a binding site on HIV-1 Rev that precisely matches that predicted by genetic analysis. Rab binds the Rev activation domain when Rev is assembled onto its RNA target and can significantly enhance Rev activity when overexpressed. We conclude that Rab is the predicted activation domain-specific cofactor for the Rev/Rex class of RNA export factors."
https://openalex.org/W2036182319,"Tumor cells in patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) are characterized by a genetic hypermutability caused by defects in DNA mismatch repair. A subset of HNPCC patients was found to have widespread mutations not only in their tumors, but also in their non-neoplastic cells. Although these patients had numerous mutations in all tissues examined, they had very few tumors. The hypermutability was associated with a profound defect in mismatch repair at the biochemical level. These results have implications for the relation between mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, and they suggest that mismatch repair deficiency is compatible with normal human development."

https://openalex.org/W2064088317,"In plant sexual reproduction, pollen tubes elongate from the stigma, through the stylar transmitting tissue, to the ovary of the pistil to deliver the male gametes for fertilization. TTS protein is a tobacco transmitting tissue glycoprotein shown to attract pollen tubes and promote their growth. Here, we show TTS proteins adhere to the pollen tube surface and tips, suggesting that they may serve as adhesive substrates for pollen tube growth. TTS proteins are also incorporated into pollen tube walls and are deglycosylated by pollen tubes, suggesting that they may provide nutrients to this process. Within the transmitting tissue, TTS proteins display a gradient of increasing glycosylation from the stigmatic end to the ovarian end of the style, coincident with the direction of pollen tube growth. These results together suggest that the TTS protein-bound sugar gradient may contribute to guiding pollen tubes from the stigma to the ovary."

https://openalex.org/W2010015418,"The S. pombe cdc15 gene is essential for cell division. cdc15ts mutants do not form a septum, but growth and nuclear division continue, leading to formation of multinucleate cells. The earliest step in septum formation and cytokinesis, rearrangement of actin to the center of the cell, is associated with appearance of hypophosphorylated cdc15p and formation of a cdc15p ring, which colocalizes with actin. Loss of cdc15p function impairs formation of the actin ring. The abundance of cdc15 mRNA varies through the cell division cycle, peaking in early mitosis before septation. Expression of cdc15 in G2-arrested cells induces actin rearrangement to the center of the cell. These data implicate cdc15p as a key element in mediating the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022546848,"The HIV-1 Rev protein increases the cytoplasmic levels of unspliced and singly spliced target transcripts in metazoan systems. Based on experiments that indicate a similar function of Rev in the yeast S. cerevisiae, we have identified a yeast protein that interacts with the effector domain of Rev. The protein, Rip1p, is a novel small nucleoporin-like protein, some of which is associated with nuclear pores. Its closest known yeast relative is a nuclear pore component also implicated in mRNA transport from nucleus to cytoplasm. Analysis of strains that overexpress Rip1p or that are deleted for the RIP1 gene show that Rip1p is important for the effect of Rev on gene expression, indicating that the physical interaction is of functional significance in vivo. The results suggest that Rev directly promotes the cytoplasmic transport of suitable transcripts by targeting them to the nuclear pore."

https://openalex.org/W2017009317,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective-tissue disorder characterized by skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular defects of highly variable expressivity. The diagnosis relies solely on clinical criteria requiring anomalies in at least two systems. By excluding the chromosome 15 disease locus, fibrillin 1 (FBN1), in a large French family with typical cardiovascular and skeletal anomalies, we raised the issue of genetic heterogeneity in MFS and the implication of a second locus (MFS2). Linkage analyses, performed in this family, have localized MFS2 to a region of 9 centiMorgans between D3S1293 and D3S1283, at 3p24.2–p25. In this region, the highest lod score was found with D3S2336, of 4.89 (θ=0.05). By LINKMAP analyses, the most probable position for the second locus in MFS was at D3S2335."

https://openalex.org/W1969213324,"Genetic configurations resulting in high ratios of beta-tubulin to alpha-tubulin are toxic in S. cerevisiae, causing microtubule disassembly and cell death. We identified three non-tubulin yeast genes that, when overexpressed, rescue cells from excess beta-tubulin. One, RBL2, rescues beta-tubulin lethality as efficiently as does alpha-tubulin. Rbl2p binds to beta-tubulin in vivo. Deficiencies or excesses of either Rbl2p or alpha-tubulin affect microtubule-dependent functions in a parallel fashion. Rbl2p has functional homology with murine cofactor A, a protein important for in vitro assays of beta-tubulin folding. The results suggest that Rbl2p participates in microtubule morphogenesis but not in the assembled polymer."
https://openalex.org/W2014572115,"OPTIMIZATION models have been widely and successfully used in evolutionary ecology to predict the attributes of organisms1á¤-6. Most such models maximize darwinian fitness (or a component of fitness) in the face of trade-offs and constraints; the numerical results usually depend on the exact form of the trade-offs/constraints. Here we report the first (to our knowledge) numerical optimum for life-history evolution which is independent of the details of the underlying trade-off, for a large array for trade-off forms. The rule is that at small litter sizes, the range in offsping size is inversely proportional to the size of the litter. Details of the offspring-survival/offspring-size trade-off7á¤-10 set the value of the proportionality constant, but the á¤-1 exponent, the inverse proportionality itself, is universal. Studies of life histories have yielded many empirical examples of universality for various scaling exponents6 (for example, adult lifespan scales as ≈0.25 with adult body mass within many taxa); this is an example of the numerical value of an exponent (here á¤- 1) emerging from a life-history model as independent of all but a few general features of the underlying economic structure."

https://openalex.org/W2063083243,"The leu-500 mutation can be suppressed in S. typhimurium topA. Previous studies have demonstrated that the plasmid-borne leu-500 minimal promoter cannot be activated in topA mutants unless adjacent (< 250 bp) transcription occurs away from the leu-500 promoter (short-range promoter interaction). To search for a potential upstream promoter responsible for activation of leu-500 in the chromosomal context, we have identified the ilvlH promoter, located 1.9 kb upstream of leu-500 (long-range promoter interaction). Different from short-range promoter interaction, which is abolished by DNA sequence insertions, the long-range promoter interaction is mediated by the intervening DNA sequence. These studies suggest that the long-range interaction between a pair of divergently arrayed promoters is probably mediated by a complex process involving relay of DNA supercoiling by the DNA sequence located between the two promoters."
