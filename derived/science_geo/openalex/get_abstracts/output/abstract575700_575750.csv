https://openalex.org/W2561535772,"A very focused function for lncRNAs The human genome generates many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). A very small number of lncRNAs have been shown to be functional. Liu et al. carried out a large-scale CRISPR-based screen to assess the function of ∼17,000 lncRNAs in seven different human cell lines. A considerable number (∼500) of the tested lncRNAs influenced cell growth, suggesting biological function. In almost all cases, though, the function was highly cell type—specific, often limited to just one cell type. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.aah7111"

Prettyman et al. used neutron and gamma-ray spectroscopy from the Dawn spacecraft to peer below Ceres' surface and map the subsurface composition. They found evidence for water ice across the dwarf planet, with water making up a larger fraction of the material near the poles than around the equator. Together with their measurements of other elements, these results aid our understanding of Ceres' composition and constrain models of its formation. Science , this issue p. 55"
https://openalex.org/W2560980003,"Poised for the second step of splicing In eukaryotes, noncoding sequences in transcribed precursor mRNA are cut out by a dynamic macromolecular machine, the spliceosome. This involves two sequential reactions. The first cuts one end of the noncoding intron and loops it back on itself to form an intron lariat, and the next excises the intron and ligates the coding mRNA. Insights into the first step of splicing have come from the structures of two intermediates: the Bact complex, which is primed for catalysis, and the C complex, which is formed after the first splicing reaction. Yan et al. now report a high-resolution structure of the step II catalytically activated spliceosome (the C* complex). This structure shows conformational changes that position catalytic motifs to accomplish the second splicing reaction. Science , this issue p. 149"

Construction of the ribosome itself involves several molecular machines and an army of helper proteins and RNAs.

The structure reveals how the processome helps in the maturation of individual domains of the ribosome and suggests that the mechanism involves a molecular motor to drive conformational changes.

https://openalex.org/W2564659821,"Background Exaggerated or simplistic news is often blamed for adversely influencing public health. However, recent findings suggested many exaggerations were already present in university press releases, which scientists approve. Surprisingly, these exaggerations were not associated with more news coverage. Here we test whether these two controversial results also arise in press releases from prominent science and medical journals. We then investigate the influence of mitigating caveats in press releases, to test assumptions that caveats harm news interest or are ignored. Methods and Findings Using quantitative content analysis, we analyzed press releases (N = 534) on biomedical and health-related science issued by leading peer-reviewed journals. We similarly analysed the associated peer-reviewed papers (N = 534) and news stories (N = 582). Main outcome measures were advice to readers and causal statements drawn from correlational research. Exaggerations in press releases predicted exaggerations in news (odds ratios 2.4 and 10.9, 95% CIs 1.3 to 4.5 and 3.9 to 30.1) but were not associated with increased news coverage, consistent with previous findings. Combining datasets from universities and journals (996 press releases, 1250 news), we found that when caveats appeared in press releases there was no reduction in journalistic uptake, but there was a clear increase in caveats in news (odds ratios 9.6 and 9.5 for caveats for advice and causal claims, CIs 4.1 to 24.3 and 6.0 to 15.2). The main study limitation is its retrospective correlational nature. Conclusions For health and science news directly inspired by press releases, the main source of both exaggerations and caveats appears to be the press release itself. However we find no evidence that exaggerations increase, or caveats decrease, the likelihood of news coverage. These findings should be encouraging for press officers and scientists who wish to minimise exaggeration and include caveats in their press releases."
https://openalex.org/W2561499239,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are long noncoding transcripts (>200 nt) from the intergenic regions of annotated protein-coding genes. We report here that the lincRNA gene lincRNA-Tnfaip3, located at mouse chromosome 10 proximal to the tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein 3 (Tnfaip3) gene, is an early-primary response gene controlled by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling in murine macrophages. Functionally, lincRNA- Tnfaip3 appears to mediate both the activation and repression of distinct classes of inflammatory genes in macrophages. Specifically, induction of lincRNA-Tnfaip3 is required for the transactivation of NF-κB-regulated inflammatory genes in response to bacterial LPSs stimulation. LincRNA-Tnfaip3 physically interacts with the high-mobility group box 1 (Hmgb1), assembling a NF-κB/Hmgb1/lincRNA-Tnfaip3 complex in macrophages after LPS stimulation. This resultant NF-κB/Hmgb1/lincRNA-Tnfaip3 complex can modulate Hmgb1-associated histone modifications and, ultimately, transactivation of inflammatory genes in mouse macrophages in response to microbial challenge. Therefore, our data indicate a new regulatory role of NF-κB-induced lincRNA-Tnfaip3 to act as a coactivator of NF-κB for the transcription of inflammatory genes in innate immune cells through modulation of epigenetic chromatin remodeling.-Ma, S., Ming, Z., Gong, A.-Y., Wang, Y., Chen, X., Hu, G., Zhou, R., Shibata, A., Swanson, P. C., Chen, X.-M. A long noncoding RNA, LincRNA-Tnfaip3, acts as a coregulator of NF-κB to modulate inflammatory gene transcription in mouse macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2561522913,"Malaria transmission is in decline in some parts of Africa, partly due to the scaling up of control measures. If the goal of elimination is to be achieved, additional control measures including an effective and durable vaccine will be required. Studies utilising the prime-boost approach to deliver viral vectors encoding the pre-erythrocytic antigen ME-TRAP (multiple epitope thrombospondin-related adhesion protein) have shown promising safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in sporozoite challenge studies. More recently, a study in Kenyan adults, similar to that reported here, showed substantial efficacy against P. falciparum infection. One hundred and twenty healthy male volunteers, living in a malaria endemic area of Senegal were randomised to receive either the Chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) ME-TRAP as prime vaccination, followed eight weeks later by modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) also encoding ME-TRAP as booster, or two doses of anti-rabies vaccine as a comparator. Prior to follow-up, antimalarials were administered to clear parasitaemia and then participants were monitored by PCR for malaria infection for eight weeks. The primary endpoint was time-to-infection with P. falciparum malaria, determined by two consecutive positive PCR results. Secondary endpoints included adverse event reporting, measures of cellular and humoral immunogenicity and a meta-analysis of combined vaccine efficacy with the parallel study in Kenyan adults.We show that this pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine is safe and induces significant immunogenicity, with a peak T-cell response at seven days after boosting of 932 Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/106 Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMC) compared to 57 SFC/ 106 PBMCs in the control group. However, a vaccine efficacy was not observed: 12 of 57 ME-TRAP vaccinees became PCR positive during the intensive monitoring period as compared to 13 of the 58 controls (P = 0.80). This trial confirms that vaccine efficacy against malaria infection in adults may be rapidly assessed using this efficient and cost-effective clinical trial design. Further efficacy evaluation of this vectored candidate vaccine approach in other malaria transmission settings and age-de-escalation into the main target age groups for a malaria vaccine is in progress."
https://openalex.org/W2567369660,"Chronic low-grade inflammation is related to the development of comorbidities and poor prognosis in obesity. Monocytes are main sources of cytokines and play a pivotal role in inflammation. We evaluated monocyte frequency, phenotype and cytokine profile of monocyte subsets, to determine their association with the pathogenesis of childhood obesity. Children with obesity were evaluated for biochemical and anthropometric parameters. Monocyte subsets were characterized by flow cytometry, considering cytokine production and activation/recognition molecules. Correlation analysis between clinical parameters and immunological data delineated the monocytes contribution for low-grade inflammation. We observed a higher frequency of non-classical monocytes in the childhood obesity group (CO) than normal-weight group (NW). All subsets displayed higher TLR4 expression in CO, but their recognition and antigen presentation functions seem to be diminished due to lower expression of CD40, CD80/86 and HLA-DR. All subsets showed a lower expression of IL-10 in CO and correlation analyses showed changes in IL-10 expression profile. The lower expression of IL-10 may be decisive for the maintenance of the low-grade inflammation status in CO, especially for alterations in non-classical monocytes profile. These cells may contribute to supporting inflammation and loss of regulation in the immune response of children with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2563436444,"Bike-sharing programs, with initiatives to increase bike use and improve accessibility of urban transit, have received increasing attention in growing number of cities across the world. The latest generation of bike-sharing systems has employed smart card technology that produces station-based data or trip-level data. This facilitates the studies of the practical use of these systems. However, few studies have paid attention to the changes in users and system usage over the years, as well as the impact of system expansion on its usage. Monitoring the changes of system usage over years enables the identification of system performance and can serve as an input for improving the location-allocation of stations. The objective of this study is to explore the impact of the expansion of a bicycle-sharing system on the usage of the system. This was conducted for a bicycle-sharing system in Zhongshan (China), using operational usage data of different years following system expansion. To this end, we performed statistical and spatial analyses to examine the changes in both users and system usage between before and after the system expansion. The findings show that there is a big variation in users and aggregate usage following the system expansion. However, the trend in spatial distribution of demand shows no substantial difference over the years, i.e. the same high-demand and low-demand areas appear. There are decreases in demand for some old stations over the years, which can be attributed to either the negative performance of the system or the competition of nearby new stations. Expanding the system not only extends the original users' ability to reach new areas but also attracts new users to use bike-sharing systems. In the conclusions, we present and discuss the findings, and offer recommendations for the further expansion of system."
https://openalex.org/W2561568853,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of unknown etiology. The pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, but evidence indicates that aberrantly activated alveolar epithelial cells secrete a variety of mediators which induce the migration, proliferation and activation of fibroblasts and finally the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix with the consequent destruction of the lung parenchyma. CC16 (approved symbol SCGB1A1), a putative anti-inflammatory protein produced by ""club"" cells in the distal airways, has not been evaluated in IPF lungs. In this study, we determined the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) levels as well as the lung cell localization of this protein. Also, we explored the usefulness of serum levels of CC16 for the differential diagnosis of IPF (n = 85), compared with non-IPF interstitial lung diseases [chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP; n = 85) and connective tissue diseases (CTD-ILD; n = 85)]. CC16 was significantly increased in serum and BAL fluids of IPF patients and was found not only in club cells but also in alveolar epithelial cells. When compared with non-IPF patients and controls, serum levels were significantly increased (p<0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity for CC16 (cut-off 41ng/mL) were 24% and 90%, positive predictive value 56% and negative predictive value 69%. These findings demonstrate that CC16 is upregulated in IPF patients suggesting that may participate in its pathogenesis. Although higher than the serum levels of non-IPF patients it shows modest sensitivity to be useful as a potential biomarker for the differential diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2562655629,"Introduction Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is the most common neurological complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and associated with poor functional outcome and mortality. Reports on incidence and predictors of CVS in Chinese patients with aSAH were scarce. We aimed to estimate the incidence and predictors of angiographic vasospasm (AV), symptomatic vasospasm (SV), and cerebral infarction in Chinese patients with aSAH. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 542 consecutive aSAH patients admitted to neurosurgery department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University in Urumqi city of China between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2015. AV, SV and cerebral infarction were defined based on clinical data and neuroimaging findings. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of AV, SV or cerebral infarction. Results 343 (63.3%) patients fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of them, 182(53.1%) developed AV, 99 (28.9%) developed SV, and 87 (25.4%) developed cerebral infarction. A history of hypertension, poor modified Fisher grade (3–4) and poor Hunt-Hess grade (4–5) on admission were common risk factors for AV, SV and cerebral infarction. Patients from Uyghur ethnic group or other minorities were less likely to develop AV, SV or cerebral infarction, compared to those from Han ethic group after adjustment of other potential confounders. Additionally, age ≥53 years, leukocyte count ≥11× 109/L on admission and being current or former smokers were independent risk factors of cerebral infarction. Leukocyte count ≥11× 109/L on admission and aneurysm size ≥ 10 mm were independent risk factors of SV. Serum glucose level ≥7.0 mmol/L on admission was an independent risk factor of AV. Conclusion Risk factors of different definitions of CVS were diverse in Chinese patients with aSAH; however, risk factors of SV and cerebral infarction seem to be similar. We recommend early and aggressive therapy in these patients at-risk of CVS."
https://openalex.org/W2563212080,"Tricholoma matsutake, the pine mushroom, is a valuable forest product with high economic value in Asia, and plays an important ecological role as an ectomycorrhizal fungus. Around the host tree, T. matsutake hyphae generate a distinctive soil aggregating environment called a fairy ring, where fruiting bodies form. Because T. matsutake hyphae dominate the soil near the fairy ring, this species has the potential to influence the microbial community. To explore the influence of T. matsutake on the microbial communities, we compared the microbial community and predicted bacterial function between two different soil types—T. matsutake dominant and T. matsutake minor. DNA sequence analyses showed that fungal and bacterial diversity were lower in the T. matsutake dominant soil compared to T. matsutake minor soil. Some microbial taxa were significantly more common in the T. matsutake dominant soil across geographic locations, many of which were previously identified as mycophillic or mycorrhiza helper bacteria. Between the two soil types, the predicted bacterial functional profiles (using PICRUSt) had significantly distinct KEGG modules. Modules for amino acid uptake, carbohydrate metabolism, and the type III secretion system were higher in the T. matsutake dominant soil than in the T. matsutake minor soil. Overall, similar microbial diversity, community structure, and bacterial functional profiles of the T. matsutake dominant soil across geographic locations suggest that T. matsutake may generate a dominance effect."

https://openalex.org/W2564194279,"Recent studies indicated that some glycolytic enzymes are complicated, multifaceted proteins rather than simple components of the glycolytic pathway. FBP1 plays a vital role in glucose metabolism, but its role in gastric cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis has not been fully understood.The prognostic value of FBP1 was first studied in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and validated in in-house database. The effect of FBP1 on cell proliferation and metastasis was examined in vitro. Nonparametric test and Log-rank test were used to evaluate the clinical significance of FBP1 expression.In the TCGA cohort, FBP1 mRNA level were shown to be predictive of overall survival in gastric cancer (P = 0.029). In the validation cohort, FBP1 expression were inversely correlated with advanced N stage (P = 0.021) and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.011). Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that FBP1 was an independent predictor for both overall survival (P = 0.004) and disease free survival (P<0.001). Functional studies demonstrated that ectopic FBP1 expression inhibited proliferation and invasion in gastric cancer cells, while silencing FBP1 expression had opposite effects (P<0.05). Mechanically, FBP1 serves as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).Downregulation of FBP1 promotes gastric cancer metastasis by facilitating EMT and acts as a potential prognostic factor and therapeutic target in gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2564369590,"Peer-reviewed publications focusing on climate change are growing exponentially with the consequence that the uptake and influence of individual papers varies greatly. Here, we derive metrics of narrativity from psychology and literary theory, and use these metrics to test the hypothesis that more narrative climate change writing is more likely to be influential, using citation frequency as a proxy for influence. From a sample of 732 scientific abstracts drawn from the climate change literature, we find that articles with more narrative abstracts are cited more often. This effect is closely associated with journal identity: higher-impact journals tend to feature more narrative articles, and these articles tend to be cited more often. These results suggest that writing in a more narrative style increases the uptake and influence of articles in climate literature, and perhaps in scientific literature more broadly."
https://openalex.org/W2566192908,"The Leishmaniases are a group of parasitic diseases caused by protozoa of the Leishmania genus affecting both humans and other vertebrates. Leishmania is an intracellular pathogen able to confer resistance to apoptosis in the early phase of macrophages infection by activation of host PI3K/Akt pathway and inhibition of caspase-3 activation. Intracellular pathogens hijack organelles such as ER to facilitate survival and replication, thus eliciting ER stress and activating/modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the host cell. The UPR is aimed to mitigate ER stress, thereby promoting cell survival. However, prolonged ER stress will activate the apoptotic pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the ER stress response in Leishmania-infected macrophages to gain insights about the mechanisms underlying the apoptosis resistance in parasitized cells. Macrophages differentiated from human monocytic cell lines (U937 and THP-1) and murine primary macrophages were infected with Leishmania infantum MHOM/TN/80/IPT1 (WHO international reference strain). Several ER stress/autophagy expression markers, as well as cell survival/apoptosis markers (phospho-Akt and cleaved caspase-3) were evaluated by qPCR and/or by western blotting. As ER stress positive control, cells were treated with tunicamycin or dithiothreitol (DTT). The gene expression analyses showed a mild but significant induction of the ER stress/autophagy markers. The western blot analyses revealed that the Leishmania infection induced Akt phosphorylation and significantly inhibited the induction of caspase-3 cleavage, eIF2α phosphorylation and DDIT3/CHOP expression in tunicamycin and DTT treated cells. The mild but significant increase in ER stress expression markers and the delay/attenuation of the effects of ER stress inducers in infected cells support the hypothesis that L. infantum could promote survival of host cells by inducing a mild ER stress response. The host ER stress response could be not only a common pathogenic mechanism among Leishmania species but also a target for development of new drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2560965072,"There is an increasing interest to restore the ecosystem services that eelgrass provides, after their continuous worldwide decline. Most attempts to restore eelgrass using seeds are challenged by very high seed losses and the reasons for these losses are not all clear. We assess the impact of predation on seed loss and eelgrass establishment, and explore methods to decrease seed loss during restoration in the Swedish northwest coast. In a laboratory study we identified three previously undescribed seed predators, the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, of which shore crabs consumed 2-7 times more seeds than the other two species. The importance of shore crabs as seed predators was supported in field cage experiments where one enclosed crab caused 73% loss of seeds over a 1-week period on average (~ 21 seeds per day). Seedling establishment was significantly higher (14%) in cages that excluded predators over an 8-month period than in uncaged plots and cages that allowed predators but prevented seed-transport (0.5%), suggesting that seed predation constitutes a major source of seed loss in the study area. Burying the seeds 2 cm below the sediment surface prevented seed predation in the laboratory and decreased predation in the field, constituting a way to decrease seed loss during restoration. Shore crabs may act as a key feedback mechanism that prevent the return of eelgrass both by direct consumption of eelgrass seeds and as a predator of algal mesograzers, allowing algal mats to overgrow eelgrass beds. This shore crab feedback mechanism could become self-generating by promoting the growth of its own nursery habitat (algal mats) and by decreasing the nursery habitat (seagrass meadow) of its dominant predator (cod). This double feedback-loop is supported by a strong increase of shore crab abundance in the last decades and may partly explain the regime shift in vegetation observed along the Swedish west coast."
https://openalex.org/W2562342786,"There is ongoing debate on the association between eosinophil count and diseases, as previous studies were inconsistent.

We focused on relationship of eosinophil count with three classes of metabolic (7 traits, 2 diseases), cardiac (6 traits, 2 diseases), and pulmonary (2 traits, 2 diseases) outcomes. Regression analyses were applied in overall, women and men, while adjusted for age, sex, BMI and smoking. A p-value of <0.00076 was considered statistically significant. 58.2% of population were women (mean±SD 51.3±11.1 years old). In overall, one-SD higher of ln-eosinophil count was associated with a 0.04 (±SE ±0.002;p = 6.0×10−6) SD higher levels in ln-BMI, 0.06 (±0.007;p = 3.1×10−12) SD in ln-TG, 0.04 (±0.003;p = 7.0×10−6) SD in TC, 0.04 (±0.004;p = 6.3×10−7) SD in LDL, 0.04 (±0.006;p = 6.0×10−6) SD in HbA1c; and with a 0.05 (±0.004;p = 1.7×10−8) SD lower levels in HDL, 0.05 (±0.007;p = 3.4×10−23) SD in FEV1, and 0.09 (±0.001;p = 6.6×10−28) SD in FEV1/FVC.

Similar results were found in women. We found no association between ln-eosinophil count either with blood pressure indices in overall, women and men; or with BMI, LDL, HbA1c and obesity in men. In a large population based cohort, we confirmed eosinophil count as a potential factor implicated in metabolic and pulmonary outcomes."

As an additional mechanism to minimize the risk of mutagenesis, UVB-irradiated cells also activate a checkpoint signaling cascade mediated by the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) kinases to transiently suppress DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Given that keratinocytes in geriatric skin display reduced activation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and alterations in DNA repair rate, apoptosis, and senescence following UVB exposure, here we used cultured human keratinocytes in vitro and skin explants ex vivo to examine how IGF-1R activation status affects ATR-CHK1 kinase signaling and the inhibition of DNA replication following UVB irradiation. We find that disruption of IGF-1R signaling with small-molecule inhibitors or IGF-1 withdrawal partially abrogates both the phosphorylation and activation of CHK1 by ATR and the accompanying inhibition of chromosomal DNA synthesis in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. A critical protein factor that mediates both ATR-CHK1 signaling and nucleotide excision repair is replication protein A, and we find that its accumulation on UVB-damaged chromatin is partially attenuated in cells with an inactive IGF-1R. These results indicate that mutagenesis and skin carcinogenesis in IGF-1-deficient geriatric skin may be caused by defects in multiple cellular responses to UVB-induced DNA damage, including through a failure to properly suppress DNA synthesis on UVB-damaged DNA templates.

https://openalex.org/W2563524331,"The present study was initiated because of concerns expressed by NHLBI-funded mid-career investigators regarding perceived difficulties in the renewal of their grant awards. This led us to ask: ""Are mid-career investigators experiencing disproportionate difficulties in the advancement of their professional careers?"" Our portfolio analysis indicates that there has been a significant and evolving shift in the demographics of research project grant (RPG) awardees at NHLBI. In 1998, mid-career (ages 41-55) investigators constituted approximately 60% of all investigators with the remaining 40% being equally divided between early-stage (ages 24-40) investigators and established (ages 56 to 70 and older) investigators. However, since 1998, the proportion of established RPG awardees has been increasing in a slowly progressive and strikingly linear fashion. At the same time the proportion of early-stage awardees fell precipitously until 2006 and then stabilized. During the same period, the proportion of mid-career awardees, which had been relatively stable through 2006, began to fall significantly. In examining potential causes of these demographic shifts we have identified certain inherent properties within the RPG award system that appear to promote an increasingly more established awardee population and a persistent decrease in the proportion of mid-career investigators. A collateral result of these demographic shifts, when combined with level or declining funding, is a significant reduction in the number of RPG awards received by NHLBI mid-career investigators and a corresponding decrease in the number of independent research laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W2572502495,"The function of the primary cilia, which is assembled in most vertebrate cells, is achieved by transport in and out of kinds of signaling receptors. The BBSome protein complex could recognize and target membrane proteins to the cilia, but how the BBSome itself is transported into the cilia is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the centrosome protein Dzip1 mediates the assembly of the BBSome-Dzip1-PCM1 complex in the centriolar satellites (CS) at the G0 phase for ciliary translocation of the BBSome. Phosphorylation of Dzip1 at Ser-210 by Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1) during the G2 phase promotes disassembly of this complex, resulting in removal of Dzip1 and the BBSome from the CS. Inhibiting the kinase activity of Plk1 maintains the CS localization of the BBSome and Dzip1 at the G2 phase. Collectively, our findings reveal the cell cycle-dependent regulation of BBSome transport to the CS and highlight a potential mechanism that the BBSome-mediated signaling pathways are accordingly regulated during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2561414555,"Particulate pollution has important consequences for human health, and is an issue of global concern. Outdoor air pollution has become a cause for alarm in India in particular because recent data suggest that ambient pollution levels in Indian cities are some of the highest in the world. We study the number of particles between 0.5μm and 2.5μm indoors while using affordable air purifiers in the highly polluted city of Delhi. Though substantial reductions in indoor number concentrations are observed during air purifier use, indoor air quality while using an air purifier is frequently worse than in cities with moderate pollution, and often worse than levels observed even in polluted cities. When outdoor pollution levels are higher, on average, indoor pollution levels while using an air purifier are also higher. Moreover, the ratio of indoor air quality during air purifier use to two comparison measures of air quality without an air purifier are also positively correlated with outdoor pollution levels, suggesting that as ambient air quality worsens there are diminishing returns to improvements in indoor air quality during air purifier use. The findings of this study indicate that although the most affordable air purifiers currently available are associated with significant improvements in the indoor environment, they are not a replacement for public action in regions like Delhi. Although private solutions may serve as a stopgap, reducing ambient air pollution must be a public health and policy priority in any region where air pollution is as high as Delhi’s during the winter."
https://openalex.org/W2565067711,"High grade chondrosarcoma is characterized by its lack of response to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, the tendency to develop lung metastases, and low survival rates. Research within the field prioritizes the development and expansion of new treatment options for dealing with unresectable or metastatic diseases. Numerous clinical trials using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib have shown specific efficacy as an active antitumor agent for treating a variety of solid tumors. However, as of yet the effect of bortezomib on chondrosarcoma has not been investigated. In our study, bortezomib decreased cell viability and proliferation in two different chondrosarcoma cell lines in a time- and dose dependent manner. FACS analysis, mRNA- and protein expression studies illustrated that induction of apoptosis developed through the intrinsic mitochondria-caspase dependent pathway. Furthermore, bortezomib treatment significantly increased expression of the death receptors TRAILR-1 and TRAILR-2 in chondrosarcoma cells. An increased expression of the autophagy markers Atg5/12, Beclin, and LC3BI-II supports the interpretation that bortezomib functions as a trigger for autophagy.

However, little effort has been made to investigate the roles of specific receptors (such as adrenergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) in mediating the effects of acupuncture at heterotopic and homotopic acupoints. Different adrenergic receptor subtypes or cholinergic receptor subtypes are predominantly expressed in various sections of the gut, resulting in variations between the effects of acupuncture at heterotopic or homotopic acupoints on gastrointestinal motility. Here, we investigated the role of β1/β2 receptors and M2/M3 receptors in gastrointestinal motility regulated by acupuncture at ST37, a heterotopic acupoint, and ST25, a homotopic acupoint, by simultaneously recording intraluminal pressures in the distal colon and stomach or jejunum and examining fecal phenol red excretion in β1/2 receptor-knockout mice and M2/3 receptor-knockout mice. We found that knockout of the M2/3 receptor significantly inhibited ST37 acupuncture-induced enhancement of gastric motility, jejunal motility, and colonic motility. Additionally, knocking out of the β1/2 receptor significantly diminished the ST25 acupuncture-induced inhibition of gastric motility and jejunal motility without significantly altering the enhancement of colonic motility induced by acupuncture at ST25. Acupuncture at ST37 significantly accelerated gastrointestinal transition in β1/2 receptor-knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. However, this acceleration of gastrointestinal transition was markedly diminished in M2/3 receptor-knockout mice relative to their wild-type littermates. Acupuncture at ST25 significantly increased gastrointestinal transition in β1/2 receptor-knockout mice and significantly decreased gastrointestinal transition in M2/3 receptor-knockout mice without altering gastrointestinal transition in wild-type littermates of either. Our study revealed that M2/3 receptors are required for the gastrointestinal motility associated with whole gastrointestinal transition enhanced by acupuncture at heterotopic acupoints, whereas β1/2 receptors are required for the same gastrointestinal motility processes inhibited by acupuncture at homotopic acupoints. Therefore, our findings reveal important biological mechanisms underlying acupuncture treatment of disorders involving gastrointestinal motility dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2567413735,"Knowledge of the location of muscle Innervation Zones (IZs) is important in many applications, e.g. for minimizing the quantity of injected botulinum toxin for the treatment of spasticity or for deciding on the type of episiotomy during child delivery. Surface EMG (sEMG) can be noninvasively recorded to assess physiological and morphological characteristics of contracting muscles. However, it is not often possible to record signals of high quality. Moreover, muscles could have multiple IZs, which should all be identified. We designed a fully-automatic algorithm based on the enhanced image Graph-Cut segmentation and morphological image processing methods to identify up to five IZs in 60-ms intervals of very-low to moderate quality sEMG signal detected with multi-channel electrodes (20 bipolar channels with Inter Electrode Distance (IED) of 5 mm). An anisotropic multilayered cylinder model was used to simulate 750 sEMG signals with signal-to-noise ratio ranging from -5 to 15 dB (using Gaussian noise) and in each 60-ms signal frame, 1 to 5 IZs were included. The micro- and macro- averaged performance indices were then reported for the proposed IZ detection algorithm. In the micro-averaging procedure, the number of True Positives, False Positives and False Negatives in each frame were summed up to generate cumulative measures. In the macro-averaging, on the other hand, precision and recall were calculated for each frame and their averages are used to determine F1-score. Overall, the micro (macro)-averaged sensitivity, precision and F1-score of the algorithm for IZ channel identification were 82.7% (87.5%), 92.9% (94.0%) and 87.5% (90.6%), respectively. For the correctly identified IZ locations, the average bias error was of 0.02±0.10 IED ratio. Also, the average absolute conduction velocity estimation error was 0.41±0.40 m/s for such frames. The sensitivity analysis including increasing IED and reducing interpolation coefficient for time samples was performed. Meanwhile, the effect of adding power-line interference and using other image interpolation methods on the deterioration of the performance of the proposed algorithm was investigated. The average running time of the proposed algorithm on each 60-ms sEMG frame was 25.5±8.9 (s) on an Intel dual-core 1.83 GHz CPU with 2 GB of RAM. The proposed algorithm correctly and precisely identified multiple IZs in each signal epoch in a wide range of signal quality and is thus a promising new offline tool for electrophysiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2561686769,"Background The prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dismal, underscoring the need for novel effective treatments. The α1,6-fucosyltransferase (fucosyltransferase 8, FUT8) has been reported to accelerate malignant potential in HCC. Our study aimed to investigate the regulation of FUT8 expression by p53 and develop a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting HCC cells using L-fucose-mediated drug delivery. Methods Binding sites for p53 were searched for within the FUT8 promoter region. FUT8 expression was assessed by immunoblotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to analyze p53 binding to the FUT8 promoter. The delivery of Cy5.5-encapsulated L-fucose-liposomes (Fuc-Lip-Cy5.5) to a Lens Culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of α-fetoprotein (AFP-L3)-expressing HCC cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The induction of FUT8 by histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) -inducing acetylated -p53 was evaluated by immunoblotting. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to assess whether the activation of p53 by HDACi affected the uptake of Fuc-Lip-Cy5.5 by HCC cells. The cytotoxicity of an L-fucose-bound liposome carrying sorafenib (Fuc-Lip-sorafenib) with HDACi was assessed in vivo and in vitro. Results The knock down of p53 with siRNA led to decreased FUT8 expression. ChIP assays revealed p53 binds to the FUT8 promoter region. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated the specific uptake of Fuc-Lip-Cy5.5 into AFP-L3-expressing HCC cells in a p53- and FUT8-dependent manner. HDACi upregulated the uptake of Fuc-Lip-Cy5.5 by HCC cells by increasing FUT8 via acetylated -p53. The addition of a HDACi increased apoptosis induced by Fuc-Lip-sorafenib in HCC cells. Conclusions Our findings reveal that FUT8 is a p53 target gene and suggest that p53 activated by HDACi induces Fuc-Lip-sorafenib uptake by HCC cells, highlighting this pathway as a promising therapeutic intervention for HCC."

The present study employed transcriptome analysis in parallel with real-time qPCR techniques to characterise for the first time the LJD condition in triploid Atlantic salmon juveniles using two independent sample sets: experimentally-sourced salmon (60 g) and commercially produced salmon (100 g). A total of eleven genes, some detected/identified through the transcriptome analysis (fbn2, gal and gphb5) and others previously determined to be related to skeletal physiology (alp, bmp4, col1a1, col2a1, fgf23, igf1, mmp13, ocn), were tested in the two independent sample sets. Gphb5, a recently discovered hormone, was significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated in LJD affected fish in both sample sets, suggesting a possible hormonal involvement. In-situ hybridization detected gphb5 expression in oral epithelium, teeth and skin of the lower jaw. Col2a1 showed the same consistent significant (P < 0.05) down-regulation in LJD suggesting a possible cartilaginous impairment as a distinctive feature of the condition. Significant (P < 0.05) differential expression of other genes found in either one or the other sample set highlighted the possible effect of stage of development or condition progression on transcription and showed that anomalous bone development, likely driven by cartilage impairment, is more evident at larger fish sizes. The present study improved our understanding of LJD suggesting that a cartilage impairment likely underlies the condition and col2a1 may be a marker. In addition, the involvement of gphb5 urges further investigation of a hormonal role in LJD and skeletal physiology in general."

https://openalex.org/W2562143017,"In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), recurrent obstruction of the upper airway leads to intermittent hypoxia (IH) during sleep, which can result in impairment of cardiac function. Although exercise can have beneficial effects against IH-induced cardiac dysfunction, the mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the interactions of zinc and exercise on IH-triggered left ventricular dysfunction in a rat model that mimics IH in OSA patients. Nine-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON) or to a group receiving 10 weeks of exercise training (EXE). During weeks 9 and 10, half the rats in each group were subjected to IH for 8 h per day for 14 days (IHCON, IHEXE), whereas the remainder continued to breathe room air. Rats within each of the CON, IHCON, EXE, and IHEXE groups were further randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal injections of either zinc chloride, the zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), or injection vehicle only. IH induced a lower left ventricular fractional shortening, reduced ejection fraction, higher myocardial levels of inflammatory factors, increased levels oxidative stress, and lower levels of antioxidative capacity, all of which were abolished by zinc treatment. IHEXE rats exhibited higher levels of cardiac function and antioxidant capacity and lower levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress than IHCON rats; however, IHEXE rats receiving TPEN did not exhibit these better outcomes. In conclusion, zinc is required for protecting against IH-induced LV functional impairment and likely plays a critical role in exercise-induced cardioprotection by exerting a dual antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect."

Methods 25OHD was measured on stored baseline plasma samples from two randomized vaccine trials in HIV-infected adults: the ANRS HB03 VIHVAC B trial and an immunological sub-study of the ANRS 114-PNEUMOVAC trial. In ANRS HB03 VIHVAC B, participants received three or four doses of recombinant HBV vaccine strategies. Anti-HBs IgG titers were measured four weeks after the last injection. Associations between baseline 25OHD levels and ordered IgG response categories were analyzed in multivariable proportional odds models. In the ANRS 114-PNEUMOVAC sub-study, two strategies of pneumococcal vaccination were tested, cellular immune responses were measured at repeated time points, and IgG responses four weeks after the last vaccine injection. Exploratory statistical analyses were performed on this sub-study data set. Results Three hundred and thirty-nine ANRS HB03 VIHVAC B and 25 ANRS 114-PNEUMOVAC sub-study participants were included in the analyses. Median age in each of the two studies was 43 years, 68% were male, and 77–92% on antiretroviral treatment. Median 25OHD level was 18 ng/mL (IQR: 12–25) and 24 ng/mL (IQR: 13–32) in the two trial populations, respectively. In the multivariable model, there was no significant association between baseline 25OHD level and vaccine responses in ANRS HB03 VIHVAC B (proportional odds ratio 0.83 per 10 ng/mL 25OHD increase; 95% confidence interval 0.65–1.07, p = 0.14). Exploratory analyses of ANRS 114-PNEUMOVAC showed consistent results. Conclusion This study does not support a positive association between 25OHD and immune responses to hepatitis B or pneumococcal vaccination in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2565607773,"Exploring novel computational methods in making sense of biological data has not only been a necessity, but also productive. A part of this trend is the search for more efficient in silico methods/tools for analysis of promoters, which are parts of DNA sequences that are involved in regulation of expression of genes into other functional molecules. Promoter regions vary greatly in their function based on the sequence of nucleotides and the arrangement of protein-binding short-regions called motifs. In fact, the regulatory nature of the promoters seems to be largely driven by the selective presence and/or the arrangement of these motifs. Here, we explore computational classification of promoter sequences based on the pattern of motif distributions, as such classification can pave a new way of functional analysis of promoters and to discover the functionally crucial motifs. We make use of Position Specific Motif Matrix (PSMM) features for exploring the possibility of accurately classifying promoter sequences using some of the popular classification techniques. The classification results on the complete feature set are low, perhaps due to the huge number of features. We propose two ways of reducing features. Our test results show improvement in the classification output after the reduction of features. The results also show that decision trees outperform SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) and ensemble classifier LibD3C, particularly with reduced features. The proposed feature selection methods outperform some of the popular feature transformation methods such as PCA and SVD. Also, the methods proposed are as accurate as MRMR (feature selection method) but much faster than MRMR. Such methods could be useful to categorize new promoters and explore regulatory mechanisms of gene expressions in complex eukaryotic species."

https://openalex.org/W2576550535,"The nodes of Ranvier are essential regions for action potential conduction in myelinated fibers. They are enriched in multimolecular complexes composed of voltage-gated Nav and Kv7 channels associated with cell adhesion molecules. Cytoskeletal proteins ankyrin-G (AnkG) and βIV-spectrin control the organization of these complexes and provide mechanical support to the plasma membrane. IQCJ-SCHIP1 is a cytoplasmic protein present in axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. It interacts with AnkG and is absent from nodes and axon initial segments of βIV-spectrin and AnkG mutant mice. Here, we show that IQCJ-SCHIP1 also interacts with βIV-spectrin and Kv7.2/3 channels and self-associates, suggesting a scaffolding role in organizing nodal proteins. IQCJ-SCHIP1 binding requires a βIV-spectrin-specific domain and Kv7 channel 1-5-10 calmodulin-binding motifs. We then investigate the role of IQCJ-SCHIP1 in vivo by studying peripheral myelinated fibers in Schip1 knock-out mutant mice. The major nodal proteins are normally enriched at nodes in these mice, indicating that IQCJ-SCHIP1 is not required for their nodal accumulation. However, morphometric and ultrastructural analyses show an altered shape of nodes similar to that observed in βIV-spectrin mutant mice, revealing that IQCJ-SCHIP1 contributes to nodal membrane-associated cytoskeleton organization, likely through its interactions with the AnkG/βIV-spectrin network. Our work reveals that IQCJ-SCHIP1 interacts with several major nodal proteins, and we suggest that it contributes to a higher organizational level of the AnkG/βIV-spectrin network critical for node integrity."

The expression of Trib3 mRNA was significantly increased at 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 weeks of age in the dmy rats, prior to the prominent myelin breakdown between 7 and 10 weeks of age. The expression level of Trib3 was increased concurrently with the progression of the clinical and pathological conditions in the dmy rats. Double immunofluorescence demonstrated that TRIB3 was mainly expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes and localized in the Golgi apparatus.

https://openalex.org/W2564335652,"President-elect Donald Trump has made no secret of his intention to dramatically reshape U.S. climate and energy policy. He has named staunch allies of the fossil fuel industry to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and the state and energy departments, and promised to walk away from international climate agreements. And last week a provocative leaked memo hinted at another likely element of the incoming administration's plan for weakening climate regulations: tweaking an obscure, but increasingly utilized, economic measure that tallies the costs and benefits of controlling carbon pollution. The leaked memo, which included 74 questions from Trump's Department of Energy (DOE) transition team to agency officials, caused a stir because it asked for the names of agency employees involved in developing climate policy. The transition team was silent on why it asked for the names, and DOE ultimately refused to provide them, but the move spurred fears that the new administration would seek to fire or punish those employees, and it drew condemnation from science advocacy groups and some lawmakers in Congress. Many of the other questions have a technical flavor, asking about DOE's role in developing the nitty-gritty statistical and economic data that often underpins regulatory efforts. One set of inquiries, for example, focuses on an economic measure called the social cost of carbon (SCC), which attempts to quantify the economic damage associated with carbon emissions and the climate change they drive. The measure has played a role in developing more than 100 regulations, and as economist Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago in Illinois, who served as a senior economic official in the Obama administration, puts it, If you want to be hostile to climate regulations, the SCC is kind of a pivot joint."

https://openalex.org/W2561617712,"John D. (“Jack”) Roberts, Professor of Chemistry, Emeritus, at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), died on 29 October at the age of 98. Roberts led organic chemistry's transition from a field that studied what reactions did to one that also studied how reactions happened. He was an explorer with boundless curiosity who was untiring in his efforts to bring new and useful ideas, tools, and experimental designs to chemistry. He thrived on convincing chemists that his opinions on both science and scientific standards were correct (or at least worth arguing about, usually strenuously). He was not the only parent of physical-organic chemistry, but he was its best teacher.

Roberts began his independent career in the time immediately after World War II. Before the war, chemistry had been concerned primarily with combining small molecules to make larger, more complicated ones. The war had produced a flood of new ideas and instrumental techniques in physical chemistry, ranging from theories of electronic structure to new spectroscopic tools. Organic synthetic chemistry and physical/analytical chemistry were culturally distinct, and interactions between them were limited. The war also resulted in the formation of the similarly distinct petrochemical industry and system of U.S. research universities that quickly came to support academic science.

Roberts was completely indifferent to these boundaries between scientific ideologies. He went where his curiosity led him, and if there were obstacles that might have deterred others (for example, if he understood nothing about the subject), he simply charged on (boldly, or incautiously, depending upon one's point of view). When he discovered a good new idea, or a new technique, he did everything he could to teach other chemists about it. He became simultaneously an organic chemist, a physical chemist, an academic scientist, an inveterate teacher, and an active industrial consultant.

As a scientist, his greatest contribution was to the formation of physical-organic chemistry, the field that studies organic reactions using combinations of physical and synthetic methods. In addition to introducing methods of simple quantum mechanics and new forms of spectroscopy [especially nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] to the field, Roberts showed how to infer the existence and structure of “transitory intermediates”: molecular structures that exist fleetingly (and are often, even now, invisible to direct observation) between the starting materials and products. In doing so, he made clear that focusing only on stable, long-lived reactants and products misses much of what goes on during the course of chemical reactions. The understanding of reaction mechanisms and intermediates that Roberts and others developed has been invaluable both in improving synthesis and in understanding the critical reaction networks making up processes ranging from metabolism in living cells to the formation of hydrocarbon fuels in petroleum refineries.

Roberts taught by doing, but he also taught by teaching. He wrote a number of books—from a widely used first-year organic chemistry text to short books on NMR spectroscopy and molecular-orbital theory (which he claimed to have dictated in his car while commuting). These books introduced the philosophy of physical-organic chemistry to both students and senior scientists.

Born in 1918 in Los Angeles, California, Roberts received his B.A. (1941) and Ph.D. (1944) degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). After short appointments at UCLA, Harvard, and MIT, he moved to Caltech in 1952, where he spent the remainder of his career. After 1980, he became vice president, provost, and dean of the faculty at Caltech, but he continued to teach courses for many years.

I joined his research group as a graduate student in 1960, when his research career was in its most active phase. Roberts was an unwavering supporter of young scientists (and, long before others, of women in science). He worked tirelessly and invisibly—insofar as he could manage it—to support and encourage younger colleagues. During the time I was a student, I almost never saw him in person (he later told me that I was a porcupine best left alone), but he devoted countless hours to editing my work. I would write a draft of a paper, he would correct it in word-for-word detail (in red pen), I would rewrite it, he would correct it again, and so on, seemingly ad infinitum. This style of directing graduate research was splendid for improving scientific standards, logic, grammar, style, and punctuation. It was even better as a lesson in the scientific method and, perhaps best of all, for building a (partially illusory) sense of independence. Years later, no longer a beginner, I wrote a report for a U.S. National Academy of Sciences committee, and Roberts was the reviewer. As in the past, we went through six or seven rounds of detailed editing (his, of course, in red pen) before he was satisfied. One comes to realize that—as a writer or scientist—one can have no better friend and teacher than a demanding editor.

Roberts loved to argue, and did not discriminate between arguments in private and in public. For decades, he was the voice of conscience in the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and in other musty halls of Washington, DC, science. His arguments were always elitist. To him, only “quality” mattered. There could be no compromise on standards (and, fortunately, he had a clear and unwavering view of what these standards should be). His arguments were also loud. He was hard of hearing, and he loved combat. Every discussion proceeded at high volume. But it was always worth thinking about what he said.

Jack Roberts was someone who was almost impossible not to love. To deal with—even for those of us who knew him well—he was gruff, argumentative, difficult or impossible to convince, and stubborn to a fault. He was also extraordinarily generous (he never took credit for a student's idea), incorrigibly curious, addicted to new ideas, warm and loyal to his friends, devoted to his family, students, and colleagues, and deeply and genuinely protective of science and its institutions.

As it crawls, a cell explores the space in front of it by extending protrusions. These are formed by the branching of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton at the leading edge that push the cell membrane outward. Leithner et al. disrupted actin branching in crawling leukocytes and observed profound changes in cell shape. The cells were able to move but were unable to change direction or navigate, whereas wild-type cells oriented in response to chemical gradients and navigated obstacles. Thus, although actin filament branching is not required to move a crawling cell forward, it is essential for generating the protrusions necessary to explore and navigate a complex three-dimensional environment.

Bacterial populations can coordinate their responses to environmental change by quorum sensing. Bacteria also possess protective combinations of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) to defend themselves against viral predation and attack by mobile elements. Patterson et al. have discovered that Serratia species do not rely on one CRISPR-Cas setup but rather have two backups to modulate responses to foreign nucleic acid sequences. Moreover, these CRISPR-Cas combinations are triggered by quorum sensing, which kicks in when a bacterial population reaches a density high enough that it becomes apparent and vulnerable to predators, competitors, and other threats.

The Gaia astrometry satellite has greatly improved measurements of the position and motion of nearby stars. Berski and Dybczynski searched the Gaia data for the star that will pass closest to the Sun. They found that Gliese 710, a small faint star, will pass within 13,000 ± 6,000 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun). That will be well within the Oort Cloud, a collection of small bodies on the outskirts of our solar system. Some of those bodies will be knocked inward, generating large numbers of new comets. Earth is safe for now, though; the encounter will happen in 1.3 million years.

Electrical impulses propagate through the heart for proper cardiac function. Heart muscle calcification, which can occur with aging, disease, or injury, blocks electrical conduction, resulting in cardiac pump dysfunction and arrhythmias. By tracing cell lineage, Pillai et al. show that cardiac fibroblasts induce this mineralization and take on an osteoblast cell–like fate. Calcification was reduced in mice by administering a small molecule inhibitor that effectively blocks the bone mineralization enzyme ENPP1. Hence, calcification associated with disease or injury may be prevented by targeting ENPP1 to restore cardiac muscle function.

For most people, sleeping and waking on a regular schedule is an aspiration rather than a reality. Unfortunately, it is becoming clear that chronic disruption of the circadian clock, or “social jet lag,” can pose health risks. Kettner et al. studied mice to explore how jet lag affects liver function experimentally by varying the times at which lights were switched on and off each week. Despite a healthy diet, the jet-lagged mice gained weight and developed fatty liver disease, which progressed to fibrosis and in some cases to hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer. The livers of these mice showed marked dysregulation of metabolic pathways controlled by two specific nuclear receptors, FXR and CAR.
