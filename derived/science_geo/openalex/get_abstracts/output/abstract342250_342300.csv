https://openalex.org/W2024263669,"An analysis of the range of morphology among arthropods demonstrates that disparity among living arthropods is similar to that in Cambrian arthropods. The range of morphological design resulting from the Cambrian ""explosion"" has been overestimated, reflecting a tendency to separate as ""problematic"" taxa that cannot be accommodated in the classification on the basis of the living biota. Problematic taxa are largely an artifact of an inadequate taxonomy. Special evolutionary processes may not be necessary to explain the early radiation of the metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2017422309,"High-resolution seismic tomographic models of the upper mantle provide powerful new constraints on theories of plate tectonics and hotspots. Midocean ridges have extremely low seismic velocities to a depth of 100 kilometers. These low velocities imply partial melting. At greater depths, low-velocity and high-velocity anomalies record, respectively, previous positions of migrating ridges and trenches. Extensional, rifting, and hotspot regions have deep (> 200 kilometers) low-velocity anomalies. The upper mantle is characterized by vast domains of high temperature rather than small regions surrounding hotspots; the asthenosphere is not homogeneous or isothermal. Extensive magmatism requires a combination of hot upper mantle and suitable lithospheric conditions. High-velocity regions of the upper 200 kilometers of the mantle correlate with Archean cratons."
https://openalex.org/W1971973399,Soluble aluminum silicate (Al-Si) complexes are critical species for the development and application of geochemical models. A fluorescence probe technique was used to show that Al-Si complexes account for up to 95% of the total inorganic mononuclear Al in natural waters. The presence of these soluble Al-Si species affects the solubility of Al-Si minerals. Soluble Al-Si species may be important intermediates in the weathering reactions of primary Al-Si minerals and should be considered in dissolution models. Soluble Al-Si species may be key components controlling the formation of metastable and new stable minerals during interactions between water and rocks or soils.

The boom-and-bust export pattern is often blamed on demand by developed countries, high import barriers, and low international wood prices. In fact, it is rooted in tropical countries' own policies related to timber concessions and wood-processing industries. These policies suppress timber scarcity signals and must be revised if the trade is to promote sustained economic growth. Even if this is done, the trade may not promote sustained-yield forestry in individual countries."
https://openalex.org/W2036148016,"Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and point-probe electrical conductivity measurements of electrochemically protonated films of the emeraldine-base form of the conducting polymer, polyaniline are reported. The conductivity varies spatially, dependent on the size (LM â‰ˆ 200 to 300 angstroms) of granular metallic regions which relate directly to the inhomogeneous micromorphology of the electrodeposited films. The normalized conductivity at zero bias is observed to increase with doping, indicating an increase in states at the Fermi level. The STM electronic measurements also show regions of negative differential resistance. Negative differential resistance is observed for all samples, although more frequently on less oxidized samples."
https://openalex.org/W2027397799,The spin response of a nested Fermi surface represented by a tight binding energy band is found to exhibit scaling in frequency divided by temperature within a restricted regime close to half-filling of the band. Computations of the spin susceptibility reveal a surprising momentum variation at various temperatures and frequencies. Neutron scattering data on the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+x are analyzed for scaling near a momentum vector that spans nested regions of the orbit. Changes in the Fermi energy remove the scaling properties and reduce the susceptibility to the conventional Fermi liquid behavior of ordinary metals. These results imply that pairing mechanisms of superconductivity need to cope with competing spin density wave and charge density wave instabilities.

https://openalex.org/W2059625247,"Never one to take its middle name too literally, the American Geophysical Union indulged the interests of a range of extraterrestrial researchers at its spring meeting last month in Montreal. In a session on the big icy bodies of the outer solar system, attendees saw the first view of the face of Pluto. In another session, on dating small rock samples, listeners heard evidence that the moon might have been battered in its youth. And a session ostensibly devoted to Earth's mantle yielded news that some form of plate tectonics seems to be operating on Venus."
