More recently, it has been shown that other mucoproteins of mammalian origin contain substances closely related to sialic acid; among these are neuraminic2, gynaminic3 and lactaminic4 acids. Despite intensive chemical investigations, the structure of these various substances has not yet been fully elucidated."

Among these patients, two were found to have strong anti-P agglutinins in their sera. These were recognized in the course of cross-matching blood for transfusion. About ninety of these cases had blood cross-matched, and of these only 25 per cent could be expected to be P-negative and able to have anti-P agglutinins in their sera. It seemed that this was a selected group presenting a high proportion of unusually strong anti-P sera. Merritt and Hardy1 reported a serum containing strong anti-P in a boy aged twelve years with hydatid disease."

A few values as high as 10 times the average have been obtained. This value is in accord with the predicted value based on fallout measurements and fractionation through the soilplant-milk-human chain. With the present burden of strontium-90, this average level should rise to 1 to 2 micromicrocuries of strontium-90 per gram of calcium by 1970."

Ray Lankester first discovered it in Chirocephalus, observing the absorption bands of oxyhaemoglobin with a microspectroscope1, and soon afterwards found it in Daphnia. The wave-length of the α-band differs among species within the genus Daphnia
2. The pigment also occurs in the blood of other Cladocera, for example: Sida, Simocephalus, Moina, Bosmina, Ilyocryptus, Eurycercus, Leydigia, Chydorus, etc., but not in Leptodora. The haemoglobin of Ceriodaphnia has a higher oxygen affinity than that of Daphnia, and the former lives in fouler water3. Haemoglobin is present, too, in Phyllopoda : it is in the blood of Conchostraca (Lynceus, Leptestheria
4, Limnadia), Anostraca (Chirocephalus, Artemia
5,6) and Notostraca (Triops
7, Lepidurus). It may be universal in the blood of the Phyllopoda. Among the Ostracoda, haemoglobin occurs in Cypria
8 and Pseudocypris."

He suggested that this type of carboxyl group activation might be a first step in protein synthesis. In a later paper with Keller and Zamecnik2 he reported partial purification of activating enzyme from liver."

Several significant differences from the description of this species in Bergey's “Manual” have been found, though the fermentation of sugars and the production of lactic acid were in accord with the data given. A surprising catalase content, however, has been revealed."

This working range was derived from a study of the serum amylase activity of 101 hospital patients in whom there was no reason for suspecting an abnormal serum amylase activity."

Fertilized eggs were obtained from a pair of toads which had previously been injected with a commercial preparation of anterior pituitary-like gonadotropins (350 I.U. for female, 150 I.U. for male). All operations on eggs were carried out at room temperature in a 100 per cent Holtfreter solution."
https://openalex.org/W2046126005,"THE use of abbreviations for the designation of compounds on chromatograms or autoradiographs has recently led to some confusion in the thyroid field, because of the variety of symbols used by different workers. At the Ciba Foundation Colloquium last June on the “Regulation and Mode of Action of Thyroid Hormones”, a discussion was held in which agreement was reached on suitable symbols for a number of compounds: namely, the iodinated thyronines and tyrosines. This discussion will be published in due course. Meanwhile we desire to direct the attention of those engaged in research on the thyroid to these agreed symbols and to a few additional symbols for compounds which might be found among thyroid hormones or their metabolites."

https://openalex.org/W2049025713,"MATTHEWS has shown1–3 that applying the guanine analogue 8-azaguanine (5-amino-7-hydroxy-1-V-triazolo (D) pyrimidine) to Nicotiana spp. infected with lucerne mosaic virus and to N. tabacum infected with tobacco mosaic virus delays the onset of symptoms. Over the past two years, we have made similar tests with 8-azaguanine on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) infected by aphids with beet yellows virus, which, in some years, is the cause of large losses of crop yield in the United Kingdom and other countries. We have observed a delay in the appearance of symptoms of about the same magnitude as those observed with tobacco mosaic virus. Matthews3 obtained delays in the appearance of symptoms with non-persistent viruses transmitted mechanically, but no such delays occurred when the same viruses were transmitted by aphids. Our results show that a delay can be obtained with a persistent, aphid-transmitted virus."

We submitted such a culture of S. typhi to the influence of various factors, transferred it into 37° C., and studied in suitable media the synthesis of antigen Vi, growth of the bacteria and synthesis of cell protein (Mazia)2. We determined antigen Vi in hot saline extracts by passive haemagglutination3–5."
