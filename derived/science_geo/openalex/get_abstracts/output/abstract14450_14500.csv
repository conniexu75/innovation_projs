https://openalex.org/W1586370846,"Cold-insoluble globulin (CI globulin) was purified from human plasma and identified on the basis of its sedimentation coefficient, electrophoretic mobility, and concentration in normal plasma. CI globulin was distinguished from antihemophilic factor (AHF) by amino acid analysis, position of elution from 4% agarose, and electrophoretic migration in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate without prior reduction. CI globulin and AHF could not be distinguished by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate after reduction and probably have very similar subunit molecular weights. CI globulin apparently consists of two polypeptide chains, each of molecular weight 2.0 x 10(5), held together by disulfide bonds. CI globulin was a substrate for activated fibrin-stabilizing factor (FSF, blood coagulation factor XIII). FSF catalyzed the incorporation of a fluorescent primary amine, N-(5-aminopentyl)-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonamide, into CI globulin and also catalyzed the cross-linking of CI globulin into multimers, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate after reduction. In the presence of fibrin, cross-linking of CI globulin by FSF occurred without the formation of CI globulin multimers. Instead, polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 2.6 x 10(5) and 3.0 x 10(5) were seen. The formation of these polypeptides coincided with the loss of the alpha chain of fibrin and CI globulin. The polypeptides were not seen when fibrin alone was cross-linked. The formation of the polypeptides was greater in fine clots than in coarse clots, and greater in clots incubated at 0 degrees than in clots incubated at 37 degrees. In clots made from purified fibrinogen, CI globulin, and FSF, the concentration of CI globulin in the clot liquor was greater if either FSF or calcium ion was omitted and cross-linking did not take place. These observations suggest that CI globulin is enzymically cross-linked to one of the chains of fibrin, most likely the alpha chain, and is thus covalently incorporated into the fibrin clot. CI globulin is very similar to a protein in the plasma membrane of fibroblasts. The cross-linking of CI globulin to itself and to fibrin may typify reactions also involving the fibroblast membrane protein."

Pharmacological analysis of the involvement of the brain catecholamines in tail-pinch behavior suggests that it is critically dependent on the nigrostriatal dopamine system."
https://openalex.org/W2013636131,"Water-insoluble membrane proteins may be analyzed by a new, rapid technique that combines electrophoresis on high-resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels and immunoelectrophoresis. After separation in the first dimension by electrophoresis in SDS, the proteins are subjected to a second electrophoresis at right angles through a two-layered buffered agarose gel. They first pass through a layer containing Lubrol PX which forms complexes with free SDS and then into an antiserum layer where antigen-antibody precipitates form. Precipitin arcs appear at positions corresponding to the antigens separated in the first dimension. The effectiveness of the technique was demonstrated with frog and cattle opsins, human erythrocyte membrane proteins, and their rabbit antiserums and for several water soluble proteins. By this method two fundamental parameters, molecular weight and antigenicity, may be readily used for analysis of membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2064854249,"Rats given intravenricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine or bilateral electrolytic lesions of the lateral hypothalamus do not show the normal increase in food intake in response to large decreases in glucose utilization or exposure to severe cold stress. However, they will eat more during chronic glucoprivation that is less intense, or during exposure to more moderate cold stress. Thus, the feeding deficits of these lesioned rats may not reflect an inability to respond to certain qualitatively different stimuli, but rather an inability to respond to quantitatively different intensities of the same stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W1583123061,"Dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate penetrates intact human erythrocytes and cross-links many of the membrane proteins to hemoglobin as well as to each other. The cross-linked complexes so produced have been analyzed by both one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, making use of the easy cleavability of the disulfide-containing reagent. The basic pattern of cross-linked complexes appears identical with that seen with unsealed ghosts. Although subtle relative motions cannot be ruled out, no rearrangement of nearest neighbor peptide chains, on a scale that would alter the cross-linking pattern, occurs during osmotic lysis of erythrocytes. Superimposed on the basic pattern was a series of complexes involving globin chains. Bands 1, 2, 2.2, 2.4, 3, 4.1, 4.2, 6, and 7 (nomenclature of Steck, T.L. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 66, 295-305) are all cross-linked to hemoglobin. Bands 2.2 and 2.4, recently shown to be accessible to the external surface of the membrane (Staros, J. V., and Richards, F. M. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 2720-2726), may be transmembrane proteins on the basis of the present findings. Band 5 is the only major band to show no detectable complexes with hemoglobin; oligomers of Band 5 itself, however, are seen. The absence of hemoglobin/Band 5 cross-linking in this case could reflect a special, as yet unexplained, environment for the Band 5 peptide. The amount of Band 6 in isolated membranes diminishes with increasing reagent concentration."

Primary fractions showing higher specific activity than homogenate were P2 (crude mitochondria and nerve endings) and P3-P2 was subfractionated on a Ficoll gradient with the P2B (nerve ending) subfraction exhibiting the greatest recovery (65%) and enrichment of toxin binding. Toxin binding showed a distribution similar to that of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, and sodium and potassium ion-activated ATPase. 2. P2B and P3 were subfractionated on five-step discontinuous sucrose gradients. The highest specific activity of toxin binding and acetylcholinesterase was associated with fractions of relatively low buoyant density, while choline acetyltransferase activity was associated with fractions of higher density. 3. Toxin binding, acetylcholinesterase, and choline acetyltransferase activities were relatively high in olfactory lobes, cerebral cortex, thalamic region, caudate nucleus, and brain stem; intermediate in hippocampus; low in cerebellum. 4. The relationship of toxin binding to the putative acetylcholine receptor in brain is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1492141962,"With pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the effects of various complexes of ferric cytochrome P-450 on the relaxation rate of bulk solution water protons have been determined. For the camphor, metyrapone, and 4-phenylimidazole complexes, the experimental results are consistent with outer sphere relaxation effects. However, for the substrate-free enzyme, the magnitude and temperature dependence of the paramagnetic relaxation effects indicate the presence of exchangeable protons in the coordination sphere of the heme iron atom. The exchange rate (9.3 x 10(4) S-1 at 25 degrees) and the thermodynamic activation parameters for the exchange process are very similar to those of acid metmyoglobin and acid methemoglobin, suggesting that a water molecule, and not an amino acid residue of the protein, coordinates to the ferric cation of the enzyme in the absence of added substrate or ligands. From the equations appropriate for coordination sphere protons, the distance between these protons and the ferric heme cation was evaluated as 2.1 A, which further supports the interpretation. These experimental results demonstrate that the solvent accessibility of the ferric cation of substrate-free cytochrome P-450 is significantly reduced by the binding of substrate or nitrogenous ligands to the hemeprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1987456577,"Foldback DNA is defined by its rapid, concentration-independent renaturation, consistent with intramolecular base pairing of inverted repeat sequences. Foldback DNA, isolated from renatured mouse main band DNA by hydroxyapatite chromatography, is spread for electron microscopy by the formamide isodenaturing technique. A large fraction of the molecules can be recognized as intramolecular ""hairpins""--structures in which complementary sequences on a single DNA strand form base-paired ""stem"" regions analogous to tRNA stems. The stem regions of the hairpins have a wide distribution of lengths, averaging about 1000 base pairs. About 60% of the stem regions terminate in single-stranded loops, ranging from 400 to many thousands of nucleotides in length, while 40% of the hairpins do not have discernible loops. There are about 40,000 hairpin-forming sequences in the main band portion of the mouse haploid genome. They appear to be either clustered in groups or confined to about one third of the DNA, rather than uniformly or randomly distributed. Another large fraction of the molecules seen in foldback DNA consists of linear structures, some of which are probably also hairpins. The electron microscopic results, along with simple theoretical considerations, make possible a better interpretation of our previous studies of the yield and S1 nuclease resistance of mouse foldback DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1508274819,"The inactivation of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase (L-malate: NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) from porcine heart and the specific modification of arginyl residues have been found to occur when the enzyme is inhibited with the reagent butanedione in sodium borate buffer. The inactivation of the enzyme was found to follow pseudo-first order kinetics. This loss of enzymatic activity was concomitant with the modification of 4 arginyl residues per molecule of enzyme. All 4 residues could be made inaccessible to modification when a malate dehydrogenase-NADH-hydroxymalonate ternary complex was formed. Only 2 of the residues were protected by NADH alone and appear to be essential. Studies of the butanedione inactivation in sodium phosphate buffer and of reactivation of enzymatic activity, upon the removal of excess butanedione and borate, support the role of borate ion stabilization in the inactivation mechanism previously reported by Riordan (Riordan, J.F. (1970) Fed. Proc. 29, Abstr. 462; Riordan, J.F. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 3915-3923). Protection from inactivation was also provided by the competitive inhibitor AMP, while nicotinamide exhibited no effect. Such results suggest that the AMP moiety of the NADH molecule is of major importance in the ability of NADH to protect the enzyme. When fluorescence titrations were used to monitor the ability of cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase to form a binary complex with NADH and to form a ternary complex with NADH and hydroxymalonate, only the formation of ternary complex seemed to be effected by arginine modification."
https://openalex.org/W1509564645,"AMP deaminase (AMP aminohydrolase, EC 3.5.4.6) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat muscle. The preparation exhibits a single polypeptide band with a molecular weight of 60,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of 11.3 S. Analysis by sedimentation equilibrium techniques showed the nat-ive enzyme to have a molecular weight of 238,000, whereas the enzyme, when analyzed in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, had a molecular weight of only 59,500. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined and peptide mapping was performed on a tryptic digest of S-carboxymethylated enzyme. NH2-terminal analysis by both the dansylation and cyanate procedures failed to identify a free NH2 terminus. Treatment of the enzyme with carboxypeptidase A resulted in the release of approximately 0.5 mol each of valine and leucine per 60,000 g of enzyme. The data presented indicate that hte native enzyme has a tetrameric structure consisting of four polypeptide chains each having a molecular weight of 60,000. The COOH-terminal analysis can be interpreted either as an indication of subunit heterogeneity or as a result of incomplete digestion of a -X-Leu-Val sequence at the end of a single type of polypeptide chain. Tryptic peptide maps strongly support the latter interpretation and suggest that the subunits are essentially identical."

https://openalex.org/W1552953453,"Proton-decoupled natural abundance 13C NMR spectra of carbon monoxide hemoglobins were recorded at 15.18 MHz by the Fourier transform method, under conditions of spectrometer sensitivity sufficient for detection of individual carbon resonances. The aromatic region of each spectrum contains broad bands of methine carbon resonances, and some relatively narrow peaks arising from nonprotonated carbons. Resonances of heme carbons were detected in spectra of carbon monoxide hemoglobins, but not in spectra of ferrihemoglobin (as a result of paramagnetic effects). Spectra of carbon monoxide hemoglobins from various species yielded only a few well resolved individual carbon resonances, most notably those of Cgamma of tryptophan residues. A comparison of the spectra of human adult, human fetal, chicken AII, and bovine fetal hemoglobins yielded specific assignments for all resonances of Cgamma of tryptophan residues. In the cases of human fetal, chicken AII, and bovine fetal hemoglobins, each tryptophan yielded a completely resolved individual carbon resonance. The chemical shift difference between the resonances of Cgamma of Trp-130beta and Cgamma of Trp-37beta is about 6 ppm. The chemical shift difference between Trp A12[14]alpha and Trp A12[15]beta is 1 ppm or less. A comparison of the chemical shifts of analogous tryptophan residues of the four carbon monoxide hemoglobins suggests very similar conformations in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1568390953,"Beta-Ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase catalyzes a common step in the utilization of protocatechuate and cis,cis-muconate by bacteria. Either of the two compounds elicits the synthesize of an enol-lactone hydrolase in Acinetobacter. The enol-lactone hydrolase that is induced by each compound was purified, and the properties of the proteins were compared. Both enzymes appear to be dimers with molecular weights of approximately 25,000. The amino acid compositions of the enzymes differ, and the two proteins do not cross-react serologically. The NH2-terminal amino acid residue of the protocatechuate-induced enol-lactone hydrolase (ELH I) is methionine and the NH2-terminal amino acid residue of the cis,cis-muconate-induced enol-lactone hydrolase (ELH II) is proline. Therefore, ELH I and ELH II appear to be the products of different structural genes. The serological specificity of ELH I and ELH II made it possible to demonstrate the mutually independent regulation of their synthesis in wild type cells and in constitutive mutant strains. The synthesis of ELH I is not impaired in mutant strains that cannot synthesize ELH II. The rapid characterization of mutant strains that produce ELH I or ELH II constitutively was made possible by the development of pH indicator enzyme assays that were performed with toluenized cells. cis,trans-Muconate, which does not support the growth of Acinetobacter, elicits the synthesis of the enzymes that normally are induced by cis,cis-muconate to 20% of fully induced levels."

The decrease in tension with shortening is accounted for almost entirely by a decrease in calcium release, rather than by changes in mechanical factors, such as filament geometry."

https://openalex.org/W1580885984,"Oxygen-linked effects of inositol hexaphosphate occur in heme-containing non-alpha chains isolated from normal human hemoglobin, fetal hemoglobin, and the abnormal human hemoglobin Abruzzo, beta143(H21) His leads to Arg. The occurrence of these effects implies that the chains undergo ligand-linked conformational changes. Inositol hexaphosphate lowers the oxygen affinity of isolated beta and gamma chains by differential binding to their deoxy conformations. Neither 2,3-diphosphoglycerate nor inorganic phosphate produces such an effect. In the case of Abruzzo beta chains, the binding of inorganic phosphate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate is also oxygen-linked. Stripped beta chains isolated from hemoglobin Abruzzo have much higher oxygen affinity than beta chains isolated from HbA. Their higher oxygen affinity and enhanced allosteric interactions with phosphates account, in large part, for the abnormal functional behavior of the hemoglobin Abruzzo tetramer. In this hemoglobin variant the substitution of arginine for histidine at beta143 involves a residue known to interact with anionic allosteric effectors of hemoglobin. It is of interest that the effect of inositol hexaphosphate observed with isolated gamma chains is comparable to the effect observed with isolated beta chains, even though the gamma143 position is occupied by an uncharged serine residue."

https://openalex.org/W1535708351,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase from Pseudomonas sp. (ATCC 11299a) has been purified 25- to 30-fold by a procedure which has been modified from that previously described for this organism (Guroff, G., and Ito, T. (1965) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 1175-1184; Guroff, G., and Rhoads, C. A. (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 3641-3645). Further purification yielded a preparation which was judged to be about 80% pure by sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing and standard analytical polyacrylamide gels, but the activity in this preparation has proved to be very labile. The enzyme appears to be a single protein chain of between 25,000 to 27,000 molecular weight. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan inhibit the activation of the enzyme by iron in a competitive fashion. The tyrosine metabolites, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic and homogentisic acids exhibit a biphasic effect on activation, stimulating at low iron, and inhibiting at higher iron concentrations. The hydroxylation itself is inhibited by tyrosine and related compounds such as L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopamine. p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid is a competitive inhibitor with respect to both substrate and cofactor. The data indicate a variety of means by which the bacterium can regulate phenylalanine hydroxylation."

https://openalex.org/W1525287890,"Rabbit hemopexin associates with rose bengal producing a hypochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of the dye; the extinction coefficient of the dye bound to heme-saturated hemopexin is approximately 20% lower than that of the dye bound to the apoprotein. The interaction of apo- and heme-saturated hemopexin with rose bengal was studied in detail by difference spectroscopy. Apo-hemopexin has one tight binding site for the dye with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range and a set of several weaker binding sites. In contrast, heme-saturated hemopexin has a very low affinity for the dye. Evidence that histidine residues of hemopexin participate in the binding of heme was obtained by photooxidation of hemopexin sensitized by rose bengal. Progressive modification of the 16 histidine residues of hemopexin is effected by illumination of the dye-hemopexin complexes. The midpoint of this pH-dependent reaction is at pH 6.8 +/- 0.1. In 15 min of irradiation, apo-hemopexin loses 50% of its ability to form a low spin hemichrome complex with deuteroheme while only 10% of the ligand coordination to heme iron of the deuteroheme-hemopexin is lost. At that time, approximately 2 more histidine residues are modified in apo-hemopexin than in deuteroheme-hemopexin, and no change is found in other potentially photolabile amino acid residues. The characteristic circular dichroism positive extremum at 231 nm of hemopexin also was decreased by photooxidation, and the loss was slower in the deuteroheme-hemopexin complex than in the apoprotein. When deuteroporphyrin IX was used as the photosensitizing agent, similar results were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1485977948,"A bile canalicular membrane fraction was isolated from 24-hour regenerating rat livers, and its properties were compared to those of homologous fractions prepared from the livers of sham-operated and unoperated controls. These canalicular membrane fractions were found to be closely related in terms of their morphology, their purity, their yield, and their qualitative protein banding profiles on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. However, when a rigorous examination of plasma membrane enzyme marker activities was made, the regenerating liver membranes were shown to possess an increased specific activity of alkaline phosphatase and lower levels of Mg2+ ATPase and 5'-nucleotidase in comparison with control specific activity values."

We now report the isolation from pork liver of a soluble NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase which acts on both 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-fuconate and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabonate. This enzyme has been purified to homogeneity by a five-step procedure; the final step involved affinity chromatography on NAD+-agarose. A purification factor of about 3000-fold was achieved with a yield of over 20%. The enzyme was homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.1 and 7.0 and on the basis of sedimentation equilibrium analysis with the ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight of the native enzyme is about 100,000 while disc gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and thiol showed the presence of a polypeptide of molecular weight 26,800; these results suggest that the enzyme is a tetramer. The enzyme has an isoelectric point of 5.4. The enzyme is unstable in the dilute state and in the absence of thiol but can be kept for 2 years at -70 degrees at a protein concentration of 4 mg per ml and in the presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol."

https://openalex.org/W1541842143,"The amino acid sequence of the proinsulin C-peptide isolated from guinea pig pancreas was determined and experimental data are presented. Digestion of the C-peptide with chymotrypsin provided two dodecapeptides, a tetrapeptide, and glutamine, which account for the intact chain. Reaction of the C-peptide with cyanogen bromide resulted in cleavage at the single methionine and provided two additional fragments. Digestion of the large peptides with papain provided a variety of small peptides and the complete sequence was assigned by identification of the fragments. Although guinea pig insulin differs markedly from mammalian insulins, guinea pig C-peptide has many features of primary structure in common with the C-peptides of other mammals. The conservation of specific residues in C-peptides indicates that these residues form essential elements in the three-dimensional structure of proinsulin."
https://openalex.org/W1577143484,"The proportion of palmitate at position 2 of triacylglycerols synthesized by microsome-cytosol preparations of rat, mouse, or chicken adipose tissue was found to be markedly increased by the addition of an inactivated preparation of pig adipose tissue microsomes. A phosphate extract of pig adipose tissue microsomes was also active in directing palmitate to position 2 of rat triacylglycerols. The proportion of palmitate at position 2 of triacylglycerols synthesized was reduced by prior repeated extraction of the pig adipose tissue microsomes with phosphate. The pretreatment specificity was restored when the extract was added back to the microsomes. These observations support the proposal that the unusually high proportion of palmitate at position 2 of lard results from the action of a factor controlling the specificity of the acyltransferase(s) from pig adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1488221919,"Upon reaction with N-ethylmaleimide, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from beef pancreas dissociates into subunits. At pH7, the rate of the dissociation is close to both the reaction rate of the buried--SH groups and the rate of inactivation (Iborra, F., Mourgeon, G., Labouesse B., and Labouesse, J. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 39, 547-556). The pH and enzyme concnetration dependences of the reaction rate of the 16 cysteinyl residues of the enzyme as well as that of its inactivation support the idea that inactivation by alkylation of the--SH groups is due essentially to the dissociation of the protein into inactive subunits and not to the chemical blocking of a catalytic residue. This is confirmed by the independence on N-ethylmaleimide concentration of the reaction of the buried--SH groups and of the inactivation of the enzyme at high N-ethylmaleimide concentration. The dissociation becomes in this case the rate-limiting step of the chemical reaction. The monomeric structure is stabilized by the blocking of the--SH groups exposed during the dissociation. The dissociation constant of the dimeric enzyme is progressively increased during the alkylation. The tightness of the associated structure depends on the protonation of groups titrating between pH 7 and pH 9."
