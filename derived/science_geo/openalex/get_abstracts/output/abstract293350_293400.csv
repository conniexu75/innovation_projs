https://openalex.org/W2061848554,"The role of forests in the American society and economy has changed greatly over the past 200 years, as is evidenced by data on acreage in forests, on volume of standing timber, on amount of annual wood growth, on amounts and form of wood utilization, and on prices for forest products. The two most dramatic facts in a long history of forest utilization have been the near fourfold increase in annual wood growth in the past 60 years and the persistent and major underestimate by the U.S. Forest Service of the wood production potential of American forests."
https://openalex.org/W1967666849,"The amount of carbon dioxide that can be dissolved in surface seawater depends at least partially on the homogeneous buffer factor, which is a mathematical function of the chemical equilibrium conditions among the various dissolved inorganic species. Because these equilibria are well known, the homogeneous buffer factor is well known. Natural spatial variations depend very systematically on sea surface temperatures, and do not contribute significantly to uncertainties in the present or future carbon dioxide budget."

https://openalex.org/W2041139363,"A distinct (0.5 per mil) carbon-13/carbon-12 isotopic shift in the light direction has been identified in a shallow marine sedimentary sequence of Late Miocene age at Blind River, New Zealand, and correlated with a similar shift in Late Miocene Deep Sea Drilling Project sequences throughout the Indo-Pacific. A dated piston core provides an age for the shift of 6.2 +/- 0.1 million years. Correlations based on the carbon isotopic change require a revision of the previously established magnetostratigraphy at Blind River. The carbon shift at Blind River occurs between 6.2 and 6.3 +/- 0.1 million years before present. A new chronology provides an age for the evolutionary first appearance datum of Globorotalia conomiozea at 6.1 +/- 0.1 million years, the beginning of a distinct latest Miocene cooling event associated with the Kapitean stage at 6.2 +/- 0.1 million years, and the beginning of a distinct shallowing of water depths at 6.1 +/- 0.1 million years. The Miocene-Pliocene boundary as recognized in New Zealand is now dated at 5.3 +/- 0.1 million years. Extension of carbon isotope stratigraphy to other shallow Late Miocene sequences should provide an important datum for international correlation of Late Miocene shallow and deep marine sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2070951253,"The bracken fern, Pteridium aquilinum, which can form completely homozygous zygotes in a single generation of self-fertilization, has a genetic system that allows the storage and release of genetic variability in spite of this homozygosity. Analysis of the distribution of electrophoretically demonstrable genetic markers demonstrates that this system is based on recombination between duplicated, unlinked loci."

https://openalex.org/W1984475659,"Motivated by concerns about the difficulty of safeguarding the large flows of plutonium in a breeder reactor fuel cycle, we explore the resource and economic implications of a strategy in which there is no nuclear weapons-usable material in fresh reactor fuel. The strategy involves the deployment of already developed types of advanced converter reactors which, unlike the breeder, can be operated effectively on proliferation-resistant once-through fuel cycles. Advanced converter reactors could be much more uranium-efficient on once-through fuel cycles than current systems and therefore could compete economically with breeders up to very high uranium prices. If necessary, the uranium requirements of an advanced converter reactor system could be reduced much further with the recycling of isotopically denatured uranium, but any commitment to a closed fuel cycle would be unnecessary for many decades."
https://openalex.org/W2021123300,The composition of the gaseous emissions of two fumaroles at the summit of Kilauea Volcano was monitored for m√¥re than 2 years. Magma was released from the summit reservoir on three occasions during this period; prior to or during each event the ratios of helium to carbon dioxide in the fumarole gases decreased substantially from that observed during periods of quiescence.

https://openalex.org/W2084063015,The disposal of hazardous wastes by incineration is discussed. The ecological impacts of this type of disposal is reviewed. The cost of the operation is also considered. The use of incinerator ships and the success of their operation are reviewed. The role of EPA in monitoring incinerating activities and in aiding in situ selection for on land incinerators is discussed. The use of microwaves to incinerate wastes was studied. A more expensive method of disposal in molten sodium carbonate at 800/sup 0/ to 1000/sup 0/C is presented. The use of deep-well injection to dispose of wastes is discussed.
