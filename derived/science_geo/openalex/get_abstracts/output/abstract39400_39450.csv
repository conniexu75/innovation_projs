https://openalex.org/W2117149353,"The complete 9193-nucleotide sequence of the probable causative agent of AIDS, lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), has been determined. The deduced genetic structure is unique: it shows, in addition to the retroviral gag, pol, and env genes, two novel open reading frames we call Q and F. Remarkably, Q is located between pol and env and F is half-encoded by the U3 element of the LTR. These data place LAV apart from the previously characterized family of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1974905296,"Unexplained debilitating dementia or encephalopathy occurs frequently in adults and children with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Brains from 15 individuals with AIDS and encephalopathy were examined by Southern analysis and in situ hybridization for the presence of human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III), the virus believed to be the causative agent of AIDS. HTLV-III DNA was detected in the brains of five patients, and viral-specific RNA was detected in four of these. In view of these findings and the recent demonstration of morphologic and genetic relatedness between HTLV-III and visna virus, a lentivirus that causes a chronic degenerative neurologic disease in sheep, HTLV-III should be evaluated further as a possible cause of AIDS encephalopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2025021474,"About 1% of the mouse genome is cleaved by Hpa II to give a discrete fraction on gels. The nonmethylated fraction is present in all tested tissues, including sperm, and contains Hpa II sites at about 15 times their frequency in bulk DNA. About 80% of the fraction is composed of sequences that occur once or a few times per genome; the remainder is largely rDNA. Unlike bulk DNA, the fraction is not deficient in CpG, and this may be directly due to the lack of methylation. Genomic mapping of three nonribosomal fragments showed that they are part of islands of DNA within which nonmethylated Hpa II and Hha I sites are highly concentrated. We estimate about 30,000 islands per haploid genome and discuss evidence that many may be associated with genes."
https://openalex.org/W2011603889,"A study was conducted of the genetic relation between human T-cell lymphotropic retroviruses and visna virus. The human T-cell lymphotropic viruses include those associated with T-cell malignancies (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) as well as the etiologic agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HTLV-III). Visna virus, a slowly replicating and pathogenic but nononcogenic retrovirus of sheep, is a member of the subfamily Lentivirinae. Results obtained by molecular hybridization and heteroduplex analysis indicated that a greater extent of nucleotide sequence homology exists between HTLV-III and visna virus than between HTLV-III and any of the other viruses. The homology observed under conditions of low stringency spanned the entire genome, but was strongest in the gag/pol region. The morphogenesis and fine structure of HTLV-III and visna virus also demonstrated striking similarities. The data provide strong evidence for a close taxonomic and thus evolutionary relation between HTLV-III and the Lentivirinae subfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2077220677,"The principal transcription product of Notch, a locus involved in the neurogenesis of D. melanogaster, is a developmentally regulated poly(A)+ RNA approximately 10.5 kb in length. Analysis of the structure of this RNA has revealed a 93 bp repeated sequence that is shared by many other developmentally regulated transcription units. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the repeat shows an unusual structure consisting predominantly of the triplets CAG and CAA, both of which can code for the amino acid Gln. We present evidence indicating that the Notch repeat is a member of a novel family of repetitive elements, which we term the opa family. Our data suggest that some of these elements may be not only transcribed but also translated. We compare opa with other known transcribed repeats and speculate on its functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W2018819460,"We report that the light-harvesting and reaction center genes in the rxcA locus of R. capsulata are contained within a single operon and that their differential expression results predominantly from marked segmental differences in stability within the polycistronic rxcA transcript. The 3′ portion of this transcript is rapidly degraded to give rise to either of two slowly decaying mRNA remnants, both of which encode only the light-harvesting polypeptides. The greater stability of these remnants accounts for nearly all of the difference between the concentrations of the light-harvesting and reaction center proteins. The unstable 3′ portion of the transcript is delimited by two alternative stem-and-loop structures, which apparently act as barriers to 3′ exoribonucleases and thereby protect the upstream RNA segment. When a DNA fragment containing the rxcA locus was fused to a plasmid promoter and transcribed in E. coli, the long precursor transcript was processed to two short messages of greater stability, as in R. capsulata."
https://openalex.org/W2084794856,"The dnaA gene in E. coli K-12 is required for the initiation of DNA replication. Although the specific function of the dnaA protein is unknown, it has been suggested that it is a regulator of the frequency of initiation. In this paper we report that the expression of both a dnaA-lacZ translational fusion and a dnaA-trpA-lacZ transcriptional fusion in vivo are sensitive to changes in the level of functional dnaA protein. Overproduction of the dnaA gene product leads to a reduction in expression from both fusions while introduction of dnaA- alleles results in an increased expression. Results from a deletion analysis of the dnaA promoter/regulatory region suggest that both dnaA promoters are regulated by the dnaA gene product and that a site between the two promoters is responsible for the regulation. DNAase protection experiments showed that the dnaA protein binds to DNA in the region of the two dnaA promoters. Our results indicate that the dnaA gene product regulates its own synthesis by inhibiting transcription from both of its promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1583023128,"Human platelet membrane vesicles that accumulated Ca2+ in the presence of ATP were isolated on an isoosmotic KCl-Percoll gradient. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake was stimulated by oxalate and phosphate to steady-state levels of greater than 100 nmol/mg protein, and the accumulated Ca2+ could be largely released by ionophore A23187. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, in a dose-dependent manner (0.5-5.0 microM), caused the rapid release (less than 5 s) of 40-70% of the total A23187-releasable store of accumulated Ca2+. The membrane vesicles that release accumulated Ca2+ in response to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate were enriched in enzymes characteristically found in smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These results support the hypothesis that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, produced by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 1,4-bisphosphate in response to stimulation of cell surface receptors, is a second messenger mediating the release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites."
https://openalex.org/W1492306774,"Our previous research has shown that the Ca2+-dependent protease within platelets is activated when platelets aggregate, resulting in the production of three polypeptides (Mr = 200,000, 100,000, and 91,000). We have now shown that these three polypeptides arise from the hydrolysis of actin-binding protein. An antibody against actin-binding protein raised in rabbits was shown to be specific for actin-binding protein on immunoblots of total platelet proteins. This antibody reacted with additional polypeptides of Mr = 200,000, 100,000, and 91,000 on immunoblots of the proteins of thrombin-activated platelets. Actin-binding protein was purified from fresh, human platelet concentrate and hydrolyzed with platelet-derived Ca2+-dependent protease; hydrolysis resulted in the appearance of three polypeptides with molecular weights and isoelectric points identical to those of the three polypeptides generated within intact, aggregating platelets. Production of these polypeptides was inhibited by leupeptin and by the chelation of Ca2+. Hydrolysis of actin-binding protein was observed at micromolar Ca2+ concentrations, demonstrating that the level of Ca2+ in aggregated platelets is sufficient to account for the hydrolysis of actin-binding protein by the Ca2+-dependent protease. P235 was also purified and tested for its susceptibility to the protease. It was hydrolyzed by the Ca2+-dependent protease, and two polypeptides (Mr = 200,000 and 46,000) were produced. Antibodies against P235 raised in rabbits reacted only with P235 on immunoblots of total platelet proteins. These antibodies also reacted with polypeptides of Mr = 200,000 and 46,000 on immunoblots of thrombin-activated platelets. These data show that both actin-binding protein and P235 are cleaved during thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and suggest that the activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease may permit reorganization of the platelet cytoskeleton in aggregating platelets."

When DNA copies of messenger RNA's for the G or N proteins of VSV were linked to a vaccinia virus promoter and inserted into the vaccinia genome, the recombinants retained infectivity and synthesized VSV polypeptides. After intradermal vaccination with live recombinant virus expressing the G protein, mice produced VSV-neutralizing antibodies and were protected against lethal encephalitis upon intravenous challenge with VSV. In cattle, the degree of protection against intradermalingually injected VSV was correlated with the level of neutralizing antibody produced following vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W1547972279,"The human leukemic cell line, HL-60, differentiates in response to tumor-promoting phorbol esters. Recently, we have reported that one of the first events evoked by phorbol esters in HL-60 cells is the stimulation of Na+-dependent H+ efflux. In efforts to determine whether stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by phorbol esters is coupled to induction of cellular differentiation, we found that 1) amiloride, a frequently used inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, rapidly inhibits phorbol ester-stimulated protein phosphorylation in vivo and protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation in vitro, both with potency similar to that with which amiloride inhibits Na+/H+ exchange; 2) an amiloride analog, dimethylamiloride, is a far more potent inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange than is amiloride, while being no more potent than amiloride in inhibiting phorbol ester/protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation; and 3) at concentrations sufficient to completely inhibit Na+/H+ exchange, amiloride blocked phorbol ester-induced adhesion of HL-60 cells (adhesion being a property indicative of the differentiated state), but dimethylamiloride (as well as ethylisopropylamiloride, another very potent amiloride analog) did not. Thus, dimethylamiloride represents a potential tool for distinguishing protein kinase C-coupled from Na+/H+ exchange-coupled events in phorbol ester-stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598998118,"Stimulation of platelets and other secretory cells by agonists results in the degradation of phosphoinositides by phospholipase C. Kinetic studies suggest that hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) is an initial event in this process. Platelets contain much larger amounts of phosphatidylinositol (PI) than PI-4,5-P2, and approximately 50% of total phosphoinositides are degraded upon stimulation. We have investigated whether degradation of PI occurs by direct phospholipase C hydrolysis or by phosphorylation to PI-4,5-P2 followed by phospholipase C action on the latter compound. When platelets are incubated for 3 min with 32Pi prior to stimulation, the phosphoinositides are labeled to different specific activities. Under these nonequilibrium conditions, the time course of change in specific activity reflects turnover. The rise in specific activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4-P) is similar in stimulated and unstimulated cells, indicating that there is little increase in the conversion of PI to PI-4-P during thrombin stimulation. In addition, the specific activity of the 4-phosphate in PI-4-P during thrombin stimulation is less than both the 5-phosphate of PI-4,5-P2 and the phosphate group of phosphatidic acid, indicating that the 4-phosphate moiety is not labeled to equilibrium with ATP. This finding is inconsistent with a rapid flux of PI via PI-4-P to PI-4,5-P2 during thrombin stimulation, in which case the 4-phosphate would be at maximum specific activity. We, therefore, conclude that the bulk of PI breakdown that occurs in thrombin-stimulated platelets occurs via direct phospholipase C hydrolysis of PI."
https://openalex.org/W2030865698,"Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging was demonstrated on two plant species, Apium graveolens and Coleus blumei. This was accomplished by soaking stems of these plants in the paramagnetic nitroxide imaging agent 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. The experiments were accomplished at L-band frequency (1.4 to 1.9 gigahertz) with single-turn, flat-loop surface coils. One-dimensional imaging spectra were diagnostic of capillary structure and long-term stability."
https://openalex.org/W1589159338,"Two molecular forms of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase catalytic subunit have been identified in rat adipocyte plasma membranes using immunological techniques. The similarity between these two forms and those in brain (Sweadner, K. J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6060-6067) led us to use the same nomenclature: alpha and alpha(+). The K0.5 values of each form for ouabain (determined by inhibition of phosphorylation of the enzyme from [gamma-32P]ATP) were 3 X 10(-7)M for alpha(+) and 1 X 10(-5)M for alpha. These numbers correlate well with the K0.5 values for the two ouabain-inhibitable components of 86Rb+/K+ pumping in intact cells (1 X 10(-7) M and 4 X 10(-5)M). Quantitation of the Na+ pumps in plasma membranes demonstrated a total of 11.5 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg of membrane protein, of which 8.5 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg, or 75%, was alpha(+). Insulin stimulation of 86Rb+/K+ uptake in rat adipocytes was abolished by ouabain at a concentration sufficient to inhibit only alpha(+)(2-5 X 10(-6)M). Immunological techniques and ouabain inhibition of catalytic labeling of the enzyme from [gamma-32P]ATP demonstrated that alpha(+) was present in skeletal muscle membranes as well as in adipocyte membranes, but was absent from liver membranes. Since insulin stimulates increased Na+ pump activity in adipose and muscle tissue but not in liver, there is a correlation between hormonal regulation of (Na+,K+)-ATPase and the presence of alpha(+). We propose that alpha(+) is the hormonally-sensitive version of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1595135821,"The nuclear pool of soluble histones in Xenopus laevis oocytes is organized into two major types of acidic histone complexes separable by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. One type of complex sediments at 5 S (Mr approximately 120,000), is isoelectric at pH 4.6, and contains histones H3 and/or H4 tightly bound to one polypeptide of a pair of very acidic polypeptides, designated N1 and N2 (Kleinschmidt, J. A., and Franke, W. W. (1982) Cell 29, 799-809). This complex can be selectively immunoprecipitated by guinea pig antibodies against purified protein N1/N2. In contrast, a larger complex of 7 S contains four histones and nucleoplasmin (the purified protein exists as a pentamer of a polypeptide of Mr approximately 30,000), is isoelectric over the pH range of 5-7, and can be immunoprecipitated by nucleoplasmin antibodies. Its relative molecular weight of 130,000-170,000, as determined by gel filtration, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cross-linked complexes, excludes the association of a histone octamer with nucleoplasmin. In addition to histones H2A and H2B, two histones (designated H3 and H4) which are similar in their electrophoretic mobilities to histones H3 and H4 but have lower isoelectric pH values are enriched in immuno-precipitates obtained with nucleoplasmin antibodies. Cross-linking of complexes present in intact nuclei, using 1% formaldehyde at near-physiological ionic strength and pH, indicates the coexistence of these two soluble histone complexes in the living cell. In chromatin assembly experiments using SV 40 DNA, both histone fractions are able to transfer histones to DNA, resulting in an increase of DNA superhelicity and the formation of beaded nucleoprotein complexes of nucleosome-like morphology. The common principle governing both types of complexes, i.e. the association of one or two histone molecules with a karyophilic large acidic histone-binding protein is emphasized. We discuss the possible role of these complexes in storing histones utilized in chromatin assembly during early amphibian embryogenesis as well as the possible existence of similar complexes, albeit at lower concentrations, in somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2052169714,"The expression of a previously unidentified gene product, encoded by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome, has been achieved with a recombinant SV40 expression vector. Antibodies against synthetic peptides representing defined regions of this protein were used to screen cells infected with recombinant virus as well as tissues naturally infected with HBV. A 24,000-dalton protein (p24) was detected in cells infected with recombinant virus and a 28,000-dalton protein (p28) was detected in tissues infected with HBV. The peptides or recombinant-derived protein were used as antigens to screen sera from individuals infected with HBV. Specific antibodies were detected predominantly in sera from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The presence of p28 in tissues infected with HBV and the appearance of specific antibodies in infectious sera establish the existence of an additional marker for HBV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2167067374,"Using supercoiled plasmids containing a (CG)16 sequence downstream of a promoter, it is shown that purified E. coli RNA polymerase can transcribe through the sequence when it is in the B helical form. However, the polymerase together with its nascent transcript is blocked at the boundary of the CG sequence proximal to the promoter when the template is negatively supercoiled to flip the CG sequence to the left-handed Z-form. S1 nuclease mapping of in vivo transcripts from an E. coli gyrase temperature-sensitive mutant harboring the plasmids indicates that the bulk of the transcripts at either permissive or nonpermissive temperatures can proceed through the CG sequence, suggesting that the sequence is normally in the B helical form in vivo. The almost total blockage of transcription in vitro by the (CG)16 sequence in a highly negatively supercoiled DNA is not observed for a d(CA)21 X d(TG)21 insert."
https://openalex.org/W2003390279,"The chicken pyruvate kinase gene is interrupted by at least ten introns, including nine introns within the coding region. We compare the structure of this gene with the three-dimensional protein structure of the homologous cat muscle enzyme. The introns are not randomly placed-they divide the coding sequence into fairly uniformly sized pieces encoding discrete elements of secondary structure. The introns tend to fall at interruptions between stretches of α-helix or β-sheet residues, and each of the six exons that contribute to the barrel-shaped central domain include one or two repeats of a simple unit, an α-helix plus a β strand. This structure suggests that introns were not inserted into a previously uninterrupted coding sequence, but instead are products of the evolution of the first pyruvate kinase gene. We have found some sequence homology between a segment of pyruvate kinase and the structurally homologous mononucleotide binding fold of alcohol dehydrogenase. The superposition of these two regions aligns an intron from the maize alcohol dehydrogenase gene four nucleotides from an intron in the chicken pyruvate kinase gene."
https://openalex.org/W2038335028,"The nucleotide sequence of the long terminal repeat sequence (LTR) of the human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III) was determined. This virus is associated etiologically with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The LTR was found to be 634 base pairs in length with U3, R, and U5 regions of 453, 98, and 83 bp, respectively. The proviral DNA is flanked by a 7-base-pair direct repeat. The promoter and polyadenylation signals are situated 27 and 24 base pairs upstream from the respective transcriptional initiation and polyadenylation sites. The primer binding site is complementary to transfer RNA-lysine. The LTR of HTLV-III, like that of HTLV-I, showed a limited homology to enhancer-like sequences within two genes expressed specifically in T lymphocytes, T-cell growth factor, and gamma-interferon. Structural comparisons revealed that the LTR of HTLV-III is distantly related to those of HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and bovine leukemia virus."
https://openalex.org/W2157935304,"125I-labeled vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (125I-VIP) was covalently cross-linked with its binding sites on intact cultured human lymphoblasts by each of three bifunctional reagents: disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate) (EGS), and N-succinimidyl 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (SANAH). A fourth cross-linking agent with a shorter chain length, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl 4-azidobenzoate (HSAB), was much less effective in cross-linking 125I-VIP to the site. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography demonstrated a band of Mr approximately equal to 50,000 +/- 3,000, regardless of which cross-linker was used. The labeling of this band was specific in that it was prevented by 10(-6) M unlabeled VIP and was partially blocked by the homologous hormones secretin and glucagon. The relative potencies of these peptides in blocking the cross-linking of 125I-VIP to the Mr approximately equal to 50,000 band of the lymphoblasts (VIP greater than secretin greater than or equal to glucagon) were similar to those previously found for competitive inhibition of 125I-VIP binding to its putative high-affinity receptor on these cells. The covalent cross-linking required a bifunctional reagent; it was dependent on both the number of Molt cells and the concentration of 125I-VIP. The apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked species was unchanged by treatment with dithiothreitol. These observations suggest that the Mr = 50,000 species represents 125I-VIP cross-linked to a specific plasma membrane receptor and that the receptor does not contain interchain disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1579888792,"The post-translational processing of the epidermal growth factor receptor in human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells has been investigated. By employing the affinity matrix epidermal growth factor Affi-Gel in conjunction with immunoprecipitation, it has been demonstrated that core oligosaccharide addition is essential for the acquisition of epidermal growth factor-binding activity. Furthermore, the initial 160-kDa translation product was observed to undergo a processing step by which ligand-binding activity was acquired with a half-time of approximately 30 min while exhibiting no apparent change in mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This was shown not to involve the conversion of high-mannose chains to complex chains which have been capped with fucose and sialic acid. Possible explanations for this activation in terms of translocation of intermediates and/or formation of disulfide bonds are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1514913575,"A subcellular extract from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to transcribe cloned yeast tRNA genes in vitro and to process the primary transcripts at the 5' and 3' termini. Chromatographic fractionation of the extract has separated the transcription components from two distinct nucleolytic activities: an endonuclease that cleaves the precursors to produce mature 5' termini; and a 3'-5' exonuclease. These fractions have been used to elaborate a processing pathway for the dimeric primary transcript of the yeast tRNAArg-tRNAAsp gene pair. Under optimal conditions in vitro this gene is expressed at a rate of 200 transcripts/gene/hour, initiating at position -10 with respect to the mature 5' terminus of tRNAArg and terminating near position +160. The primary transcripts are cleaved by an endonuclease to give tRNAAsp with a mature 5' terminus, and a pre-tRNAArg monomer with a 5' leader and 3' trailer sequences. A second endonuclease cleavage of pre-tRNAArg generates the mature 5' terminus of tRNAArg. The endonuclease cleavages are not ordered. Exonuclease activity(ies) remove the spacer sequences from the 5' mature tRNAArg, and trim the 3' trailer portion from tRNAAsp. Exonucleolytic removal of the 3' trailer does not require prior endonuclease action, but removal of the spacer sequences from pre-tRNAArg is incomplete without prior removal of the 5' leader sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1519718386,"Recently, the dermal fibroblasts (ATCC CRL 1262) of a lethal perinatal variant of osteogenesis imperfecta have been used for the first molecular characterization of a collagen gene defect (Chu, M. L., Williams, C. J., Pepe, G., Hirsch, J. L., Prockop, D. J., and Ramirez, F. (1983) Nature (Lond.) 304, 78-80). These studies revealed that the patient was heterozygous for an internal deletion of approximately 500 base pairs in the pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene, consistent with previous investigations indicating that CRL 1262 fibroblasts equally synthesized a normal and a shortened pro-alpha 1(I) chain (Barsh, G. S., and Byers, P. H. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 5142-5146). Cloning and analysis of the affected allele of CRL 1262 has now indicated that the deletion is contained between two introns of the pro-alpha 1(I) gene and results in the elimination of three exons of the triple helical domain. Furthermore, the termini of the rearrangement are located within two short inverted repeats suggesting that the self-complementary nature of these DNA elements may have favored the formation of a DNA secondary structure intermediate which, in turn, served as substrate for the deletion. Evidence are also presented for an elevated Type III collagen mRNA content in the patient fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1973831269,"Four genomic clones obtained from microdissected fragments of the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 17 have been used to identify a series of t-haplotype-specific restriction fragments. Their specificity is defined by presence in eight complete t haplotypes and absence from 18 inbred strains of wild-type mice. Partial t haplotypes contain subsets of the t-specific fragments, and each can be classified according to the t-specific fragments it contains. This is the first molecular evidence that independent partial t haplotypes contain different lengths of t haplotype DNA. Recombination studies indicate that partial t haplotypes suppress recombination in proportion to the extent of t haplotype DNA they contain. Molecular analysis of partial t haplotypes shows that the t-specific fragments map to and thus define different regions of the t complex. Certain regions of t haplotype DNA defined by t-specific restriction fragments can be correlated with loci involved in the control of transmission ratio distortion."
https://openalex.org/W1676519673,"Abstract The gene for rat cholecystokinin (CCK) was isolated from a rat genomic DNA library. The transcription unit spans 7 kilobases and is interrupted by two introns. The initiator methionine codon lies 2 bases into exon 2; therefore, exon 1 is a noncoding exon. The transcription initiation site was determined using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase, a cDNA primer, and mRNA isolated from a rat medullary thyroid carcinoma. A TATA-like sequence precedes the transcription initiation site at position -34. The polyadenylation site for the gene was mapped by a nuclease protection assay using a cRNA generated by transcription of the exon 3 region of the CCK gene with SP6 bacteriophage RNA polymerase. The sequence AT-TAAA is found 22 bases 5' to the site determined to be the polyadenylation addition site. Two regions of simple repetitive DNA occur within the CCK lambda clone, one within intron 2 and the other 4 kilobases 3' to the gene. Sequence analysis of the repetitive element 3' distal to the gene revealed two copies of the sequence 5'-(AC)n-3', where n is 22 and 25. A 114-base pair sequence of predominantly repeating purine-pyrimidine nucleotides separates these two d(AC) repeats. Transcriptional control elements were investigated by fusing regions of the CCK gene to the structural gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Promoter activity was determined by transfecting COS-7 cells with plasmids containing the gene fusions, followed by determining chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in cellular extracts. The region necessary for expression of the CCK gene fusions in COS-7 cells is within 144 bases 5' to the initiation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1988333200,The transcription initiation signals for retroviruses lie within the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences that flank the integrated provirus. This study shows that factors present in cells infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) mediate transcriptional trans activation of the BLV LTR. This phenomenon is similar to that reported for the human T-cell leukemia virus LTR and establishes both structural and functional criteria for inclusion of BLV and human T-cell leukemia viruses in the same family of transforming retroviruses.
https://openalex.org/W2093060289,"A novel mechanism of oncogene activation by transposition of a tissue-specific cellular enhancer is described. A rearranged c-myc oncogene was cloned from murine plasmacytoma ABPC17 in the expectation that it would reflect the t(6;15) chromosome translocation carried by this tumor. The rearrangement instead reflects an insertion 361 bp 5' to the c-myc gene on chromosome 15. The insert conveys a 2.3 kb segment of the immunoglobulin heavy (H) chain locus from chromosome 12. Since the insertion introduces the lymphoid-specific enhancer from the JH-Smu region and also disrupts a region implicated in normal c-myc control, it may account for the c-myc transcription observed in ABPC17. The structure of the transposed segment and a corresponding deletion in the JH-Smu region suggests that the transposition reflects a complex recombination between chromosomes 15 and 12. Since the t(6;15) breakpoint is not near c-myc, chromosome 15 must have undergone an independent exchange with chromosome 6."
https://openalex.org/W1766845628,"Abstract We present a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the structure and organization of a cloned ribosomal RNA gene cluster from the archaebacterial species Halobacterium cutirubrum. With the exception of a region in the middle of the 23 S rRNA gene, the DNA sequence of the entire gene cluster has been determined. The gene organization is similar to that found in typical eubacteria with the 16, 23, and 5 S genes occupying the proximal, middle, and distal positions, respectively. There appears to be no equivalent to the eucaryotic 5.8 S gene in H. cutirubrum. The cluster also contains two putative tRNA genes, an alanine tRNA gene in the 16-23 S intergenic space, and a cysteine tRNA gene distal to the 5 S rRNA gene. The 16 and 23 S rRNA genes are surrounded by long nearly perfect inverted repeat sequences which are presumably utilized along with other structural features of the RNA for the processing of 16 and 23 S rRNA from a large precursor transcript. The 5' sequence flanking the 16 S rRNA gene contains two imperfect copies, followed by three perfect copies of a bipartite direct-repeat unit. The sequence AAGTAA, believed to be an important component of the Halobacterium promotor, is present in the highly conserved portion of the direct repeat unit. In the 3' region flanking the 5 S rRNA gene there are sequences, a short inverted repeat followed by T5, and a G/C-rich region followed by an A/T-rich region, which may function in transcription termination. Genomic southern hybridization experiments clearly indicate that the ribosomal RNA genes are unique single-copy DNA in H. cutirubrum."
https://openalex.org/W2042155513,"Using gold complexes stabilized with a monoclonal antibody specific for the human transferrin receptor, the distribution of transferrin receptors on the surfaces of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells has been mapped at high resolution. On prefixed cells and cells incubated at 5 degrees C, the receptors are predominantly within and around clathrin-coated microdomains near the free cell margin. By preincubating the cells with saturating concentrations of free antibody at 5 degrees C and warming them to 37 degrees C in the presence of the gold complexes, the appearance of new receptors in the membrane has been followed. The majority first appear near the free cell margin and then move centripetally. At first, they are monodisperse, but as they move toward the site of internalization they form loose aggregates. Within the immediate vicinity of the clathrin-coated microdomains the migrating receptors form closely packed, ordered aggregates. These observations indicate recycling transferrin receptors move to their site of internalization without cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W1602935155,"The structural organization of the entire chicken calmodulin (CaM) gene was determined by analysis of overlapping genomic clones obtained from Charon 4A and cosmid DNA libraries. These clones together span 39 kilobases of chicken genomic DNA. The CaM gene is 12 kilobases long and contains 8 exons interrupted by introns of highly variable size. The first intron (A) is only 19 base pairs (bp) long and divides the 5' untranslated region. Intron B separates the ATG from the first nucleotide of the triplet which encodes the NH2-terminal amino acid of CaM (Ala) whereas intron C separates the triplets encoding amino acids 10-11. Introns D, F, and G interrupt the Ca2+ binding subdomains II, III, and IV of CaM whereas intron E is localized in the linker region between the highly homologous NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of the protein. Primer extension studies using chicken brain poly(A+) mRNA and a fragment from the 5' untranslated region of a CaM cDNA identified the presumptive transcription initiation site (cap site) of the mRNA to be 103 bp 5' from the initiation condon ATG. A consensus sequence TATTTAA was localized 29 bp 5' from this cap site while a CCAAT sequence was located further 5' at position -58 bp. The structure of the CaM gene is strikingly similar to genes that encode other Ca2+ binding proteins from sea urchin, chicken, rat, and quail. These data suggest a conservation of genome organization related to the calcium binding and regulatory domains of Ca2+ binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2016655706,"The functional activity of the promoter unit contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) was examined by monitoring transient expression of a heterologous gene placed under its control. Various cell lines were transfected with recombinant plasmids carrying the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene coupled to the BLV LTR (pBL-cat). Transient expression of CAT activity directed by the BLV LTR was observed only in the established BLV-producer cell lines derived from fetal lamb kidney (FLK) cells and bat lung cells. The amount of CAT activity transiently expressed in FLK-BLV cells was decreased approximately tenfold by deletion of LTR sequences located within a region 100 to 170 nucleotides upstream of the RNA start site. Surprisingly, removal of the region 50 base pairs downstream of the RNA initiation site to the 3'-end of the LTR reduced the expression of CAT activity by 87 percent. The BLV LTR thus appears to be an unusual promoter unit, functioning in a cell type-specific manner and possessing sequences on both the 5' and 3' sides of the RNA start site that influence gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1574363706,"Abstract 22Na+ uptake into confluent monolayers of cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells was studied in the presence of ouabain (10(-4)M) to inhibit active sodium extrusion. In bicarbonate saline, uptake was reduced to a similar degree either by amiloride (10(-3)M) or by 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) (10(-3)M). A further reduction was obtained with SITS-pretreated cells in the presence of amiloride. SITS-sensitive uptake was further characterized in saline containing both ouabain (10(-4)M) and amiloride (10(-3)M). It was absolutely dependent on bicarbonate, which could not be substituted by other plasma membrane permeable buffers (50 mM acetate or 25 mM glycodiazine). It was a saturable function of both bicarbonate and sodium concentration. Half-maximal fluxes occurred between 3 and 7 mM HCO3 (at 151 mM Na) and between 35 and 60 mM Na (at 28 mM HCO3). Uptake into sodium-depleted cells was reduced as opposed to sodium-rich cells, and SITS-sensitive 22Na+ efflux out of 22Na+-loaded cells into sodium-free medium was less than efflux into sodium saline, indicating trans-stimulation by sodium. The amiloride-sensitive pathway was studied in the absence of bicarbonate to inhibit uptake via the SITS-sensitive pathway. 22Na+ uptake into sodium-depleted cells increased steeply with extracellular pH in the range between pH 6 and 8 and could be largely blocked by 10(-3), but not by 10(-5) M amiloride. It is concluded that bovine corneal endothelial cells possess at least two distinct pathways for sodium uptake, amiloride sensitive 22Na+ fluxes being mediated by a Na+/H+ antiport, while the SITS-sensitive process is probably identical to a bicarbonate-sodium cotransport system postulated earlier from electrophysiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2093817390,"We have examined the transcriptional activity of the Formosa sgs3 glue gene reinserted in the Drosophila genome in transposons containing various arrangements of its natural flanking sequences. The shortest transposons, retaining 127 bp of 5′ sequence show no (or very rare) expression. Constructs with up to 1.4 kb of 5′ sequence show tissue- and stage-specific accumulation of transcripts, but at severely reduced levels when compared with the resident sgs3 glue gene. To obtain wild-type levels of transcripts, sequences contained in the next 1.3 kb are necessary. At least one regulatory element defined by these experiments is bidirectional. Our results show that marked P-element transformation vectors can be used to analyze regulatory elements of linked genes."
https://openalex.org/W2059546432,Double labeling and color microradioautography were used in a new method of hybridization in situ to identify different genes in individual cells. The method is based on the unequal penetration of 3H and 35S into two layers of nuclear track emulsion separated by a thin barrier film. Hybridization of a 35S-labeled probe specific for one kind of gene results in silver grains over cells in both layers of emulsion; a 3H-labeled probe for a second gene provides grains only in the first layer of emulsion. Silver grains are converted to magenta-colored grains in the first layer and to cyan-colored grains in the second to facilitate enumeration of grains in each layer. This technique should be widely applicable in analyses of differential gene expression in single cells or in discrete populations of cells.
https://openalex.org/W2108436623,"Various azido-ubiquinone derivatives were synthesized and characterized. 3-Azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-(3,7-dimethyloctyl)-1,4-benzoquinone was found to be suitable for the study of specific interaction between ubiquinone (Q) and protein. It was synthesized with high specific radioactivity and used to identify the Q-binding proteins in purified ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. This azido-Q derivative showed partial efficiency in restoring activity to the Q- and phospholipids-depleted ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase in the absence of light. Azido-Q derivative treated samples, however, became completely inactivated upon photolysis, and the inactivation was not reversed by addition of Q derivatives. The redox state of the azido-Q derivative has little effect on the Q-binding affinity. Two protein subunits with Mr = 37,000 and 17,000 were found to be heavily labeled when depleted ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase was treated with [3H] azido-Q derivative followed by photolysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of radioactive labeling of the Mr = 17,000 protein was proportional to the degree of inactivation and affected by the presence of phospholipids. The radioactive labeling of the Mr = 37,000 protein subunit, however, showed no correlation with degree of inactivation and was not affected by phospholipids. Since the radiolabeling at the Mr = 17,000 protein subunit was affected by phospholipids and correlated with the enzymatic activity, this subunit is probably the Q-binding protein in this enzyme complex (QPc). The inhibition of enzymatic activity by n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide was easily reversed by addition of the azido-Q derivative. The distribution of radioactivity among the subunits of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase was not affected by the presence of antimycin A, 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole or n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, suggesting that the binding site(s) of these inhibitors are not the Q-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2039503019,"In vitro recombination by Tn3 resolvase of plasmids containing two directly repeated recombination (res) sites generates two singly interlinked catenated rings. This simple product catenane structure was maintained over a wide range of substrate supercoil densities and in a reaction mixture in which phage λ. Int-mediated recombination generated its characteristic multiply interlinked forms. Using substrates containing four res sites, we found that resolvase recombined neighboring res sites with high preference. This position effect implies that resolvase searches systematically along the DNA for a partner site. Intervening res sites in the opposite orientation did not prevent translocation. We analyzed the geometric arrangement of the interlocked rings after multiple recombination events in a four-site substrate and the pattern of segregation of nonspecific reporter rings catenated to the standard substrate. The results of these novel topological tests imply that the translocating enzyme may not make continuous contact with the DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1484619521,"The predominant leader region of the late 16 S mRNAs of simian virus 40 encodes a histone-like, 61-amino acid, DNA-binding protein called the agnoprotein or LP1. To test the hypothesis that this protein facilitates assembly of viral minichromosomes into virions, we have studied the synthesis of virions in cells infected with mutants deleted in this region of the SV40 genome. We found that 220 S mature virions, indistinguishable from those of wild type, were produced in cells infected with these mutants. As in wild-type-infected cells, no assembly intermediates other than 75 S chromatin were observed. However, data obtained from both steady-state and pulse-chase labeling experiments indicated that cells infected with agnogene deletion mutants produced virions more slowly than cells infected with wild-type virus. Taken together with data showing that similar levels of virion proteins were present in the wild-type- and mutant-infected cells, these findings strongly suggest that LP1 plays a role in expediting virion assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1539661614,"Paraquat induced the SOS response in Escherichia coli. This was measured in terms of acquired resistance towards UV lethality in a wild-type strain and in terms of appearance of beta-galactosidase activity in a din::Mu d(Ap lac) fusion strain. However measured, the induction of the SOS response by paraquat was entirely dioxygen-dependent; whereas induction of the SOS response by mitomycin C was independent of the presence of dioxygen. As expected, recA(Def) and lexA(Ind-) isogenic strains did not show the SOS response. It appears likely that O-2, whose intracellular production is increased by paraquat, leads to DNA damage which in turn induces the SOS response."
https://openalex.org/W1548196050,"We have characterized the effect of a stable small molecule isolated from bovine hypothalamus (Haupert, G. T., and Sancho, J. M. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 76, 4658-4660) on mammalian (Na,K)ATPase. This hypothalamus-derived inhibitory factor, HIF, has been shown to inhibit ATPase activity of purified dog kidney enzyme reversibly with high affinity (Haupert, G. T., Carilli, C. T., and Cantley, L. C. (1984) Am. J. Physiol. 247, F919-F924). In this report it is shown that HIF inhibits the ouabain sensitive component of 86Rb+ uptake into human red blood cells. HIF also inhibited (Na,K)ATPase activity of unsealed red cell membranes but not that of sealed inside-out vesicles, indicating that HIF is impermeant to red cell membranes and inhibits the (Na,K)ATPase from the extracellular side. In unsealed human red cell membranes, concentrations of HIF which caused 70% inhibition of the (Na,K)ATPase did not inhibit ATP hydrolysis by plasma membrane (Ca2+)ATPase or (Mg2+)ATPase. However, at a similar concentration, HIF was shown to inhibit rabbit muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+)ATPase. HIF also inhibited p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity of unmodified or fluorescein-5'-iso-thiocyanate labeled dog kidney (Na,K)ATPase. As judged by fluorescein fluorescence of the modified enzyme, HIF stabilized the low fluorescent E2 conformation of the enzyme similar to that stabilized by ouabain. However, unlike ouabain, HIF blocked covalent phosphorylation of dog kidney (Na,K)ATPase by inorganic phosphate. These studies show that HIF is an inhibitor of (Na,K)ATPase which acts from the extracellular side of the membrane by a mechanism similar to but not identical to that of cardiac glycosides."
https://openalex.org/W1555561146,"We report here the synthesis and properties of a hybrid toxin prepared by covalently coupling diphtheria toxin to transferrin. The purified material contained two major hybrid protein species and was highly cytotoxic to mouse LMTK- cells in culture, reducing protein synthesis by 50% in 24 h at a concentration of 1 ng/ml. Cytotoxic activity was completely abolished in the presence of exogenous transferrin or anti-transferrin or anti-diphtheria toxin, thus demonstrating that the hybrid toxin was intoxicating cells via their transferrin receptors and that both the diphtheria toxin and transferrin components of the conjugate were necessary for activity. NH4Cl, a drug that elevates the pH within acidic intracellular vesicles, also blocked cytotoxic activity, suggesting that a low intravesicular pH was required for activity. The inhibitory effect of NH4Cl could be abolished by exposing toxin-treated cells to acidic culture medium, further implicating an acid-dependent step in the mechanism of the hybrid toxin action. Studies on the kinetics of intoxication also implied that endocytosis and exposure to a low pH within vesicles were necessary for cytotoxicity. Altogether, the results suggest that the transferrin-diphtheria toxin conjugate binds to transferrin receptors and is internalized into acidic endocytic vesicles. The enzymatic moiety of diphtheria toxin then apparently enters the cytosol in response to the low pH and subsequently arrests protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001589156,"Refractory periods were estimated for fibers of the hypothalamic substrate of brain stimulation reward. Two nonoverlapping populations were evident: a homogeneous fast population and a more heterogeneous slow population. Cholinergic blockade eliminated the contribution of the fast but not the slow fibers, while dopaminergic blockade reduced responding without significantly influencing either directly activated fiber population. These data indicate that the hypothalamic reward substrate is more complex than has been widely appreciated; it contains two or more parallel subsystems, and one of these subsystems has a cholinergic link."
https://openalex.org/W1598438403,"We have synthesized a series of 2-5A (ppp5'-A2'p5'A2'p5'A) analogs in which each adenosine residue has been sequentially replaced by inosine: viz., ppp5'I2'p5'A2'p5'A, ppp5'A2'p5'I2'p5'A, and ppp5'A2'p5'A2'p5'I. These transformations enabled us to delineate the role of each of the three purine N-6 amino groups of 2-5A in determining oligonucleotide binding to and activation of the 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease, RNase L. With the RNase L activity of both mouse L cells and human Daudi lymphoblastoid cells, we found that the N-6 amino group of the first adenosine nucleotide residue (from the 5'-terminus) is of crucial importance in determining binding to the endonuclease; however, removal of the N-6 amino moieties of the second or third adenosine nucleotide residues resulted in only a minimal decrease in binding to the endonuclease. On the other hand, conversion of the third adenosine residue to inosine effected a dramatic (10,000-fold compared to 2-5A) loss in ability to activate the nuclease; however, execution of the same N-6 amino group conversion at either the first or second adenosine residue did not cause a major change in nuclease activation ability when the accompanying decreased endonuclease binding was considered. These results clearly demonstrate that the N-6 amino group of the first adenosine residue of 2-5A is critical in RNase L binding whereas the N-6 amino function of the third adenosine residue of 2-5A is crucial for the activation of RNase L."
https://openalex.org/W1607697952,"Human skin collagenase activity was examined against type III collagens, in both soluble and fibrillar form, from different animal species. In either form, human, dog, and cat type III were degraded 10- to 30-fold faster than was that from guinea pig and nearly 100-fold more readily than chick type III. These differences in susceptibility were mirrored by essentially identical differences in the rate of trypsin cleavage of the same substrates. Human, dog, and cat type III were cleaved most rapidly by trypsin, guinea pig III more slowly, and chick III was completely resistant to the serine protease. Arrhenius plots, relating enzyme activity to temperature, revealed differences in the various type III substrates consistent with their collagenase and trypsin susceptibilities. Human, dog, and cat type III collagens yielded nonlinear plots, with accompanying activation energies which decreased at temperatures above 26 degrees C; guinea pig type III displayed a plot which deviated only slightly from linearity while the plot for chick type III was completely linear. These data strongly suggest that type III collagens display substantial variability in the stability of the helix at or near the collagenase cleavage site. The susceptibility of these type III substrates as reconstituted fibrils was also examined. The relative rates of degradation of these substrates by collagenase, and by trypsin, were the same as those observed in solution. The absolute rates of degradation of collagen in fibrillar form, however, were massively lower than predicted by extrapolation from solution values. This reduction in rate is even greater for type III than for type I collagens. Thus, whereas in solution type III substrates are cleaved much faster than type I collagens, in fibrillar form these differences are less than 2-fold. These data, together with values for activation energies and deuterium isotope effects on type III fibrillar substrates, reinforce the concept that helical integrity near the collagenase cleavage site is a major specifier of the rate of collagenase activity. Furthermore, the data suggest that the exclusion of water accompanying the tight packing of monomers into fibrils presents a major energy barrier to collagenase activity, which is particularly large for type III collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1521029289,"Although the sodium pump normally exchanges three sodium for two potassium ions, experiments with inside-out red cell membrane vesicles show that the stoichiometry is reduced when the cytoplasmic sodium concentration is decreased to less than 1 mM. The present study was designed to gain insight into the question whether other monovalent cations, particularly protons, can act as sodium congeners in effecting pump-mediated potassium transport (ATP-dependent rubidium efflux from inside-out vesicles). The results show that at low cytoplasmic sodium concentration, an increase in proton concentration effects a further reduction in sodium:rubidium stoichiometry, to a value less than the minimal expected (1Na+:3Rb+). Furthermore, when vesicles containing 86RbCl are incubated in nominally sodium-free medium. ATP-dependent net rubidium efflux (normal influx) occurs when the pH is reduced from approximately 7.0 to 6.2 or less. This efflux is inhibited by strophanthidin and vanadate. These experiments support the notion that the sodium pump can operate as an ATP-dependent proton-activated rubidium (potassium) pump without obligatory countertransport of sodium ions."
https://openalex.org/W1496838995,"One major very highly repeated (VHR) DNA (approximately 7 X 10(6) copies/genome; repeat unit = 156 base pairs (bp)), a family of three minor VHR DNAs (approximately 2.8 X 10(6) copies/genome; repeat units = 71-74 bp), and a number of trace components account for almost 30% of the genome of a hermit crab. The repeat units of the three minor variants are defined by identical 14-bp G + C-rich inverted repeats that might form cruciforms. Two copies of the repeat unit (CCTA) of one of two patent satellites of this crab (Skinner, D. M., and Beattie, W. G. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 3922-3929; Skinner, D. M., Beattie, W. G., Blattner, F. R., Stark, B. P., and Dahlberg, J. E. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 3930-3937) occur at the center of one in seven of the G + C-rich inverted repeats; copies of the other patent satellite (Chambers, C. A., Schell, M. P., and Skinner, D. M. (1978) Cell 13, 97-110) are found in main component DNA. The sequences of both the major and minor VHR DNAs are characterized by short tracts of An and/or Tn (n = 4-7) residues whose presence would permit the formation of perfectly matched stems separated by loops of 8-16 bp. The An and/or Tn tracts are interspersed with segments of G + C-rich DNA and are arranged differently in the major and minor VHR DNAs. Although the repeat units of the major and the three minor VHR DNAs are arranged in tandem, the composition and sequence of their bases are such that they do not form distinct bands in CsCl gradients; they are cryptic satellites."
https://openalex.org/W1576378802,"The binuclear iron cluster of uteroferrin in its reduced and enzymatically active pink form is sensitive to a variety or perturbants. Orthophosphate, in the presence or absence of oxygen, rapidly shifts the absorption maximum of pink uteroferrin from 510 to 545 nm, concurrently abolishing the protein's g'av = 1.74 EPR signal. Apparently, therefore, dioxygen is not required for phosphate-induced oxidation of the pink protein's ferrous iron. Pyrophosphate and arsenate produce changes which differ only in degree from those induced by phosphate, suggesting that all of these structurally similar competitive inhibitors bind to a common site. Molybdate, an inhibitor even more potent than phosphate, quantitatively converts the rhombic EPR signal of pink uteroferrin into an axial signal that remains invariant to subsequent additions of phosphate. Thus, there can be inhibition without oxidation, as further evidenced by the complex EPR spectrum of undiminished intensity produced by sulfate. Fluoride, too, induces an axial component in the EPR signal of pink uteroferrin, but at high concentration abolishes the signal entirely. Vanadate also drives the protein to its oxidized, EPR-silent state, serving as an electron acceptor itself to yield the characteristic g' = 2 signal of the vanadyl (VO2+) cation. Remarkably, however, the protein remains pink, demonstrating a dissociation between color and oxidation state. Guanidinium, in contrast, causes a sizeable red shift in the pink protein's absorption maximum without loss of EPR signal intensity, showing dissociation of color and oxidation state in a complementary way."
https://openalex.org/W1497402588,"Proapolipoprotein (apo-) A-II and several isoforms of apo-A-II including sialylated isoforms were identified in human plasma and thoracic duct lymph. Proapo-A-II secreted by HepG2 cells was identified by a combination of immunoblots and [14C]arginine incorporation. Proapo-A-II which contains 2 arginine residues could be readily differentiated from mature apo-A-II which contains no arginine. The pI of proapo-A-II is 6.79, whereas the pI of the major apo-A-II isoform in plasma and lymph is 4.90. Minor apo-A-II isoforms have pI values of 5.17, 4.68, 4.42, and 4.20, respectively. Sialoisoforms of apo-A-II were identified, which had a higher apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis than the major isoform and disappeared following neuraminidase treatment. The relative quantity of proapo-A-II was relatively constant in lymph very low density lipoproteins, lymph high density lipoproteins, and plasma high density lipoproteins, whereas the sialoforms and the other minor isoforms of apo-A-II were greater in lymph very low density lipoproteins and the lowest in plasma high density lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1568385819,"The Soret absorption band of the ferrous carbon monoxide (CO) complex of cytochrome c peroxidase exhibited a blue shift from 423.7 to 420 nm upon an increase in pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The spectral change was reversible with an isosbestic point at 422 nm. The pH dependence of this spectral change gave a sigmoidal curve fitted well to a theoretical curve of a cooperative release of two protons with a pK value of 7.5, indicating the existence of the acidic and alkaline forms of the ferrous CO enzyme. Upon irradiation of light flash (100 J of power and 30-microseconds), the heme-bound CO was readily dissociated in both acidic and alkaline forms with a quantum yield of approximately unity. On the other hand, the rate of recombination of the dissociated CO with the heme iron was significantly different between these two forms; the recombination rate constants were 1.1 X 10(3) and 3.0 X 10(4) M-1 S-1 at 25 degrees C for the acidic and alkaline forms, respectively. At intermediate pH values, kinetics of recombination were biphasic, consisting of the slow and fast processes with the appropriate rate constants mentioned above. When the fraction of the fast process was plotted against pH, the pH profile coincided with the spectrophotometric pH titration curve described above. Thus, it was concluded that the acidic and alkaline forms of the enzyme were responsible for the slow and fast processes, respectively. In infrared spectroscopy, the acidic form showed a narrow CO stretching band at 1922 cm-1 with a half-band width of 12.5 cm-1, while the alkaline form exhibited a broad CO-stretching band at 1948 cm-1 with a half-band width of 33 cm-1. Significance of these results are discussed in relation to the structure of the heme vicinity on the CO complex of cytochrome c peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1507900720,"We have investigated the expression of a cloned mouse gene which confers ouabain resistance to African green monkey kidney (CV1) cells. CV1 cells carrying the transfected ouabain resistance (ouaR) gene express an ouabain-inducible K+-transport system. This K+-transport system is not a normal (Na,K)-ATPase since plasma membranes prepared from the transfected cells have significantly reduced Na+-stimulated ATPase activity. RNA sequences homologous to the transfected gene are observed in abundance only following exposure of transfectants to ouabain. The small size of the message induced (1.2 kilobases) also argues that the gene does not code for the alpha-subunit of the (Na,K)-ATPase. Ouabain-treated transfected cells maintain an internal [K+] of 113 mM; a level close to the 139 mM of control cells. However, ouabain-treated transfectants exhibit an internal [Na+] of 61 mM, which is 3-6 times the level in untreated cells (11-21 mM). These results suggest: ouabain resistance can be conferred by a gene which codes for an ouabain-inducible K+-transport system; induction of this transport system by ouabain is due to increased levels of mRNA coded for by the ouabain resistance gene; and the ouabain resistance gene does not encode for the alpha-subunit of the (Na,K)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1606440838,"Suspensions of rat adrenocortical cells produce corticosterone as the major glucocorticoid. Cholesterol side-chain cleavage, the initial and rate-limiting step in the glucocorticoid biosynthetic pathway, is catalyzed by P-450scc. We have examined the effect of a variety of P-450scc inhibitors on corticosterone production by isolated rat adrenocortical cells. These inhibitors include reversible, noncovalently interacting inhibitors as well as mechanism-based inhibitors which irreversibly inactivate P-450scc in vitro. (20S)-22-nor-22-thiacholesterol and (22R)-22-aminocholesterol cause 50% inhibition of corticosterone production at 4 microM and 30 nM, respectively. Inhibition by these compounds was essentially not time-dependent. (20R)-20-(1-hexynyl)-pregn-5-en-3 beta, 20-diol and (20R)-20-(1,5-hexdiynyl)-pregn-5-en-3 beta, 20-diol at 10 microM inhibited corticosterone production in a time-dependent manner, resulting in 30% inhibition of corticosterone production during a 100-min incubation. (20S)-20-(2-trimethylsilyl ethyl)-pregn-5-en-3 beta, 20-diol inhibited in a strongly time-dependent manner. At 10 microM this compound irreversibly inhibited more than 90% of the side-chain cleavage capacity of the cell during a 40-min incubation. Cells treated with this steroid did not regain their capacity for side-chain cleavage after removal of free steroid. None of the inhibitors described above inhibited production of corticosterone by cells supplied with pregnenolone, the product of the P-450scc reaction. We suggest that the only significant effect of these compounds under these conditions is inhibition of the side-chain cleavage enzyme."
