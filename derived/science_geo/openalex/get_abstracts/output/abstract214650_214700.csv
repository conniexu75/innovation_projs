https://openalex.org/W2435401553,"SUMMARY The structure of the galactohinase in Escherichia coli has been analyzed with the aim of defining the size of its structural gene. To that end the molecular weight, amino acid composition, number of tryptic peptides, and amino-terminal residues of this protein were determined. The results indicate that this galactokinase consists of one polypeptide chain containing 368 residues, and hence that its structural gene contains about 1100 base pairs."

The interaction of streptokinase and human plasminogen has been studied by ultracentrifugation at pH 7.5 in the presence of E-aminocaproic acid, which is a solubilizing agent for plasmino- gen at neutral pH values and an inhibitor of its conversion to plasmin. 2. Under such conditions, an equimolar mixture of highly purified streptokinase and plasminogen produced a single 5.2 S boundary. An excess of either reactant could be quantitatively identified as a boundary separate from this reaction product. 3. The molecular weight of the 5.2 S complex was determined by equilibrium centrifugation to be about 130,000, which is very close to the sum of the molecular weights of streptokinase (47,000) and plasminogen (84,000), but it is not possible to state whether a simple additive reaction took place. 4. In control experiments, no changes in sedimentation prop- erties or homogeneity of streptokinase, plasminogen, albumin, or y-globulin were observed in the presence of c-aminocaproic acid. Also, combination did not take place between streptokinase or plasminogen and albumin or y-globulin. 5. When lysine was substituted for c-aminocaproic acid, a com- plex schlieren pattern was obtained with an equimolar mixture of streptokinase and plasminogen, 60 y0 of the total protein appear- ing as an 8 to 10 S component and 40% as polydisperse, lower molecular weight material. Dialysis of this system to substitute e-aminocaproic acid for lysine or addition of t-aminocaproic acid without removal of lysine restored the system to the pattern ob- tained with e-aminocaproic acid alone. 6. The implications of all the above results in the process of plasminogen activation by streptokinase are discussed. 7. Some of the physical properties of streptokinase are re- ported.

https://openalex.org/W2109759497,"Cobalt is known to be essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legumes (l-5), but a requirement of the element for growth of leguminous plants supplied with adequate fixed nitrogen has not been shown. Ahmed and Evans (3) provided evidence that cobalt was required for the bacteria within the nodules of inoculated legumes but was not required for the leguminous plants per se. Lowe, Evans, and Ahmed (6) and Lowe and Evans (7) subsequently showed that cobalt is necessary for normal growth of five species of Rhixobium. More recently, Kliewer and Evans (8-10) analyzed nodules of a variety of symbionts and cells from several species of Rhizobium and observed the presence of cobamide coenzymes in each of the organisms. In addition, they (9) isolated and identified the dimethylbenaimidazolylcobamide coenzyme in extracts of cells isolated from soybean nodules and in cells of a pure culture of Rhizobium meliloti and presented data (10) showing that cobalt deficiency not only limited the growth of Rhizobium japonicum and R. meliloti but also limited the synthesis of cobamide coenzymes in these organisms. The Bn coenzyme has been shown to be involved in propionate metabolism in animals (11-13) and in Propionibacterium sherma&i (14, 15). In addition, Arnstein and White (16) have shown that Bn deficiency in Ochromonas malhamensis resulted in a reduced capacity of the organism to oxidize propionate. Ayers (17) has described similar effects of Blz deficiency in a Flavobacterium species. On the basis of these reports, experiments were conducted to determine whether Rhizobium would metabolize propionate and the possible effect of cobalt deficiency on propionate utilization in these bacteria. In a preliminary communication (18), evidence was presented showing that the rate of oxidation of propionate by cell suspensions of R. meliloti was strikingly affected by the concentration of cobalt in the culture medium. In contrast, the oxidation of glutamate was not affected by cobalt deficiency. In this paper, evidence is presented showing that enzymes necessary for the catalysis of the conversion of propionate to succinyl coenzyme A by a pathway involving methylmalonyl coenzyme A are widely distributed in Rhizobium and that cobalt deficiency in R. meliloti results in insufficient Blz coenzyme for the function of methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase in cell-free extracts."

https://openalex.org/W2154456118,"bovine plasminogen, an ability possessed by neither of the two components alone, has been the basis of the hypothesis that solutions of human plasminogen contain a “proactivator” which, when combined with streptokinase, is capable of activating bovine plasminogen. It was tacitly assumed that the same “activator” was also responsible for the catalytic conversion of human plasminogen when the latter was mixed with streptokinase. The nature of proactivator and its presumed streptokinase complex was for some time a controversial subject in the field, some workers maintaining that proactivator was a separate molecular species distinct from plasminogen (l-3) and others that it was identical with plasminogen or with plasmin (4, 5). In experiments with the use of column chromatography for the fractionation of human plasminogen, proactivator activity invariably was eluted together with plasminogen activity (6, 7). It is important to note that in all these experiments activator activity was tested on bovine plasminogen. In a recent paper, Kline and Fishman (8) convincingly demonstrated that the catalyst responsible for the activation of bovine plasminogen was a human plasmin-streptokinase complex, and thus defined human plasmin as the proactivator for this function. Our experiments have independently led us to the same conclusion (9). In the course of our studies, however, it became evident that the activator responsible for the activation of human plasminogen by streptokinase cannot be identical with the complex operative in the conversion of bovine plasminogen. The agent (Activator I) which catalyzes the conversion of human plasminogen appears to be a complex between streptokinase and Proactivator I, a substance present in variable amounts in solutions of human plasminogen. The present paper analyzes the rates of development of plasmin and of Activator II activity and discusses the nature of Activator I. A method for the quantitative estimation of Proactivator I is presented."

A deficiency in the design of that experiment was that the method used to measure food preference behaviour was confounded with a measure of the activity of flies. We have repeated this experiment with a new method of testing."
