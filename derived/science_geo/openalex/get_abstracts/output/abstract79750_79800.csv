https://openalex.org/W2082677148,"Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is secreted by many human tumors and can induce the reversible transformation of nontransformed cell lines. Using long synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides as hybridization probes we isolated an exon coding for a portion of TGF-alpha from a human genomic DNA library. Utilizing this exon as a probe, a cell line derived from a human renal cell carcinoma was identified as a source of TGF-alpha mRNA. A cloned TGF-alpha cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library prepared using RNA from this cell line, and was found to encode a precursor polypeptide of 160 amino acids. The 50 amino acid mature TGF-alpha produced by expression of the appropriate coding sequence in E. coli binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor and induces the anchorage independence of normal mammalian cells in culture."

https://openalex.org/W2021054898,"To study the mechanisms of RNA splicing we have analyzed the products generated by in vitro processing of a truncated 32P-labeled human beta-globin RNA precursor that contains the first two exons and the first intervening sequence (IVS1). Six major RNA products were detected and characterized. The first detectable RNA processing event is cleavage at the 5' GT of IVS1. Subsequently, accurately spliced RNA and the excised, intact IVS1 are simultaneously observed. The IVS1-containing RNA processing products have several unusual properties, which include: anomalous electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gels; a block to reverse transcription near the 3' end of IVS1; the presence of a nuclease-resistant component within IVS1. The block to reverse transcription and the nuclease-resistant component map to the same site near the 3' end of IVS1. The nuclease-resistant component appears to be a modified adenosine residue that contains an RNA branch. Based upon these and other structural studies we propose that the 5' end of IVS1 is joined by a 2'-5' phosphodiester linkage to the A residue in the RNAase T1 oligonucleotide ACTCTCTCTG located 28-37 nucleotides upstream from the IVS1 3' end. The IVS1 is therefore in the form of a lariat. These results imply that sequences within IVS1 actively participate in splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2032105273,"We have made a P-element derivative called Pc[ry], which carries the selectable marker gene rosy, but which acts like a nondefective, intact P element. It transposes autonomously into the germline chromosomes of an M-strain Drosophila embryo and it mobilizes in trans the defective P elements of the singed-weak allele. Frameshift mutations introduced into any of the four major open reading frames of the P sequence were each sufficient to eliminate the transposase activity, but none affected signals required in cis for transposition of the element. Complementation tests between pairs of mutant elements suggest that a single polypeptide comprises the transposase. We have examined transcripts of P elements both from natural P strains and from lines containing only nondefective Pc[ry] elements, and have identified two RNA species that appear to be specific for autonomous elements."

https://openalex.org/W2159947557,"The rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG CoA reductase, is controlled by negative feedback regulation of transcription. We have isolated the reductase gene from a bacteriophage lambda genomic library prepared from hamster UT-1 cells. The 25 kilobase gene is split into 20 exons. The 5' untranslated and promoter regions differ from those of previously characterized genes. The 5' untranslated region encompasses as many as 670 nucleotides; contains up to eight AUG codons upstream of the codon used to initiate translation; and has multiple transcription initiation sites as determined by S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis. The promoter region lacks a characteristic TATA box and CCAAT box; is rich in G + C residues (65%); and contains repeat sequences homologous to the 21 base pair repeats of the SV40 promoter. These unusual features may be relevant to the mechanism of expression of ""housekeeping"" genes, particularly those that are subject to negative feedback regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2002854177,"A derivative of mouse mammary tumor virus (MTV) DNA, LTL, was constructed in vitro and introduced into the genome of mouse L cells. Transcription of LTL was stimulated by dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone. Two features of LTL chromatin structure are altered upon hormone treatment. First, “moderate” DNAase I sensitivity of the entire LTL element increases following addition of dexamethasone; this alteration persists after hormone withdrawal, when LTL transcription is shut off. Second, a discrete DNAase I-hypersensitive region is induced with a time course that closely parallels the rate of increasing transcription from the MTV promoter; this structure disappears upon hormone removal. The induced hypersensitive region coincides with a segment of the MTV long terminal repeat sequence that specifically binds purified glucocorticoid receptor in vitro and functions as a hormone-dependent enhancer element in vivo. We suggest that specific glucocorticoid receptor-DNA interactions may alter the configuration of DNA or chromatin in the vicinity of the binding sites, thereby creating an active transcriptional enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W2063248559,"The major chicken vitellogenin (VTG II) gene is marked at the chromatin level in hormone-responsive cells by a set of nuclease-hypersensitive sites that exist prior to hormone-mediated expression. When the gene is transcriptionally activated in the liver by treatment with 17 β-estradiol, three additional hypersensitive sites are induced, which map near the 5′ end of the gene. Two of these sites are stable and, moreover, appear to be propagated to daughter cells after hormone is withdrawn. In contrast, the third site (located 0.7 kb upstream from the gene) is observed only during periods of hormone treatment, perhaps due to a transient interaction with hormone receptor complex at this site. Whereas none of these nuclease-hypersensitive sites is observed in erythrocytes, brain, or fibroblasts, a subset is present in differentiated oviduct cells that have estrogen receptors, but do not express VTG II."
https://openalex.org/W2000983477,"Leukotriene B4, at the same intracutaneous doses as bradykinin, reduced the nociceptive threshold in the rat paw. The mechanism of leukotriene B4-induced hyperalgesia was distinguished from that of the hyperalgesia elicited by prostaglandin E2 and bradykinin by its dependence on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and independence of the cyclooxygenation of arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2040072356,"We have isolated three types of pBR322-AAV recombinant plasmids that contain deletions within the 145 bp AAV terminal repeats. When the plasmids were transfected into human cells, mutants that contained deletions within the left (type I) or right (type II) terminal repeat were viable. Of four mutants examined that contained deletions in both termini (type III), only one was viable. All of the viable mutants produced AAV virions that contained wild-type AAV DNA. Furthermore, the viable type III deletion could be converted to a nonviable mutant by deleting all copies of an 11 bp sequence from its termini. We conclude that there is an efficient mechanism for correcting deletions within the AAV termini. A model that could account for these observations is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2018338006,"L12 are Ab-MuLV-transformed cells that express the abl p120 oncogene product but lack the cellularly encoded p53. The functional p53 gene in these cells has been inactivated by the insertion of Moloney virus-like sequences into the first p53 intron. Transfection of L12 cells with a functional p53 gene, contained in a 16 kb Eco RI genomic cloned fragment gave rise to L12-derived cell lines with novel p53 sequences of various sizes and copy number. A high percentage of L12-derived clones efficiently transcribed p53 mRNA and synthesized the p53 protein. Whereas injection of L12 parental cells into syngeneic mice caused the development of local tumors that later regressed, L12-derived clones that expressed p53 caused lethal tumors in syngeneic mice, thus behaving similarly to other Ab-MuLV-transformed p53-producer cell lines. These results suggest that the expression of p53 is essential for tumor cells to exhibit a fully transformed phenotype, manifested in lethal tumors in syngeneic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2103852045,"We have analyzed two mutations of the white-eye gene, which arose in flies subject to I-R hybrid dysgenesis. These mutations are associated with insertions of apparently identical 5.4 kb sequences, which we have cloned. We believe that these insertions are copies of the I factor controlling I-R hybrid dysgenesis. The I factor is not a member of the copia-like or fold-back classes of transposable elements and has no sequence homology with the P factor that controls P-M dysgenesis. All strains of D. melanogaster contain I-factor sequences. Those present in reactive strains must represent inactive I elements. I elements have a remarkably similar sequence organization in all reactive strains and are located in peri-centromeric regions. Inducer strains appear to contain both I elements, located in peri-centromeric regions, and 10-15 copies of the complete I factor at sites on the chromosome arms."
https://openalex.org/W2134305122,We introduced into MEL cells rabbit β-globin gene deletion mutants and two sets of hybrid genes constructed from the inducible human β-globin gene and noninducible human γ-globin gene or the murine H-2Kbm1 class I MHC gene. S1 nuclease analysis of gene transcripts before and after MEL differentiation showed that induction of the rabbit β-globin gene did not require more than 58 bp of DNA 5′ to the transcription initiation site. Hybrid genes were constructed with human β-globin DNA sequences from either 5′ or 3′ of the translation initiation site linked to the complementary parts of the γ or H2Kbm1 genes. Both types of constructs were inducible during MEL differentiation. The relative rates of transcription of the 5′γ-3′β and 5′H2-3′ β hybrid genes show that induction of the hybrid gene transcripts results at least in part from transcriptional activation of the genes. We suggest that DNA sequences that regulate β-globin gene transcription during MEL differentiation are located both 5′ and 3′ to the translation initiation site.
https://openalex.org/W2071008278,"We have used Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells grown on nitrocellulose filters to study the polarity of virus infection and maturation. The cells form epithelia-like monolayers, which display high (>1000 Ω cm2) electrical resistance and a cuboidal morphology. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was found to infect the monolayer at least 100 times more efficiently when applied through the filter to the basolateral surface than when applied to the apical surface. The avian influenza, fowl plague virus (FPV), infected the monolayer through either the apical or basolateral surface. The polarity of virus budding was evaluated by harvesting virus from the two sides of the monolayer. More than 99% of released influenza hemagglutinin titre was found on the apical side of the filter, while more than 98% of budded VSV was found on the basal side. This polarity of budding was retained through 10 hr of viral infection, as was the polarity of surface expression of viral envelope proteins revealed by immunofluorescence. The strong preference of VSV for basolateral maturation is paralleled by an equally strong preference for infection through the basolateral membrane of this polar epithelial cell."
https://openalex.org/W2081945314,"A crude soluble enzyme system capable of authentic replication of a variety of oriC plasmids has been replaced by purified proteins constituting three functional classes: initiation proteins (RNA polymerase, dnaA protein, gyrase) that recognize the oriC sequence and presumably prime the leading strand of the replication fork; replication proteins (DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, single-strand binding protein, primosomal proteins) that sustain progress of the replication fork; and specificity proteins (topoisomerase I, RNAase H, protein HU) that suppress initiation of replication at sequences other than oriC, coated with dnaA protein. Protein HU and unidentified factors in crude enzyme fractions stimulate replication at one or more stages. Replication has been separated temporally and physically into successive stages of RNA synthesis and DNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2088220832,"We have sequenced a cloned segment of E. coli chromosomal DNA that includes the heat shock regulatory gene htpR. This segment contains an 852 nucleotide open reading frame bounded by transcriptional and translational signals. Both in vivo and in vitro the cloned segment produces a single protein that migrates in gels with the cellular protein (F33.4) implicated as the htpR product. Properties of a cloned fragment of the coding sequence truncated at the promoter-distal end are consistent with this assignment. The htpR gene product appears homologous to the sigma factor of RNA polymerase, and the two proteins are predicted to have similar secondary structure. In addition, two regions of the predicted htpR product resemble protein-DNA contact points conserved in known DNA-binding proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1576816863,"In this paper, the isolation of rat liver gap junctions from alkali-extracted rat liver plasma membranes is described. The purification is significantly more rapid than the commonly used detergent-based approaches and is subject to less variability. The gap junctions isolated by this method are comprised of a 27,000-Da polypeptide previously identified as the major gap junction polypeptide. The isolated gap junctions have the characteristic double-membrane organization and subunit structure observed in vivo. The protein yield is from 8 to 10 micrograms/g of liver (wet weight), about a 10-fold increase in recovery over that of earlier isolation procedures. With the availability of increased amounts of material, antibodies were raised to the liver gap junction polypeptide. Immunofluorescence localization of these antibodies on rat liver sections revealed a distribution consistent with that expected from electron microscopic analysis of liver thin sections. Double diffusion of antibody against solubilized gap junctions in detergent-containing gels resulted in the formation of precipitin arcs, suggesting response to multiple determinants. Antibody binding to the 27,000-Da gap junction polypeptide was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing rat liver plasma membranes and isolated gap junctions. These results confirm the identification of the 27,000-Da polypeptide as the major protein component of gap junctions."

https://openalex.org/W2012895234,"A 5'-terminal leader sequence of 35 nucleotides was found to be present on multiple trypanosome RNAs. Based on its representation in cDNA libraries, we estimate that many, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs contain this leader. This same leader was originally identified on mRNAs encoding the molecules responsible for antigenic variation, variant surface glycoproteins. Studies of selected cDNAs containing this leader sequence revealed that leader-containing transcripts can be stage-specific, stage-regulated, or constitutive. They can be abundant or rare, and transcribed from single or multigene families. No linkage between the genomic leader sequences and the structural gene exons was observed. Possible mechanisms by which the leader sequences are added to trypanosome mRNAs are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1977275028,"We have examined the manner in which transposable element insertions affect the expression of the white gene of Drosophila by analyzing polyadenylated RNA of flies with each of nine insertions in or near the gene. In five mutants having insertions in the transcribed sequences of white, transcripts initiating at the white promoter are truncated within the insertions. Two insertions in the 3 kb intron of white alter neither the amount nor the structure of the mature white RNA. An insertion near the 5' end of the gene blocks the accumulation of any white transcripts. Another insertion, located 1.2 kb upstream from the transcribed region of the gene, causes a mutant phenotype yet surprisingly has no obvious effect on the structure or abundance of the major white RNA. We also show that a mutation at each of two other loci that modulate the phenotype of the white-apricot insertion mutant are correlated with small but significant changes in the pattern of white transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1987055757,"Human T-cell leukemia virus has been linked with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL), a tumor of mature T cells that occurs at elevated rates in southwestern Japan and in the Caribbean Basin. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) or a closely related virus, has also been found in varying proportions of healthy individuals of several species of Old World monkeys. In the present study, conducted with macaques from Taiwan and the New England Regional Primate Research Center, antibodies to membrane antigens of HTLV-infected cells (HTLV-MA) were found in 11 of 13 macaques with malignant lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease but in only 7 of 95 of healthy macaques. This indicates that antibodies to HTLV are significantly associated with the development of naturally occurring lymphoid neoplasms in at least some species of nonhuman primates."
https://openalex.org/W2019786963,"We have determined the complete 3581 bp sequence of the mitochondrial plasmid from Neurospora crassa strain Mauriceville-1c. The plasmid contains a long open reading frame that is expressed in its major transcript and could encode a hydrophilic protein of 710 amino acids. Two characteristics of the plasmid--codon usage and the presence of conserved sequence elements--suggest that it is related to Group I mtDNA introns. The major transcripts of the plasmid are approximately full-length, colinear RNAs that have heterogenous 5' ends and a single major 3' end. The major 5' and 3' ends are adjacent and slightly overlapping. The Mauriceville plasmid may belong to a class of genetic elements that were or are the progenitors of mtDNA introns."

https://openalex.org/W2042131034,"The chromatin structure of the collagen α1(I) gene, which has been mutated by retrovirus insertion in Mov13 mice, was compared with that of the wild-type allele. Limited digestions with DNAase I revealed the presence of two hypersensitive sites in all normal cells analyzed, while a third site at 100 to 200 bp 5′ of the transcription start was detected only in cells synthesizing collagen α1(I) mRNA. This transcription-associated site was not present in chromatin of the mutant allele, while the two other hypersensitive sites, one of which is located close to the provirus, were not changed by the virus integration. Our results suggest that the virus insertion in Mov13 mice may prevent the developmentally regulated appearance of a transcription-associated hypersensitive site, thereby interfering with proper activation of the gene during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2063946652,A stable cell line expressing a complementary DNA clone encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein fused and formed polykaryons at pH 5.5. The formation of polykaryons was dependent on the presence of glycoprotein anchored at the cell surface and could be prevented by incubation of cells with a monoclonal antibody to the glycoprotein. Fusion occurred at a pH 0.5 unit lower than that observed for cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus.
https://openalex.org/W2049076737,"To define the interaction of SV40 large T with different structural systems in the nuclei of SV40-transformed cells (BALB/c mKSA), we have employed an in situ cell fractionation procedure leading to the preparation of the nuclear matrix, and giving rise to defined nuclear extracts comprising soluble nuclear proteins (nucleoplasm) and the solubilized chromatin. Large T could be detected in the nucleoplasmic fraction and in the chromatin fraction, as well as in tight association with the nuclear matrix. From the nuclear matrix, large T could be solubilized by treatment with a zwitterionic detergent. Different solubility properties, differences in the amount of the cellular phosphoprotein p53 coprecipitating with large T, and different stabilities in its association with the nuclear structural systems indicate that distinct subclasses of large T were isolated from their in vivo location in SV40-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001728675,"Three overlapping cosmid clones contain coding sequences for four HLA Class II genes, provisionally identified as two HLA-SB alpha and two HLA-SB beta genes. The genes are in the order beta, alpha, beta, alpha, inverted with respect to each other. One of the SB beta genes contains a 513 bp sequence that appears to be a processed pseudogene, flanked by direct 17 bp repeat sequences, in the intron upstream of the beta 1 exon. The pseudogene is homologous to a family of sequences of approximately 25-40 members, most of which are not on chromosome 6. A cDNA clone, highly homologous to the pseudogene, except for its 5' end, contains a normal poly(A) addition site and a poly(A) tail. The cDNA clone is homologous to a single-copy gene in both man and mouse, encoded on human chromosome 15. A search of published DNA sequences identified a mouse sequence, with about 77% similarity to the pseudogene sequence, in the negative strand of an intron in a mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene. The second SB beta gene does not contain the pseudogene sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1998694225,"A gram-negative bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, was found to contain 500 to 700 copies per chromosome of a short single-stranded linear DNA fragment. When this DNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA; msDNA) labeled at the 5′ end with kinase was used as a probe against total chromosomal blots, it hybridized to unique high molecular weight bands, which were cloned and sequenced. Labeling of msDNA was also possible using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as well as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, permitting direct sequencing. The 5′ end of msDNA was found to be primed by a short RNA segment. The DNA portion of msDNA consisted of 163 bases. Exact correspondence was seen between the msDNA sequence and the sequence of a chromosomal clone. An elaborate secondary structure is postulated for the msDNA sequence. A similar satellite DNA was also found in another myxobacterium, Stigmatella aurantiaca."
https://openalex.org/W2169943021,"Late in oogenesis two clusters of Drosophila chorion genes and flanking DNA sequences undergo specific amplification in ovarian follicle cells. Lines were constructed using P-element-mediated transformation in which DNA segments derived from the chorion gene cluster at 66D on chromosome III had been inserted at new chromosomal locations. Only transposons that contained a specific 3.8 kb genomic segment derived from the cluster underwent amplification during oogenesis, which occurred with apparently normal tissue and temporal specificity. Adjacent nonchorion sequences also underwent amplification. However, the ability of a transposon to replicate differentially was subject to position effect. These studies provide evidence for the existence of a specific, cis-acting element controlling chorion gene amplification, which includes an origin for disproportionate DNA replication. Attempts to induce amplification with subfragments of the 3.8 kb segment were unsuccessful, suggesting that much of this fragment may be required for amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2036330256,"Three distinct segments (the partition-related, or PR segments) within the 370 bp par region of pSC101 have been shown by deletion analysis to be involved in partitioning of the plasmid to daughter cells. The two lateral segments are direct repeats, each of which potentially can pair with an inverted repeat located between them to form a hairpin-loop structure. Deletion of either lateral segment, together with the middle segment, results in plasmid instability (the Par- phenotype). Deletion of one PR segment yields a stable plasmid that nevertheless shows reduced ability to compete with a coexisting wild-type derivative of the same replicon (the Cmp- phenotype). Deletion of all three segments results in a rate of plasmid loss far in excess of that predicted from the observed copy number of the plasmid. Analysis of the segregation properties of these mutants and of temperature-sensitive and high copy number derivatives of the pSC101 replicon suggests a model in which the par function allows the nonreplicating plasmids of the intracellular pool to be counted as individual molecules, and to be distributed evenly to daughter cells. In the absence of par, the multicopy pool of plasmids behaves as a single segregation unit."
https://openalex.org/W1990185795,"Approximately 20% of the genome is missing and an equivalent amount is under-represented in the mitochondrial chromosome population of a stopper (stp) mutant of Neurospora crassa during the stopped phase of its cyclical growth pattern. At this stage, a 21 kb (7.2 μ) circular molecule, one-third the length of the normal chromosome, is the predominant form. A complementary 43 kb (14.6 μ) circle appears upon resumption of growth. The circles arise by reciprocal recombination at or near directly repeated tRNAmet sequences and the frequency of the two depends upon their rates of replication from replication origins unique to each of them. The 7.2 and 14.6 μ circles are the most frequent of the heteromorphic derivatives found within wild-type mitochondrial chromosome populations."
https://openalex.org/W1993245788,"The methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes Hha I and Hpa II were used to analyze the methylation pattern of four Xenopus laevis genes in DNA of embryos, of erythrocytes, and of untreated and estrogen-treated hepatocytes. Within these four genes all sites tested are fully modified in embryonic DNA. However, the adult beta 1-globin gene is unmethylated in DNA of erythrocytes, where it is expressed, and the 68 kd albumin gene, active only in hepatocytes, is specifically hypomethylated in hepatic DNA. The vitellogenin genes A1 and A2, in hepatocytes simultaneously expressed upon estrogen treatment, are heavily methylated in all adult tissues, irrespective of expression. Our results reveal that specific genes can be actively transcribed even when they are fully methylated and that changes in the methylation pattern are not a general prerequisite for gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2041188360,"We have genetically engineered three alleles of the K locus of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the mouse. These novel hybrid H-2K genes were introduced into mouse 1T 22-6 cells (H-2q), and their products were shown to be expressed on the cell surface. The hybrid H-2 K antigens were examined for their ability to function as restricting elements for cytotoxic T lymphocytes during influenza A infection. Both the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of the Kd antigen were required for T cell recognition. This implies an important role for ""conformational determinants"" on H-2 antigens acting as restricting elements. The cytoplasmic domain of the Kb antigen is not phenotypically important for recognition by T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082971321,"Employing specifically engineered plasmids in which the expression of E. coli galK cistron is regulated by transcription termination, we have analyzed the antitermination function of phage lambda N gene product in S30 extracts. Antitermination by N, dependent on its site of action, nutL, is defective in the extracts prepared from nusA, nusB, and nusE mutants. By complementation analysis, we demonstrate that none of the these nus mutations affects the synthesis of N or the other nus gene products to cause a defect in antitermination. Rather, these mutations have inactivated a set of specific host components, the Nus factors, which are essential for N activity. Curiously, an appreciable portion of N and Nus complementation activities of an S30 extract is ribosome-associated. The significance of this finding remains to be uncovered."
https://openalex.org/W1968446155,"Active and passive sensitization, both in vivo and in vitro, caused significant hyperpolarization of airway smooth muscle cell preparations isolated from guinea pigs. An increase in the contribution of the electrogenic Na+ pump to the resting membrane potential was responsible for this change. Hyperpolarization, as induced by passive sensitization, was not prevented by agents that inhibit specific mediators of anaphylaxis but was abolished when serum from sensitized animals was heated. The heat-sensitive serum factor, presumably reaginic antibodies, appears to be responsible for the membrane hyperpolarization of airway smooth muscle cells after sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2159318560,"The resolvase protein encoded by the gamma delta transposon has two functions. It catalyzes a site-specific recombination, and it negatively regulates the expression of two transposon genes. Both functions involve the action of resolvase at the res site. To define regions of resolvase that are involved specifically in the recombination reaction, we have isolated and characterized mutants that are defective in cointegrate resolution but retain the ability to bind to res (as measured by regulatory activity). Nine independent mutants were found to contain six different amino acid substitutions among just four distinct residues. The altered residues all lie within the 140 amino acid amino-terminal domain of resolvase and fall within two clusters of amino acids that are highly conserved in other related recombinases. The regulatory properties of the mutants suggest that one of these clusters may be involved in the interaction of the catalytic domain with the crossover site."

https://openalex.org/W2006805496,"To obtain additional mutants in the secretory apparatus of E. coli we have isolated suppressors of a mutant (secAts) that is temperature-sensitive for secretion. One of these, secC, can suppress the secretion defect of secA and has a phenotype of its own. At 23 degrees C, the secC mutant is cold-sensitive for growth and blocks the synthesis of transported proteins. The synthesis of at least one secreted protein, maltose-binding protein (MBP), can be restored by mutations that alter the hydrophobic region of the signal sequence of MBP. The phenotype of the secC mutant suggests that the SecC protein may be a component of the secretory apparatus of E. coli; it also supports the notion that in procaryotes secretion and gene expression are coupled. The secC gene maps at 68.5 minutes on the E. coli chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2021113277,"When a plasmid carrying a P-transposable element (derived from Drosophila melanogaster) is injected into young embryos of D. hawaiiensis, the P-element sequence from the plasmid transposes into the germ-line chromosomes. The introduction of this P element into D. hawaiiensis provides an opportunity to study the behavior of the transposable element in a novel context. Germ-line transposition and numerical increase of the P elements are readily detected in D. hawaiiensis. Thus these aspects of P-element function do not require chromosomal or cytoplasmic properties that are unique to D. melanogaster. Since D. hawaiiensis is among those Drosophila that are most distantly related to D. melanogaster, these results suggest that P-element-mediated transformation may function in many species."
https://openalex.org/W2017980863,"The human epsilon-globin gene has a number of alternative transcription-initiation sites located upstream of the canonical mRNA cap site. In three nonerythroid cell lines, ""leaky"" epsilon-globin transcription occurs exclusively from one of these upstream sites, the -200 cap site. Using a transient expression assay, we have shown that transcription initiation from the -200 cap site and the major cap site can be independently regulated in response to plasmid replication, SV40 enhancer sequences in cis, and the adenovirus E1A gene in trans. The -200 cap site is located within a region of S1 hypersensitivity in the supercoiled plasmid, and in the absence of viral enhancer sequences it is the main initiation site following transfection into a number of cell lines. We suggest that the -200 cap site acts as a polymerase entry site by virtue of its accessible chromatin structure. The efficiency of polymerase binding at this site may be altered by trans-acting regulatory molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1607151022,"When K562 human erythroleukemic cells are induced to differentiate by addition of hemin to their medium, the number of binding sites for transferrin on the cell surface is substantially reduced. This reflects an internalization of receptors since no such reduction is observed when the total binding sites in soluble extracts of uninduced and differentiating cells are compared. The internalization of transferrin receptors has also been shown using lactoperoxidase-mediated radioiodination of cell surfaces and by immune precipitation of total and surface labeled receptors using an anti-receptor monoclonal antibody. Transferrin receptors from uninduced and differentiating cells were partially purified by affinity chromatography on transferrin-Sepharose and shown to be disulfide-bridged homodimers of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 90,000. This protein is a phosphoprotein that can be resolved by isoelectric focusing into three major and two minor forms. By digestion with bacterial alkaline phosphatase, it was shown that at least four of these forms are probably phosphorylation variants of a single polypeptide. As differentiation proceeds, the proportions of the individual forms of the receptor change with a shift to the more phosphorylated polypeptides."

Comparison of the synthesis of ovalbumin and the alpha 4 gene product in the converted cells infected with ts mutants in alpha 4 gene and incubated at the permissive (33 degrees C) and nonpermissive (39 degrees C) temperatures revealed the following. (i) The synthesis of both ovalbumin and alpha 4 gene product was transiently induced at the permissive temperature but continued at elevated levels for many hours at the nonpermissive temperature. (ii) The synthesis of both ovalbumin and alpha 4 gene products resumed when the infected cells were shifted from permissive to nonpermissive temperature after the shut-off of alpha protein synthesis. (iii) Although both the beta-TK and alpha 4-ovalbumin chimeric genes were covalently linked on the same plasmid, each was regulated independently. We conclude that alpha gene regulation is determined solely by (a) the inducer and (b) the induction sequence contained in the promoter-regulatory region and not by the location or the higher order structure of the immediate environment of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1512411648,Abstract We have characterized the in vivo and in vitro transcription products of the Escherichia coli glnS gene which codes for the enzyme glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. The in vivo glnS transcript is about 1.9 kilobases long. Sequence analysis of the 5'- and 3'-ends of glnS mRNA showed that transcription initiates approximately 30 bases upstream from the translation initiation codon AUG and terminates approximately 230 bases downstream from the termination codon UAA. Characterization of the in vitro transcripts of glnS revealed similar transcription initiation and termination sites as were found in the glnS mRNA produced in vivo. These results indicate that the Pribnow box structure upstream and the dyad symmetry terminator structure downstream of the glnS structural region are regulatory signals used for glnS expression. In vitro transcription of glnS is not autogenously regulated by glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and glutamine; it is also not affected by the presence of tRNA.
