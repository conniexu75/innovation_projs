https://openalex.org/W2051130805,"Unmodified neurons can be directly stimulated with light to produce action potentials, but such techniques have lacked localization of the delivered light energy. Here we show that gold nanoparticles can be conjugated to high-avidity ligands for a variety of cellular targets. Once bound to a neuron, these particles transduce millisecond pulses of light into heat, which changes membrane capacitance, depolarizing the cell and eliciting action potentials. Compared to non-functionalized nanoparticles, ligand-conjugated nanoparticles highly resist convective washout and enable photothermal stimulation with lower delivered energy and resulting temperature increase. Ligands targeting three different membrane proteins were tested; all showed similar activity and washout resistance. This suggests that many types of ligands can be bound to nanoparticles, preserving ligand and nanoparticle function, and that many different cell phenotypes can be targeted by appropriate choice of ligand. The findings have applications as an alternative to optogenetics and potentially for therapies involving neuronal photostimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1977249777,"Forgetting can at times serve an adaptive purpose. Here the authors develop a method for dynamically tracking neocortical activity patterns related to the retrieval of individual episodic memories. They show that remembering gradually enhances relevant memories but also suppresses the cortical traces of interfering memories, causing adaptive forgetting. Remembering a past experience can, surprisingly, cause forgetting. Forgetting arises when other competing traces interfere with retrieval and inhibitory control mechanisms are engaged to suppress the distraction they cause. This form of forgetting is considered to be adaptive because it reduces future interference. The effect of this proposed inhibition process on competing memories has, however, never been observed, as behavioral methods are 'blind' to retrieval dynamics and neuroimaging methods have not isolated retrieval of individual memories. We developed a canonical template tracking method to quantify the activation state of individual target memories and competitors during retrieval. This method revealed that repeatedly retrieving target memories suppressed cortical patterns unique to competitors. Pattern suppression was related to engagement of prefrontal regions that have been implicated in resolving retrieval competition and, critically, predicted later forgetting. Thus, our findings demonstrate a cortical pattern suppression mechanism through which remembering adaptively shapes which aspects of our past remain accessible."
https://openalex.org/W2006324173,"Variability is a prominent feature of behavior and is an active element of certain behavioral strategies. To understand how neuronal circuits control variability, we examined the propagation of sensory information in a chemotaxis circuit of C. elegans where discrete sensory inputs can drive a probabilistic behavioral response. Olfactory neurons respond to odor stimuli with rapid and reliable changes in activity, but downstream AIB interneurons respond with a probabilistic delay. The interneuron response to odor depends on the collective activity of multiple neurons-AIB, RIM, and AVA-when the odor stimulus arrives. Certain activity states of the network correlate with reliable responses to odor stimuli. Artificially generating these activity states by modifying neuronal activity increases the reliability of odor responses in interneurons and the reliability of the behavioral response to odor. The integration of sensory information with network states may represent a general mechanism for generating variability in behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2149081083,"Expression of TET1 dioxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, is downregulated by repeated cocaine administration in mouse nucleus accumbens, where it controls cocaine reward. Genome-wide mapping of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in this brain region reveals novel modes of epigenetic regulation by cocaine. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes mediate the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which is enriched in brain, and its ultimate DNA demethylation. However, the influence of TET and 5hmC on gene transcription in brain remains elusive. We found that ten-eleven translocation protein 1 (TET1) was downregulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward structure, by repeated cocaine administration, which enhanced behavioral responses to cocaine. We then identified 5hmC induction in putative enhancers and coding regions of genes that have pivotal roles in drug addiction. Such induction of 5hmC, which occurred similarly following TET1 knockdown alone, correlated with increased expression of these genes as well as with their alternative splicing in response to cocaine administration. In addition, 5hmC alterations at certain loci persisted for at least 1 month after cocaine exposure. Together, these reveal a previously unknown epigenetic mechanism of cocaine action and provide new insight into how 5hmC regulates transcription in brain in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2029664411,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess unique gene expression programs that enforce their identity and regulate lineage commitment. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and cell fate decisions, although their functions in HSCs are unclear. Here we profiled the transcriptome of purified HSCs by deep sequencing and identified 323 unannotated lncRNAs. Comparing their expression in differentiated lineages revealed 159 lncRNAs enriched in HSCs, some of which are likely HSC specific (LncHSCs). These lncRNA genes share epigenetic features with protein-coding genes, including regulated expression via DNA methylation, and knocking down two LncHSCs revealed distinct effects on HSC self-renewal and lineage commitment. We mapped the genomic binding sites of one of these candidates and found enrichment for key hematopoietic transcription factor binding sites, especially E2A. Together, these results demonstrate that lncRNAs play important roles in regulating HSCs, providing an additional layer to the genetic circuitry controlling HSC function."
https://openalex.org/W2090139525,"Predisposition to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) involves interactions between a person's unique combination of genetic variants and the environment. The molecular effect of these variants may be subtle and difficult to analyze with standard in vitro or in vivo models. Here we used hIPSCs to examine genetic variation in the SORL1 gene and possible contributions to SAD-related phenotypes in human neurons. We found that human neurons carrying SORL1 variants associated with an increased SAD risk show a reduced response to treatment with BDNF, at the level of both SORL1 expression and APP processing. shRNA knockdown of SORL1 demonstrates that the differences in BDNF-induced APP processing between genotypes are dependent on SORL1 expression. We propose that the variation in SORL1 expression induction by BDNF is modulated by common genetic variants and can explain how genetic variation in this one locus can contribute to an individual's risk of developing SAD."
https://openalex.org/W2150300479,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are critical for anti-bacterial activity of the innate immune system. We have previously shown that mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are released into the circulation after injury. We therefore questioned whether mtDNA is involved in trauma-induced NET formation. Treatment of human polymorphoneutrophils (PMN) with mtDNA induced robust NET formation, though in contrast to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation, no NADPH-oxidase involvement was required. Moreover, formation of mtDNA-induced NETs was completely blocked by TLR9 antagonist, ODN-TTAGGG. Knowing that infective outcomes of trauma in elderly people are more severe than in young people, we measured plasma mtDNA and NET formation in elderly and young trauma patients and control subjects. MtDNA levels were significantly higher in the plasma of elderly trauma patients than young patients, despite lower injury severity scores in the elderly group. NETs were not visible in circulating PMN isolated from either young or old control subjects. NETs were however, detected in PMN isolated from young trauma patients and to a lesser extent from elderly patients. Stimulation by PMA induced widespread NET formation in PMN from both young volunteers and young trauma patients. NET response to PMA was much less pronounced in both elderly volunteers’ PMN and in trauma patients’ PMN. We conclude that mtDNA is a potent inducer of NETs that activates PMN via TLR9 without NADPH-oxidase involvement. We suggest that decreased NET formation in the elderly regardless of higher mtDNA levels in their plasma may result from decreased levels of TLR9 and/or other molecules, such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase that are involved in NET generation. Further study of the links between circulating mtDNA and NET formation may elucidate the mechanisms of trauma-related organ failure as well as the greater susceptibility to secondary infection in elderly trauma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2036671650,"Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and due to the invasive nature cannot be completely removed. The WNT inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), a secreted inhibitor of WNTs, is systematically downregulated in glioblastoma and acts as strong tumor suppressor. The aim of this study was the dissection of WIF1-associated tumor-suppressing effects mediated by canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling. We found that WIF1 besides inhibiting the canonical WNT pathway selectively downregulates the WNT/calcium pathway associated with significant reduction of p38-MAPK (p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation. Knockdown of WNT5A, the only WNT ligand overexpressed in glioblastoma, phenocopied this inhibitory effect. WIF1 expression inhibited cell migration in vitro and in an orthotopic brain tumor model, in accordance with the known regulatory function of the WNT/Ca2+ pathway on migration and invasion. In search of a mediator for this function differential gene expression profiles of WIF1-expressing cells were performed. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a long non-coding RNA and key positive regulator of invasion, emerged as the top downregulated gene. Indeed, knockdown of MALAT1 reduced migration in glioblastoma cells, without effect on proliferation. Hence, loss of WIF1 enhances the migratory potential of glioblastoma through WNT5A that activates the WNT/Ca2+ pathway and MALAT1. These data suggest the involvement of canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways in glioblastoma promoting key features associated with this deadly disease, proliferation on one hand and invasion on the other. Successful targeting will require a dual strategy affecting both canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2035720357,"Introduction Mammography ensures early diagnosis and a better chance for treatment and recovery from breast cancer. We conducted a national survey to investigate knowledge and practices of breast cancer screening among Saudi women aged 50 years or older in order to inform the breast cancer national health programs. Materials and Methods The Saudi Health Interview Survey is a national multistage survey of individuals aged 15 years or older. The survey included questions on socio-demographic characteristics, tobacco consumption, diet, physical activity, health-care utilization, different health-related behaviors, and self-reported chronic conditions. Female respondents were asked about knowledge and practices of self and clinical breast exams, as well as mammography. Results Between April and June 2013, a total of 10,735 participants completed the survey. Among respondents, 1,135 were women aged 50 years or older and were included in this analysis. About 89% of women reported not having a clinical breast exam in the past year, and 92% reported never having a mammogram. Women living in Al Sharqia had the highest rate of mammography use. Women who were educated, those who had received a routine medical exam within the last two years, and those who were diagnosed with hypertension were more likely to have had a mammogram in the past two years. Discussion Our results show very low rates of breast cancer screening in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country with free health services. This calls for educational campaigns to improve breast cancer screening. Addressing the barriers for breast cancer screening is a public health imperative."

The monoamine serotonin (5-HT) 2The abbreviations used are: 5-HTserotoninBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferPLCphospholipase CGPCRG protein-coupled receptormGluR2metabotropic glutamate-2 receptor4-PPDOT4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralinRlucRenilla luciferaseTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateIPinositol 1-phosphateβARKβ-adrenergic receptor kinase. is derived from dietary tryptophan, which is transformed into 5-HT in diverse clusters of neurons in the gut and brain. 5-HT exerts its actions via 14 classes of receptors, which are broadly expressed in peripheral tissues and the central nervous system (1.Millan M.J. Marin P. Bockaert J. Mannoury la Cour C. Signaling at G-protein-coupled serotonin receptors: recent advances and future research directions.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 454-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Conversely, although the neurohormone melatonin is derived from 5-HT, it is mainly produced by the pineal gland in a circadian pattern under the control of hypothalamic nuclei, attaining peak levels during the night. Melatonin binds with high affinity to MT1 and MT2 receptors and with moderate affinity to the enzyme quinone reductase 2 (2.Jockers R. Maurice P. Boutin J.A. Delagrange P. Melatonin receptors, heterodimerization, signal transduction and binding sites: what's new?.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 154: 1182-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both MT1 and MT2 receptors as well as all 14 classes of 5-HT receptor (except 5-HT3) belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Despite structural similarities between melatonin and 5-HT, melatonin does not recognize 5-HT receptors, and 5-HT fails to bind MT1 or MT2 receptors. Furthermore, to date, there have been only a few reports of functional cross-talk between melatonergic and serotonergic transmission: for example, melatonin inhibits the ability of 5-HT to phase shift the suprachiasmatic circadian clock (3.Prosser R.A. Melatonin inhibits in vitro serotonergic phase shifts of the suprachiasmatic circadian clock.Brain Res. 1999; 818: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). serotonin bioluminescence resonance energy transfer phospholipase C G protein-coupled receptor metabotropic glutamate-2 receptor 4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetralin Renilla luciferase tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate inositol 1-phosphate β-adrenergic receptor kinase. Recent studies have demonstrated other more direct modes of potential functional interaction expressed not only among signaling pathways but also operating directly at the level of GPCRs, which can assemble into heteromeric complexes (4.Milligan G. G protein-coupled receptor hetero-dimerization: contribution to pharmacology and function.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 158: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Such complexes frequently display functional properties distinct from those of the corresponding homomers and may even transduce novel and unique cellular responses. Moreover, several classes of GPCR heteromers have been associated with the pathogenesis and control of CNS disorders like 5-HT2A and metabotropic glutamate-2 receptor (mGluR2) heteromers in frontal cortex implicated in schizophrenia and in the actions of antipsychotics (5.González-Maeso J. Ang R.L. Yuen T. Chan P. Weisstaub N.V. López-Giménez J.F. Zhou M. Okawa Y. Callado L.F. Milligan G. Gingrich J.A. Filizola M. Meana J.J. Sealfon S.C. Identification of a serotonin/glutamate receptor complex implicated in psychosis.Nature. 2008; 452: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and limbic dopamine D1 and D2 receptor heteromers incriminated in depressed states (6.Pei L. Li S. Wang M. Diwan M. Anisman H. Fletcher P.J. Nobrega J.N. Liu F. Uncoupling the dopamine D1-D2 receptor complex exerts antidepressant-like effects.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1393-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To date, the possible existence of heteromeric associations of MT1 or MT2 receptor with specific classes of 5-HT receptors has not been evaluated. Their putative existence is of particular interest inasmuch as the clinically proven antidepressant agomelatine, the first to possess a non-monoaminergic component of action, behaves as an agonist at Gi-coupled MT1 and MT2 receptors but as a neutral antagonist at Gq/11-coupled 5-HT2C receptors (7.Audinot V. Mailliet F. Lahaye-Brasseur C. Bonnaud A. Le Gall A. Amossé C. Dromaint S. Rodriguez M. Nagel N. Galizzi J.P. Malpaux B. Guillaumet G. Lesieur D. Lefoulon F. Renard P. Delagrange P. Boutin J.A.

Lejeune F. Dekeyne A. Newman-Tancredi A. Pasteau V. Rivet J.M. Cussac D. The novel melatonin agonist agomelatine (S20098) is an antagonist at 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors, blockade of which enhances the activity of frontocortical dopaminergic and adrenergic pathways.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, although the affinity of agomelatine is substantially lower at 5-HT2C versus MT1 and MT2 in vitro, this apparent difference is much less pronounced in vivo, suggesting that it may exert its actions “synergistically” via these sites. Indeed, both 5-HT2C and MT1 and MT2 receptors are necessary for expression of the antidepressant actions of agomelatine, which cannot be reproduced either by melatonin or by selective 5-HT2C antagonists alone (9.Racagni G. Riva M.A. Molteni R. Musazzi L. Calabrese F. Popoli M. Tardito D. Mode of action of agomelatine: Synergy between melatonergic and 5-HT2C receptors.World J. Biol. Psychiatry. 2011; 12: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For example, “synergistical” MT1, MT2, and 5-HT2C receptor-transduced actions of agomelatine may account for its induction of neurogenesis and BDNF synthesis as well as its modulation of glutamate release (for a review, see Ref. 9.Racagni G. Riva M.A. Molteni R. Musazzi L. Calabrese F. Popoli M. Tardito D. Mode of action of agomelatine: Synergy between melatonergic and 5-HT2C receptors.World J. Biol. Psychiatry. 2011; 12: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In light of the above observations, the present studies explored the potential formation of heteromers between melatonin receptors and 5-HT2C receptors and specifically examined the functional profile of agomelatine at these sites. All chemicals and ligands were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the exception of pertussis toxin, which was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, and 4-PPDOT, luzindole, and SB242084, which were purchased from Tocris.

The 5-HT2C-S138N-Rluc mutant was obtained by mutagenesis from the 5-HT2C-Rluc plasmid. All constructs were verified by sequencing. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, HEK293 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and co-transfected with 4 μg of each indicated plasmid. 48 h after transfection, crude membranes were prepared as described previously (13.Jockers R.

Results were analyzed by PRISM (GraphPad Software). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments. Student's t test was applied for statistical analysis. We first carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments to assess a possible interaction between the human 5-HT2C and MT1 and MT2 receptors. These experiments revealed that 5-HT2C interacts with MT1 and MT2 in HEK293 cells co-expressing the respective receptors (Fig. 1, A and B). To further confirm the existence of these heteromeric complexes and to assess the propensity of heteromer formation, BRET experiments were performed. 5-HT2C was fused at its C terminus to the energy donor Rluc. C-terminal YFP fusion proteins (5-HT2C-YFP, MT1-YFP, MT2-YFP, and 5-HT4d-YFP) acted as energy acceptors (Fig. 1C). The expected hyperbolic donor saturation curve, reflecting a specific interaction between BRET donor and acceptor pairs, was observed for all receptor combinations except for the negative control 5-HT4d-YFP fusion protein for which a quasilinear increase in BRET reflecting a nonspecific interaction due to random collision was observed (18.Mercier J.F.

Determination of BRET50 values, corresponding to the saturation of 50% of BRET donors by BRET acceptors, revealed that the relative propensity of 5-HT2C to form heteromers with MT2 (BRET50 = 2.2 ± 0.4) is higher than with MT1 (BRET50 = 6.9 ± 1.5) or with itself (BRET50 = 8.8 ± 1.5), indicating preferential formation of MT2/5-HT2C heteromers. As shown by immunofluorescence staining, 5-HT2C expressed alone was mainly intracellular, and a significant amount of MT2 and 5-HT2C was present at the plasma membrane where both receptors colocalized (Fig. 1D). Formation of MT2/5-HT2C heteromers was further suggested by co-immunoprecipitation studies in human cortex and hippocampus, two regions shown previously to express melatonin and 5-HT2C receptors (20.Brunner P.

Heat-inactivated anti-MT2 antibodies were used as a negative control. Further evidence for the formation of MT2/5-HT2C heteromers was obtained from choroid plexus membranes, which are known to express significant amounts of 5-HT2C receptors. Melatonin receptors were labeled with 2-(125I)iodomelatonin, and protein complexes were solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-5-HT2C antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1E, significant amounts of radiolabeled melatonin receptors were precipitated with anti-5-HT2C antibodies as compared with a mixture of irrelevant control antibodies. Overall, our results indicate that 5-HT2C specifically interacts with MT2 in transfected HEK293 cells and in the cortex, hippocampus, and choroid plexus. HEK293 cells expressing equivalent and physiologically relevant levels of MT2 and 5-HT2C (20–30 fmol each/mg of protein) either alone or together were treated with forskolin and increasing concentrations of melatonin followed by determination of cAMP levels. Melatonin decreased cAMP levels in cells expressing MT2 alone as expected and in cells co-expressing MT2 and 5-HT2C with the same efficiency (EC50 = 0.76 ± 0.46 versus 0.76 ± 0.39 nm, respectively) and potency (30% reduction) (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Melatonin was without effect in cells expressing 5-HT2C alone. Stimulation with up to 10 μm 5-HT did not modify cAMP levels in any of the three cell types (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that activation of the MT2 protomer of the MT2/5-HT2C heteromer activates the Gi/cAMP pathway but that activation of the 5-HT2C protomer is unable to transactivate this pathway.TABLE 1Compared potencies and properties of melatonin receptor ligands on two signaling pathways in cells expressing MT2 or MT2 and 5-HT2C receptorsEC50 ± S.E.Inhibition of cAMP productionStimulation of inositol phosphate productionMT2MT2/5-HT2CMT2MT2/5-HT2CnmMTR agonists MLT0.76 ± 0.460.76 ± 0.39No effect69 ± 20 Agomelatine0.29 ± 0.160.89 ± 0.35No effectAntagonistMTR antagonists LuzindoleAntagonist (Ki = 1.12 ± 0.48 nm)Antagonist (Ki = 7.73 ± 4.98 nm)No effectFull agonist (EC50 = 223 ± 97 nm) 4-PPDOTAntagonist (Ki = 0.14 ± 0.12 nm)Antagonist (Ki = 0.04 ± 0.01 nm)No effectPartial agonist (EC50 = 2.5 ± 1.7 nm) S20928Antagonist (Ki = 4.88 ± 1.5 nm)Antagonist (Ki = 0.66 ± 0.45 nm)No effectAntagonist (Ki = ND) Open table in a new tab We next investigated the capacity of MT2/5-HT2C heteromers to activate the Gq/PLC pathway by monitoring 5-HT-induced IP production. Stimulation of HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT2C alone resulted in the expected dose-dependent increase in IP production (Fig. 3A). This response was potentiated (∼3-fold) in cells expressing similar quantities of 5-HT2C receptors, but in the presence of MT2, the response was of similar potency (EC50 = 21 ± 11 nm (5-HT2C) versus 68 ± 25 nm (MT2/5-HT2C)). 5-HT was ineffective in cells expressing MT2 alone (Fig. 3A). Amplification of the 5-HT-induced response was Gq/11- but not Gi-dependent as determined by pretreating cells with YM254890 or pertussis toxin inhibitors, respectively (Fig. 3B). Expression of the Gβγ scavenger βARKCter had no significant effect (Fig. 3C), confirming the predominant role of Gq/11α proteins in the observed amplification. Pretreatment of cells with 5-HT2C antagonists (RS102221 and SB242084) or an inverse agonist (SB206553) completely blocked the 5-HT-induced IP production in cells expressing 5-HT2C alone and in the presence of MT2 as expected (Fig. 3D). Pretreatment with S20928, a melatonin receptor antagonist, showed no cross-reactivity on 5-HT-induced responses (Fig. 3E). Amplified 5-HT-induced responses in the context of the MT2/5-HT2C heteromer might be explained by increased cell surface expression of 5-HT2C receptors. In agreement with previous reports, only a minor fraction of 5-HT2C receptors (13.2 ± 1.1%) was expressed at the cell surface when expressed alone as determined by in-cell Western experiments (Fig. 3F). In cells co-expressing 5-HT2C and MT2 receptors, the fraction of cell surface-expressed 5-HT2C almost doubled (22.7 ± 3.0%), whereas the total amount of 5-HT2C receptors was not modified. The total amount and the fraction of cell surface-expressed MT2 remained constant irrespective of the presence or absence of 5-HT2C. Taken together, our results indicate that MT2 co-expression potentiates 5-HT2C receptor signaling in the MT2/5-HT2C heteromer by increasing the cell surface expression of 5-HT2C. To explore the possible effect of MT2 activation in the MT2/5-HT2C heteromer on the Gq/PLC pathway, we stimulated HEK293 cells expressing MT2 and 5-HT2C either alone or together with melatonin and determined IP production. Whereas melatonin had no effect in cells expressing either receptor alone, a dose-dependent increase in IP production was observed in cells co-expressing both receptors with an EC50 of 69 ± 20 nm (Fig. 4A). To verify that melatonin-induced IP production is not due to the signaling cross-talk between MT2 and any Gq-coupled GPCR, we co-expressed MT2 with the Gq-coupled M1 muscarinic receptor, which does not form heteromers with MT2 (data not show). In these cells, melatonin did not increase IP production, indicating that melatonin-induced IP production is specific for the MT2/5-HT2C heteromer (Fig. 4B). Functional expression of M1 receptors was shown by the expected increase in IP production in the presence of acetylcholine (Fig. 4B). Melatonin-induced IP production in cells co-expressing MT2 and 5-HT2C receptors was not affected by the expression of the Gβγ scavenger βARKCter (Fig. 4C), but it was partially and completely abrogated by pertussis toxin and YM254890 treatment, respectively (Fig. 4D). This indicates the predominant role of Gq/11α proteins, which can be assisted by the presence of Giα proteins. This result raises the intriguing possibility that melatonin binding to the MT2 protomer of the MT2/5-HT2C heteromer transactivates the 5-HT2C protomer, which then activates Gq. To verify this hypothesis, we evaluated whether the melatonin-induced response depended on the activation state of the 5-HT2C protomer. Pretreatment of cells with 5-HT2C neutral antagonists (RS102221 and SB242084) prior to melatonin addition had no effect on melatonin-induced IP production, whereas the inverse agonist SB206553 blocked the effect (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the notion that the melatonin-induced effect is independent of the occupation of the 5-HT2C receptor binding site but dependent on the constitutive activity of the 5-HT2C protomer. To further verify the transactivation hypothesis, we used the 5-HT2C-S138N mutant, which does not bind 5-HT and exhibits decreased constitutive activity due to decreased coupling to Gq proteins compared with the wild-type receptor (22.Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Harrigan T.J. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Inhibition of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2c receptor function through heterodimerization: receptor dimers bind two molecules of ligand and one G-protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40144-40151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The absence of 5-HT-promoted IP production was confirmed in cells expressing 5-HT2C-S138N and MT2 (Fig. 5B). When cells co-expressing this mutant and MT2 receptors were stimulated with melatonin, the anticipated reduction in amplitude and efficiency (EC50 = 550 ± 187 versus 69 ± 20 nm for MT2/5-HT2C-S138N and MT2/5-HT2C, respectively (p < 0.001)) was observed compared with 5-HT2C wild-type receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 5C). Decreased activity was not due to less efficient heteromerization with MT2 as comparable BRET50 values (2.2 ± 0.4 versus 3.5 ± 0.6 for MT2/5-HT2C and MT2/5-HT2C-S138N, respectively) were observed (Fig. 5D). The decreased response to melatonin in the presence of the 5-HT2C-S138N mutant further supports the transactivation mechanism in which the melatonin-induced conformational change in the MT2 protomer is transmitted to the 5-HT2C protomer and then further downstream to the Gq/PLC pathway. Apart from interacting with heterotrimeric G proteins, GPCRs are also known to recruit β-arrestins. We therefore studied the ability of melatonin to activate the previousl"
https://openalex.org/W2037650911,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that continually undergo cycles of fission and fusion. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a large GTPase of the dynamin superfamily, is the main mediator of mitochondrial fission. Like prototypical dynamin, Drp1 is composed of a mechanochemical core consisting of the GTPase, middle, and GTPase effector domain regions. In place of the pleckstrin homology domain in dynamin, however, Drp1 contains an unstructured variable domain, whose function is not yet fully resolved. Here, using time-resolved EM and rigorous statistical analyses, we establish the ability of full-length Drp1 to constrict lipid bilayers through a GTP hydrolysis-dependent mechanism. We also show the variable domain limits premature Drp1 assembly in solution and promotes membrane curvature. Furthermore, the mechanochemical core of Drp1, absent of the variable domain, is sufficient to mediate GTP hydrolysis-dependent membrane constriction."

However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, two putative DDIT3 binding sites (−1636/−1625; −374/−364) and a putative AP-1 binding site (−304/−298) were identified in the TNFRSF10A promoter region. We found that DDIT3 interacts with phospho-JUN, and the DDIT3·phospho-JUN complex binds to the AP-1 binding site (−304/−298) within the TNFRSF10A promoter region. In addition, we confirmed that KAT2A physically interacts with the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–26) of DDIT3. Importantly, knockdown of KAT2A down-regulated TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B and dramatically decreased promoter activity of cells transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid containing the AP-1 binding site (−304/−298) of the TNFRSF10A promoter, as well as cells transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid containing DDIT3 binding site (−276/−264) of the TNFRSF10B promoter. ChIP results suggest that KAT2A may participate in a KAT2A·DDIT3·phospho-JUN complex, or may participate in a KAT2A·DDIT3 complex and acetylate H3K9/K14, respectively. Moreover, we verified that TNFRSF10A mediates apoptosis triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress in human lung cancer cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that DDIT3 and KAT2A cooperatively up-regulate TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B. Our findings highlight novel mechanisms underlying endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B expressions and apoptosis. These findings will be helpful for elucidating mechanisms related to anticancer drugs in mediating apoptosis."

With the leukemogenic concerns of viral gene therapy there is a need to explore alternative therapeutic options. We have utilized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and genome editing mediated by TALENs to generate isogenic subject-specific mutant and gene-corrected iPSC lines. While the subject-derived mutant iPSCs have the capacity to generate hematopoietic precursors and myeloid cells, only wild-type and gene-corrected iPSCs can additionally generate mature NK cells and T cell precursors expressing the correctly spliced IL-2Rγ.

https://openalex.org/W1985991629,"Cellular senescence is an important mechanism that restricts tumour growth. The Ink4a-Arf locus (also known as Cdkn2a), which encodes p16INK4A and p19ARF, has a central role in inducing and maintaining senescence. Given the importance of cellular senescence in restraining tumour growth, great emphasis is being placed on the identification of novel factors that can modulate senescence. The MYST-family histone acetyltransferase MOZ (MYST3, KAT6A), first identified in recurrent translocations in acute myeloid leukaemia, has been implicated in both the promotion and inhibition of senescence. In this study, we investigate the role of MOZ in cellular senescence and show that MOZ is a potent inhibitor of senescence via the INK4A-ARF pathway. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from Moz-deficient embryos exhibit premature senescence, which was rescued on the Ink4a-Arf−/− background. Importantly, senescence resulting from the absence of MOZ was not accompanied by DNA damage, suggesting that MOZ acts independently of the DNA damage response. Consistent with the importance of senescence in cancer, expression profiling revealed that genes overexpressed in aggressive and highly proliferative cancers are expressed at low levels in Moz-deficient MEFs. We show that MOZ is required to maintain normal levels of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and H3K27 acetylation at the transcriptional start sites of at least four genes, Cdc6, Ezh2, E2f2 and Melk, and normal mRNA levels of these genes. CDC6, EZH2 and E2F2 are known inhibitors of the INK4A-ARF pathway. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that MOZ occupies the Cdc6, Ezh2 and Melk loci, thereby providing a direct link between MOZ, H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, and normal transcriptional levels at these loci. This work establishes that MOZ is an upstream inhibitor of the INK4A-ARF pathway, and suggests that inhibiting MOZ may be one way to induce senescence in proliferative tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022945031,"Metastasis of cancer cells involves multiple steps, including their dissociation from the primary tumor and invasion through the endothelial cell barrier to enter the circulation and finding their way to distant organ sites where they extravasate and establish metastatic lesions. Deficient contact inhibition is a hallmark of invasive cancer cells, yet surprisingly the vascular invasiveness of commonly studied cancer cell lines is regulated by the density at which cells are propagated in culture. Cells grown at high density were less effective at invading an endothelial monolayer than cells grown at low density. This phenotypic difference was also observed in a zebrafish model of vascular invasion of cancer cells after injection into the yolk sac and extravasation of cancer cells into tissues from the vasculature. The vascular invasive phenotypes were reversible. A kinome-wide RNA interference screen was used to identify drivers of vascular invasion by panning small hairpin RNA (shRNA) library-transduced noninvasive cancer cell populations on endothelial monolayers. The selection of invasive subpopulations showed enrichment of shRNAs targeting the large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) kinase that inhibits the activity of the transcriptional coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) in the Hippo pathway. Depletion of LATS1 from noninvasive cancer cells restored the invasive phenotype. Complementary to this, inhibition or depletion of YAP inhibited invasion in vitro and in vivo. The vascular invasive phenotype was associated with a YAP-dependent upregulation of the cytokines IL6, IL8 and C-X-C motif ligand 1, 2 and 3. Antibody blockade of cytokine receptors inhibited invasion and confirmed that they are rate-limiting drivers that promote cancer cell vascular invasiveness and could provide therapeutic targets."

E40 exhibited the maximal activity at 45 °C and was quite thermolabile, with a half-life of only 2 min at 40 °C, which may be an adaptation of E40 to the permanently cold sediment environment. The structure of E40 was solved to study its thermolability. Structural analysis showed that E40 lacks the interdomain hydrophobic interactions between loop 1 of the CAP domain and α7 of the catalytic domain compared with its thermostable homologs. Mutational analysis showed that the introduction of hydrophobic residues Trp202 and Phe203 in α7 significantly improved E40 stability and that a further introduction of hydrophobic residues in loop 1 made E40 more thermostable because of the formation of interdomain hydrophobic interactions. Altogether, the results indicate that the absence of interdomain hydrophobic interactions between loop 1 and α7 leads to the thermolability of E40. In addition, a comparative analysis of the structures of E40 and other thermolabile and thermostable HSLs suggests that the interdomain hydrophobic interactions between loop 1 and α7 are a key element for the thermostability of microbial HSLs.

Despite its biological and clinical significance, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms engaged by GPNMB. Herein, we show that GPNMB engages distinct functional domains and mechanisms to promote primary tumor growth and metastasis. We demonstrate that neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) expression is increased in breast cancer cells that overexpress GPNMB. Interestingly, the GPNMB-driven increase in NRP-1 expression potentiated vascular endothelial growth factor signaling in breast cancer cells and was required for the growth, but not metastasis, of these cells in vivo. Interrogation of RNAseq data sets revealed a positive correlation between GPNMB and NRP-1 levels in human breast tumors. Furthermore, we ascribe pro-growth and pro-metastatic functions of GPNMB to its ability to bind α5β1 integrin and increase downstream signaling in breast cancer cells. We show that GPNMB enhances breast cancer cell adhesion to fibronectin, increases α5β1 expression and associates with this receptor through its RGD motif. GPNMB recruitment into integrin complexes activates Src and Fak signaling pathways in an RGD-dependent manner. Importantly, both the RGD motif and cytoplasmic tail of GPNMB are required to promote primary mammary tumor growth; however, only mutation of the RGD motif impaired the formation of lung metastases. Together, these findings identify novel and distinct molecular mediators of GPNMB-induced breast cancer growth and metastasis."

During osteoblast maturation, the basal expression of Mmp13 and its sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D3 are strikingly increased.

Agonist-independent GPCR phosphorylation cannot be explained by constitutive activity of the receptor or membrane association of the GRK, suggesting that it is an inherent ability of GRK5/6. Importantly, phosphorylation of the inactive β2-adrenergic receptor enhanced its interactions with arrestins. Arrestin-3 was able to discriminate between phosphorylation of the same receptor by GRK2 and GRK5, demonstrating preference for the latter. Arrestin recruitment to inactive phosphorylated GPCRs suggests that not only agonist activation but also the complement of GRKs in the cell regulate formation of the arrestin-receptor complex and thereby G protein-independent signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2002831680,"Deregulation of autophagy has been linked to multiple degenerative diseases and cancer, thus the identification of novel autophagy regulators for potential therapeutic intervention is important. To meet this need, we developed a high content image-based short hairpin RNA screen monitoring levels of the autophagy substrate p62/SQSTM1. We identified 186 genes whose loss caused p62 accumulation indicative of autophagy blockade, and 67 genes whose loss enhanced p62 elimination indicative of autophagy stimulation. One putative autophagy stimulator, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4 (PFKFB4), drives flux through pentose phosphate pathway. Knockdown of PFKFB4 in prostate cancer cells increased p62 and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but surprisingly increased autophagic flux. Addition of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine prevented p62 accumulation in PFKFB4-depleted cells, suggesting that the upregulation of p62 and autophagy was a response to oxidative stress caused by PFKFB4 elimination. Thus, PFKFB4 suppresses oxidative stress and p62 accumulation, without which autophagy is stimulated likely as a ROS detoxification response."
https://openalex.org/W2059401269,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays an important role in human physiology, exerting vasodilatory, neuromodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. H2S has been implicated in the mechanism of gastrointestinal integrity but whether this gaseous mediator can affect hemorrhagic lesions induced by stress has been little elucidated. We studied the effect of the H2S precursor L-cysteine, H2S-donor NaHS, the H2S synthesizing enzyme (CSE) activity inhibitor- D,L-propargylglycine (PAG) and the gastric H2S production by CSE/CBS/3-MST activity in water immersion and restraint stress (WRS) ulcerogenesis and the accompanying changes in gastric blood flow (GBF). The role of endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) and sensory afferent nerves releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the mechanism of gastroprotection induced by H2S was examined in capsaicin-denervated rats and those pretreated with capsazepine to inhibit activity of vanilloid receptors (VR-1). Rats were pretreated with vehicle, NaHS, the donor of H2S and or L-cysteine, the H2S precursor, with or without the concurrent treatment with 1) nonselective (indomethacin) and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 (SC-560) or COX-2 (rofecoxib) inhibitors. The expression of mRNA and protein for COX-1 and COX-2 were analyzed in gastric mucosa pretreated with NaHS with or without PAG. Both NaHS and L-cysteine dose-dependently attenuated severity of WRS-induced gastric lesions and significantly increased GBF. These effects were significantly reduced by pretreatment with PAG and capsaicin denervation. NaHS increased gastric H2S production via CSE/CBS but not 3-MST activity. Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 activity significantly diminished NaHS- and L-cysteine-induced protection and hyperemia. NaHS increased expression of COX-1, COX-2 mRNAs and proteins and raised CGRP mRNA expression. These effects of NaHS on COX-1 and COX-2 protein contents were reversed by PAG and capsaicin denervation. We conclude that H2S exerts gastroprotection against WRS-induced gastric lesions by the mechanism involving enhancement in gastric microcirculation mediated by endogenous PGs, sensory afferent nerves releasing CGRP and the activation of VR-1 receptors."

NTMT1 transfers a methyl group from the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to α-N-terminal amines, where the lone pair of electrons on the α-amine attacks the electrophilic methylsulfonium group of AdoMet to yield the S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) and methylated protein (Fig. 1). There are generally three different methylation states: mono-, di-, and trimethylation. The different individual methylation states at the protein α-N terminus may have divergent roles with respect to biological functions (3.Stock A. Clarke S. Clarke C. Stock J.

NTMT1 recognizes a canonical motif XPK (where X represents A, P, or S) (4.Tooley C.E. Petkowski J.J. Muratore-Schroeder T.L. Balsbaugh J.L. Shabanowitz J. Sabat M. Minor W. Hunt D.F. Macara I.G.

Despite increased efforts to understand various NTMT1 activities within a cellular context, very little is known about its mechanism. Herein we sought to determine the kinetic mechanism for NTMT1. Additionally, we have examined the progression of methylation to determine how the distribution of methylation states varies over time. Our results indicate that NTMT1 follows a random sequential Bi Bi mechanism in which either AdoMet or protein substrate can initially bind to NTMT1. Furthermore, we find that NTMT1 catalysis displays a distributive mechanism for multiple methylations. All chemicals and reagents were used as purchased without further purification except for α-cyano-3-hydroxycinnamic acid. Most chemicals and reagents were purchased from Aldrich, Fisher, VWR, EMD, Calbiochem, and ChemImpex. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was used as purchased from Qiagen. Human NTMT1 clone (AD-003) was obtained from Addgene. The AdoHcy hydrolase (SAHH) clone was obtained through a Materials Transfer Agreement with Dr. Raymond C. Trievel (University of Michigan) and was expressed and purified as described by Collazo et al. (13.Collazo E. Couture J.F. Bulfer S. Trievel R.C.

Peptides representing hRCC1-6 (SPKRIA), hRCC1-9 (SPKRIAKRR), hRCC1-10 (SPKRIAKRRS), and hRCC1-12 (SPKRIAKRRSPP) were synthesized on Rink amide resin using standard Fmoc chemistry with a CEM Liberty microwave peptide synthesizer. Fmoc protection groups at the α-N termini were removed by 20% (v/v) piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. Me-RCC1-10 and Ac-RCC1-10 peptides were prepared according to the literature (14.Borch R.F. Bernstein M.D. Durst H.D. Cyanohydridoborate anion as a selective reducing agent.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 2897-2904Crossref Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). The Me2-RCC1-10 peptide was synthesized as follows. To the deprotected RCC1-10 peptide on resin (0.1 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (2 ml) was added formaldehyde (24 μl of 37% (w/v) solution, 0.24 mmol), HOAc (20 μl), and NaBH3CN (15 mg, 0.24 mmol) (15.Biron E. Chatterjee J. Kessler H. Optimized selective N-methylation of peptides on solid support.J. Pept. Sci. 2006; 12: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mixture was placed on a shaker for 4 h. The resin was washed with N,N-dimethylformamide, and the reaction was repeated. The procedure for synthesis of Me3-RCC1-10 peptide was as follows. To Me2-RCC1-10 on resin (0.03 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (2 ml) was added methyl iodide (83 μl, 1.2 mmol), 18-crown-6 (176 mg, 0.6 mmol), and K2CO3 (93 mg, 0.6 mmol) (16.Santhiya D. Dias R.S.

Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University for three peptides (RCC1-10, Me-RCC1-10, and Ac-RCC1-10). The Ac-RCC1-10 was used to generate a calibration curve by HPLC for quantitation of the remaining peptides. His-NTMT1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus RIL cells in Terrific Broth medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml kanamycin, using a pET28a-LIC expression vector that encodes a full-length NTMT1 (amino acids 1–222) with His6 tag obtained from Addgene. Cells were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 1.5, induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm), and incubated overnight at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm. Cell pellets were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl and 10 mm imidazole, lysed by passing through a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp.) at 20,000 p.s.i., and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. After removal of unbound protein by extensive washing, the protein was eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl. Combined elution fractions were dialyzed in the dialysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl) three times to provide His-NTMT1. The yield was 20 mg/liter. To remove the His tag from NTMT1, thrombin (200 μl, 1 unit/μl in 1× PBS) was added to His-NTMT1 (20 mg) in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl and gently shaken at room temperature. After 3.5 h, p-aminobenzamidine-agarose was added to remove thrombin. The resultant solution was dialyzed in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm KCl overnight and run over a nickel column three times to remove residual His-NTMT1 and yield untagged NTMT1, which was stored at −80 °C. Protein purity (>95%) was verified by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was determined. A fluorescence-based SAHH-coupled assay was adapted to study the kinetics of NTMT1, which monitors the formation of a ThioGlo1-thiol adduct that exhibits a strong fluorescence at 500 nm (13.Collazo E.

NTMT1 activity was measured under the following conditions in a final well volume of 100 μl: 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 μm SAHH, 0.2 μm NTMT1, 100 μm AdoMet, and 15 μm ThioGlo1. 10 μm SAHH was used to ensure that the hydrolysis of AdoHcy was not rate-limiting as compared with NTMT1. ThioGlo1 was prepared as a stock solution in DMSO and stored protected from light at −20 °C. All components except for peptide substrate were initially mixed in a 96-well plate, and the reaction was initiated at 37 °C with the addition of a peptide substrate. All peptide substrate concentrations were varied from 0 to 40 μm except for RCC1-6, which was varied from 0 to 160 μm. Fluorescence was monitored on a FlexStation® 3 microplate reader with excitation = 370 nm and emission = 500 nm. The data for the initial rates were fit to the Michaelis-Menten model using least squares nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism 5 software (version 5.04). The initial rates for AdoMet were determined at different fixed concentrations of the RCC1-10 peptide (1, 2, 4, and 8 μm). For reactions where the RCC1-10 peptide was the varied substrate, the initial rates were examined at fixed concentration of AdoMet (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μm). The initial rates were globally fit to the following equations using least squares nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism 5 software (19.Copeland R.A.

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based methylation assays were performed and analyzed via an Applied Biosystems Voyager matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Methylation was performed under the following conditions: 0.2 μm NTMT1, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KOAc, peptide substrate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at either 30 or 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of AdoMet to initiate the reaction. Aliquots were quenched in a 1:1 ratio with a quenching solution (20 mm NH4H2PO4, 0.4% (v/v) TFA in 1:1 acetonitrile/water) and kept at 4 °C before analysis (20.Zhu X. Papayannopoulos I.A.

An average of five acquisitions were performed for each well. For the inhibition assays, inhibitors were incubated in buffer with NTMT1 in the absence of both enzyme substrates for 5 min. Three independent trials were performed for all experiments. Data were processed in Data Explorer by applying a noise filter (correlation factor of 0.7) and a baseline correction. The fraction of each methylation state was determined by summing the areas of the monoisotopic peaks for that state ((M + H)+, (M + Na)+, and (M + K)+) and dividing by the total area of all relevant species. Multiplying the original peptide concentration by the fraction gave the concentration of each methylation state. Dividing the concentration by the time at which the aliquot was quenched provided the rate of methylation for that species. Rate constants for the irreversible conversion of substrates to products were determined by fitting of the progression data with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm via Dynafit (22.Kuzmic P.

The Me3-RCC1-10 peptide and AdoHcy were used as the product inhibitors. The Ac-RCC1-10 and sinefungin were used as the dead-end analogues (24.Obianyo O. Osborne T.C. Thompson P.R. Kinetic mechanism of protein arginine methyltransferase 1.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10420-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We used RCC1-9 as the peptide substrate in the inhibition studies because Ac-RCC1-10 and Me3-RCC1-10 overlap the peaks for RCC1-10. The IC50 values were determined for all four inhibitors by fitting the activity data with GraphPad. In cases where the highest concentration tested did not result in greater than 50% inhibition, the IC50 was determined manually as greater than the highest concentration. The inhibition patterns were determined by fitting the initial rate data for competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and mixed inhibition, respectively. His-NTMT1 was expressed as a fusion protein and purified according to a published protocol from the Structural Genomics Consortium. The His tag was removed with thrombin to yield untagged NTMT1. The yield for the cleaved form of NTMT1 is 2.5 mg/liter after purification. The steady-state kinetic parameters of both His-NTMT1 and NTMT1 were determined for RCC1-12 and AdoMet using a continuous fluorescence assay (13.Collazo E. Couture J.F. Bulfer S. Trievel R.C.

For the fluorescence assay, the concentration of AdoHcy formed during the reaction was derived from a standard calibration curve generated with glutathione and ThioGlo1. The linearity of the methylation reaction with respect to enzyme concentration was confirmed in the range of 0–0.4 μm (Fig. 2A). We chose to use 0.2 μm enzyme for our assays, and the linearity of the methylation reaction with respect to time is shown in Fig. 2B. We compared the activities between His-NTMT1 and NTMT1. The Km value for RCC1-12 with His-NTMT1 is 4.9 ± 0.7 μm, with a kcat value at 0.78 ± 0.03 min−1 (Fig. 2C). The Km value for AdoMet with His-NTMT1 is 8.0 ± 1.6 μm with a kcat value at 0.23 ± 0.01 min−1 (Fig. 2D). These values are in reasonable agreement with NTMT1 (Table 1). Therefore, we used both His-NTMT1 and untagged NTMT1 interchangeably.TABLE 1Comparison of activities of His-NTMT1 with NTMT1SubstrateNTMT1His-NTMT1Kmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1m−1 min−1μmmin−1m−1 min−1RCC1-12a(AdoMet) = 100 μm.3.1 ± 0.30.57 ± 0.011.8×1054.9 ± 0.70.78 ± 0.031.6×105AdoMetb(RCC1-12) = 40 μm.11.7 ± 1.30.57 ± 0.024.9×1048.0 ± 1.60.23 ± 0.012.9×104a (AdoMet) = 100 μm.b (RCC1-12) = 40 μm. Open table in a new tab A series of peptides based on the N terminus of RCC1 were prepared with different lengths and N-terminal methylation states. We determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for methylation of these peptide substrates via fluorescence assay. The resulting rate constants are compiled in Table 2. Kinetic studies on peptides with different lengths (6–12-mer) gave Km values from 0.89 to 4.9 μm and kcat values from 0.44 to 0.59 min−1. The kcat/Km values ranged from 1.4 × 105 to 4.9 × 105 m−1 min−1. The Km values for the unmethylated and monomethylated substrates are very similar (0.89 and 1.4 μm, respectively). The Km value for the dimethylated substrate (4.3 μm) is about 5-fold higher than unmethylated substrate. The kcat/Km value for the dimethylated substrate is about 3–4-fold lower than unmethylated and monomethylated peptide substrates.TABLE 2Effect of C-terminal truncations and N-terminal modifications of NTMT1 recognitionPeptide IDSequenceKmkcatkcat/Kmμmmin−1m−1 min−1RCC1-6SPKRIA3.2 ± 0.40.56 ± 0.021.8×105RCC1-9SPKRIAKRR1.4 ± 0.10.53 ± 0.013.8×105RCC1-10SPKRIAKRRS0.89 ± 0.090.44 ± 0.014.9×105MeRCC1-10Me-SPKRIAKRRS1.4 ± 0.10.58 ± 0.014.1×105Me2RCC1-10Me2-SPKRIAKRRS4.3 ± 0.50.59 ± 0.021.4×105 Open table in a new tab We applied a MALDI-MS assay to understand the progression of methylation for RCC1-10 and Me-RCC1-10. To determine whether ionization efficiency was a factor, we analyzed a sample mixture containing variable amounts of peptides with differing methylation states (RCC1-10, Me-RCC1-10, Me2-RCC1-10, and Me3-RCC1-10) via MALDI-MS. The relative fraction of each peptide was calculated from the areas of all of the relevant peaks for each component. Results showed acceptable levels of precision and accuracy (less than 5% error), indicating that N-terminal methylation does not significantly affect the efficiency of ionization. As shown in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, we monitored product formation over 2 h. For both RCC1-10 and Me-RCC1-10 substrates, the concentrations of each of the intermediates (Me-RCC1-10 and Me2-RCC1-10, respectively) increased to ∼50% of the sample throughout the progression. The overall peptide concentration was 10 μm, so the intermediate concentrations peaked at ∼5 μm. Because the enzyme concentration was only 0.2 μm, the intermediates must be released and accumulated throughout the progress of the reaction, which is indicative of a distributive mechanism.

However, it has been rarely used in the marine realm, where the adequate design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is urgently needed. Here, we examined the interacting processes underlying the patterns of genetic structure and demographic strucuture of a highly vulnerable Mediterranean habitat-forming species (i.e. Paramuricea clavata (Risso, 1826)), with particular emphasis on the processes of contemporary dispersal, genetic drift, and colonization of a new population. Isolation by distance and genetic discontinuities were found, and three genetic clusters were detected; each submitted to variations in the relative impact of drift and gene flow. No founder effect was found in the new population. The interplay of ecology and evolution revealed that drift is strongly impacting the smallest, most isolated populations, where partial mortality of individuals was highest. Moreover, the eco-evolutionary analyses entailed important conservation implications for P. clavata. Our study supports the inclusion of habitat-forming organisms in the design of MPAs and highlights the need to account for genetic drift in the development of MPAs. Moreover, it reinforces the importance of integrating genetic and demographic data in marine conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2043816982,"With hundreds of chromatin regulators identified in mammals, an emerging issue is how they modulate biological and pathological processes. BRPF1 (bromodomain- and PHD finger-containing protein 1) is a unique chromatin regulator possessing two PHD fingers, one bromodomain and a PWWP domain for recognizing multiple histone modifications. In addition, it binds to the acetyltransferases MOZ, MORF, and HBO1 (also known as KAT6A, KAT6B, and KAT7, respectively) to promote complex formation, restrict substrate specificity, and enhance enzymatic activity. We have recently showed that ablation of the mouse Brpf1 gene causes embryonic lethality at E9.5. Here we present systematic analyses of the mutant animals and demonstrate that the ablation leads to vascular defects in the placenta, yolk sac, and embryo proper, as well as abnormal neural tube closure. At the cellular level, Brpf1 loss inhibits proliferation of embryonic fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. Molecularly, the loss reduces transcription of a ribosomal protein L10 (Rpl10)-like gene and the cell cycle inhibitor p27, and increases expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p16 and a novel protein homologous to Scp3, a synaptonemal complex protein critical for chromosome association and embryo survival. These results uncover a crucial role of Brpf1 in controlling mouse embryo development and regulating cellular and gene expression programs."
https://openalex.org/W1963948079,"The chemokine receptor CCR7 is widely implicated in breast cancer pathobiology. Although recent reports correlated high CCR7 levels with more advanced tumor grade and poor prognosis, limited in vivo data are available regarding its specific function in mammary gland neoplasia and the underlying mechanisms involved. To address these questions we generated a bigenic mouse model of breast cancer combined with CCR7 deletion, which revealed that CCR7 ablation results in a considerable delay in tumor onset as well as significantly reduced tumor burden. Importantly, CCR7 was found to exert its function by regulating mammary cancer stem-like cells in both murine and human tumors. In vivo experiments showed that loss of CCR7 activity either through deletion or pharmacological antagonism significantly decreased functional pools of stem-like cells in mouse primary mammary tumors, providing a mechanistic explanation for the tumor-promoting role of this chemokine receptor. These data characterize the oncogenic properties of CCR7 in mammary epithelial neoplasia and point to a new route for therapeutic intervention to target evasive cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979497016,"The phospho-binding protein 14-3-3ζ acts as a signaling hub controlling a network of interacting partners and oncogenic pathways. We show here that lysines within the 14-3-3ζ binding pocket and protein-protein interface can be modified by acetylation. The positive charge on two of these lysines, Lys49 and Lys120, is critical for coordinating 14-3-3ζ-phosphoprotein interactions. Through screening, we identified HDAC6 as the Lys49/Lys120 deacetylase. Inhibition of HDAC6 blocks 14-3-3ζ interactions with two well described interacting partners, Bad and AS160, which triggers their dephosphorylation at Ser112 and Thr642, respectively. Expression of an acetylation-refractory K49R/K120R mutant of 14-3-3ζ rescues both the HDAC6 inhibitor-induced loss of interaction and Ser112/Thr642 phosphorylation. Furthermore, expression of the K49R/K120R mutant of 14-3-3ζ inhibits the cytotoxicity of HDAC6 inhibition. These data demonstrate a novel role for HDAC6 in controlling 14-3-3ζ binding activity."

https://openalex.org/W4234126893,"Purpose Although cerebral perfusion alterations have long been acknowledged in multiple sclerosis (MS), the relationship between measurable perfusion changes and the status of highly active MS has not been examined. We hypothesized that alteration of perfusion can be detected in normal appearing white matter and is increased in high inflammatory patients. Materials and Methods Thirty-three patients with relapsing-remitting MS underwent four monthly 3T MRI scans including dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted MRI. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) were measured in normal appearing white matter. Patients were stratified in a high- and low-inflammatory group according to the number of new contrast enhancing lesions. Results Thirteen patients were classified as high-inflammatory. Compared to low-inflammatory patients, the high-inflammatory group demonstrated significantly higher CBV (p = 0.001) and CBF (p = 0.014) values. A mixed model analysis to assess independent variables associated with CBV and CBF revealed that white matter lesion load and atrophy measurements had no significant influence on CBF and CBV. Conclusion This work provides evidence that high inflammatory lesion load is associated with increased CBV and CBF, underlining the role of global modified microcirculation prior to leakage of the blood-brain barrier in the pathophysiology of MS. Perfusion changes might therefore be sensitive to active inflammation apart from lesion development without local blood–brain barrier breakdown, and could be utilized to further assess the metabolic aspect of current inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2040389973,"The processes associated with transition to castration-resistant prostate cancer (PC) growth are not well understood. Cellular senescence is a stable cell cycle arrest that occurs in response to sublethal stress. It is often overcome in malignant transformation to confer a survival advantage. CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP) β function is frequently deregulated in human malignancies and interestingly, androgen-sensitive PC cells express primarily the liver-enriched inhibitory protein isoform. We found that C/EBPβ expression is negatively regulated by androgen receptor (AR) activity and that treatment of androgen-sensitive cell lines with anti-androgens increases C/EBPβ mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, we also find that C/EBPβ levels are significantly elevated in primary PC samples from castration-resistant compared with therapy-naive patients. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated enhanced binding of the AR to the proximal promoter of the CEBPB gene in the presence of dihydroxytestosterone. Upon androgen deprivation, induction of C/EBPβ is facilitated by active transcription as evident by increased histone 3 acetylation at the C/EBPβ promoter. Also, the androgen agonist R1881 suppresses the activity of a CEBPB promoter reporter. Loss of C/EBPβ expression prevents growth arrest following androgen deprivation or anti-androgen challenge. Accordingly, suppression of C/EBPβ under low androgen conditions results in reduced expression of senescence-associated secretory genes, significantly decreased number of cells displaying heterochromatin foci and increased numbers of Ki67-positive cells. Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ caused pronounced morphological changes, reduced PC cell growth and increased the number of senescent LNCaP cells. Lastly, we found that senescence contributes to PC cell survival under androgen deprivation, and C/EBPβ-deficient cells were significantly more susceptible to killing by cytotoxic chemotherapy following androgen deprivation. Our data demonstrate that upregulation of C/EBPβ is critical for complete maintenance of androgen deprivation-induced senescence and that targeting C/EBPβ expression may synergize with anti-androgen or chemotherapy in eradicating PC."
https://openalex.org/W2086540224,"DEP-1/PTPRJ is a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase mainly known for its antiproliferative and tumor-suppressive functions. Many identified substrates are growth factor receptors, and DEP-1 is deleted and/or mutated in human cancers including that of the breast. However, DEP-1 was also identified as a promoter of Src activation and proinvasive functions in the endothelium, suggesting it could perhaps mediate breast cancer invasiveness that is likewise driven by Src family kinases. We show here that DEP-1 expression was greater in highly invasive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT-549) than in the less invasive or untransformed cell lines tested (MCF-7, T47D, SK-BR3 and MCF10A). DEP-1 silencing experiments in invasive cells demonstrated that moderately expressed and catalytically active DEP-1 was required, in collaboration with basal epidermal growth factor receptor activity, for Src activation and the phosphorylation of its substrate Cortactin, and for their colocalization at the cell’s leading edge. This correlated with an increased number of cell protrusions, and an enhanced capacity of the cells to migrate and invade. Similarly, moderate overexpression of DEP-1 in the low-invasive cells resulted in the promotion of their invasiveness in an Src-dependent manner. Consistent with these data, the expression of endogenous DEP-1 was elevated in a bone metastatic cell line derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, and promoted increased Src Y418 and Cortactin Y421 phosphorylation, as well as pro-MMP9 secretion and Matrigel invasion. Importantly, the silencing of DEP-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells greatly decreased their ability to metastasize, despite having no effect on tumor growth or angiogenesis. Hence, we found that moderate expression of DEP-1 was associated with the increased relapse and decreased survival of breast cancer patients. These results therefore identify a new and unsuspected role for DEP-1 as a mediator of an invasive cell program implicating Src activation and the promotion of breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2093067665,"Hepatoma exhibits a series of heterogeneous subpopulations in its cell surface markers, tumorigenicity, invasion and metastatic capability. We previously demonstrated that the CD133−/EpCAM− hepatoma subpopulation was more metastatic than its counterpart; however, the controlling mechanisms are unexplored. The present study aimed to delineate the significance of aberrant hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the mediation of metastases. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-enriched CD133−/EpCAM− (double negative, DN), Huh-7 cells underwent a transwell selection for metastatic cells (transwell-selected, TS). The TS cells displayed much greater metastatic activity as evidenced by an increased invasion rate, extremely upregulated expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1/2/9 genes compared with DN and double-positive (DP) subpopulations. In contrast to DP cells, TS cells lost E-cadherin and were all vimentin-positive as shown by immunocytochemistry. There was a transitional increase in Gli-1/2 gene expression levels from DP, DN to TS subpopulations, which was consistent with elevated Gli-1/2 or Twist-1 protein levels in the nuclear fraction. Furthermore, truncated Gli-1 (tGli-1), which transactivates molecules involved in metastasis, was detected in the highly invasive Huh-7 cell subpopulation, but not in less metastatic hepatoma cells or normal hepatocytes. The enhanced metastatic features with increased expression of MMPs as well as the presence of twist and snail genes in TS Huh-7 cells were reversed by LDE225, a potent Smoothened antagonist. In conclusion, the highly metastatic capability of a unique TS subpopulation was highly attributed to significant epithelial–mesenchymal transition, enhanced Hh activity and aberrant occurrence of a tGli-1 variant, which appears to be responsible for the highly invasive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2168035287,"A recent study showed that adaptation to causal events (collisions) in adults caused subsequent events to be less likely perceived as causal. In this study, we examined if a similar negative adaptation effect for perceptual causality occurs in children, both typically developing and with autism. Previous studies have reported diminished adaptation for face identity, facial configuration and gaze direction in children with autism. To test whether diminished adaptive coding extends beyond high-level social stimuli (such as faces) and could be a general property of autistic perception, we developed a child-friendly paradigm for adaptation of perceptual causality. We compared the performance of 22 children with autism with 22 typically developing children, individually matched on age and ability (IQ scores). We found significant and equally robust adaptation aftereffects for perceptual causality in both groups. There were also no differences between the two groups in their attention, as revealed by reaction times and accuracy in a change-detection task. These findings suggest that adaptation to perceptual causality in autism is largely similar to typical development and, further, that diminished adaptive coding might not be a general characteristic of autism at low levels of the perceptual hierarchy, constraining existing theories of adaptation in autism."

Src-family tyrosine kinase A-kinase anchoring protein 8 KRAB-associated protein 1 nuclear localization signal tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate propidium iodide kinase-dead. Despite the importance of non-receptor-type tyrosine kinases in signal transduction, most studies have focused on their roles as cytoplasmic signaling molecules (7Hubbard S.R. Till J.H.

To investigate the role of nuclear tyrosine kinases in chromatin structural changes, we developed a quantitative pixel imaging method with DNA staining of the nucleus (1Takahashi A. Obata Y.

Using the pixel imaging method, we have demonstrated that nucleus-localized SFKs and c-Abl induce chromatin structural changes (1Takahashi A. Obata Y. Fukumoto Y. Nakayama Y. Kasahara K. Kuga T.

Cell Res. 2011; 317: 2874-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently identified KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1/TIF1β/TRIM28), which is a component of heterochromatin, as a nuclear substrate of nuclear tyrosine kinases (14Kubota S. Fukumoto Y. Aoyama K. Ishibashi K. Yuki R. Morinaga T. Honda T. Yamaguchi N. Kuga T. Tomonaga T. Yamaguchi N.

Nuclear tyrosine kinases were found to regulate the function of heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α), which has important roles in heterochromatin formation, through tyrosine phosphorylation of KAP1 (14Kubota S.

However, the relationship between nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation and chromatin structural changes has not been fully understood. To further understand the roles for nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation, we recently performed phosphoproteomic analysis of nuclear proteins in HeLa S3 cells expressing nucleus-targeted Lyn or c-Abl (nuclear localization signal (NLS)-fused Lyn and c-Abl). As a result, we identified various nuclear tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including protein kinase A-anchoring protein 8 (AKAP8/AKAP95). AKAP8 is a member of the large family of protein kinase A-anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which have a common function in binding to protein kinase A (23Wong W. Scott J.D. AKAP signalling complexes: focal points in space and time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). AKAP8 was previously shown to be associated with nuclear structures, such as chromatin and the nuclear matrix (24Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M.

However, it is unclear whether the function of AKAP8 is regulated through a posttranslational modification. In this study we examined the roles of tyrosine phosphorylation of AKAP8 in nuclear tyrosine kinase-mediated chromatin structural changes. We showed that AKAP8 is one of the substrates for nuclear tyrosine kinases, and tyrosine phosphorylation of AKAP8 at multiple tyrosine residues inhibits its association with nuclear structures.

https://openalex.org/W2054497677,"Cytosolic Ca2+, closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+, plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the role of ER lumen proteins in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ level remains poorly understood. Here, we find that the Cab45S, localizes in the ER lumen, inhibits sarco/ER Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) activity through its first EF-hand domain directly binding to the intra-lumenal loop 4 of SERCA2b, and reduces ER Ca2+. STIM1 activation, induced by the Cab45S-dependent drop in ER Ca2+, together with the upregulation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ channel TRPC1 ultimately increases extracellular Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, increased cytosolic Ca2+ level elicits Ca2+-NFAT signaling and promotes cell proliferation. Consistently, in cervical carcinoma patients, Cab45S is upregulated. Thus, our data reveal that the ability of Cab45S to inhibit SERCA2b activity is crucial for its role as a modulator of cell proliferation and tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1992591788,"Anthrax is an important zoonotic disease worldwide that is caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming pathogenic bacterium. A rapid and sensitive method to detect B. anthracis is important for anthrax risk management and control in animal cases to address public health issues. However, it has recently become difficult to identify B. anthracis by using previously reported molecular-based methods because of the emergence of B. cereus, which causes severe extra-intestinal infection, as well as the human pathogenic B. thuringiensis, both of which are genetically related to B. anthracis. The close genetic relation of chromosomal backgrounds has led to complexity of molecular-based diagnosis. In this study, we established a B. anthracis multiplex PCR that can screen for the presence of B. anthracis virulent plasmids and differentiate B. anthracis and its genetically related strains from other B. cereus group species. Six sets of primers targeting a chromosome of B. anthracis and B. anthracis-like strains, two virulent plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, a bacterial gene, 16S rRNA gene, and a mammalian gene, actin-beta gene, were designed. The multiplex PCR detected approximately 3.0 CFU of B. anthracis DNA per PCR reaction and was sensitive to B. anthracis. The internal control primers also detected all bacterial and mammalian DNAs examined, indicating the practical applicability of this assay as it enables monitoring of appropriate amplification. The assay was also applied for detection of clinical strains genetically related to B. anthracis, which were B. cereus strains isolated from outbreaks of hospital infections in Japan, and field strains isolated in Zambia, and the assay differentiated B. anthracis and its genetically related strains from other B. cereus group strains. Taken together, the results indicate that the newly developed multiplex PCR is a sensitive and practical method for detecting B. anthracis."
https://openalex.org/W2006495215,"Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-1 (NCX1) is a major calcium extrusion mechanism in renal epithelial cells enabling the efflux of one Ca2+ ion and the influx of three Na+ ions. The gradient for this exchange activity is provided by Na,K-ATPase, a hetero-oligomer consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and a regulatory β-subunit (Na,K-β) that also functions as a motility and tumor suppressor. We showed earlier that mice with heart-specific ablation (KO) of Na,K-β had a specific reduction in NCX1 protein and were ouabain-insensitive. Here, we demonstrate that Na,K-β associates with NCX1 and regulates its localization to the cell surface. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with Na,K-β knockdown have reduced NCX1 protein and function accompanied by 2.1-fold increase in free intracellular calcium and a corresponding increase in the rate of cell migration. Increased intracellular calcium up-regulated ERK1/2 via calmodulin-dependent activation of PI3K. Both myosin light chain kinase and Rho-associated kinase acted as mediators of ERK1/2-dependent migration. Restoring NCX1 expression in β-KD cells reduced migration rate and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that NCX1 functions downstream of Na,K-β in regulating cell migration. In parallel, inhibition of NCX1 by KB-R7943 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, LLC-PK1, and human primary renal epithelial cells (HREpiC) increased ERK1/2 activation and cell migration. This increased migration was associated with high myosin light chain phosphorylation by PI3K/ERK-dependent mechanism in HREpiC cells. These data confirm the role of NCX1 activity in regulating renal epithelial cell migration.

Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with Na,K-β knockdown have reduced NCX1 protein and function accompanied by 2.1-fold increase in free intracellular calcium and a corresponding increase in the rate of cell migration. Increased intracellular calcium up-regulated ERK1/2 via calmodulin-dependent activation of PI3K. Both myosin light chain kinase and Rho-associated kinase acted as mediators of ERK1/2-dependent migration. Restoring NCX1 expression in β-KD cells reduced migration rate and ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that NCX1 functions downstream of Na,K-β in regulating cell migration. In parallel, inhibition of NCX1 by KB-R7943 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, LLC-PK1, and human primary renal epithelial cells (HREpiC) increased ERK1/2 activation and cell migration. This increased migration was associated with high myosin light chain phosphorylation by PI3K/ERK-dependent mechanism in HREpiC cells. These data confirm the role of NCX1 activity in regulating renal epithelial cell migration. Enhanced cell migration is a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Calcium-dependent signaling is essential for directional movement, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, and cleaving of cell-cell and cell-substrate attachments in the regulation of cell migration (1Monteith G.R.

Thus, alteration in intracellular calcium levels can contribute to cell migration and invasion. Regulation of intracellular Ca2+ involves a balance between Ca2+ influx and efflux, which is governed by membrane-associated ion channels, ATPases, exchangers, and binding proteins. Indeed, modulation of specific calcium channels or pumps is associated with certain cancers. For example, transient receptor potential channel 8 (TRPM8) up-regulation in prostate cancer (4Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Trp-p8, a novel prostate-specific gene, is up-regulated in prostate cancer and other malignancies and shares high homology with transient receptor potential calcium channel proteins.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase 3 (SERCA3) 2The abbreviations used are:SERCAsarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPaseNCX1sodium-calcium exchanger 1Na,K-αNa,K-ATPase α-subunitNa,K-βNa,K-ATPase β-subunitMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyPMCAplasma membrane calcium ATPaseβ-KDβ knockdownβ-KD/Rβ-KD cells rescued by overexpression of shRNA resistant Na,K-βHREpiChuman primary renal epithelial cellsECISelectrical cell-substrate impedance sensingMLCmyosin light chain. down-regulation in colon cancer (5Brouland J.P.

In renal epithelial cells, the sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA), and SERCA ATPases are the major regulators of intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration, with NCX1 being the protein responsible for Ca2+ extrusion (6Goldhaber J.I.

Pharmacol. 1997; 74: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The two other isoforms NCX2 and NCX3 are not expressed in the kidney (8Lytton J. Na+/Ca2+ exchangers: three mammalian gene families control Ca2+ transport.Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). NCX1 consists of a 9 α-helical transmembrane domain and a large (550 residue) cytosolic domain that has two Ca2+ binding sites that mediate the extrusion of a Ca2+ and the influx of 3 Na+ in one exchange movement in the forward mode (9Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Ca2+ regulation in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger involves two markedly different Ca2+ sensors.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). NCX1 has also been shown to function in reverse mode, i.e. the exchanger can cause an influx of the Ca2+ ions into the cells depending on intracellular Na+, Ca2+, pH, ATP, and membrane potential (10Reeves J.P. Na+/Ca2+ exchange and cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although there is no direct evidence linking NCX1 to cancer, there are isolated studies indicating that NCX1 is involved in cell adhesion. For example, cell adhesion in prostate epithelial cells induced by stromal cell co-culture caused an up-regulation of NCX1 transcript level among other genes involved in cell adhesion (11Chambers K.F. Pearson J.F. Pellacani D. Aziz N. Gužvić M. Klein C.A. Lang S.H. Stromal upregulation of lateral epithelial adhesions: gene expression analysis of signalling pathways in prostate epithelium.J. Biomed. Sci. 2011; 18: 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of NCX1 activity by KB-R7943 down-regulated cell adhesion molecule ICAM1 and suppressed cell adhesion (12Li J. Jin H.B. Sun Y.M. Su Y. Wang L.F. KB-R7943 inhibits high glucose-induced endothelial ICAM-1 expression and monocyte-endothelial adhesion.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 392: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). NCX1 works in close partnership with Na,K-ATPase, by utilizing the sodium gradient generated by Na,K-ATPase to drive calcium efflux. Na,K-ATPase has also been shown to function as a motility and tumor suppressor (13Barwe S.P. Anilkumar G. Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Whitelegge J.P. Rajasekaran S.A. Rajasekaran A.K.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2796-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, we previously reported that knockdown of Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit (Na,K-β) in MDCK cells led to mesenchymal phenotype accompanied by increased cell proliferation via activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathways (18Barwe S.P. Skay A. McSpadden R. Huynh T.P. Langhans S.A. Inge L.J. Rajasekaran A.K. Na,K-ATPase β-subunit cis homo-oligomerization is necessary for epithelial lumen formation in mammalian cells.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5711-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that MDCK cells with Na,K-β knockdown (β-KD) showed reduced NCX1 protein expression leading to an increase in intracellular calcium. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Na,K-β interacts with NCX1 and regulates NCX1 membrane localization. The activation of ERK1/2 and enhanced cell migration in β-KD cells was calcium-dependent and could be reversed when NCX1 was overexpressed in β-KD cells. Increased intracellular calcium activated calmodulin/PI3K/ERK signaling leading to myosin light chain kinase/Rho-associated protein kinase-dependent migration. Furthermore, inhibition of NCX1 in MDCK, LLC-PK1, and human primary renal epithelial cells (HREpiC) also led to activation of ERK1/2 and enhanced cell migration. Thus, our data reveal a novel role of forward mode NCX1 in regulation of cell migration in renal epithelial cells. DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 25 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin was used to grow MDCK and LLC-PK1 cells. Similarly, MDCK-Na,K-β1-KD and rescue cells (β-KD/R) as described in Barwe et al. (18Barwe S.P. Skay A. McSpadden R. Huynh T.P. Langhans S.A. Inge L.J. Rajasekaran A.K.

The cells that survived the selection media were confirmed to express the transfected constructs and were utilized for the experiments. HREpiC purchased from ScienCell™ (Carlsbad, CA) were maintained as per the supplier's recommendations and treated with inhibitors as indicated. Monoclonal Na,K-β1 (M17-P5-F11) antibody from ThermoFisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA) and monoclonal NCX1 antibody from Abcam® (Cambridge, MA) were used. Antibodies against PMCA4 and SERCA2 were purchased from BIOSS antibodies (Woburn, MA). Antibodies against phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2), total p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), total Akt, phospho p70S6 kinase (Thr-389), phospho MLC2 (Ser-19), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse and rabbit IgG were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology® (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. KB-R7943, PD98059, U0126, and LY294002 were purchased from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN). MK-2206 and Y27632 were from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). W-13, KN-93, and ML-7 were from Cayman (Ann Harbor, MI). Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mg/ml anti-papain, leupeptin, and pepstatin. For detection of NCX1 protein, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer supplemented with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Based on protein estimation, 50 or 100 μg of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The immunoblots were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Primary antibodies were diluted either in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or nonfat dried milk in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBST. Immunoblots were developed with chemiluminescent lightning system ECL or ECL Prime (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. TINA 2.0 software (Open Source Image Analysis Environment) was utilized for immunoblot quantification and image analysis. Cell lysate corresponding to 1 mg of protein was precleared with Protein A Mag-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated overnight with control IgG, Na,K-β, or NCX1 antibodies pre-coupled to Mag beads for 4 h. The beads were washed and separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins bound to the beads were immunoblotted as described above. For resolution of Na,K-β protein (55 kDa) from heavy chain IgG band (50 kDa), immunoprecipitates were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA) as described previously (13Barwe S.P. Anilkumar G. Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Whitelegge J.P. Rajasekaran S.A. Rajasekaran A.K. Novel role for Na,K-ATPase in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling and suppression of cell motility.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1082-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The deglycosylated Na,K-β (32 kDa) appears as a single band. Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (16Barwe S.P. Kim S. Rajasekaran S.A. Bowie J.U. Rajasekaran A.K. Janus model of the Na,K-ATPase β-subunit transmembrane domain: distinct faces mediate α/β assembly and β-β homo-oligomerization.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sub-confluent monolayer of cells was labeled with 0.5 μg/ml membrane-impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, Pierce in TEA buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 9, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) on ice and quenched with buffer containing 50 mm NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 and lysed in 1000 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The lysate was incubated with 30 μl of Ultralink streptavidin beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for NCX1 and Na,K-β. RNA was extracted by TRIzol, and cDNA was generated by iScript™ cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a 384-well plate on a 7900HT Fast Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The following primers were used: Na,K-β (forward, TTACCCTTACTACGGCAAGCTCCT; reverse, TTCAGTGTCCATGGTGAGGTTGGT); NCX1 (forward, TTAGCCGTTGTGGCTCTCTT; reverse, TGTAGACCATGGCCACAAAA); GAPDH (forward, GCTGTCCAACCACATCTCCTC; reverse, TGGGGCCGAAGATCCTGTT). RNA levels were calculated by relative quantification (RQ) normalized to the endogenous control GAPDH. Samples were assayed in triplicate. Cells (200,000) were grown on 60-mm dishes for 24 h in complete DMEM. Cells were incubated in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM containing 1% FBS 2 h before pulsing with 0.5 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed on ice in a lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with protein A-agarose beads coated 1 μg/ml NCX1 antibody. Beads were washed and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography using Typhoon Trio-phosphorimager (GE® Healthcare). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and fixed with either ice-cold methanol (−20 °C) or 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBS with 100 μm calcium chloride and 1 mm magnesium chloride followed by Alexa-488™-, Alexa-546™-, or Alexa-633™-conjugated secondary antibodies and TO-PRO®-3-Iodide (Life Technologies) for nuclear staining. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with ProLong gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies). The images were captured using Leica TCS SP5 Confocal Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Cells (200,000) were seeded in a 6-well tissue culture plate 24 h before a wound was made by scratching across the bottom of the well with a pipette tip. Wounded cell monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the detached cells. Culture dishes were returned to the incubator for recovery of the wound in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors or reagents in serum-free media for 16 h. The scratches were photographed using an inverted microscope under the same configuration at the start and end of the experiment. The images were used to calculate the distance migrated by the cell sheet. The rate at which the wound was closed was calculated using the formula, speed = distance/time. ECIS Model 1600R, Applied BioPhysics (Troy, NY) was utilized. 1 × 105 cells in 200 μl of media were plated on ECIS electrode arrays (8W1E), each array containing 8 individual wells, with an active gold electrode in the base, and allowed to incubate overnight. Cell impedance and resistance levels were continuously measured. The resistance gained steadily and plateaued when cell confluence was attained. At this point, the electrodes were supplied an AC signal of 1 μA, between a small measuring electrode (250-μm diameter) and a large counter electrode, resulting in a sharp drop in resistance. As the cells re-grew and spread on the small electrode, the resistance increased proportionally to the distance migrated by the cells. The rate of migration was calculated as a ratio of the area covered (49,062.5 μm2) in a given period of time (number of hours taken for the resistance to reach the plateau). Cells (5 × 105) were plated in a 6-well dish for 48 h. On the day of the experiment cells were detached without the use of trypsin using 1× Hanks' buffer saline solution + 0.5 m EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 3 min, and resuspended in complete medium. 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer without calcium containing 0.5 μm Fluo4-AM in pluronic acid (both from Life Technologies) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Tyrode's buffer containing calcium was added to the cell suspension to make the final calcium concentration 0.5 mm before data acquisition using flow cytometer, BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored for 8–10 min. 100 μm ouabain was added to the cells 2 min after start, and changes in intracellular calcium were calculated as described previously (20Khan A. Li D. Ibrahim S. Smyth E. Woulfe D.S. The physical association of the P2Y12 receptor with PAR4 regulates arrestin-mediated Akt activation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2014; 86: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells (10,000) were plated on glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and cultured until confluent. Cell cultures were then incubated with fluorescent calcium indicator, FURA-2, AM (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 10 μm in a Pluronic acid/DMSO mixture in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min protected from light. The MatTek plates were washed twice with HBSS containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4. Cells were allowed to recover after loading in Hanks' buffer saline solution for 10 min before imaging. A xenon lamp equipped with quartz collector lenses was used to excite the cells, and the cells were imaged with a Nikon inverted microscope (Intracellular Imaging, Cincinnati, OH). The fluorescence intensity was measured continuously for 5 min to obtain baseline calcium values. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity emitted at 510 nm after excitation at 340 nm over excitation at 380 nm was used to calculate -fold change in intracellular calcium concentrations as described previously (21Li W. Duncan R.L. Karin N.J. Farach-Carson M.C. 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances PTH-induced Ca2+ transients in preosteoblasts by activating L-type Ca2+ channels.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E599-E605PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were incubated with 10 μm Fluo-4 AM in a Pluronic acid/DMSO mixture for 20 min at 37 °C. The plates were washed twice with Hanks' buffer saline solution with or without 2 mm CaCl2. After recovery for 15 min, the fluorescence intensity corresponding to cytosolic calcium was continuously measured by an LSM 710 confocal microscope system (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The amplitude of the response was calculated by subtracting basal fluorescence obtained during the initial 2 min from the maximum intensity of fluorescence after adding the 10 μm KB-R7943. Paired t test was used to evaluate the differences between average of two groups using data from at least three independent experiments, and a p of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MDCK cells with stable knockdown of Na,K-β using the RNA interference technique (β-KD) and with specific rescue of Na,K-β (β-KD/R), generated by introducing silent mutations within the shRNA recognition site in the Na,K-β cDNA, have been described previously (18Barwe S.P. Skay A. McSpadden R. Huynh T.P. Langhans S.A. Inge L.J. Rajasekaran A.K. Na,K-ATPase β-subunit cis homo-oligomerization is necessary for epithelial lumen formation in mammalian cells.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5711-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis confirmed 80% reduction in Na,K-β protein level in β-KD cells. These cells also showed 42% reduction in NCX1 protein level compared with MDCK cells when normalized to β-actin used as a loading control (Fig. 1A). β-KD/R cells with renewed Na,K-β expression had restored NCX1 protein, highlighting the specificity of Na,K-β in the regulation of NCX1. The reduction in NCX1 protein in β-KD cells was consistent with the reduction of NCX1 in β-KO hearts as we reported previously (22Barwe S.P. Jordan M.C. Skay A. Inge L. Rajasekaran S.A. Wolle D. Johnson C.L. Neco P. Fang K. Rozengurt N. Goldhaber J.I. Roos K.P. Rajasekaran A.K. Dysfunction of ouabain-induced cardiac contractility in mice with heart-specific ablation of Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Changes in the protein levels of other Ca2+ transport proteins such as PMCA and SERCA were not observed in β-KO hearts (22Barwe S.P. Jordan M.C. Skay A. Inge L. Rajasekaran S.A. Wolle D. Johnson C.L. Neco P. Fang K. Rozengurt N. Goldhaber J.I. Roos K.P. Rajasekaran A.K. Dysfunction of ouabain-induced cardiac contractility in mice with heart-specific ablation of Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 47: 552-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, PMCA and SERCA protein levels in β-KD cells were comparable to parental MDCK cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that Na,K-β specifically regulates NCX1 protein. To determine whether Na,K-β alters NCX1 transcription, the mRNA level of NCX1 in β-KD cells was quantified. Compared with MDCK, β-KD cells did not show a significant change in NCX1 mRNA (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Na,K-β-mediated NCX1 regulation is post-transcriptional. It has been reported previously that Na,K-β regulates the rate of protein synthesis of its binding partner Na,K-α (23Rajasekaran S.A. Gopal J. Willis D. Espineda C. Twiss J.L. Rajasekaran A.K. Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit increases the translation efficiency of the α1-subunit in MSV-MDCK cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested NCX1 protein synthesis rate in β-KD cells by performing 35S metabolic labeling. The newly synthesized NCX1 protein detected by fluorography was comparable in MDCK, β-KD, and β-KD/R cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that Na,K-β does not alter the rate of synthesis of NCX1. Next, we determined the membrane localization of NCX1 using cell surface biotinylation assay. Na,K-β on the cell surface was reduced by 85% in β-KD cells. The NCX1 level on the cell membrane was drastically diminished (by 89%) (Fig. 2A), although the NCX1 total protein level was reduced only by 42% (Fig. 1A). NCX1 membrane expression was restored in β-KD/R cells, highlighting the specificity of Na,K-β in targeting NCX1 to the membrane. The cell surface level of occludin, a well known tight junction protein, remained the same and was used as a control for successful biotinylation and equal loading. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that NCX1 staining was diminished in β-KD cells. Moreover, whereas NCX1 was localized to the membrane in MDCK and β-KD/R cells, such localization was not prominent in β-KD cells (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence analysis also showed that Na,K-β and NCX1 co-localize on the cell surface in MDCK and β-KD/R cells. To test the possibility that Na,K-β interacts with NCX1, a co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed. Na,K-β was captured by anti-NCX1 immunoprecipitation, and NCX1 was detected in Na,K-β antibody immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C), indicating that Na,K-β associates with NCX1. NCX1 activity is required for ouabain-induced increase in intracellular calcium (24Blaustein M.P. Physiological effects of endogenous ouabain: control of intracellular Ca2+ stores and cell responsiveness.Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1367-C1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of ouabain on intracellular calcium was tested to determine whether NCX1 function is altered in β-KD cells. Treatment of MDCK and β-KD/R cells with 100 μm ouabain elicited an immediate increase in intracellular calcium shown by the spike in fluorescence intensity above the threshold, i.e. the percentage of response to ouabain treatment above the baseline calcium level (Fig. 3A). However, the percentage of response to ouabain treatment was 50% lower in β-KD cells compared with MDCK cells, suggesting that β-KD cells have reduced NCX1 activity, consistent with reduced NCX1 protein. NCX1 is the major Ca2+ extrusion mechanism in kidney. To test whether reduced NCX1 affects calcium concentration in β-KD cells, the baseline intracellular free calcium levels were measured by Fura-2AM ratiometric imaging. The baseline intracellular calcium was 2.1-fold higher in β-KD cells compared with MDCK cells (Fig. 3B). The baseline calcium level in β-KD/R cells was similar to MDCK cells. Thus, the baseline intracellular calcium levels were inversely proportional to NCX1 protein levels.

https://openalex.org/W2020585063,"Insulin is one of the most studied proteins since it is central to the regulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism in vertebrates and its expression and release are disturbed in diabetes, the most frequent human metabolic disease worldwide. However, the evolution of the function of the insulin protein family is still unclear. In this study, we present a phylogenetic and developmental analysis of the Insulin Like Peptide (ILP) in the cephalochordate amphioxus. We identified an ILP in the European amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum that displays structural characteristics of both vertebrate insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGFs). Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that amphioxus ILP represents the sister group of both vertebrate insulin and IGF proteins. We also characterized both temporal and spatial expression of ILP in amphioxus. We show that ilp is highly expressed in endoderm and paraxial mesoderm during development, and mainly expressed in the gut of both the developing embryo and adult. We hypothesize that ILP has critical implications in both developmental processes and metabolism and could display IGF- and insulin-like functions in amphioxus supporting the idea of a common ancestral protein."
https://openalex.org/W2047428222,"Although modulation of the cellular tumor-suppressor p53 is considered to have the major role in E1A/E1B-55K-mediated tumorigenesis, other promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML-NB)/PML oncogenic domain (POD)-associated factors including SUMO, Mre11, Daxx, as well as the integrity of these nuclear bodies contribute to the transformation process. However, the biochemical consequences and oncogenic alterations of PML-associated E1B-55K by SUMO-dependent PML-IV and PML-V interaction have so far remained elusive. We performed mutational analysis to define a PML interaction motif within the E1B-55K polypeptide. Our results showed that E1B-55K/PML binding is not required for p53, Mre11 and Daxx interaction. We also observed that E1B-55K lacking subnuclear PML localization because of either PML-IV or PML-V-binding deficiency was no longer capable of mediating E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53, inhibition of p53-mediated transactivation or efficiently transforming primary rodent cells. These results together with the observation that E1B-55K-dependent SUMOylation of p53 is required for efficient cell transformation, provides evidence for the idea that the SUMO ligase activity of the E1B-55K viral oncoprotein is intimately linked to its growth-promoting oncogenic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2071376683,"TFAP2C/AP-2γ influences development of the mammary gland and regulates patterns of gene expression in luminal and HER2-amplified breast cancer. The roles of TFAP2C in mammary gland tumorigenesis and in pathways critical to cancer progression remain poorly understood. To gain greater insight into oncogenic mechanisms regulated by TFAP2C, we examined mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-Neu transgenic female mice with or without conditional knockout (KO) of Tcfap2c, the mouse homolog of TFAP2C. Loss of Tcfap2c increased the latency of tumorigenesis and tumors that formed demonstrated reduced proliferative index and increased apoptosis. In addition, tumors formed in Tcfap2c KO animals had a significant reduction in Egfr levels without a change in the expression of the Neu oncogene. The MMneu-flAP2C cell line was established from tumor tissue derived from MMTV-Neu/Tcfap2c(L/L) control animals and parallel cell lines with and without expression of Tcfap2c were created by transduction with adenovirus-empty and adenovirus-Cre, respectively. KO of Tcfap2c in vitro reduced activated phosphorylated-Erk, decreased cell viability, repressed tumor growth and was associated with attenuation of Egfr expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and direct sequencing and expression analysis confirmed that Egfr was a Tcfap2c target gene in murine, as well as human, mammary carcinoma cells. Furthermore, decreased viability of mammary cancer cells was directly related to Egfr functional blockade. We conclude that TFAP2C regulates tumorigenesis, cell growth and survival in HER2-amplified breast cancer through transcriptional regulation of EGFR. The findings have important implications for targeting the EGFR pathway in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2058716443,"Objective To investigate the incidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in pregnant women and in the subpopulation of pregnant women with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia compared to that in the age-matched general female population to determine if there is increased risk of RVO in pregnancy. Design Nationwide population-based retrospective study using data entered into the Korean national health claims database from 2007 to 2011. Setting and Participants Of the incident RVO cases in the database, RVO cases that occurred during the pregnancy-associated period, which spanned a 52-week period from 40-weeks-before to 12-weeks-after childbirth, were identified. Of these cases, the presence of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was determined. Main Outcome and Measure The standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of RVO in the general pregnant population and in the pregnant population with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia were determined with respect to the age-matched general female population. Results Pregnancy-related RVO was identified in 33 cases from the 1.8 million women who experience childbirth during the study period, while the expected number of cases calculated by the direct standardization to the age-matched general population was 113. Of the 33 patients, 12 patients (36.4%) had pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. The SIR for the general pregnant population in reference to the age-matched general female population was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.20–0.41). In contrast, the SIR for the pregnant population with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in reference to the age-matched general female population and the age-matched general pregnant population was 67.50 (95% CI, 34.88–117.92) and 246.50 (95% CI, 127.37–430.59), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance The results suggest that pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is a risk factor for RVO, while pregnancy itself may not be a risk factor for RVO."
https://openalex.org/W2312567930,"Post-translational modifications of core histones play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin dynamics and gene expression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae methylation marks at K4, K36, and K79 of histone H3 are associated with gene transcription. Although Set2-mediated H3K36 methylation is enriched throughout the coding region of active genes and prevents aberrant transcriptional initiation within coding sequences, it is not known if transcription of one locus impacts the methylation pattern of neighbouring areas and for how long H3K36 methylation is maintained after transcription termination. Our results demonstrate that H3K36 methylation is restricted to the transcribed sequence only and the modification does not spread to adjacent loci downstream from transcription termination site. We also show that H3K36 trimethylation mark persists in the locus for at least 60 minutes after transcription inhibition, suggesting a short epigenetic memory for recently occurred transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that both replication-dependent exchange of nucleosomes and the activity of histone demethylases Rph1, Jhd1 and Gis1 contribute to the turnover of H3K36 methylation upon shut-down of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2083383210,"Introduction A growing body of literature reveals the causal pathways between physical activity and brain function, indicating that increasing physical activity among children could improve rather than undermine their scholastic performance. However, past studies of physical activity and scholastic performance among students often relied on parent-reported grade information, and did not explore whether the association varied among different levels of scholastic performance. Our study among fifth-grade students in Shanghai sought to determine the association between regular physical activity and teacher-reported academic performance scores (APS), with special attention to the differential associational patterns across different strata of scholastic performance. Method A total of 2,225 students were chosen through a stratified random sampling, and a complete sample of 1470 observations were used for analysis. We used a quantile regression analysis to explore whether the association between physical activity and teacher-reported APS differs by distribution of APS. Results Minimal-intensity physical activity such as walking was positively associated with academic performance scores (β = 0.13, SE = 0.04). The magnitude of the association tends to be larger at the lower end of the APS distribution (β = 0.24, SE = 0.08) than in the higher end of the distribution (β = 0.00, SE = 0.07). Conclusion Based upon teacher-reported student academic performance, there is no evidence that spending time on frequent physical activity would undermine student’s APS. Those students who are below the average in their academic performance could be worse off in academic performance if they give up minimal-intensity physical activity. Therefore, cutting physical activity time in schools could hurt the scholastic performance among those students who were already at higher risk for dropping out due to inadequate APS."
https://openalex.org/W2002505064,"Variability is an inherent and important feature of human movement. This variability has form exhibiting a chaotic structure. Visual feedback training using regular predictive visual target motions does not take into account this essential characteristic of the human movement, and may result in task specific learning and loss of visuo-motor adaptability. In this study, we asked how well healthy young adults can track visual target cues of varying degree of complexity during whole-body swaying in the Anterior-Posterior (AP) and Medio-Lateral (ML) direction. Participants were asked to track three visual target motions: a complex (Lorenz attractor), a noise (brown) and a periodic (sine) moving target while receiving online visual feedback about their performance. Postural sway, gaze and target motion were synchronously recorded and the degree of force-target and gaze-target coupling was quantified using spectral coherence and Cross-Approximate entropy. Analysis revealed that both force-target and gaze-target coupling was sensitive to the complexity of the visual stimuli motions. Postural sway showed a higher degree of coherence with the Lorenz attractor than the brown noise or sinusoidal stimulus motion. Similarly, gaze was more synchronous with the Lorenz attractor than the brown noise and sinusoidal stimulus motion. These results were similar regardless of whether tracking was performed in the AP or ML direction. Based on the theoretical model of optimal movement variability tracking of a complex signal may provide a better stimulus to improve visuo-motor adaptation and learning in postural control."
https://openalex.org/W1979441947,"The present study investigates the role of small G-proteins of the Ras family in the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-activated cellular signalling pathway that downregulates activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). We found that H-Ras is a key component of this EGF-activated cellular signalling mechanism in M1 mouse collecting duct cells. Expression of a constitutively active H-Ras mutant inhibited the amiloride-sensitive current. The H-Ras-mediated signalling pathway that inhibits activity of ENaC involves c-Raf, and that the inhibitory effect of H-Ras on ENaC is abolished by the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059. The inhibitory effect of H-Ras is not mediated by Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin protein ligase that regulates the abundance of ENaC at the cell surface membrane, or by a negative effect of H-Ras on proteolytic activation of the channel. The inhibitory effects of EGF and H-Ras on ENaC, however, were not observed in cells in which expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) had been knocked down by siRNA. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of EGF on ENaC-dependent Na+ absorption is mediated via the H-Ras/c-Raf, MEK/ERK signalling pathway, and that Cav-1 is an essential component of this EGF-activated signalling mechanism. Taken together with reports that mice expressing a constitutive mutant of H-Ras develop renal cysts, our findings suggest that H-Ras may play a key role in the regulation of renal ion transport and renal development."
https://openalex.org/W2024951844,"The phenotype of many regulatory circuits in which mutations can cause complex, polygenic diseases is to some extent robust to DNA mutations that affect circuit components. Here I demonstrate how such mutational robustness can prevent the discovery of genetic disease determinants. To make my case, I use a mathematical model of the insulin signaling pathway implicated in type 2 diabetes, whose signaling output is governed by 15 genetically determined parameters. Using multiple complementary measures of a parameter's importance for this phenotype, I show that any one disease determinant that is crucial in one genetic background will be virtually irrelevant in other backgrounds. In an evolving population that drifts through the parameter space of this or other robust circuits through DNA mutations, the genetic changes that can cause disease will vary randomly over time. I call this phenomenon causal drift. It means that mutations causing disease in one (human or non-human) population may have no effect in another population, and vice versa. Causal drift casts doubt on our ability to infer the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases from non-human model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2030069429,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the major cause of adult nephrotic syndrome, which severely affects patients’ quality of life. Currently, percutaneous renal biopsy is required to definitively diagnose MN. However, this technique is invasive and may cause severe complications. Therefore, an urgent clinical need exists for dynamic noninvasive monitoring of the renal state. In-depth molecular imaging studies could assist in finding a solution. Membrane attack complex C5b-9 is the key factor in the development of MN, and this protein primarily deposits in the glomerulus. The present study bound polyclonal antibodies to C5b-9 with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles to obtain C5b-9-targeted magnetic resonance molecular imaging probes. The probes were injected intravenously into rats with Heymann nephritis, a classic disease model of MN. The signal intensity in the T2*-weighted imaging of kidneys in vivo using 7.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging decreased significantly 24 hours after injection compared to the untargeted and control groups. This signal change was consistent with the finding of nanoparticle deposits in pathological glomeruli. This study demonstrated a novel molecular imaging technique for the assessment of MN."
