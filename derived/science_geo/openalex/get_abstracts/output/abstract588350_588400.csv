https://openalex.org/W2624508213,"In bone regenerative medicine there is a need for suitable bone substitutes. Hydrogels have excellent biocompatible and biodegradable characteristics, but their visco-elastic properties limit their applicability, especially with respect to 3D bioprinting. In this study, we modified the naturally occurring extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA), in order to yield photo-crosslinkable hydrogels with increased mechanical stiffness and long-term stability, and with minimal decrease in cytocompatibility. Application of these tailor-made methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) gels for bone tissue engineering and 3D bioprinting was the subject of investigation. Visco-elastic properties of MeHA gels, measured by rheology and dynamic mechanical analysis, showed that irradiation of the hydrogels with UV light led to increased storage moduli and elastic moduli, indicating increasing gel rigidity. Subsequently, human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were incorporated into MeHA hydrogels, and cell viability remained 64.4% after 21 days of culture. Osteogenic differentiation of MSCs occurred spontaneously in hydrogels with high concentrations of MeHA polymer, in absence of additional osteogenic stimuli. Addition of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) to the culture medium further increased osteogenic differentiation, as evidenced by increased matrix mineralisation. MeHA hydrogels demonstrated to be suitable for 3D bioprinting, and were printed into porous and anatomically shaped scaffolds. Taken together, photosensitive MeHA-based hydrogels fulfilled our criteria for cellular bioprinted bone constructs within a narrow window of concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2621369616,"The giant planet KELT-9b has a dayside temperature of about 4,600 K, which is sufficiently high to dissociate molecules and to evaporate its atmosphere, owing to its hot stellar host. Hot Jupiters are exoplanets that are physically similar to Jupiter, but are strongly irradiated by their host stars. Until now, the most extreme example was WASP-33b, but its atmosphere is still cool enough to contain molecules. Scott Gaudi et al. report the discovery of KELT-9b, which has a dayside temperature of about 4,600 kelvin. This is sufficiently high to dissociate molecules, so the primary sources of opacity in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b are probably atomic metals. The atmosphere might be evaporated before the host star reaches the end of its life. The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of extrasolar planets now known, only six have been found that transit hot, A-type stars (with temperatures of 7,300–10,000 kelvin), and no planets are known to transit the even hotter B-type stars. For example, WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature of about 7,430 kelvin, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet, WASP-33b (ref. 1); the planet is itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M (ref. 2). WASP-33b displays a large heat differential between its dayside and nightside2, and is highly inflated–traits that have been linked to high insolation3,4. However, even at the temperature of its dayside, its atmosphere probably resembles the molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets and, given the level of ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be substantially ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report observations of the bright star HD 195689 (also known as KELT-9), which reveal a close-in (orbital period of about 1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At approximately 10,170 kelvin, the host star is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the dayside temperature of KELT-9b to be about 4,600 kelvin. This is as hot as stars of stellar type K4 (ref. 5). The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and so the primary sources of opacity in the dayside atmosphere of KELT-9b are probably atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives 700 times more extreme-ultraviolet radiation (that is, with wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometres) than WASP-33b, leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host star6."

https://openalex.org/W2624174818,"Circulating oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers change after regular physical exercise; however, how a short session of acute physical activity affects the inflammatory status and redox balance in sedentary individuals is still unclear. Aim of this study is to assess antioxidant and inflammatory parameters, both at rest and after acute exercise, in sedentary young men with or without obesity. Thirty sedentary male volunteers, aged 20–45 (mean age 32 ± 7 years), were recruited, divided into 3 groups (normal weight: BMI < 25 kg/m2; overweight to moderate obesity: 25–35 kg/m2; severe obesity: 35–40 kg/m2), and their blood samples collected before and after a 20-min run at ~ 70% of their VO2max for the measurement of Glutathione Reductase, Glutathione Peroxidase, Superoxide Dismutase, Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, MCP-1, VEGF, IFNγ, EGF). Inter-group comparisons demonstrated significantly higher Glutathione Reductase activity in severely obese subjects in the post-exercise period (P = 0.036), and higher EGF levels in normal weight individuals, either before (P = 0.003) and after exercise (P = 0.05). Intra-group comparisons showed that the acute exercise stress induced a significant increase in Glutathione Reductase activity in severely obese subjects only (P = 0.007), a significant decrease in MCP-1 in the normal weight group (P = 0.02), and a decrease in EGF levels in all groups (normal weight: P = 0.025, overweight/moderate obesity: P = 0.04, severe obesity: P = 0.018). Altogether, these findings suggest that in sedentary individuals with different ranges of BMI, Glutathione Reductase and distinct cytokines are differentially involved into the adaptive metabolic changes and redox responses induced by physical exercise. Therefore, these biomarkers may have the potential to identify individuals at higher risk for developing diseases pathophysiologically linked to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2623343525,"N-Acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) regulates protein O-GlcNAcylation, an essential and dynamic post-translational modification. The O-GlcNAc modification is present on numerous nuclear and cytosolic proteins and has been implicated in essential cellular functions such as signaling and gene expression. Accordingly, altered levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation have been associated with developmental defects and neurodegeneration. However, mutations in the OGT gene have not yet been functionally confirmed in humans. Here, we report on two hemizygous mutations in OGT in individuals with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and dysmorphic features: one missense mutation (p.Arg284Pro) and one mutation leading to a splicing defect (c.463–6T>G). Both mutations reside in the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT that are essential for substrate recognition. We observed slightly reduced levels of OGT protein and reduced levels of its opposing enzyme O-GlcNAcase in both patient-derived fibroblasts, but global O-GlcNAc levels appeared to be unaffected. Our data suggest that mutant cells attempt to maintain global O-GlcNAcylation by down-regulating O-GlcNAcase expression. We also found that the c.463–6T>G mutation leads to aberrant mRNA splicing, but no stable truncated protein was detected in the corresponding patient-derived fibroblasts. Recombinant OGT bearing the p.Arg284Pro mutation was prone to unfolding and exhibited reduced glycosylation activity against a complex array of glycosylation substrates and proteolytic processing of the transcription factor host cell factor 1, which is also encoded by an XLID-associated gene. We conclude that defects in O-GlcNAc homeostasis and host cell factor 1 proteolysis may play roles in mediation of XLID in individuals with OGT mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2623723222,"Gold nanoparticles are predominantly used in diagnostics, therapeutics and biomedical applications. The present study has been designed to synthesize differently capped gold nanoparticles (AuNps) by a simple, one-step, room temperature procedure and to evaluate the potential of these AuNps for biomedical applications. The AuNps are capped with glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and citrate using different reducing agents. This is the first report of synthesis of 2DG-AuNp by the simple room temperature method. The synthesized gold nanoparticles are characterized with UV-Visible Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED), Dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) study of the synthesized AuNps shows increase in Raman signals up to 50 times using 2DG. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay has been performed using all the three differently capped AuNps in different cell lines to assess cytotoxcity if any, of the nanoparticles. The study shows that 2DG-AuNps is a better candidate for theranostic application."
https://openalex.org/W2621875245,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine factor that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. Circulating FGF21 predicts cardiovascular events and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus, including early-stage chronic kidney disease, but its impact on clinical outcomes in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients remains unclear. This study enrolled 90 ESRD patients receiving chronic hemodialysis who were categorized into low- and high-FGF21 groups by the median value. We investigated the association between circulating FGF21 levels and the cardiovascular event and mortality during a median follow-up period of 64 months. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-FGF21 group than in the low-FGF21 group (28.3% vs. 9.1%, log-rank, P = 0.034), while the rate of cardiovascular events did not significantly differ between the two groups (30.4% vs. 22.7%, log-rank, P = 0.312). In multivariable Cox models adjusted a high FGF21 level was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 3.98; 95% confidence interval: 1.39–14.27, P = 0.009). Higher circulating FGF21 levels were associated with a high mortality rate, but not cardiovascular events in patient with ESRD, suggesting that circulating FGF21 levels serve as a predictive marker for mortality in these subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2623680887,"Mutations in LRRK2 play a critical role in both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD). Up to date, the role of LRRK2 in PD onset and progression remains largely unknown. However, experimental evidence highlights a critical role of LRRK2 in the control of vesicle trafficking that in turn may regulate different aspects of neuronal physiology. We have analyzed the role of LRRK2 in regulating dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) and D2 (DRD2) trafficking. DRD1 and DRD2 are the most abundant dopamine receptors in the brain. They differ in structural, pharmacological and biochemical properties, as well as in localization and internalization mechanisms. Our results indicate that disease-associated mutant G2019S LRRK2 impairs DRD1 internalization, leading to an alteration in signal transduction. Moreover, the mutant forms of LRRK2 affect receptor turnover by decreasing the rate of DRD2 trafficking from the Golgi complex to the cell membrane. Collectively, our findings are consistent with the conclusion that LRRK2 influences the motility of neuronal vesicles and the neuronal receptor trafficking. These findings have important implications for the complex role that LRRK2 plays in neuronal physiology and the possible pathological mechanisms that may lead to neuronal death in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2624535578,"Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) have the highest prevalence in women of reproductive age. The role of estrogen in TMDs and especially in TMDs related pain is not fully elucidated. Voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Nav1.7) plays a prominent role in pain perception and Nav1.7 in trigeminal ganglion (TG) is involved in the hyperalgesia of inflamed Temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Whether estrogen could upregulate trigeminal ganglionic Nav1.7 expression to enhance hyperalgesia of inflamed TMJ remains to be explored. Methods Estrous cycle and plasma levels of 17β-estradiol in female rats were evaluated with vaginal smear and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Female rats were ovariectomized and treated with 17β-estradiol at 0 μg, 20 μg and 80 μg, respectively, for 10 days. TMJ inflammation was induced using complete Freund’s adjuvant. Head withdrawal thresholds and food intake were measured to evaluate the TMJ nociceptive responses. The expression of Nav1.7 in TG was examined using real-time PCR and western blot. The activity of Nav1.7 promoter was examined using luciferase reporter assay. The locations of estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), the G protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30), and Nav1.7 in TG were examined using immunohistofluorescence. Results Upregulation of Nav1.7 in TG and decrease in head withdrawal threshold were observed with the highest plasma 17β-estradiol in the proestrus of female rats. Ovariectomized rats treated with 80 μg 17β-estradiol showed upregulation of Nav1.7 in TG and decrease in head withdrawal threshold as compared with that of the control or ovariectomized rats treated with 0 μg or 20 μg. Moreover, 17β-estradiol dose-dependently potentiated TMJ inflammation-induced upregulation of Nav1.7 in TG and also enhanced TMJ inflammation-induced decrease of head withdrawal threshold in ovariectomized rats. In addition, the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, partially blocked the 17β-estradiol effect on Nav1.7 expression and head withdrawal threshold in ovariectomized rats. ERα and ERβ, but not GPR30, were mostly co-localized with Nav1.7 in neurons in TG. In the nerve growth factor-induced and ERα-transfected PC12 cells, 17β-estradiol dose-dependently enhanced Nav1.7 promoter activity, whereas mutations of the estrogen response element at -1269/-1282 and -1214/-1227 in the promoter completely abolished its effect on the promoter activity. Conclusion Estradiol could upregulate trigeminal ganglionic Nav1.7 expression to contribute to hyperalgesia of inflamed TMJ."
https://openalex.org/W2623286853,"Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that sense pathogen-associated and danger-associated molecular patterns and induce inflammation in cells. The NALP3 inflammasome is tightly regulated by recently discovered control mechanisms, but other modulators still remain to be characterized. NLR family CARD-containing 3 (NLRC3) protein, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)–containing member of the nucleotide oligomerization domain–like receptor (NLR) family, was found to down-regulate the NF-κB pathway and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–dependent cytokine secretion. However, the effect of NLRC3 on the NALP3 inflammasome or other inflammasomes is still unknown. We hypothesized that NLRC3 might inhibit NALP3 inflammasome complex assembly. Toward this end, we tested whether NLRC3 overexpression or knockdown influences NALP3 activity in human monocyte and HEK293FT cells when the complex is ectopically reconstituted. We found that NLRC3 indeed decreases NALP3-induced IL-1β maturation and secretion, pro-caspase-1 cleavage, and speck formation by apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) protein in response to NALP3 activators. We also show that endogenous NLRC3 interacts with both ASC and pro-caspase-1 but not with NALP3, disrupts ASC speck formation through its CARD, and impairs the ASC and pro-caspase-1 interaction. Moreover, the NLRC3 CARD alone could dampen IL-1β secretion and ASC speck formation induced by NALP3 mutants associated with autoinflammatory diseases. In conclusion, we show here that, besides its role in the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, NLRC3 interferes with the assembly and activity of the NALP3 inflammasome complex by competing with ASC for pro-caspase-1 binding.

https://openalex.org/W2624457998,"Elephant crop raiding is one of the most relevant forms of human-elephant conflict (HEC) in Africa. Northern Botswana holds the largest population of African elephants in the world, and in the eastern Okavango Panhandle, 16,000 people share and compete for resources with more than 11,000 elephants. Hence, it is not surprising this area represents a HEC 'hotspot' in the region. Crop-raiding impacts lead to negative perceptions of elephants by local communities, which can strongly undermine conservation efforts. Therefore, assessing trends in conflict levels is essential to developing successful management strategies. In this context, we investigated the trend in the number of reported raiding incidents as one of the indicators of the level of HEC, and assessed its relationship to trends in human and elephant population size, as well as land-use in the study area. For each of these factors, we considered data spanning historical (since the 1970s) and contemporary (2008-2015) time frames, with the aim of comparing subsequent inferences on the drivers of crop raiding and predictions for the future. We find that the level of reported crop raiding by elephants in the eastern Panhandle appears to have decreased since 2008, which seems to be related to the reduction in agricultural land allocated to people in recent years, more than with human and elephant population size. We show that inferences regarding the drivers of HEC and predictions for the future are dependent on the time span of the data used. Although our study represents a first step in developing a HEC baseline in the eastern Panhandle, it highlights the need for additional multi-scale analyses that consider progress in conservation conflict to better understand and predict drivers of HEC in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2623643441,"The current study aimed to explore cultural and social network influence on HIV vulnerability among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) population in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A qualitative inquiry employing in-depth one-on-one interviews was carried out with 24 MSM participants in July 2015. Data were analysed using a framework analysis and guided by the Social Networks Theory (SNT) as a conceptual framework. Findings indicated that prohibitive cultural perspectives and norms against same-sex marriage made them to conceal their sexual orientation and thus secretively engaging in unprotected sex that increased their predisposition to HIV transmission. The prohibitive cultures were also instrumental in the formation of MSM sexual networks that provided supportive environment for HIV-risky sexual practices among network partners. These findings provide information that can be used to improve HIV/AIDS service practices and policies. However, further studies with large numbers of MSM would be needed to improve the understanding of other HIV vulnerability determinants, the unique needs of MSM, and what and how programs could be conducted to reduce HIV vulnerability among MSM population."
https://openalex.org/W2624486984,"The cuprizone animal model, also known as the toxic demyelination model, is a well-reproducible model of demyelination- and remyelination in mice, and has been useful in studying important aspect of human demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis. In this study, we investigated the role of acid sphingomyelinase in demyelination and myelin repair by inducing acute and chronic demyelination with 5- or 12-week cuprizone treatment, followed by a 2-week cuprizone withdrawal phase to allow myelin repair. Sphingolipids, in particular ceramide and the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, which generates ceramide from sphingomyelin, seem to be involved in astrocyte activation and neuronal damage in multiple sclerosis. We used immunohistochemistry to study glial reaction and oligodendrocyte distribution in acid sphingomyelinase deficient mice and wild-type C57BL/6J littermates at various time intervals after demyelination and remyelination. Axonal injury was quantified using amyloid precursor protein and synaptophysin, and gene expression and protein levels were measured using gene analysis and Western blotting, respectively. Our results show that mice lacking acid sphingomyelinase had a significant increase in myelin recovery and a significantly higher oligodendrocyte cell count after 2 weeks remyelination compared to wild-type littermates. Detrimental astroglial distribution was also significantly reduced in acid sphingomyelinase deficient animals. We obtained similar results in experiments using amitriptyline to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase. These findings suggest that acid sphingomyelinase plays a significant role in myelin repair, and its inhibition by amitriptyline may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis patients."

Chem. 1989; 264: 19514-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), typically contains 75–100 residues, with 10 conserved cysteines. Two cysteine-containing motifs, CXXCXC and CCXXC, lie toward the middle and the C-terminal parts of the domain, respectively (17O'Leary J.M. Hamilton J.M. Deane C.M. Valeyev N.V. Sandell L.J.

X-ray crystallographic and NMR structures have revealed that vWC domains comprise an N-terminal region and two subdomains of SD1 and SD2 linked together by a disulfide bond (17O'Leary J.M.

The crystal structure of the first vWC domain of CV-2 (CV-2 vWC1) in complex with BMP-2 revealed one modality of the vWC/BMP-2 interaction (18Zhang J.L. Qiu L.Y. Kotzsch A. Weidauer S. Patterson L.

Cell. 2008; 14: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The CV-2 vWC1 binds to BMP-2 through two separate sites of interactions. First, there is high-affinity binding between its N-terminal clip and the type I receptor-binding site on BMP-2 via hydrogen bonds at a nanomolar affinity compatible with the type I receptor/BMP-2 interaction. As shown by its NMR structure in solution at unbound state, this BMP-2-compatible conformation of the N-terminal clip is preformed in the CV-2 vWC domain instead of being induced by complexation (23Fiebig J.E. Weidauer S.E. Qiu L.Y. Bauer M. Schmieder P. Beerbaum M. Zhang J.L. Oschkinat H. Sebald W. Mueller T.D. The clip-segment of the von Willebrand domain 1 of the BMP modulator protein crossveinless 2 is preformed.Molecules. 2013; 18: 11658-11682Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), suggesting that the N-terminal structure of a vWC domain could be indicative of its binding mechanism with BMPs. Second, there are hydrophobic interactions between its SD1 and the type II receptor-binding site on BMP-2 at a similarly low affinity. The SD2 of CV-2 vWC1 was shown to make no contact with BMP-2 (18Zhang J.L. Qiu L.Y. Kotzsch A. Weidauer S. Patterson L. Hammerschmidt M. Sebald W. Mueller T.D.

For other BMP-binding vWC domains in Chordin and CHL2, the BMP2-binding epitopes have also been pinned down in the SD1, although structural information of their N termini have hitherto been unavailable to compare their binding modes with that of CV-2 (22Fujisawa T.

CCN proteins are characterized by their conserved primary structure, comprised of four clearly distinguishable disulfide-rich domains (41Bork P. The modular architecture of a new family of growth regulators related to connective tissue growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The vWC domain is the second domain in the N-terminal half for CCN proteins after the insulin-like growth factor binding (IB) domain. These two domains are separated by a hinge region from the C-terminal half that contains thrombospondin module 1 (TSP-1) and C-terminal cysteine-knot (CTCK) domains (41Bork P. The modular architecture of a new family of growth regulators related to connective tissue growth factor.FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that CCN3 binds to BMP-2 (25Minamizato T. Sakamoto K. Liu T. Kokubo H. Katsube K. Perbal B. Nakamura S. Yamaguchi A. CCN3/NOV inhibits BMP-2-induced osteoblast differentiation by interacting with BMP and Notch signaling pathways.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and that it promotes the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, possibly through BMP (42Kawaki H. Kubota S. Suzuki A. Suzuki M. Kohsaka K. Hoshi K. Fujii T. Lazar N. Ohgawara T. Maeda T. Perbal B. Takano-Yamamoto T. Takigawa M. Differential roles of CCN family proteins during osteoblast differentiation: involvement of Smad and MAPK signaling pathways.Bone. 2011; 49: 975-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the exact site of interaction in CCN3 is yet to be identified. To understand the molecular mechanism of BMP-2 binding by Col2a and CCN3, we have determined crystal structures of vWC domains from both of these proteins and analyzed their interactions with BMP-2. We observe both common and unique features in the crystal structures of these two vWC domains when compared with the existing structure of CV-2 vWC1. Our biochemical analyses demonstrate that Col2a weakly binds to BMP-2 through a novel hydrophobic interaction on the opposite side of its SD1 as compared with CV-2 vWC1. However, despite its overall structural similarities to Col2a vWC, CCN3 vWC does not bind BMP-2. To begin to make comparisons among vWC domains, we determined the structures of the vWC domains from both Col2a and CCN3 by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of Col2a vWC was determined through sulfur single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing at a resolution of 1.74 Å (Table 1). As with other vWC domains, the domain has an elongated shape with N and C termini at the opposite ends. As expected, the conserved cysteines are all involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds, with the same connectivity as seen before: Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys8, Cys3-Cys5, Cys6-Cys9, Cys7-Cys10 (superscripted numbers refer to the sequential position of the cysteines in the vWC sequence; Fig. 1). The structure can be subdivided into three parts: an N-terminal β-hairpin region, a subdomain 1 (SD1), and a subdomain 2 (SD2; Fig. 1A). The N-terminal region comprises a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that resembles the fold of a β-hairpin, whereas SD1 consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with a disulfide (Cys3-Cys5) between the last two strands. The angle between the N-terminal β-hairpin and SD1 is stabilized by a π-stacking interaction formed by two aromatic residues, Tyr-41 and Trp-47 as well as a disulfide bond (Cys1-Cys4) between the first strand of the β-hairpin and the second strand of SD1. SD2 is devoid of regular secondary structure, although it is tethered by one disulfide bond within itself (Cys7-Cys10) and by two disulfides to SD1 (Cys2-Cys8 and Cys6-Cys9). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit align well for most of the structure, with an overall r.m.s.d. of 0.464 Å for 49 of 67 residues; the main differences are found in the first part of SD2 (amino acids (aa) 71–77, r.m.s.d. of 1.05 Å) and in the flexible loop at the C termini (aa 89–96, r.m.s.d. of 2.49 Å) (supplemental Fig. S1A).Table 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsCol2a vWCCol2a vWCCCN3 vWCCCN3 vWC V105M/R128MPDB code5NIRn/a5NB8n/aData collectionTemperature (K)100100100100BeamlineDLS I24DLS I02DLS I04–1ESRF BM14Wavelength (Å)0.96861.90000.91730.9793Space groupP212121P212121P1C2Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)31.9, 60.2, 86.430.1, 59.6, 86.638.4, 43.1, 72.3141.7, 43.4, 38.0α, β, γ (°)90.0, 90.0, 90.090.0, 90.0, 90.075.3, 2.0, 89.990.0, 98.0, 90.0Resolution (Å)49.37-1.7459.58-1.8428.58-2.1019.01-2.43(1.75-1.74)(1.85-1.84)(2.20-2.10)(2.59-2.43)Rmerge0.042 (0.709)0.053 (0.560)0.083 (0.596)0.068 (0.269)〈I〉/σ〈I〉22.7 (2.2)24.8 (2.2)10.94 (2.60)12.04 (4.35)Number of reflections11275014411913012565573CC½aCC½, Pearson correlation coefficient between random half-datasets.1.00 (0.898)0.999 (0.886)0.998 (0.864)0.997 (0.936)Unique reflections17667128292547516452Multiplicity6.4 (5.9)11.2 (6.7)5.1 (4.7)4.0 (4.0)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)90.8 (37.2)98.1 (95.3)97.2 (96.3)RefinementResolution (Å)49.37-1.74 (1.84-1.74)28.58-2.10 (2.18-2.10)No. reflections/free17616 / 89425446 / 1298Rwork/Rfree0.210 / 0.2310.189 / 0.216(0.222 / 0.257)(0.253 / 0.302)No. atomsProtein10102149Ligand/ion20731Water16155B-factors(Å2)Protein35.349.8Ligand/ion48.892.7Water47.250.5R.m.s.d.Bond lengths (Å)0.010.007Bond angles (°)1.180.872a CC½, Pearson correlation coefficient between random half-datasets.

The β-hairpin and SD1 agree very well between the different NMR models and the crystal structure, with r.m.s.d. of 0.9–1.3 Å. However, we see much poorer overall alignment (r.m.s.d. ∼3.5 Å) when comparing the entire structures or SD2 (supplemental Fig. S2). The disorder in SD2 observed in the NMR ensemble, particularly in the C-terminal tail after the last cysteine, suggests that our crystal structure captured one of many conformations possible for SD2 and that there is flexibility in both SD2 and in its relative orientation to SD1. Additionally, we observe a more extended third β-strand in SD1, a consequence of an extended β-sheet that is formed between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (supplemental Fig. S1B). Meanwhile, the structure of CCN3 vWC was solved using selenomethionine-labeled vWC, with mutations V105M/R128M to introduce methionines that are otherwise lacking in the domain. This experimentally derived mutant structure was then used to solve the structure of the wild-type vWC domain and that was refined to 2.1 Å resolution (Table 1). Similar to Col2a vWC, the CCN3 vWC comprises an N-terminal β-hairpin, an SD1 of three β-strands, and an SD2 of three β-strands (Fig. 1C), stabilized by five conserved disulfide bonds with the same connectivity. The angle between the β-hairpin and SD1 is also stabilized by a π-π interaction between two aromatic side chains, Tyr-111 and Phe-117, and a disulfide bond (Cys1-Cys4). Although SD2 of Col2a vWC is devoid of regular secondary structure, SD2 of CCN3 vWC consists of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. All four molecules in the asymmetric unit for CCN3 vWC are nearly identical, with r.m.s.d. of 0.121–0.338 Å (supplemental Fig. S3A). The structure of the V105M/R128M mutant domain aligns well with the wild-type vWC domain, whereas its packing in the crystal is very different, suggesting that the orientation between the SD1/SD2 subdomains in CCN3 is relatively stable (data not shown). As evolutionary conservation can reflect structural and/or functional importance of individual residues in a protein, we performed such analysis for the newly determined Col2a vWC and CCN3 vWC structures. Given the generally low conservation between different vWC domains and possibly different molecular functions this domain has in different proteins, analysis of sequences from a single species was not deemed to be fruitful. Instead, we used a large number of orthologue sequences across different species to make sure we analyzed conservation between functionally identical domains. We extracted the sequences from the Ensembl genome browser to ensure the widest possible coverage of eukaryotes and removed only the sequences with significant stretches of poorly defined segments. As expected, all 10 cysteines are fully conserved across species in Col2a vWC. The two aromatic residues"
https://openalex.org/W2622765713,"Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML, formerly LEOPARD syndrome) is an autosomal dominant ""RASopathy"" disorder manifesting in congenital heart disease. Most cases of NSML are caused by catalytically inactivating mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), encoding the SH2 domain-containing PTP-2 (SHP2) protein. We previously generated knock-in mice harboring the PTPN11 mutation Y279C, one of the most common NSML alleles; these now-termed SHP2Y279C/+ mice recapitulate the human disorder and develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) by 12 weeks of age. Functionally, heart and/or cardiomyocyte lysates from SHP2Y279C/+ mice exhibit increased basal and agonist-induced AKT and mTOR activities. Here, we sought to determine whether we could reverse the hypertrophy in SHP2Y279C/+ mice using ARQ 092, an oral and selective allosteric AKT inhibitor currently in clinical trials for patients with PI3K/AKT-driven tumors or Proteus syndrome. We obtained echocardiographs of SHP2Y279C/+ and wildtype (SHP2+/+) littermates, either in the presence or absence of ARQ 092 at 12, 14, and 16 weeks of age. While SHP2Y279C/+ mice developed significant left ventricular hypertrophy by 12 weeks, as indicated by decreased chamber dimension and increased posterior wall thickness, treatment of SHP2Y279C/+ mice with ARQ 092 normalized the hypertrophy in as early as 2 weeks following treatment, with hearts comparable in size to those in wildtype (SHP2+/+) mice. In addition, we observed an increase in fractional shortening (FS%) in SHP2Y279C/+ mice, an effect of increased compensatory hypertrophy, which was not apparent in SHP2Y279C/+ mice treated with ARQ 092, suggesting functional improvement of HCM upon treatment with the AKT inhibitor. Finally, we found that ARQ 092 specifically inhibited AKT activity, as well as its downstream effectors, PRAS and S6RP in NSML mice. Taken together, these data suggest ARQ 092 may be a promising novel therapy for treatment of hypertrophy in NSML patients."

An AD transgenic (Tg) pig model would be useful for preclinical testing of therapeutic agents. We generated an AD Tg pig by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) using a multi-cistronic vector that harbored three AD-related genes with a total of six well-characterized mutations: hAPP (K670N/M671L, I716V, and V717I), hTau (P301L), and hPS1 (M146V and L286P). Four AD Tg cell lines were established from Jeju black pig ear fibroblasts (JB-PEFs); the resultant JB-PEFAD cells harbored transgene integration, expressed transgene mRNAs, and had normal karyotypes. Tg line #2–1, which expressed high levels of the transgenes, was used for SCNT; cleavage and blastocyst rates of embryos derived from this line were lower than those of Non-Tg. These embryos yielded three piglets (Jeju National University AD-Tg pigs, JNUPIGs) revealed by microsatellite testing to be genetically identical to JB-PEFAD. Transgenes were expressed in multiple tissues, and at especially high levels in brain, and Aβ-40/42, total Tau, and GFAP levels were high in brains of the Tg animals. Five or more copies of transgenes were inserted into chromosome X. This is the first report of an AD Tg pig derived from a multi-cistronic vector."
https://openalex.org/W2621738285,"The human dopamine (DA) transporter (hDAT) is a key regulator of neurotransmission and a target for antidepressants and addictive drugs. Despite the recent resolution of dDAT structures from Drosophila melanogaster, complete understanding of its mechanism of function and even information on its biological assembly is lacking. The resolved dDAT structures are monomeric, but growing evidence suggests that hDAT might function as a multimer, and its oligomerization may be relevant to addictive drug effects. Here, using structure-based computations, we examined the possible mechanisms of hDAT dimerization and its dynamics in a lipid bilayer. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, DA-uptake, and cross-linking experiments that exploited the capacity of Cys-306 to form intermonomeric disulfide bridges in the presence of an oxidizing agent, we tested the effects of mutations at transmembrane segment (TM) 6 and 12 helices in HEK293 cells. The most probable structural model for hDAT dimer suggested by computations and experiments differed from the dimeric structure resolved for the bacterial homolog, LeuT, presumably because of a kink at TM12 preventing favorable monomer packing. Instead, TM2, TM6, and TM11 line the dimer interface. Molecular dynamics simulations of the dimeric hDAT indicated that the two subunits tend to undergo cooperative structural changes, both on local (extracellular gate opening/closure) and global (transition between outward-facing and inward-facing states) scales. These observations suggest that hDAT transport properties may be allosterically modulated under conditions promoting dimerization. Our study provides critical insights into approaches for examining the oligomerization of neurotransmitter transporters and sheds light on their drug modulation.

The process is assisted by co-transport of two sodium ions and the permeation of a chloride ion. The human DAT, hDAT, is a major target for therapeutic antidepressants and addictive drugs such as amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine (1Amara S.G. Sonders M.S.

DAT belongs to the SLC6A3 family of neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSSs). NSSs comprise structural and functional homologs such as norepinephrine transporter (NET), serotonin transporter (SERT), and GABA transporter (GAT). It is generally accepted that NSS members transport their substrate via the classic alternating access mechanism (4Jardetzky O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps.Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), i.e. the transporter alternates between outward-facing open (OFo) conformation for extracellular (EC) binding of DA and Na+/Cl− ions and inward-facing open (IFo) conformation for their intracellular (IC) release. The passage between these states takes place via intermediates occluded to both EC and IC regions either in substrate/Na+-loaded form or in the apo state after the release of the cargo. In addition, eukaryotic NSS members such as DAT and SERT allow for the efflux of their substrate to the cell exterior, which has been attributed to the modulating effects of addictive psychostimulants such as AMPH (5Sitte H.H.

Cooperativity between individual transporter protomers: new data fuelling old complexes.J. Neurochem. 2015; 133: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). NSS members generally share the topology of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT. The LeuT fold is composed of 12 transmembrane (TM) helices (TM1–TM12) organized in two pseudo-symmetric inverted repeats (7Forrest L.R. Structural biology: (pseudo-)symmetrical transport.Science. 2013; 339: 399-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). LeuT has long served as a prototype for understanding the mechanism of function of transporters that share its fold, as the first structurally characterized member of the LeuT fold family. The Gouaux laboratory has resolved the X-ray structures of LeuT in four different states: OFo, stabilized by inhibitors (8Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. A competitive inhibitor traps LeuT in an open-to-out conformation.Science. 2008; 322: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), substrate-free OFo (9Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E. X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.Nature. 2012; 481: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), substrate-bound OFc where the EC gate is closed (10Yamashita A.

Penmatsa A. Gouaux E. Neurotransmitter and psychostimulant recognition by the dopamine transporter.Nature. 2015; 521: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), have led the way to structure-based explorations of DAT mechanism of function (26Cheng M.H.

As such, it served as a reliable model for modeling its human counterpart. Using these structural data, we studied the mechanism of function of hDAT monomer (27Cheng M.H. Bahar I.

Our simulations revealed the structure of hDAT at various stages of the transport cycle, including DA-bound OFc state, which shows close resemblance to Leu-bound LeuT (10Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar), and the IFo state, leading to the release of DA and Na+ ions. The transport events revealed for hDAT monomer (27Cheng M.H. Bahar I. Molecular mechanism of dopamine transport by human dopamine transporter.Structure. 2015; 23: 2171-2181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed striking similarities to those disclosed in our recent investigation of LeuT transport cycle (16Cheng M.H.

Complete mapping of substrate translocation highlights the significance of LeuT N-terminal segment in regulating transport cycle.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10: e1003879Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yet there are notable differences in the sequence and structure of DAT and LeuT, which evidently underlie their specific functionalities. A prominent structural difference is the kink in the TM12 helix of dDAT (24Penmatsa A. Wang K.H. Gouaux E. X-ray structure of dopamine transporter elucidates antidepressant mechanism.Nature. 2013; 503: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) which is also retained in hDAT (Fig. 1). This kink occurs at the position of two serines (Ser-567–Ser-568 in hDAT) that are conserved among human monoamine transporters hDAT, hSERT, and hNET as well as inhibitory transporters like hGAT1 and glycine transporters (hGly1). The recently resolved crystal structure of hSERT in an antidepressant-bound OFo also shows a kink at TM12 (31Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). At present, there is no consensus on whether the preferred functional state of NSS members is monomeric or dimeric or even oligomeric. LeuT OFo and OFc crystal structures were resolved as dimers (8Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. A competitive inhibitor traps LeuT in an open-to-out conformation.Science. 2008; 322: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 9Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E.

Gouaux E. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Gouaux and co-workers (32Wang H. Elferich J. Gouaux E. Structures of LeuT in bicelles define conformation and substrate binding in a membrane-like context.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) studied LeuT crystal structures in a range of environments and reported that a common feature was the occurrence of a parallel LeuT dimer. Even though dDAT (24Penmatsa A. Wang K.H. Gouaux E.

X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) have been resolved as monomeric constructs, there is growing evidence in support of the formation of multimeric structures for monoamine transporters such as hDAT or SERT, indicated by radiation inactivation (33Berger S.P.

An early experimental study by Javitch and co-workers (34Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Symmetrical dimer of the human dopamine transporter revealed by cross-linking Cys-306 at the extracellular end of the sixth transmembrane segment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) found that the dimer interface of hDAT formed intermonomeric cross-links between the Cys-306 residues belonging to the TM6 of the two subunits. Torres et al. (35Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. Oligomerization and trafficking of the human dopamine transporter.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) proposed that the TM2 segment of hDAT was involved in dimerization. On the other hand, the dimer interface observed in prokaryotic LeuT is mainly formed by TM9 and TM12 (8Singh S.K. Piscitelli C.L. Yamashita A. Gouaux E. A competitive inhibitor traps LeuT in an open-to-out conformation.Science. 2008; 322: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 10Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). No rigorous computational study of potential dimerization interface has been performed after the elucidation of the monomeric DAT structure. Given the neurobiological significance of the transporter and the availability of structures, we are now in a good position to examine the possible dimerization geometry and/or the most favorable dimerization interface as well as their implication on DAT functional dynamics using a combination of computations and experiments. To this aim, we take advantage of the wealth of conformational data generated in our hDAT monomer simulations (26Cheng M.H. Block E. Hu F. Cobanoglu M.C. Sorkin A. Bahar I. Insights into the modulation of dopamine transporter function by amphetamine, orphenadrine, and cocaine binding.Front. Neurol. 2015; 6: 134Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Cheng M.H. Bahar I. Molecular mechanism of dopamine transport by human dopamine transporter.Structure. 2015; 23: 2171-2181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar): mainly, we will explore the dimerization propensities of hDAT in different states in the presence of the membrane remodeling effect. Strikingly, the most probable hDAT dimer model indicated by the present study differs from the LeuT dimeric structure with regard to its dimerization interface. Cys-306 residues are confirmed to form intermonomer cross-links in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline (CuP), in support of the computationally predicted dimerization interface, and in consistency with the observations made by Javitch and co-workers (34Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Symmetrical dimer of the human dopamine transporter revealed by cross-linking Cys-306 at the extracellular end of the sixth transmembrane segment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that residues in (spatial) proximity of Cys-306 are important for hDAT stabilization and dimer formation. Arg-304 and Glu-307 appear to be able to form intersubunit salt-bridges in our computed model. Substitutions at those sites (changes to alanine, R304A and E307A, or charge inversions, R304E and E307R) resulted in impairment of the formation of the CuP-induced dimer. Moreover, our study highlights the functional significance of the kink in the TM12 segment of hDAT. Substitution of helix-breaking residues (Gly-561, Ser-567, Ser-568, and Pro-573) at this kink by their (helix-favoring) orthologous counterparts in LeuT reduced the surface expression of DAT and altered its DA-reuptake. The importance of the TM12 residues revealed a new region relevant to function and/or expression. To assess the accuracy of ClusPro (45Comeau S.R. Gatchell D.W. Vajda S. Camacho C.J. ClusPro: an automated docking and discrimination method for the prediction of protein complexes.Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) for predicting the dimeric structure of a member of LeuT fold family, we first examined LeuT in different conformation states. LeuT dimer in the OFo state has been resolved by X-ray crystallography (9Krishnamurthy H. Gouaux E. X-ray structures of LeuT in substrate-free outward-open and apo inward-open states.Nature. 2012; 481: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). We took one monomer (subunit A) from the OFo LeuT dimer crystal structure (PDB code 3TT1) and then generated structural models for a dimer composed of these monomers using ClusPro. Among the 23 computationally predicted models for LeuT dimer, only one satisfied the four criteria of acceptance (see “Experimental Procedures”). Supplemental Fig. S1A compares this computationally predicted LeuT OFo dimer with that structurally resolved. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the computed structural model (yellow) and experimentally resolved structure (orange) is 1.39 Å, indicating that the model predicted for the LeuT dimer in OFo state yields satisfactory agreement with the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. The LeuT dimer in the IFo state has not yet been resolved. We generated a structural model for the IFo LeuT dimer using ClusPro, based on the resolved IFo LeuT monomer (PDB code 3TT3) using precisely the same protocol as adopted for OFo dimer (which will also be adopted for hDAT below). Interestingly, among a total of 27 LeuT IFo dimer models, again only one satisfied the four criteria set forth for selecting the optimal model. Supplemental Fig. S1B displays the structural alignment of the computationally predicted LeuT dimers in the OFo (yellow) and IFo (green) states. The r.m.s.d. between these two structural models is ∼6 Å. Similar protei"
https://openalex.org/W2621948834,"Nanoparticles can be used as carriers to transport biomolecules like proteins and synthetic molecules across the cell membrane because many molecules are not able to cross the cell membrane on their own. The uptake of nanoparticles together with their cargo typically occurs via endocytosis, raising concerns about the possible degradation of the cargo in the endolysosomal system. As the tracking of a dye-labelled protein during cellular uptake and processing is not indicative of the presence of the protein itself but only for the fluorescent label, a label-free tracking was performed with the red-fluorescing model protein R-phycoerythrin (R-PE). Four different eukaryotic cell lines were investigated: HeLa, HEK293T, MG-63, and MC3T3. Alone, the protein was not taken up by any cell line; only with the help of calcium phosphate nanoparticles, an efficient uptake occurred. After the uptake into HeLa cells, the protein was found in early endosomes (shown by the marker EEA1) and lysosomes (shown by the marker Lamp1). There, it was still intact and functional (i.e. properly folded) as its red fluorescence was detected. However, a few hours after the uptake, proteolysis started as indicated by the decreasing red fluorescence intensity in the case of HeLa and MC3T3 cells. 12 h after the uptake, the protein was almost completely degraded in HeLa cells and MC3T3 cells. In HEK293T cells and MG-63 cells, no degradation of the protein was observed. In the presence of Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of acidification and protein degradation in lysosomes, the fluorescence of R-PE remained intact over the whole observation period in the four cell lines. These results indicate that despite an efficient nanoparticle-mediated uptake of proteins by cells, a rapid endolysosomal degradation may prevent the desired (e.g. therapeutic) effect of a protein inside a cell."
https://openalex.org/W2622425362,"Background Given the scarcity of specialist mental healthcare in India, diverse community mental healthcare models have evolved. This study explores and compares Indian models of mental healthcare delivered by primary-level workers (PHW), and health workers’ roles within these. We aim to describe current service delivery to identify feasible and acceptable models with potential for scaling up. Methods Seventy two programmes (governmental and non-governmental) across 12 states were visited. 246 PHWs, coordinators, leaders, specialists and other staff were interviewed to understand the programme structure, the model of mental health delivery and health workers’ roles. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Results Programmes were categorised using an existing framework of collaborative and non-collaborative models of primary mental healthcare. A new model was identified: the specialist community model, whereby PHWs are trained within specialist programmes to provide community support and treatment for those with severe mental disorders. Most collaborative and specialist community models used lay health workers rather than doctors. Both these models used care managers. PHWs and care managers received support often through multiple specialist and non-specialist organisations from voluntary and government sectors. Many projects still use a simple yet ineffective model of training without supervision (training and identification/referral models). Discussion and conclusion Indian models differ significantly to those in high-income countries—there are less professional PHWs used across all models. There is also intensive specialist involvement particularly in the community outreach and collaborative care models. Excessive reliance on specialists inhibits their scalability, though they may be useful in targeted interventions for severe mental disorders. We propose a revised framework of models based on our findings. The current priorities are to evaluate the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and scalability of these models in resource-limited settings both in India and in other low- and middle- income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2624533018,"The question how intergroup bias can be alleviated is of much theoretical and practical interest. Whereas diversity training and the multiculturalism ideology are two approaches prominent in practice, most theoretical models on reducing intergroup bias are based on social-identity theory and self-categorization theory. This social-identity perspective assumes that similar processes lead to intergroup bias in very different intergroup contexts if people identify with the respective social groups. A recent prominent model based on these theories is the ingroup-projection model. As this model assumes, an ingroup’s norms and standards are applied to outgroups included in a common superordinate category (this is called ingroup projection). Intergroup bias results because the outgroup fulfils these norms and standards less than the ingroup. Importantly, if the diversity of the superordinate category is induced as the norm, ingroup projection and thus intergroup bias should be reduced. The present research delineates and tests how general this process is. We propose that ingroup prototypicality is not only an outcome variable, as the ingroup-projection model originally assumes, but can also be an important moderator. We hypothesize that for members considering their ingroup highly prototypical (“pars pro toto”, large majorities), the superordinate group’s diversity may question their ingroup’s position and thus elicit threat and intergroup bias. In contrast, for members who consider their group as less prototypical (one among several, or “una inter pares” groups), activating diversity should, as originally assumed in the ingroup-projection model, reduce intergroup bias. Three experiments (total N = 345) supported these predictions in the contexts of groups defined by gender or nationality. Taken together, the ingroup-projection model can explain under which conditions activating superordinate-category diversity induces tolerance, and when it may backfire. We discuss in how far the ingroup-projection model can integrate conflicting findings on the multiculturalism ideology."
https://openalex.org/W2623818925,"Up-flow column percolation tests are used at laboratory scale to assess the leaching behavior of hazardous substance from contaminated soils in a specific condition as a function of time. Monitoring the quality of these test results inter or within laboratory is crucial, especially if used for Environment-related legal policy or for routine testing purposes. We tested three different sandy loam type soils (Soils I, II and III) to determine the reproducibility (variability inter laboratory) of test results and to evaluate the difference in the test results within laboratory. Up-flow column percolation tests were performed following the procedure described in the ISO/TS 21268-3. This procedure consists of percolating solution (calcium chloride 1 mM) from bottom to top at a flow rate of 12 mL/h through softly compacted soil contained in a column of 5 cm diameter and 30 ± 5 cm height. Eluate samples were collected at liquid-to-solid ratio of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 L/kg and analyzed for quantification of the target elements (Cu, As, Se, Cl, Ca, F, Mg, DOC and B in this research). For Soil I, 17 institutions in Japan joined this validation test. The up-flow column experiments were conducted in duplicate, after 48 h of equilibration time and at a flow rate of 12 mL/h. Column percolation test results from Soils II and III were used to evaluate the difference in test results from the experiments conducted in duplicate in a single laboratory, after 16 h of equilibration time and at a flow rate of 36 mL/h. Overall results showed good reproducibility (expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation, CV, calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean), as the CV was lower than 30% in more than 90% of the test results associated with Soil I. Moreover, low variability (expressed in terms of difference between the two test results divided by the mean) was observed in the test results related to Soils II and III, with a variability lower than 30% in more than 88% of the cases for Soil II and in more than 96% of the cases for Soil III. We also discussed the possible factors that affect the reproducibility and variability in the test results from the up-flow column percolation tests. The low variability inter and within laboratory obtained in this research indicates that the ISO/TS 21268-3 can be successfully upgraded to a fully validated ISO standard."

Our goal was to define a novel indicator of neuronal activity based on a first-order textural feature of the resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI) signal. Furthermore, we examined the association between this neuronal activity metric and glucose metabolism from 18F FDG-PET. We studied 15 normal elderly controls (NEC) and 15 probable Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. An independent component analysis was applied to the RS-fMRI, followed by template matching to identify neuronal components (NC). A regional brain activity measurement was constructed based on the variation of the RS-fMRI signal of these NC. The standardized glucose uptake values of several brain regions relative to the cerebellum (SUVR) were measured from partial volume corrected FDG-PET images. Comparing the AD and NEC groups, the mean brain activity metric was significantly lower in the accumbens, while the glucose SUVR was significantly lower in the amygdala and hippocampus. The RS-fMRI brain activity metric was positively correlated with cognitive measures and amyloid β1–42 cerebral spinal fluid levels; however, these did not remain significant following Bonferroni correction. There was a significant linear correlation between the brain activity metric and the glucose SUVR measurements. This proof of concept study demonstrates that this novel and easy to implement RS-fMRI brain activity metric can differentiate a group of healthy elderly controls from a group of people with AD."
https://openalex.org/W2623182928,"UiO-66 analogues are good candidates as stationary phase in HPLC because of their chemical/thermal stability, large surface area, and two cage structures. Here, two UiO-66 analogues, UiO-66-NH2 and UiO-67, were synthesized and used as stationary phase in HPLC to evaluate their performance in the separation of substituted benzenes (SBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results showed that SBs could be well separated on UiO-66-NH2 column but not on UiO-67 column. Nonetheless, PAHs could be well separated on UiO-67 column. The separation mechanisms of SBs and PAHs on UiO-66 analogues may be involved in the pore size and functional group in the frameworks of UiO-66 analogues. Introduction of the-NH2 into UiO-66 significantly reduced its adsorption capacity for SB congeners, which resulted in less separation of SBs on UiO-66-NH2. As for the separation of PAHs on UiO-67 column, the π-π stacking effect was supposed to play a vital role."
https://openalex.org/W2949088649,"Recognition of personally familiar faces is remarkably efficient, effortless and robust. We asked if feature-based face processing facilitates detection of familiar faces by testing the effect of face inversion on a visual search task for familiar and unfamiliar faces. Because face inversion disrupts configural and holistic face processing, we hypothesized that inversion would diminish the familiarity advantage to the extent that it is mediated by such processing. Subjects detected personally familiar and stranger target faces in arrays of two, four, or six face images. Subjects showed significant facilitation of personally familiar face detection for both upright and inverted faces. The effect of familiarity on target absent trials, which involved only rejection of unfamiliar face distractors, suggests that familiarity facilitates rejection of unfamiliar distractors as well as detection of familiar targets. The preserved familiarity effect for inverted faces suggests that facilitation of face detection afforded by familiarity reflects mostly feature-based processes."

However, although the transcriptional regulation of BR-C proteins has been well studied, how BR-C is regulated at post-transcription and -translation levels is poorly understood. To this end, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, we identified residue Ser-186 as a phosphorylation site of BR-C in silkworm. Site-directed mutagenesis and treatment with specific kinase activators and inhibitors indicated that the Ser-186 residue in silkworm BR-C is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). Immunostaining assays disclosed that PKA-mediated phosphorylation of silkworm BR-C has no effect on its nuclear import. However, luciferase reporter analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that the PKA phosphorylation event suppresses the transcriptional activation of silkworm BR-C target genes and that this inhibition was caused by repression of BR-C binding to its DNA targets. Of note, both in vitro and ex vivo experiments disclosed that a continuous 20E signal inhibits the PKA-mediated BR-C phosphorylation and also the cAMP/PKA pathway, indicating that 20E's inhibitory effect on PKA-mediated phosphorylation of silkworm BR-C contributes to maintaining BR-C transcriptional activity. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PKA-mediated phosphorylation inhibits silkworm BR-C activity by interfering with its binding to DNA and that 20E signaling relieves PKA-mediated phosphorylation of BR-C, thereby maintaining its transcriptional activity.

https://openalex.org/W2622997108,"Palatogenesis is a complex morphogenetic process, disruptions in which result in highly prevalent birth defects in humans. In recent decades, the use of model systems such as genetically-modified mice, mouse palatal organ cultures and primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cultures has provided significant insight into the molecular and cellular defects underlying cleft palate. However, drawbacks in each of these systems have prevented high-throughput, large-scale studies of palatogenesis in vitro. Here, we report the generation of an immortalized MEPM cell line that maintains the morphology, migration ability, transcript expression and responsiveness to exogenous growth factors of primary MEPM cells, with increased proliferative potential over primary cultures. The immortalization method described in this study will facilitate the generation of palatal mesenchyme cells with an unlimited capacity for expansion from a single genetically-modified mouse embryo and enable mechanistic studies of palatogenesis that have not been possible using primary culture."

The hepatitis B virus deploys the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) as a suppressor of host defenses consisting of RNAi-based silencing of viral genes. Because of its critical role in countering host defenses, HBx represents an attractive target for antiviral drugs. Here, we developed and optimized a loss-of-function screening procedure, which identified a potential pharmacophore that abrogated HBx RNAi suppression activity. In a survey of 14,400 compounds in the Maybridge Screening Collection, we prioritized candidate compounds via high-throughput screening based on reversal of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–reported, RNAi-mediated silencing in a HepG2/GFP-shRNA RNAi sensor line. The screening yielded a pharmacologically active compound, N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-N′-[3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) propyl] thiourea (IR415), which blocked HBx-mediated RNAi suppression indicated by the GFP reporter assay. We also found that IR415 reversed the inhibitory effect of HBx protein on activity of the Dicer endoribonuclease. We further confirmed the results of the primary screen in IR415-treated, HBV-infected HepG2 cells, which exhibited a marked depletion of HBV core protein synthesis and down-regulation of pre-genomic HBV RNA. Using a molecular interaction analysis system, we confirmed that IR415 selectively targets HBx in a concentration-dependent manner. The screening assay presented here allows rapid and improved detection of small-molecule inhibitors of HBx and related viral proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2624609241,"Investigation of household contacts exposed to infectious tuberculosis (TB) is widely recommended by international guidelines to identify secondary cases of TB and limit spread. There is little data to guide the use of contact investigations outside of the household, despite strong evidence that most TB infections occur outside of the home in TB high burden settings. In older adolescents, the majority of infections are estimated to occur in school. Therefore, as part of a project to increase active case finding in Swaziland, we performed school contact investigations following the identification of a student with infectious TB.The Butimba Project identified 7 adolescent TB index cases (age 10-20) with microbiologically confirmed disease attending 6 different schools between June 2014 and March 2015. In addition to household contact investigations, Butimba Project staff worked with the Swaziland School Health Programme (SHP) to perform school contact investigations. At 6 school TB screening events, between May and October 2015, selected students underwent voluntary TB screening and those with positive symptom screens provided sputum for TB testing.Among 2015 student contacts tested, 177 (9%) screened positive for TB symptoms, 132 (75%) produced a sputum sample, of which zero tested positive for TB. Household contact investigations of the same index cases yielded 40 contacts; 24 (60%) screened positive for symptoms; 19 produced a sputum sample, of which one case was confirmed positive for TB. The odds ratio of developing TB following household vs. school contact exposure was significantly lower (OR 0.0, 95% CI 0.0 to 0.18, P = 0.02) after exposure in school.School-based contact investigations require further research to establish best practices in TB high burden settings. In this case, a symptom-based screening approach did not identify additional cases of tuberculosis. In comparison, household contact investigations yielded a higher percentage of contacts with positive TB screens and an additional tuberculosis case."

Here, we constructed the phage display vector pCANTAB 5E-VHH and then transformed it into Escherichia coli TG1-competent cells, to construct an initial anti-BVDV nanobody gene library. We obtained a BVDV-E2 antigen epitope bait protein by prokaryotic expression using the nucleotide sequence of the E2 gene of the BVDV-NADL strain published in GenBank. Phage display was used to screen the anti-BVDV nanobody gene library. We successfully constructed a high quality phage display nanobody library, with an initial library capacity of 4.32×105. After the rescue of helper phage, the titer of the phage display nanobody library was 1.3×1011. The BVDV-E2 protein was then expressed in Escherichia coli (DE3), and a 49.5 kDa band was observed with SDS-PAGE analysis that was consistent with the expected nanobody size. Thus, we were able to isolate one nanobody that exhibits high affinity and specificity against BVDV using phage display techniques. This isolated nanobody was then used in Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay and qRT-PCR, and ELISA analyses of BVDV infection of MDBK cells indicated that the nanobodies exhibited good antiviral effect."
https://openalex.org/W2623982762,"Since the increased prevalence of anabolic androgenic steroids abuse in last few decades is usually accompanied by various exercise protocols, the scope of our study was to evaluate the effects of chronic nandrolone decanoate administration in supraphysiological dose and a prolonged swimming protocol (alone and simultaneously with nandrolone decanoate) on depressive state in male rats. Simultaneously, we investigated the possible alterations in neuropeptide Y (NPY) content in blood and the hippocampus, in order to determine the role of NPY in the modulation of depressive-like behavior.Exercise induced antidepressant effects in tail suspension test (decrease of the total duration of immobility), as well as significant increase in the number of hippocampal NPY-interneurons in CA1 region. Chronic nandrolone decanoate treatment attenuated the beneficial antidepressant effects of exercise as measured by the tail suspension test parameters. Simultaneously, nandrolone decanoate treatment resulted in diminution of NPY content both in blood (decreased serum levels) and in hippocampus (the significant decrease in NPY expression in all three investigated hippocampal regions-CA1, CA2/3 and DG). Our findings indicate that alterations in serum and hippocampal NPY contents may underlie the changes in depressive state in rats. The exercise was beneficial as it exerted antidepressant effect, while chronic nandrolone decanoate treatment resulted in depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, the behavioral indicators of depression showed strong correlations with the serum levels and the hippocampal content of NPY."

We aimed to assess the correlation between cFAP activity and antigen levels and to compare variations in levels. Methods In plasma of 465 control individuals, 368 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and 102 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients with severe liver disease before and after liver transplant, cFAP activity levels were measured with a newly developed cFAP activity assay. In the same samples, cFAP antigen levels were measured using a commercially available cFAP ELISA. Correlation analyses between activity and antigen levels were performed by calculating Pearson’s correlation coefficient (ρ). Additionally, normal ranges, determinants and differences between cohorts and between anticoagulants were investigated. Results cFAP activity and antigen levels significantly correlated in controls (ρ: 0.660, p<0.001) and in CHD patients (ρ: 0.709, p<0.001). cFAP activity and antigen levels in the HCV cohort were significantly lower in the samples taken after liver transplantation (p<0.001) and normalized toward levels of healthy individuals. Furthermore, cFAP activity and antigen levels were higher in men and significantly associated with body mass index. Also, cFAP activity and antigen levels were higher in EDTA plasma as compared to the levels in citrated plasma from the same healthy individuals. Conclusions For analyzing cFAP levels, either activity levels or antigen levels can be measured to investigate differences between individuals. However, it is of importance that blood samples are collected in the same anticoagulant."

In this study, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) reactive blood donations were screened using a combination of serological and molecular methods to identify immune escape HBV mutant strains and to determine the HBV genotypes and subtypes present in Pakistan.Blood donations were collected at the Armed Forces Institute of Transfusion (AFIT) located in northern Pakistan and the Hussaini Blood Bank (HBB) located in the south. From 2009 to 2013 a total of 706,575 donations were screened with 2.04% (14,409) HBsAg reactive. A total of 2055 HBsAg reactive specimens, were collected and screened using a monoclonal antibody based research assay to identify immune escape mutants followed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing to identify the mutation present. DNA sequences obtained from 192 specimens, including mutant candidates and wild type strains, were analyzed for escape mutations, genotype, and HBsAg subtype.Mutations were identified in approximately 14% of HBsAg reactive donations. Mutations at HBsAg amino acid positions 143-145 are the most common (46%) with the mutation serine 143 to leucine the most frequently occurring change (28%). While regional differences were observed, the most prevalent HBV strains are subgenotypes of D with subgenotype D1/subtype ayw2 accounting for the majority of infections; 90.2% at AFIT and 52.5% at HBB.The high frequency of immune escape HBV mutants in HBV infected Pakistani blood donors highlights the need for more studies into the prevalence of escape mutants. Differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, the correlation of escape mutant frequency with genotype, and impact of escape mutations in different genotype backgrounds on the performance of commercially available HBsAg assays represent avenues for further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2623765059,"Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis and the number of PDAC-related deaths is rising. Recently the tumour stroma and in particular one of its main components, hyaluronan (HA), have attracted considerable attention as intravenous hyaluronidase treatment together with conventional chemotherapy considerably prolonged survival in HA-rich PDA patients. We therefore wanted to investigate the prognostic significance of HA deposition in PDA using both antibodies to HA and hyaluronan binding protein (HABP). Material and methods Tissue microarrays of PDAs of 184 patients and pancreatic xenografts tumours were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for HA using either biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding protein (HABP) or anti-HA antibody. Results The pattern of staining with HABP differed significantly from that with antibody IHC. Antibody staining was found both within cancer cells and in the extracellular matrix and staining could not be eliminated by hyaluronidase predigestion of the tissue sections. In contrast, HABP staining was generally confined to the extracellular matrix and was completely abolished by hyaluronidase pretreatment. HA positivity as determined by HABP was associated with larger primary tumours (p = 0.046). There were no correlations between overall survival, disease-free survival and HA expression. Conclusion Presence of HA alone is not of prognostic importance in PDAC, and IHC with utilization of antibody detection shows no reliable staining pattern and should not be applied for HA IHC."

However an increasing rate of ART failure with resistant virus is reported. We therefore described the pattern of drug resistance mutations at antiretroviral treatment (ART) failure in a real-life Tanzanian setting using the remote genotyping procedure and thereafter predicted future treatment options using rule-based algorithm and the EuResist bioinformatics predictive engine. According to national guidelines, the default first-line regimen is tenofovir + lamivudine + efavirenz, but variations including nevirapine, stavudine or emtricitabine can be considered. If failure on first-line ART occurs, a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and boosted lopinavir or atazanavir is recommended.Plasma was obtained from subjects with first (n = 174) or second-line (n = 99) treatment failure, as defined by clinical or immunological criteria, as well as from a control group of ART naïve subjects (n = 17) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Amplification of the pol region was performed locally and the amplified DNA fragment was sent to Sweden for sequencing (split genotyping procedure). The therapeutic options after failure were assessed by the genotypic sensitivity score and the EuResist predictive engine. Viral load was quantified in a subset of subjects with second-line failure (n = 52).The HIV-1 pol region was successfully amplified from 55/174 (32%) and 28/99 (28%) subjects with first- or second-line failure, respectively, and 14/17 (82%) ART-naïve individuals. HIV-1 pol sequence was obtained in 82 of these 97 cases (84.5%). Undetectable or very low (<2.6 log10 copies/10-3 L) viral load explained 19 out of 25 (76%) amplification failures in subjects at second-line ART failure. At first and second line failure, extensive accumulation of NRTI (88% and 73%, respectively) and NNRTI (93% and 73%, respectively) DRMs but a limited number of PI DRMs (11% at second line failure) was observed. First line failure subjects displayed a high degree of cross-resistance to second-generation NNRTIs etravirine (ETR; 51% intermediate and 9% resistant) and rilpivirine (RPV; 12% intermediate and 58% resistant), and to abacavir (ABC; 49% resistant) which is reserved for second line therapy in Tanzania. The predicted probability of success with the best salvage regimen at second-line failure decreased from 93.9% to 78.7% when restricting access to the NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs currently available in Tanzania compared to when including all approved drugs.The split genotyping procedure is potential tool to analyse drug resistance in Tanzania but the sensitivity should be evaluated further. The lack of viral load monitoring likely results in a high false positive rate of treatment failures, unnecessary therapy switches and massive accumulation of NRTI and NNRTI mutations. The introduction of regular virological monitoring should be prioritized and integrated with drug resistance studies in resource limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2621415659,"The dioxonapthoimidazolium YM155 is a survivin suppressant which has been investigated as an anticancer agent in clinical trials. Here, we investigated its growth inhibitory properties on a panel of immortalized and patient derived renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines which were either deficient in the tumour suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein or possessed a functional copy. Neither the VHL status nor the survivin expression levels of these cell lines influenced their susceptibility to growth inhibition by YM155. Of the various RCC lines, the papillary subtype was more resistant to YM155, suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of YM155 may be restricted to clear cell subtypes. YM155 was equally potent in cells (RCC786.0) in which survivin expression had been stably silenced or overexpressed, implicating a limited reliance on survivin in the mode of action of YM155. A follow-up in-vitro high throughput RNA microarray identified possible targets of YM155 apart from survivin. Selected genes (ID1, FOXO1, CYLD) that were differentially expressed in YM155-sensitive RCC cells and relevant to RCC pathology were validated with real-time PCR and western immunoblotting analyses. Thus, there is corroboratory evidence that the growth inhibitory activity of YM155 in RCC cell lines is not exclusively mediated by its suppression of survivin. In view of the growing importance of combination therapy in oncology, we showed that a combination of YM155 and sorafenib at ½ x IC50 concentrations was synergistic on RCC786.0 cells. However, when tested intraperitoneally on a murine xenograft model derived from a nephrectomised patient with clear cell RCC, a combination of suboptimal doses of both drugs failed to arrest tumour progression. The absence of synergy in vivo highlighted the need to further optimize the dosing schedules of YM155 and sorafenib, as well as their routes of administration. It also implied that the expression of other oncogenic proteins which YM155 may target is either low or absent in this clear cell RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2621874321,"The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) mediates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to initiate skeletal muscle contraction and is associated with muscle diseases, malignant hyperthermia, and central core disease. To better understand RyR1 channel function, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of channel gating and ion permeation. An adequate model of channel gating requires accurate, high-resolution models of both open and closed states of the channel. To this end, we generated an open-channel RyR1 model using molecular simulations to pull Ca2+ through the pore constriction site of a closed-channel RyR1 structure determined at 3.8-A resolution. Importantly, we find that our open-channel model is consistent with the RyR1 and cardiac RyR (RyR2) open-channel structures reported while this paper was in preparation. Both our model and the published structures show similar rotation of the upper portion of the pore-lining S6 helix away from the 4-fold channel axis and twisting of Ile-4937 at the channel constriction site out of the channel pore. These motions result in a minimum open-channel pore radius of ∼3 A formed by Gln-4933, rather than Ile-4937 in the closed-channel structure. We also present functional support for our model by mutations around the closed- and open-channel constriction sites (Gln-4933 and Ile-4937). Our results indicate that use of ion-pulling simulations produces a RyR1 open-channel model, which can provide insights into the mechanisms of channel opening complementing those from the structural data."
https://openalex.org/W2624172890,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare multisystemic disorder associated with an expansion of CUG repeats in mutant DMPK (dystrophia myotonica protein kinase) transcripts; the main effect of these expansions is the induction of pre-mRNA splicing defects by sequestering muscleblind-like family proteins (e.g. MBNL1). Disruption of the CUG repeats and the MBNL1 protein complex has been established as the best therapeutic approach for DM1, hence two main strategies have been proposed: targeted degradation of mutant DMPK transcripts and the development of CUG-binding molecules that prevent MBNL1 sequestration. Herein, suitable CUG-binding small molecules were selected using in silico approaches such as scaffold analysis, similarity searching, and druggability analysis. We used polarization assays to confirm the CUG repeat binding in vitro for a number of candidate compounds, and went on to evaluate the biological activity of the two with the strongest affinity for CUG repeats (which we refer to as compounds 1-2 and 2-5) in DM1 mutant cells and Drosophila DM1 models with an impaired locomotion phenotype. In particular, 1-2 and 2-5 enhanced the levels of free MBNL1 in patient-derived myoblasts in vitro and greatly improved DM1 fly locomotion in climbing assays. This work provides new computational approaches for rational large-scale virtual screens of molecules that selectively recognize CUG structures. Moreover, it contributes valuable knowledge regarding two compounds with desirable biological activity in DM1 models."
https://openalex.org/W2622352934,"When researchers complete a manuscript, they need to choose a journal to which they will submit the study. This decision requires to navigate trade-offs between multiple objectives. One objective is to share the new knowledge as widely as possible. Citation counts can serve as a proxy to quantify this objective. A second objective is to minimize the time commitment put into sharing the research, which may be estimated by the total time from initial submission to final decision. A third objective is to minimize the number of rejections and resubmissions. Thus, researchers often consider the trade-offs between the objectives of (i) maximizing citations, (ii) minimizing time-to-decision, and (iii) minimizing the number of resubmissions. To complicate matters further, this is a decision with multiple, potentially conflicting, decision-maker rationalities. Co-authors might have different preferences, for example about publishing fast versus maximizing citations. These diverging preferences can lead to conflicting trade-offs between objectives. Here, we apply a multi-objective decision analytical framework to identify the Pareto-front between these objectives and determine the set of journal submission pathways that balance these objectives for three stages of a researcher’s career. We find multiple strategies that researchers might pursue, depending on how they value minimizing risk and effort relative to maximizing citations. The sequences that maximize expected citations within each strategy are generally similar, regardless of time horizon. We find that the “conditional impact factor”—impact factor times acceptance rate—is a suitable heuristic method for ranking journals, to strike a balance between minimizing effort objectives and maximizing citation count. Finally, we examine potential co-author tension resulting from differing rationalities by mapping out each researcher’s preferred Pareto front and identifying compromise submission strategies. The explicit representation of trade-offs, especially when multiple decision-makers (co-authors) have different preferences, facilitates negotiations and can support the decision process."
https://openalex.org/W2623295209,"Purpose A multi-electrode array was used to generate spatially resolved Surface electromyography (SEMG) data of the hip muscles in healthy older adults. The cohort was meant to serve as an age-matched, normal control population for future surgical and rehabilitative studies in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty, in view of the large, continuously increasing number of hip joint replacements. Methods Bilateral hip muscle SEMG activity, including tensor fasciae latae (TFL), gluteus medius (Gmed), and gluteus maximus (Gmax), was measured during locomotion on a walkway at self-selected slow, normal, and fast walking speeds (age-matched cohort of 29 females and 25 males). Eight equally-spaced, vertically oriented bipolar channels were applied on a horizontal line at mid-distance between iliac crest and greater trochanter (length 17.5 cm; named P1 to P8). Time-independent parameters (e.g., mean amplitude) were derived from the amplitude curves expressed as root mean square. Results The acquired SEMG data were not significantly influenced by gender (p = 0.202) or side (p = 0.313) and were therefore pooled. The most ventral to central electrode positions P1 to P5, representing TFL and ventral to central Gmed, showed the highest mean amplitude levels (averaged over the whole stride; 0.001 < p < 0.027 against P6 to P8; Bonferroni-adjusted paired t-test) at all walking speeds. Also, the respective curves showed two distinct amplitude peaks (representing load acceptance and hip stabilization during mid-stance), with a continuous increase of the first peak from P1 to P4 (most pronounced at fast speed) and the second peak from P1 to P3. Independently of the underlying individual muscles, both peaks displayed a continuous time shift from the most dorsal P8 to the most ventral P1 position, with the peaks for the ventral positions occurring at later time points during the normalized stride. Conclusions The continuously changing activation patterns of the superficial muscles in the gluteal region during walking may reflect function-driven, finely tuned coordination patterns of neighboring muscles and muscle segments, rather than independent activation of anatomically defined muscles. This may be important for the definition of specific target parameters for the improvement and/or normalization of muscle function during training and post-injury rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2621542278,"Overcrowded adipocytes secrete excess adipokines and cytokines under stress, which results in a deregulated metabolism. This negative response to stress increases the possibility of obesity and several of its associated diseases, such as cancer and atherosclerosis. Therefore, a reduction in the number of adipocytes may be a rational strategy to relieve the undesired expansion of adipose tissue. A newly synthesized xanthene analog, MI-401, was found to have two distinct effects on the regulation of the adipocyte’s life cycle. MI-401 efficiently down regulated the expression of transcription factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, and lipogenesis proteins, FAS and FABP4. This down regulation resulted in the inhibition of adipogenesis. Without newly differentiated adipocytes, the total number of adipocytes will not increase. In addition to this inhibitory effect, MI-401 was able to actively kill mature adipocytes. It specifically triggered apoptosis in adipocytes at low micro molar concentration and spared preadipocytes and fibroblasts. These dual functionalities make MI-401 an effective agent in the regulation of the birth and death of adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2622887323,"Imidazoquinolines are powerful immunostimulants (IMMS) that function through Toll-like receptors, particularly TLR7 and TLR8. In addition to enhancing the immune response, IMMS also function as antineoplastic drugs and vaccine adjuvants. These small compounds display almost the same molecular structure, except in some cases in which atom in position 1 varies and changes the imidazole characteristics. A variable acyclic side chain is also always attached at atom in position 2, while another chain may be attached at atom in position 1. These structural differences alter immune responses, such as the production of interferon regulatory factor and nuclear factor-κB (IRF-NFκB). In this work, quantum mechanics theory and computational chemistry methods were applied to study the physicochemical properties of the crystal binding site of TLR8 complexed with the following six IMMS molecules: Hybrid-2, XG1-236, DS802, CL075, CL097 and R848 (resiquimod). The PDB IDs of the crystals were: 4R6A, 4QC0, 4QBZ, 3W3K, 3W3J, and 3W3N respectively. Thus, were calculated, the total energy, solvation energy, interaction energy (instead of free energy) of the system and interaction energy of the polar region of the IMMS. Additionally, the dipole moment, electrostatic potential, polar surface, atomic charges, hydrogen bonds, and polar and hydrophobic interactions, among others, were assessed. Together, these properties revealed important differences among the six TLR8-immunostimulant complexes, reflected as different interaction energies and therefore different electrostatic environments and binding energies. Remarkably, the interaction energy of a defined polar region composed of the highly polarized N3, N5 atoms and the N11 amino group, acted as a polar pharmacophore that correlates directly with the reported immunopharmacological potency of the six complexed molecules. Based on these results, it was concluded that accurate physicochemical analysis of the crystal binding site could reveal the binding energy (measured as interaction energy) and associated molecular mechanism of action between IMMS and TLR8. These findings may facilitate the development and design of improved small molecules with IMMS properties that are targeted to the TLR system and have enhanced pharmacological effectiveness and reduced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2623295441,"We previously showed that p21Cip1 transits through the nucleolus on its way from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that DNA damage inhibits this transit and induces the formation of p21Cip1-containing intranucleolar bodies (INoBs). Here, we demonstrate that these INoBs also contain SUMO-1 and UBC9, the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme. Furthermore, whereas wild type SUMO-1 localized in INoBs, a SUMO-1 mutant, which is unable to conjugate with proteins, does not, suggesting the presence of SUMOylated proteins at INoBs. Moreover, depletion of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 or the sumo hydrolase SENP2 changed p21Cip1 intracellular distribution. In addition to SUMO-1 and p21Cip1, cell cycle regulators and DNA damage checkpoint proteins, including Cdk2, Cyclin E, PCNA, p53 and Mdm2, and PML were also detected in INoBs. Importantly, depletion of UBC9 or p21Cip1 impacted INoB biogenesis and the nucleolar accumulation of the cell cycle regulators and DNA damage checkpoint proteins following DNA damage. The impact of p21Cip1 and SUMO-1 on the accumulation of proteins in INoBs extends also to CRM1, a nuclear exportin that is also important for protein translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus. Thus, SUMO and p21Cip1 regulate the transit of proteins through the nucleolus, and that disruption of nucleolar export by DNA damage induces SUMO and p21Cip1 to act as hub proteins to form a multiprotein complex in the nucleolus."

GERD symptoms severity was assessed by the ReQuest in Practice questionnaire. Heritability and genetic correlation were determined using the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines software.585 subjects were included, the mean age was 42 (±16.7) years, 57% were women. The heritability of the severity of some GERD symptoms was h2 = 0.27, 0.27, 0.37, and 0.34 (p-value <1.0x10-5) for acidity complaints, lower abdominal complaints, sleep disturbances, and total ReQuest score, respectively. Heritability of metabolic syndrome components ranged from 0.40 for fasting plasma glucose to 0.61 for body mass index and diabetes mellitus. The heritability for fibrinogen and C-reactive protein was 0.64 and 0.38, respectively. Statistically significant genetic correlations were found between acidity complaints and fasting plasma glucose (ρG = 0.40); sleep disturbances and fasting plasma glucose (ρG = 0.36); acidity complaints and diabetes mellitus (ρG = 0.49) and between total ReQuest score and fasting plasma glucose (ρG = 0.43). The rest of metabolic syndrome components did not correlate with GERD symptoms.Genetic factors substantially explain the phenotypic variance of the severity of some GERD symptoms, metabolic syndrome components and inflammation markers. Observed genetic correlations suggest that these phenotypes share common genes. These findings suggest conducting further investigation, as the determination of a linkage analysis in order to identify regions of susceptibility for developing of GERD and metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2623613491,A generalized right truncated bivariate Poisson regression model is proposed in this paper. Estimation and tests for goodness of fit and over or under dispersion are illustrated for both untruncated and right truncated bivariate Poisson regression models using marginal-conditional approach. Estimation and test procedures are illustrated for bivariate Poisson regression models with applications to Health and Retirement Study data on number of health conditions and the number of health care services utilized. The proposed test statistics are easy to compute and it is evident from the results that the models fit the data very well. A comparison between the right truncated and untruncated bivariate Poisson regression models using the test for nonnested models clearly shows that the truncated model performs significantly better than the untruncated model.

https://openalex.org/W2622009284,"We aimed to identify the independent associations of genomic ancestry and education level with abdominal fat distributions in the 1982 Pelotas birth cohort study, Brazil. In 2,890 participants (1,409 men and 1,481 women), genomic ancestry was assessed using genotype data on 370,539 genome-wide variants to quantify ancestral proportions in each individual. Years of completed education was used to indicate socio-economic position. Visceral fat depth and subcutaneous abdominal fat thickness were measured by ultrasound at age 29–31y; these measures were adjusted for BMI to indicate abdominal fat distributions. Linear regression models were performed, separately by sex. Admixture was observed between European (median proportion 85.3), African (6.6), and Native American (6.3) ancestries, with a strong inverse correlation between the African and European ancestry scores (ρ = -0.93; p<0.001). Independent of education level, African ancestry was inversely associated with both visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat distributions in men (both P = 0.001), and inversely associated with subcutaneous abdominal fat distribution in women (p = 0.009). Independent of genomic ancestry, higher education level was associated with lower visceral fat, but higher subcutaneous fat, in both men and women (all p<0.001). Our findings, from an admixed population, indicate that both genomic ancestry and education level were independently associated with abdominal fat distribution in adults. African ancestry appeared to lower abdominal fat distributions, particularly in men."
https://openalex.org/W2622094125,"Evidence suggests European American (EA) women have two- to five-fold increased odds of having pelvic organ prolapse (POP) when compared with African American (AA) women. However, the role of genetic ancestry in relation to POP risk is not clear. Here we evaluate the association between genetic ancestry and POP in AA women from the Women's Health Initiative Hormone Therapy trial. Women with grade 1 or higher classification, and grade 2 or higher classification for uterine prolapse, cystocele or rectocele at baseline or during follow-up were considered to have any POP (N = 805) and moderate/severe POP (N = 156), respectively. Women with at least two pelvic exams with no indication for POP served as controls (N = 344). We performed case-only, and case-control admixture-mapping analyses using multiple logistic regression while adjusting for age, BMI, parity and global ancestry. We evaluated the association between global ancestry and POP using multiple logistic regression. European ancestry at the individual level was not associated with POP risk. Case-only and case-control local ancestry analyses identified two ancestry-specific loci that may be associated with POP. One locus (Chromosome 15q26.2) achieved empirically-estimated statistical significance and was associated with decreased POP odds (considering grade ≥2 POP) with each unit increase in European ancestry (OR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.57; p-value = 1.48x10-5). This region includes RGMA, a potent regulator of the BMP family of genes. The second locus (Chromosome 1q42.1-q42.3) was associated with increased POP odds with each unit increase in European ancestry (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28, 2.22; p-value = 1.93x10-4). Although this region did not reach statistical significance after considering multiple comparisons, it includes potentially relevant genes including TBCE, and ACTA1. Unique non-overlapping European and African ancestry-specific susceptibility loci may be associated with increased POP risk."
https://openalex.org/W2620661764,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) and topoisomerase II inhibitors are used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) as they induce death in lymphoid cells through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and p53 respectively. Mechanisms underlying ALL cell death and the contribution of the bone marrow microenvironment to drug response/resistance remain unclear. The role of the microenvironment and the identification of chemoresistance determinants were studied by transcriptomic analysis in ALL cells treated with Dexamethasone (Dex), and Etoposide (Etop) grown in the presence or absence of bone marrow conditioned media (CM). The necroptotic (RIPK1) and the apoptotic (caspase-8/3) markers were downregulated by CM, whereas the inhibitory effects of chemotherapy on the autophagy marker Beclin-1 (BECN1) were reduced suggesting CM exerts cytoprotective effects. GCs upregulated the RIPK1 ubiquitinating factor BIRC3 (cIAP2), in GC-sensitive (CEM-C7-14) but not in resistant (CEM-C1-15) cells. In addition, CM selectively affected GR phosphorylation in a site and cell-specific manner. GR is recruited to RIPK1, BECN1 and BIRC3 promoters in the sensitive but not in the resistant cells with phosphorylated GR forms being generally less recruited in the presence of hormone. FACS analysis and caspase-8 assays demonstrated that CM promoted a pro-survival trend. High molecular weight proteins reacting with the RIPK1 antibody were modified upon incubation with the BIRC3 inhibitor AT406 in CEM-C7-14 cells suggesting that they represent ubiquitinated forms of RIPK1. Our data suggest that there is a correlation between microenvironment-induced ALL proliferation and altered response to chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2623663276,"Background MR-angiography currently represents one of the clinical reference-standards for the assessment of aortic-dimensions. For experimental research in mice, dedicated preclinical high-field MRI scanners are used in most studies. This type of MRI scanner is not available in most institutions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of MR-angiography performed on a clinical MR scanner for the assessment of aortic aneurysms in an experimental mouse model, compared to a preclinical high-resolution ultrasound imaging system and histopathology. Methods All in vivo MR imaging was performed with a clinical 3T MRI system (Philips Achieva) equipped with a clinical gradient system in combination with a single-loop surface-coil (47 mm). All MR sequences were based on clinically used sequences. For ultrasound, a dedicated preclinical high-resolution system (30 MHz linear transducer, Vevo770, VisualSonics) was used. All imaging was performed with an ApoE knockout mouse-model for aortic aneurysms. Histopathology was performed as reference-standard at all stages of aneurysm development. Results MR-angiography on a clinical 3T system enabled the clear visualization of the aortic lumen and aneurysmal dilation at different stages of aneurysm development. A close correlation (R2 = 0.98; p < 0.001) with histological area measurements was found. Additionally, a good agreement between MR and ultrasound area measurements in systole (R2 = 0.91; p < 0.001) and diastole (R2 = 0.94; p < 0.001) were measured. Regarding interobserver reproducibility, MRI measurements yielded a smaller 95% confidence interval and a closer interreader correlation compared to ultrasound measurements (-0.37–0.46; R2 = 0.97 vs. -0.78–0.88; R2 = 0.87). Conclusion This study demonstrates that MR-angiography, performed on a clinical 3T MR scanner, enables the reliable detection and quantification of the aortic dilatation at different stages of aneurysm development in an experimental mouse model."
