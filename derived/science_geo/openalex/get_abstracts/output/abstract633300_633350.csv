https://openalex.org/W2946692293,"Base editing requires that the target sequence satisfy the protospacer adjacent motif requirement of the Cas9 domain and that the target nucleotide be located within the editing window of the base editor. To increase the targeting scope of base editors, we engineered six optimized adenine base editors (ABEmax variants) that use SpCas9 variants compatible with non-NGG protospacer adjacent motifs. To increase the range of target bases that can be modified within the protospacer, we use circularly permuted Cas9 variants to produce four cytosine and four adenine base editors with an editing window expanded from ~4-5 nucleotides to up to ~8-9 nucleotides and reduced byproduct formation. This set of base editors improves the targeting scope of cytosine and adenine base editing."
https://openalex.org/W2946529671,"Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) results in heterogeneous clinical outcomes including primary progressive tuberculosis and latent Mtb infection (LTBI). Mtb infection is identified using the tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay IGRA, and a positive result may prompt chemoprophylaxis to prevent progression to tuberculosis. In the present study, we report on a cohort of Ugandan individuals who were household contacts of patients with TB. These individuals were highly exposed to Mtb but tested negative disease by IFN-γ release assay and tuberculin skin test, 'resisting' development of classic LTBI. We show that 'resisters' possess IgM, class-switched IgG antibody responses and non-IFN-γ T cell responses to the Mtb-specific proteins ESAT6 and CFP10, immunologic evidence of exposure to Mtb. Compared to subjects with classic LTBI, 'resisters' display enhanced antibody avidity and distinct Mtb-specific IgG Fc profiles. These data reveal a distinctive adaptive immune profile among Mtb-exposed subjects, supporting an expanded definition of the host response to Mtb exposure, with implications for public health and the design of clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2946618087,"Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for cell-based therapies and drug discovery. However, homogeneous differentiation remains a major challenge, highlighting the need for understanding developmental mechanisms. We performed genome-scale CRISPR screens to uncover regulators of definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation, which unexpectedly uncovered five Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)–JUN family genes as key barriers of DE differentiation. The JNK–JUN pathway does not act through directly inhibiting the DE enhancers. Instead, JUN co-occupies ESC enhancers with OCT4, NANOG, SMAD2 and SMAD3, and specifically inhibits the exit from the pluripotent state by impeding the decommissioning of ESC enhancers and inhibiting the reconfiguration of SMAD2 and SMAD3 chromatin binding from ESC to DE enhancers. Therefore, the JNK–JUN pathway safeguards pluripotency from precocious DE differentiation. Direct pharmacological inhibition of JNK significantly improves the efficiencies of generating DE and DE-derived pancreatic and lung progenitor cells, highlighting the potential of harnessing the knowledge from developmental studies for regenerative medicine. CRISPR screens identify JNK–JUN family genes as repressors of definitive endoderm differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells. JUN co-occupies stem cell enhancers with OCT4, NANOG, SMAD2 and SMAD3 and inhibits the exit from pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2944903436,"It is not clear how spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) form and are processed in normal cells, and whether they predispose to cancer-associated translocations. We show that DSBs in normal mammary cells form upon release of paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at promoters, 5′ splice sites and active enhancers, and are processed by end-joining in the absence of a canonical DNA-damage response. Logistic and causal-association models showed that Pol II pausing at long genes is the main predictor and determinant of DSBs. Damaged introns with paused Pol II-pS5, TOP2B and XRCC4 are enriched in translocation breakpoints, and map at topologically associating domain boundary-flanking regions showing high interaction frequencies with distal loci. Thus, in unperturbed growth conditions, release of paused Pol II at specific loci and chromatin territories favors DSB formation, leading to chromosomal translocations. Release of paused Pol II at specific intronic loci or chromatin domains favors the formation of abnormal DNA recombination, leading to cancer-associated chromosomal translocations."
https://openalex.org/W2952098662,"An expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide of more than 30 repeats (termed (G4C2)30+) within C9orf72 is the most prominent mutation in familial frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (termed C9+). Through an unbiased large-scale screen of (G4C2)49-expressing Drosophila we identify the CDC73/PAF1 complex (PAF1C), a transcriptional regulator of RNA polymerase II, as a suppressor of G4C2-associated toxicity when knocked-down. Depletion of PAF1C reduces RNA and GR dipeptide production from (G4C2)30+ transgenes. Notably, in Drosophila, the PAF1C components Paf1 and Leo1 appear to be selective for the transcription of long, toxic repeat expansions, but not shorter, nontoxic expansions. In yeast, PAF1C components regulate the expression of both sense and antisense repeats. PAF1C is upregulated following (G4C2)30+ expression in flies and mice. In humans, PAF1 is also upregulated in C9+-derived cells, and its heterodimer partner, LEO1, binds C9+ repeat chromatin. In C9+ FTD, PAF1 and LEO1 are upregulated and their expression positively correlates with the expression of repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts. These data indicate that PAF1C activity is an important factor for transcription of the long, toxic repeat in C9+ FTD."
https://openalex.org/W2944895870,"Objective The use of brain-computer interface in neurofeedback therapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a relatively new approach. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether an 8-week brain computer interface (BCI)-based attention training program improved inattentive symptoms in children with ADHD compared to a waitlist-control group, and the effects of a subsequent 12-week lower-intensity training. Study design We randomized 172 children aged 6–12 attending an outpatient child psychiatry clinic diagnosed with inattentive or combined subtypes of ADHD and not receiving concurrent pharmacotherapy or behavioral intervention to either the intervention or waitlist-control group. Intervention involved 3 sessions of BCI-based training for 8 weeks, followed by 3 training sessions per month over the subsequent 12 weeks. The waitlist-control group received similar 20-week intervention after a wait-time of 8 weeks. Results The participants’ mean age was 8.6 years (SD = 1.51), with 147 males (85.5%) and 25 females (14.5%). Modified intention to treat analyzes conducted on 163 participants with at least one follow-up rating showed that at 8 weeks, clinician-rated inattentive symptoms on the ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) was reduced by 3.5 (SD 3.97) in the intervention group compared to 1.9 (SD 4.42) in the waitlist-control group (between-group difference of 1.6; 95% CI 0.3 to 2.9 p = 0.0177). At the end of the full 20-week treatment, the mean reduction (pre-post BCI) of the pooled group was 3.2 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.1). Conclusion The results suggest that the BCI-based attention training program can improve ADHD symptoms after a minimum of 24 sessions and maintenance training may sustain this improvement. This intervention may be an option for treating milder cases or as an adjunctive treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2946413103,"The accurate relay of electrical signals within cortical networks is key to perception and cognitive function. Theoretically, it has long been proposed that temporal coordination of neuronal spiking activity controls signal transmission and behavior. However, whether and how temporally precise neuronal coordination in population activity influences perception are unknown. Here, we recorded populations of neurons in early and mid-level visual cortex (areas V1 and V4) simultaneously to discover that the precise temporal coordination between the spiking activity of three or more cells carries information about visual perception in the absence of firing rate modulation. The accuracy of perceptual responses correlated with high-order spiking coordination within V4, but not V1, and with feedforward coordination between V1 and V4. These results indicate that while visual stimuli are encoded in the discharge rates of neurons, perceptual accuracy is related to temporally precise spiking coordination within and between cortical networks. Shahidi et al. show that the brain uses different strategies to encode sensory stimuli and behavior. They find that visual stimuli are encoded in firing rates, whereas behavioral accuracy is correlated with spike timing regardless of spike counts."
https://openalex.org/W2949212099,"In addition to the BAC-based reference sequence of the accession Columbia-0 from the year 2000, several short read assemblies of THE plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana were published during the last years. Also, a SMRT-based assembly of Landsberg erecta has been generated that identified translocation and inversion polymorphisms between two genotypes of the species. Here we provide a chromosome-arm level assembly of the A. thaliana accession Niederzenz-1 (AthNd-1_v2c) based on SMRT sequencing data. The best assembly comprises 69 nucleome sequences and displays a contig length of up to 16 Mbp. Compared to an earlier Illumina short read-based NGS assembly (AthNd-1_v1), a 75 fold increase in contiguity was observed for AthNd-1_v2c. To assign contig locations independent from the Col-0 gold standard reference sequence, we used genetic anchoring to generate a de novo assembly. In addition, we assembled the chondrome and plastome sequences. Detailed analyses of AthNd-1_v2c allowed reliable identification of large genomic rearrangements between A. thaliana accessions contributing to differences in the gene sets that distinguish the genotypes. One of the differences detected identified a gene that is lacking from the Col-0 gold standard sequence. This de novo assembly extends the known proportion of the A. thaliana pan-genome."
https://openalex.org/W2944971937,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible deterioration of lung function. Exacerbations of COPD have prolonged negative effects on pulmonary function and a major impact on health status and outcomes. NLRP3 inflammasome is a cardinal component of the inflammatory response, with marked evidence in stable and exacerbations of COPD. The aim of our study was to evaluate the NLRP3 inflammasome activity during COPD exacerbation by using an in vitro model.A549 cells were stimulated with different concentrations (10%, 4%, 2%) of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) with or without LPS (0.1μg/ml) for 24 hours. Cell viability was assessed by using XTT test. Levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-1β) were measured by ELISA and the activity level of NLRP-3 was evaluated by flow cytometry.Cells exposed to CSE present an increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and MCP-1) production in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with LPS to these cells results in higher levels of IL-8 and MCP-1 compared to stimulation of CSE alone. NLRP3 inflammasome activity and IL-1β levels were significantly increased in cells exposed to both CSE and LPS compared to CSE alone.NLRP3 inflammasome is upregulated in an in-vitro model of COPD and COPD exacerbation. Our findings provide novel biomarkers for COPD exacerbation and may present new targets for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2946356574,"The paper introduces structural diversity as a new approach to quantify the complexity of technologies. By modeling technologies as combinatorial networks, a measure of technological complexity is derived that represents the diversity of (sub-)network topologies in these networks. It is further argued that this measure can be empirically approximated with the Network Diversity Score (NDS). The paper also presents an application of this approach to European patent data from 1980 to 2015. On this basis, the measure of structural diversity is shown to replicate a number of stylized facts commonly associated with technological complexity: Complexity increases over time and younger technologies are more complex than older technologies. Complex technologies are also associated to larger R&D efforts and require more collaborative R&D activities. Lastly, when controlling for technologies’ size, technologies scoring high on structural diversity are also shown to concentrate in space."
https://openalex.org/W3099131077,"Gravitational-wave emission can lead to the coalescence of close pairs of compact objects orbiting each other1,2. In the case of neutron stars, such mergers may yield masses above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (2 to 2.7 solar masses)3, leading to the formation of black holes4. For white dwarfs, the mass of the merger product may exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, leading either to a thermonuclear explosion as a type Ia supernova5,6 or to a collapse forming a neutron star7,8. The latter case is expected to result in a hydrogen- and helium-free circumstellar nebula and a hot, luminous, rapidly rotating and highly magnetized central star with a lifetime of about 10,000 years9,10. Here we report observations of a hot star with a spectrum dominated by emission lines, which is located at the centre of a circular mid-infrared nebula. The widths of the emission lines imply that wind material leaves the star with an outflow velocity of 16,000 kilometres per second and that rapid stellar rotation and a strong magnetic field aid the wind acceleration. Given that hydrogen and helium are probably absent from the star and nebula, we conclude that both objects formed recently from the merger of two massive white dwarfs. Our stellar-atmosphere and wind models indicate a stellar surface temperature of about 200,000 kelvin and a luminosity of about 104.6 solar luminosities. The properties of the star and nebula agree with models of the post-merger evolution of super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs9, which predict a bright optical and high-energy transient upon collapse of the star11 within the next few thousand years. Our observations indicate that super-Chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf mergers can avoid thermonuclear explosion as type Ia supernovae, and provide evidence of the generation of magnetic fields in stellar mergers."
https://openalex.org/W2774313241,"A fundamental cognitive process is to map value and identity onto the objects we learn about. However, what space best embeds this mapping is not completely understood. Here we develop tools to quantify the space and organization of such a mapping in neural responses as reflected in functional MRI, to show that quick learners have a higher dimensional representation than slow learners, and hence more easily distinguishable whole-brain responses to objects of different value. Furthermore, we find that quick learners display more compact embedding of their neural responses, and hence have higher ratios of their stimuli dimension to their embedding dimension, which is consistent with greater efficiency of cognitive coding. Lastly, we investigate the neurophysiological drivers at smaller scales and study the complementary distinguishability of whole-brain responses. Our results demonstrate a spatial organization of neural responses characteristic of learning and offer geometric measures applicable to identifying efficient coding in higher-order cognitive processes. Why do certain individuals learn faster than others, and how does the acquired information take shape within their brains? Tang and colleagues show that fast learners encode information in a particularly compact, efficient and space-saving manner."
https://openalex.org/W2944861543,"In the present study, endophytic fungi have been isolated from various parts of the medicinal herb Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort), which is known as a source of medically important metabolites. The isolated strains were cultured in liquid media and their ability to synthesize hypericin, the secondary metabolite of the host and its suspected precursor, emodin was tested analyzing the extracts of the fermentation broth and the mycelia. The HPLC-UV analysis of the chloroform/methanol extracts of the mycelia revealed that three isolates were able to produce emodin (SZMC 23771, 19.9 ng/mg; SZMC 23772, 20.8 ng/mg; SZMC 23769, 427.9 ng/mg) and one of them also could synthesize hypericin (SZMC 23769, 320.4 ng/mg). These results were also confirmed via UHPLC-HRMS technique both in full scan and MS/MS mode. The strains producing only emodin belong to the section Alternata of the genus Alternaria, while the isolate producing both metabolites was identified as Epicoccum nigrum. The mycelial extracts of E. nigrum and the Alternaria sp. SZMC 23772 showed higher inhibitory activities in the antimicrobial tests against the six selected bacteria compared to the hypericin and emodin standards in the applied concentration (100 μg/mL), while in case of the Alternaria sp. SZMC 23771 lower inhibition activities were observed on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptomyces albus than the pure compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2945341460,"Cancer cells harness immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) to evade immune control. Checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated durable anti-tumor efficacy in human and preclinical models. Liver toxicity is one of the common immune-related adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) and its frequency and severity often increase significantly during CPI combination therapies. We aim to develop a mouse model to elucidate the immune mechanisms of CPI-associated liver toxicity. Co-administration of CTLA-4 blocking antibody, 9D9, and/or an IDO1 inhibitor, epacadostat in wild-type and PD-1-/- mice (to simulate the effect of PD1 blockade) synergistically induced liver injury and immune cell infiltration. Infiltrated cells were primarily composed of CD8+ T cells and positively associated with hepatocyte necrosis. Strikingly, sites of hepatocyte necrosis were frequently surrounded by clusters of mononuclear immune cells. CPI treatments resulted in increased expression of genes associated with hepatocyte cell death, leukocyte migration and T cell activation in the liver. In conclusion, blockade of immune checkpoints PD-1, CTLA-4, and IDO1 act synergistically to enhance T cell infiltration and activity in the liver, leading to hepatocyte death."
https://openalex.org/W2946475306,"Herbivores have important impacts on ecological and ecosystem dynamics. Population density and species composition are both important determinants of these impacts. Large herbivore communities are shifting in many parts of the world driven by changes in livestock management and exploitation of wild populations. In this study, we analyse changes in large herbivore community structure over 66 years in Norway, with a focus on the contribution of wildlife and livestock. We calculate metabolic biomass of all large-herbivore species across the whole region between 1949 and 2015. Temporal and spatial patterns in herbivore community change are investigated and we test hypotheses that changes in wildlife biomass are driven by competition with livestock. We find that total herbivore biomass decreased from 1949 to a minimum in 1969 due to decreases in livestock biomass. Increasing wild herbivore populations lead to an increase in total herbivore biomass by 2009. Herbivore communities have thus reverted from a livestock dominated state in 1949 (2% of large herbivore metabolic biomass comprised of wildlife species) to a state with roughly equal wildlife and livestock (48% of metabolic biomass comprised of wildlife species). Declines in livestock biomass were a modest predictor of wildlife increases, suggesting that competition with livestock has not been a major limiting factor of wild herbivore populations over the past decades. Instead there was strong geographic variation in herbivore community change, with milder lowland regions becoming more dominated by wild species, but colder mountain and northern regions remaining dominated by livestock. Our findings indicate that there has been notable rewilding of herbivore communities and herbivore-ecosystem interactions in Norway, particularly in milder lowland regions. However, Norwegian herbivores remain mostly regulated by management, and our findings call for integrated management of wild and domestic herbivores."
https://openalex.org/W2946325123,"Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, is caused by the CGG trinucleotide expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the Fmr1 gene on the X chromosome, which silences the expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP has been shown to bind to a G-rich region within the PSD-95 mRNA, which encodes for the postsynaptic density protein 95, and together with microRNA-125a to mediate the reversible inhibition of the PSD-95 mRNA translation in neurons. The miR-125a binding site within the PSD-95 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) is embedded in a G-rich region bound by FMRP, which we have previously demonstrated folds into two parallel G-quadruplex structures. The FMRP regulation of PSD-95 mRNA translation is complex, being mediated by its phosphorylation. While the requirement for FMRP in the regulation of PSD-95 mRNA translation is clearly established, the exact mechanism by which this is achieved is not known. In this study, we have shown that both unphosphorylated FMRP and its phosphomimic FMRP S500D bind to the PSD-95 mRNA G-quadruplexes with high affinity, whereas only FMRP S500D binds to miR-125a. These results point towards a mechanism by which, depending on its phosphorylation status, FMRP acts as a switch that potentially controls the stability of the complex formed by the miR-125a-guided RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) and PSD-95 mRNA."

Despite their important functions many aspects of lipid droplets biology are still unknown. This is partially due to the current use of exogenous labels to monitor their formation and remodelling by invasive imaging methods. Here, we apply stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to acquire images with high spatial resolution along with resolving capabilities of lipids and proteins and three-dimensional sectioning. Our images and data analysis demonstrate an increase in the number of large (>15μm2) lipid droplets in human adipocyte cells during differentiation process. In addition, spatially-resolved maps of lipids and proteins inside cells and three dimensional reconstructions of lipids at the initial and final steps of adipocyte differentiation are reported, too."
https://openalex.org/W2945832135,"Bacterial communities in human-impacted rivers and streams are exposed to multiple anthropogenic contaminants, which can eventually lead to biodiversity loss and function. The Wonderfonteinspruit catchment area is impacted by operational and abandoned gold mines, farms, and formal and informal settlements. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to characterize bacterial communities in the lower Wonderfonteinspruit and their response to various contaminant sources. The results showed that composition and structure of bacterial communities differed significantly (P<0.05) between less (downstream) and more (upstream) polluted sites. The taxonomic and functional gene dissimilarities significantly correlated with each other, while downstream sites had more distinct functional genes. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria was higher at upstream sites, while Acidobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia were prominent at downstream sites. In addition, upstream sites were rich in genera pathogenic and/or potentially pathogenic to humans. Multivariate and correlation analyses suggest that bacterial diversity was significantly (P<0.05) impacted by pH and heavy metals (cobalt, arsenic, chromium, nickel and uranium). A significant fraction (~14%) of the compositional variation was explained by a combination of anthropogenic inputs, of which mining (~6%) was the main contributor to bacterial community variation. Network analysis indicated that bacterial communities had non-random inter- and intra-phyla associations and that the main taxa showed both positive and negative linkages to environmental parameters. Our results suggest that species sorting, due to environmental parameters, was the main process that structured bacterial communities. Furthermore, upstream sites had higher relative abundances of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation, suggesting stronger removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic compounds. This study provides insights into the influences of anthropogenic land use on bacterial community structure and functions in the lower Wonderfonteinspruit."
https://openalex.org/W2945526271,"We established a collection of 142 Capsicum genotypes from different geographical areas of Ethiopia with the aim of capturing genetic diversity. Morphological traits and high-resolution melting analysis distinguished one Capsicum baccatum, nine Capsicum frutescens and 132 Capsicum annuum accessions in the collection. Measurement of plant growth parameters revealed variation between germplasms in parameters including plant height, stem thickness, internode length, number of side branches, fruit width, and fruit length. Broad-sense heritability was maximum for fruit weight, followed by length and width of leaves. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the panel of 142 Capsicum germplasms and found 2,831,791 genome-wide SNP markers. Among these, we selected 53,284 high-quality SNPs and used them to estimate the level of genetic diversity, population structure, and phylogenetic relationships. From model-based ancestry analysis, the phylogenetic tree and principal-coordinate analysis (PCoA), we identified two distinct genetic populations: one comprising 132 C. annuum accessions and the other comprising the nine C. frutescens accessions. GWAS analysis detected 509 SNP markers that were significantly associated with fruit-, stem- and leaf-related traits. This is the first comprehensive report of the analysis of genetic variation in Ethiopian Capsicum species involving a large number of accessions. The results will help breeders utilize the germplasm collection to improve existing commercial cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2946067544,"Background Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are more likely to be readmitted than patients with other chronic medical conditions, yet knowledge regarding such readmissions is limited. We aimed to determine factors associated with readmission within 30 days of a COPD hospitalization or death with an emphasis on examining aspects of socioeconomic status and specific comorbidities. Methods A population-based cohort study was conducted using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada. All hospitalizations for COPD between 2004 and 2014 were considered. The primary exposures were socioeconomic status as measured by residential instability (an ecologic variable), and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Other domains of socioeconomic status were considered as secondary exposures. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was used to examine the effect of exposures, adjusting for other patient factors, on 30-day readmission or death. Results There were 126,013 patients contributing to 252,756 index COPD hospitalizations from 168 Ontario hospitals. Of these hospitalizations, 19.4% resulted in a readmission and 2.8% resulted in death within 30 days. After adjusting for other factors, readmissions or death were modestly more likely among people with the highest residential instability compared to the lowest (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.09). Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as other aspects of low socioeconomic status also increased readmission or death risk. Interpretation Socioeconomic status, measured in various ways, and many comorbidities predict 30-day readmission or death in patients hospitalized for COPD. Strategies that address these factors may help reduce readmissions and death."
https://openalex.org/W2945129910,"Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a Ca2+-activated nonselective cationic channel involved in a wide variety of physiologic and pathophysiological processes. Bioinformatics analyses of the primary sequence of TRPM4 allowed us to identify a putative motif for interaction with end-binding (EB) proteins, which are microtubule plus-end tracking proteins. Here, we provide novel data suggesting that TRPM4 interacts with EB proteins. We show that mutations of the putative EB binding motif abolish the TRPM4-EB interaction, leading to a reduced expression of the mature population of the plasma membrane channel and instead display an endoplasmic reticulum-associated distribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EB1 and EB2 proteins are required for TRPM4 trafficking and functional activity. Finally, we demonstrated that the expression of a soluble fragment containing the EB binding motif of TRPM4 reduces the plasma membrane expression of the channel and affects TRPM4-dependent focal adhesion disassembly and cell invasion processes.-Blanco, C., Morales, D., Mogollones, I., Vergara-Jaque, A., Vargas, C., Álvarez, A., Riquelme, D., Leiva-Salcedo, E., González, W., Morales, D., Maureira, D., Aldunate, I., Cáceres, M., Varela, D., Cerda, O.

https://openalex.org/W2945786510,"Adequate gut microbiota establishment is important for lifelong health. The aim was to sequentially analyze the gut microbiota establishment in low-birth-weight preterm neonates admitted to a single neonatal intensive care unit during their first 3 weeks of life, comparing two epidemiological scenarios. Seven control infants were recruited, and another 12 during a severe S. marcescens outbreak. Meconium and feces from days 7, 14, and 21 of life were collected. Gut microbiota composition was determined by 16S rDNA massive sequencing. Cultivable isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, with four S. marcescens submitted for whole-genome sequencing. The expected bacterial ecosystem expansion after birth is delayed, possibly related to antibiotic exposure. The Proteobacteria phylum dominates, although with marked interindividual variability. The outbreak group considerably differed from the control group, with higher densities of Escherichia coli and Serratia to the detriment of Enterococcus and other Firmicutes. Curiously, obligate predators were only detected in meconium and at very low concentrations. Genotyping of cultivable bacteria demonstrated the high bacterial horizontal transmission rate that was confirmed with whole-genome sequencing for S. marcescens. Preterm infants admitted at NICU are initially colonized by homogeneous microbial communities, most of them from the nosocomial environment, which subsequently evolve according to the individual conditions. Our results demonstrate the hospital epidemiology pressure, particularly during outbreak situations, on the gut microbiota establishing process."
https://openalex.org/W2946444923,"There is a lack of evidence about the ventilatory efficiency in resistance exercises despite the key role played in endurance exercises. This study aimed to compare the cardiorespiratory, metabolic responses and ventilatory efficiency between half-squat (HS) and cycle ergometer exercises during a constant-load test at the lactate threshold (LT) intensity. Eighteen healthy male participants were randomly assigned in a crossover design to carry out HS or cycle ergometer tests. For the three HS tests, a one repetition maximum (1RM) test was performed first to determine the load (kg) corresponding to the 1RM percentages. In the second test, the incremental HS exercise was carried out to establish the load (kg) at the LT intensity. Finally, a constant-load HS test was performed at the LT intensity. The first cycle ergometer test was incremental loading to determine the intensity in watts corresponding to the LT, followed by a constant-load test at the LT intensity. A recovery time of 48 hours between each test was established. During both constant-load test, cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses were monitored. A significant exercise mode x time interaction effect was only detected in oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate, and blood lactate (p < 0.001). No differences were found between the two types of exercise in ventilatory efficiency (p >0.05). Ventilation (VE) and carbon dioxide were highly correlated (p <0.001) in the cycle ergometer (r = 0.892) and HS (r = 0.915) exercises. In the VO2 efficiency slope (OUES), similarly significant and high correlations (p <0.001) were found between VO2 and log10 VE in the cycle ergometer (r = 0.875) and in the HS (r = 0.853) exercise. Although the cardioventilatory responses were greater in the cycle ergometer test as compared to HS exercise, ventilatory efficiency was very similar between the two exercise modalities in a predominantly aerobic metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2909954038,"Climate and environmental conditions are determinant for coral distribution and their very existence. When changes in such conditions occur, their effects on distribution can be predicted through species distribution models, anticipating suitable habitats for the subsistence of species. Mussismilia harttii is one of the most endangered Brazilian endemic reef-building corals, and in increasing risk of extinction. Herein, species distribution models were used to determine the present and future potential habitats for M. harttii. Estimations were made through the maximum entropy approach, predicting suitable habitat losses and gains by the end of the 21st century. For this purpose, species records published in the last 20 years and current and future environmental variables were correlated. The best models were chosen according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and evaluated through the partial ROC (AUCratio), a new approach which uses independent occurrence data. Both approaches showed that the models performed satisfactorily in predicting potential habitat areas for the species. Future projections were made using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for 2100, with different levels of greenhouse gas emission. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used to model the Future Potential Habitat (FPH) of M. harttii in two different scenarios: stabilization of emissions (RCP 4.5) and increase of emissions (RCP 8.5). According to the results, shallow waters to the south of the study area concentrate most of the current potential habitats for the species. However, in future scenarios, there was a loss of suitable areas in relation to the Current Potential Habitat (RCP 4.5 46% and RCP 8.5 59%), whereas there is a southward shift of the suitable areas. In all scenarios of FPH, the temperature was the variable with the greatest contribution to the models (> 35%), followed by the current velocity (> 33%) and bathymetry (>29%). In contrast, there is an increase of deep (50-75 m) suitable areas FPH scenarios, mainly in the southern portion of its distribution, at Abrolhos Bank (off Espirito Santo State). These deeper sites might serve as refugia for the species in global warming scenarios. Coral communities at such depths would be less susceptible to impacts of climate change on temperature and salinity. However, the deep sea is not free from human impacts and measures to protect deeper ecosystems should be prioritized in environmental policies for Brazilian marine conservation, especially the Abrolhos Bank, due to its importance for M. harttii."
https://openalex.org/W2945150042,"Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is an airborne fungal disease which always destructs leaf and leads to stagnation of grain filling, decreasing of kernel weight, thin seed and yield loss. Winter wheat Huixianhong is a special germplasm with special characteristics of tolerance or resistance against stripe rust. In order to understand the effect on Huixianhong from stripe rust, we designed two kinds of treatment, inoculation of stripe rust fungi (IH) and artificial immune by bactericide (CK) to study the dynamic of disease process, the grain filling and the thousand-kernel weight (TKW). Our results showed that the incubation period of Hongxinahui was 13.5 days. The prevalence increased from 32.9% at 15 days after jointing to 80.0% at 9 days after booting, and reached to 97.0% at the heading stage. The infection type (IT) was 7 to 9 at the beginning of anthesis. The severity, leaf withered area ratio and disease index at the 15th day after anthesis were 67.17%, 98.17% and 0.6717, respectively. The IH maximum increasing rate of leaf necrosis and chlorosis area was from heading beginning stage to anthesis beginning stage, which increased from 18.66 mm2·d-1 to 21.04 mm2·d-1. The maximum rate of grain filling was 1.25 mg·d-1 at the 18th day after anthesis, which was earlier than that of CK by 3.3 days. The IH thousand-kernel weight Loss (TKWL) was more than that of CK by 6.19%, the stage of heading and amature were 3.0 days and 4.5 days earlier than CK, respectively. The stripe rust infection seriously destructed the photosynthetic function of leaf at the earlier stage of grain filling, i.e. at the beginning of anthesis, which led to the most important biomass loss and the grain filling rate decrease. As far as stripe rust is concerned, Huixianhong is a high susceptible, easily been infected, seriously showing symptoms and most quickly epidemic type but can successfully complete grain filling in high quality. It is a very useful germplasm for creating and selecting special breeding materials against stripe rust."
https://openalex.org/W2945261815,"Introduction In 2015, 4062 unaccompanied minor refugees were registered in Berlin, Germany. According to national policies, basic clinical examination and tuberculosis (TB) screening is a prerequisite to admission to permanent accommodation and schooling for every refugee. This article evaluates the use of an interferon-γ-release-assay (IGRA) during the initial examination and TB screening of 970 unaccompanied minor refugees. Results IGRA test were obtained during TB screening for 301 (31.0%) of 970 adolescents not previously screened for TB. Positive IGRA results were obtained in 13.9% (42/301). Most of the 42 IGRA-positive refugees originated from Afghanistan or Syria (n?20 and 10 respectively). Two IGRA-positive adolescents were lost to follow-up, 2 were diagnosed with TB and the remaining 38 diagnosed with latent TB infection (LTBI). Demographic features of the 40 patients with positive IGRA result were as follows: 39 male, median age 16.8 years (IQR 16.0–17.2y), none meeting underweight criteria (median BMI 21.3kg/m2). On initial chest X-ray 2/40 participants had signs of active TB, while in 38 active disease was excluded and the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) made. Active hepatitis B-co-infection was diagnosed in 3/38 patients. All patients with LTBI received Isoniazid and Rifampicin for 3 months without occurrence of severe adverse events. The most frequently observed side effect was transient upper abdominal pain (n = 5). Asymptomatic elevation of liver transaminases was seen in 2 patients. 29 patients completed treatment with no signs of TB disease at the end of chemoprevention and 9 were lost to follow up. Conclusion Screening for TB infection in minor refugees was feasible in our setting with a relatively high rate of TB infection detected. Chemopreventive treatment was tolerated well regardless of underlying hepatitis-B-status. Minor refugees migrating to Germany should be screened for TB infection, instead of TB disease only, regardless of the background TB incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2946014949,"Background Administrative data are used to examine variation in thirty-day mortality across health services in several jurisdictions. Hospital performance measurement may be error-prone as information about disease severity is not typically available in routinely collected data to incorporate into case-mix adjusted analyses. Using ischaemic stroke as a case study, we tested the extent to which accounting for disease severity impacts on hospital performance assessment. Methods We linked all recorded ischaemic stroke admissions between July, 2011 and June, 2014 to death registrations and a measure of stroke severity obtained at first point of patient contact with health services, across New South Wales, Australia’s largest health service jurisdiction. Thirty-day hospital standardised mortality ratios were adjusted for either comorbidities, as is typically done, or for both comorbidities and stroke severity. The impact of stroke severity adjustment on mortality ratios was determined using 95% and 99% control limits applied to funnel plots and by calculating the change in rank order of hospital risk adjusted mortality rates. Results The performance of the stroke severity adjusted model was superior to incorporating comorbidity burden alone (c-statistic = 0.82 versus 0.75; N = 17,700 patients, 176 hospitals). Concordance in outlier classification was 89% and 97% when applying 95% or 99% control limits to funnel plots, respectively. The sensitivity rates of outlier detection using comorbidity adjustment compared with gold-standard severity and comorbidity adjustment was 74% and 83% with 95% and 99% control limits, respectively. Corresponding positive predictive values were 74% and 91%. Hospital rank order of risk adjusted mortality rates shifted between 0 to 22 places with severity adjustment (Median = 4.0, Inter-quartile Range = 2–7). Conclusions Rankings of mortality rates varied widely depending on whether stroke severity was taken into account. Funnel plots yielded largely concordant results irrespective of severity adjustment and may be sufficiently accurate as a screening tool for assessing hospital performance."
https://openalex.org/W2944912212,"Populus deltoides Marsh has high ornamental value because its leaves remain yellow during the non-dormant period. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of leaf coloration in P. deltoides Marsh. Thus, we analyzed the physiological and transcriptional differences of yellow leaves (mutant) and green leaves (wild-type) of P. deltoides Marsh. Physiological experiments showed that the contents of chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid were lower in mutant leaves, and the flavonoid content did not differ significantly between mutant and wild-type leaves. Transcriptomic sequencing was further used to identify 153 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional classifications based on Gene Ontology enrichment and Genome enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were involved in Chl biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Among these, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (CHLP) genes associated with Chl biosynthesis showed down-regulation, while chlorophyllase (CLH) genes associated with Chl degradation were up-regulated in yellow leaves. The expression levels of these genes were further confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, the estimation of the main precursors of Chl confirmed that CHLP is a vital enzyme for the yellow leaf color phenotype. Consequently, the formation of yellow leaf color is due to the disruption of Chl synthesis or catabolism rather than flavonoid synthesis. These results contribute to our understanding of mechanisms and regulation of leaf color variation in poplar at the transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2952916234,"The mitochondrial outer membrane protein Mitochondrial Fission Factor (Mff) plays a key role in both physiological and pathological fission. It is well established that at stressed or functionally impaired mitochondria, PINK1 recruits the ubiquitin ligase Parkin which ubiquitinates Mff and other mitochondrial outer membrane proteins to facilitate the removal of defective mitochondria and maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial network. Here we show that, in addition to this clearance pathway, Parkin also ubiquitinates Mff in a PINK1-dependent manner under non-stressed conditions to regulate constitutive Mff turnover. We further show that removing Parkin via shRNA-mediated knockdown does not completely prevent Mff ubiquitination under these conditions, indicating that at least one other ubiquitin ligase contributes to Mff proteostasis. These data suggest that that Parkin plays a role in physiological maintenance of mitochondrial membrane protein composition in unstressed cells through constitutive low-level activation."
https://openalex.org/W2945502516,"Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated the reciprocal relationship between the development of cancer and Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. To identify this relationship, we first compared lung tumor growth in parkin knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. Parkin KO mice showed decreased lung tumor growth and increased expression of p21, a cell cycle arrester, as compared with WT mice. We also found that parkin interacts with p21, resulting in its degradation; however, parkin KO, knockdown, as well as mutation (R275W or G430D) reduced the degradation of p21. We investigated whether parkin KO increases the association of p21 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or CDK2 by reducing p21 degradation, and, thus, arresting the cell cycle. The interaction between p21 and PCNA or CDK2 was also enhanced by parkin knockdown, and this increased interaction induced sub G0/G1 arrest, leading to cell death. Therefore, our data indicate that parkin KO reduces the development of lung tumors via cell cycle arrest by blocking the degradation of p21. These findings suggest that PD could be associated with lower lung cancer incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2945507316,"The lipophilic electron-transport cofactor rhodoquinone (RQ) facilitates anaerobic metabolism in a variety of bacteria and selected eukaryotic organisms in hypoxic environments. We have shown that an intact rquA gene in Rhodospirillum rubrum is required for RQ production and efficient growth of the bacterium under anoxic conditions. While the explicit details of RQ biosynthesis have yet to be fully delineated, ubiquinone (Q) is a required precursor to RQ in R. rubrum, and the RquA gene product is homologous to a class I methyltransferase. In order to identify any additional requirements for RQ biosynthesis or factors influencing RQ production in R. rubrum, we performed transcriptome analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in anoxic, illuminated R. rubrum cultures, compared with those aerobically grown in the dark. To further select target genes, we employed a bioinformatics approach to assess the likelihood that a given differentially expressed gene under anoxic conditions may also have a direct role in RQ production or regulation of its levels in vivo. Having thus compiled a list of candidate genes, nine were chosen for further study by generation of knockout strains. RQ and Q levels were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and rquA gene expression was measured using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In one case, Q and RQ levels were decreased relative to wild type; in another case, the opposite effect was observed. These results comport with the crucial roles of rquA and Q in RQ biosynthesis, and reveal the existence of potential modulators of RQ levels in R. rubrum."
https://openalex.org/W2944937108,"Many adults with IgG subclass deficiency (IgGSD) experience long intervals of frequent/severe respiratory tract infection before IgGSD diagnosis, but reasons for delays in IgGSD diagnoses are incompletely understood. We performed a retrospective study of 300 white adults (ages ≥18 y) with IgGSD including frequency analyses of age at IgGSD diagnosis, duration of frequent/severe respiratory tract infection before IgGSD diagnosis, and age at onset of frequent/severe infection (calculated). We performed multivariable regressions on age at diagnosis, infection duration, and age at infection onset using these variables, as appropriate: sex; age at diagnosis; diabetes; autoimmune condition(s); atopy; allergy; corticosteroid use; body mass index; serum immunoglobulin isotype levels; blood lymphocyte subsets; three IgGSD-associated human leukocyte antigen-A and -B haplotypes; and referring physician specialties. Mean age at diagnosis was 50 ± 12 (standard deviation) y (median 50 y (range 19–79)). There were 247 women (82.3%). Mean infection duration at IgGSD diagnosis was 12 ± 13 y (median 7 y (range 1–66)). Mean age at infection onset was 38 ± 16 y (median 38 y (range 4, 76)). Age at infection onset was ≥18 y in 95.7% of subjects. Regressions on age at diagnosis and infection duration revealed no significant associations. Regression on age at infection onset revealed one positive association: age at diagnosis (p <0.0001). We conclude that the median duration of frequent/severe respiratory tract infection in adults before IgGSD diagnosis was 7 y. Older adults may be diagnosed to have IgGSD after longer intervals of infection than younger adults. Duration of frequent/severe respiratory tract infection before IgGSD diagnosis was not significantly associated with routine clinical and laboratory variables, including referring physician specialties."
https://openalex.org/W2945520146,"Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that respond rapidly to a number of stressors to regulate energy transduction, cell death signaling, and reactive oxygen species generation. We hypothesized that mitochondrial remodeling, comprising both structural and functional alterations, following ionizing radiation (IR) may underlie some of the tenets of radiobiology. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are precursors of bone marrow stroma and are altered in acute myeloid leukemia and by radiation and chemotherapy. Here, we report on changes in mitochondrial remodeling in human MSCs following X-ray IR. Mitochondrial function was significantly increased in MSCs 4 h after IR as measured by mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Consistent with this elevated functional effect, electron transport chain supercomplexes were also increased in irradiated samples. In addition, mitochondria were significantly, albeit modestly, elongated, as measured by high-throughput automated confocal imaging coupled with automated mitochondrial morphometric analyses. We also demonstrate in fibroblasts that mitochondrial remodeling is required for the adaptation of cells to IR. To determine novel mechanisms involved in mitochondrial remodeling, we performed quantitative proteomics on isolated mitochondria from cells following IR. Label-free quantitative mitochondrial proteomics revealed notable changes in proteins in irradiated samples and identified prosaposin, and potentially its daughter protein saposin-B, as a potential candidate for regulating mitochondrial function following IR. Whereas research into the biologic effects of cellular irradiation has long focused on nuclear DNA effects, our experimental work, along with that of others, is finding that mitochondrial effects may have broader implications in the field of stress adaptation and cell death in cancer (including leukemia) and other disease states.-Patten, D.

https://openalex.org/W2952709402,"Lignocellulosic biomass offers a sustainable source for biofuel production that does not compete with food-based cropping systems. Importantly, two critical bottlenecks prevent economic adoption: many industrially relevant microorganisms cannot ferment pentose sugars prevalent in lignocellulosic medium, leaving a significant amount of carbon unutilized. Furthermore, chemical biomass pretreatment required to release fermentable sugars generates a variety of toxins, which inhibit microbial growth and metabolism, specifically limiting pentose utilization in engineered strains. Here we dissected genetic determinants of anaerobic xylose fermentation and stress tolerance in chemically pretreated corn stover biomass, called hydrolysate. We previously revealed that loss-of-function mutations in the stress-responsive MAP kinase HOG1 and negative regulator of the RAS/Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway, IRA2, enhances anaerobic xylose fermentation. However, these mutations likely reduce cells’ ability to tolerate the toxins present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate, making the strain especially vulnerable to it. We tested the contributions of Hog1 and PKA signaling via IRA2 or PKA negative regulatory subunit BCY1 to metabolism, growth, and stress tolerance in corn stover hydrolysate and laboratory medium with mixed sugars. We found mutations causing upregulated PKA activity increase growth rate and glucose consumption in various media but do not have a specific impact on xylose fermentation. In contrast, mutation of HOG1 specifically increased xylose usage. We hypothesized improving stress tolerance would enhance the rate of xylose consumption in hydrolysate. Surprisingly, increasing stress tolerance did not augment xylose fermentation in lignocellulosic medium in this strain background, suggesting other mechanisms besides cellular stress limit this strain’s ability for anaerobic xylose fermentation in hydrolysate."
https://openalex.org/W2945942267,"The optimal strategy to ensure chest compression quality for patients being transported on a stretcher has not been established yet. We hypothesised that straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation may improve chest compression quality in patients being transported on stretchers. We conducted a prospective randomised crossover study using manikins to investigate whether straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation improves chest compression quality (depth, recoil, rate, correct hand position) performed on patients during stretcher transportation compared to walking cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Walking and straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation were performed for 2 minutes each. The mean chest compression depth (mm) for 2 minutes was significantly greater in the straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation group than in the walking cardiopulmonary resuscitation group (median, 51.3 [interquartile range, 46.7–55.5] versus 40.9 [34.6–50.1], P = 0.003). An adequate depth of chest compressions could not be achieved when walking cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed by female participants, but the depth of chest compressions was within the acceptable range when female participants performed straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation. On the other hand, the degree of deterioration was relatively small in male participants, even when they performed walking cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In patients with cardiac arrest being transported on a stretcher, straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation improved the depth of chest compressions compared to walking cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Female rescuers, in particular, may consider using straddling cardiopulmonary resuscitation."
https://openalex.org/W2946238297,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor frequently present in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Additionally, moderate and severe OSA are highly prevalent in patients with cardiac disease, as they increase the riskfor cardiovascular events by 80%. The gold standard diagnostic method for OSA is overnight polysomnography (PSG), which remains unaffordable for the overall population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) is anuseful tool for assessing the risk of OSA in patients with MetS.97 patients, previously untreated and recently diagnosed with MetS (National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III, ATP-III) underwent a PSG. OSA was characterized by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). BQ was administered before PSG and we evaluated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy.Of the 97 patients with MetS, 81 patients had OSA, with 47 (48.5%) presenting moderate and severe OSA. For all MetS with OSA (AHI≥5 events/hour), the BQ showed good sensitivity (0.65, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.76) and fair specificity (0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.65) with a positive predictive value of 0.84, a negative predictive value of 0.18 and an 84% accuracy. Similarly, for moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15 events/hour) we found good sensitivity (0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.85) and fair specificity (0.40, 95% CI 0.27-0.55). Interestingly, for severe OSA (AHI≥30 events/hour), there was a very good sensitivity (0.91, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) and moderate specificity (0.42, 95% CI 0.31-0.54).The BQ is a valid tool for screening the risk of OSA in MetS patients in general, and it is particularly useful in predicting severe OSA."
https://openalex.org/W2951872332,"Clinical observations show emergence of agitation and hyperactivity during the anesthesia induction and/or recovery period post-anesthesia. However, an animal model to illustrate this clinical phenomenon has not yet been established. We therefore set out to investigate whether sevoflurane, a commonly used anesthetic, could alter locomotion in mice during the anesthesia induction and recovery period post-anesthesia. The activity of the mice was recorded 5 minutes before, during (for 30 minutes), and 40 minutes after the administration of the anesthetic sevoflurane [1-, 1.5- and 2-fold minimum alveolar concentration] at 370 C. The total walking distance and velocity of movement were measured and quantified as the indexes of locomotion. We found that the anesthetic sevoflurane increased the locomotion of the mice during the induction period of the anesthesia. During the recovery phase after anesthesia, the mice exhibited increased locomotion for a short period of time (about 5 minutes) and then displayed a sharp decrease in mobility for up to 60 minutes following the end of anesthesia administration. The anesthetic sevoflurane did not significantly alter the food intake and body weight of the mice. Furthermore, we found that Alzheimer’s disease transgenic mice exhibited a greater degree of sevoflurane-induced hyperactivity than the wild-type mice did. Our results showed that inhalation of the anesthetic sevoflurane induced an acute hyperactivity in mice, particularly among Alzheimer’s disease transgenic mice. These findings from the pilot studies have established an animal model to promote further studies into postoperative emergence agitation, hyperactivity and the underlying mechanisms into these conditions."

This study assessed the association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Study design A retrospective cohort study using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. Settings and participants Our study included patients with type 2 diabetes who received OHAs between March 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. All eligible subjects were classified into CKD and non-CKD cohorts and further categorized as the DPP-4i and non-DPP-4i users in each cohort. Methods The DPP-4i and non-DPP-4i groups were matched 1:1 by propensity score to attenuate potential selection bias. Propensity score was estimated by logistic regression, using demographics, co-medications, comorbidities. and adapted diabetic complication severity index at baseline. Outcomes Outcomes of interest included a composite endpoint of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiac events [MACE]), and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). COX proportional hazard models were applied to examine the association between DPP-4i and outcomes of interest. Results We identified 37,641 and 87,604 patients with type 2 diabetes with and without CKD, respectively. After propensity score matching, 8,213 pairs of CKD patients and 12,313 pairs of non-CKD patients were included for analysis. In the CKD cohort, DPP-4i were associated with a 25% increased risk of hHF (DPP-4i vs. non-DPP-4i incidence/1,000 person-years: 15.0 vs. 9.9, HR = 1.25; 95% CI 1.01–1.54, p = 0.037) but not with the risk of MACE (HR = 0.89, p = 0.144). In the non-CKD cohort, DPP-4i were associated with a lower risk of MACE (DPP-4i vs. non-DPP-4i incidence/1,000 person-years: 9.8 vs. 12.6 HR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.61–0.87, p = 0.0007), but not the risk of hHF (HR = 1.09, p = 0.631). Conclusions DPP-4i were found to be associated with decreased risk of MACE in the non-CKD cohort in our study. However, DPP-4i were associated with increased risk of hHF in the CKD cohort. DPP-4i in the CKD cohort should be used cautiously."
https://openalex.org/W2946829331,"Nitrification, the microbial oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2–) and NO2– to nitrate (NO3–), plays a vital role in ocean nitrogen cycling. Characterizing the distribution of nitrifying organisms over environmental gradients can help predict how nitrogen availability may change with shifting ocean conditions, for example, due to loss of dissolved oxygen (O2). We characterized the distribution of nitrifiers at 5 depths spanning the oxic to hypoxic zone of the offshore Benguela upwelling system above the continental slope off Namibia. Based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, the proportional abundance of nitrifiers (ammonia and nitrite oxidizers) increased with depth, driven by an increase in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA; Thaumarchaeota) to up to 33% of the community at hypoxic depths where O2 concentrations fell to ~25 μM. The AOA community transitioned from being dominated by a few members at oxic depths to a more even representation of taxa in the hypoxic zone. In comparison, the community of NO2–-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), composed primarily of Nitrospinae, was far less abundant and exhibited higher evenness at all depths. The AOA:NOB ratio declined with depth from 41:1 in the oxic zone to 27:1 under hypoxia, suggesting potential variation in the balance between NO2– production and consumption via nitrification. Indeed, in contrast to prior observations from more O2-depleted sites closer to shore, NO2– did not accumulate at hypoxic depths near this offshore site, potentially due in part to a tightened coupling between AOA and NOB."
https://openalex.org/W2945105917,"We examined copulatory behaviour in the Bonelli´s Eagle (Aquila fasciata) at nesting sites in the eastern zone of the Baetic Cordillera, southern Spain, between 2010 and 2012. We observed the copulatory behaviour of 15 pairs during the pre-laying period. Bonelli´s Eagles commenced sexual activity ca. 69 days before egg-laying. Ninety-six percent of mounting attempts were successful. Bonelli´s Eagle pairs averaged 99.8 copulation attempts per clutch, with an average copulation frequency of 0.86 copulation attempts per day. Pairs displayed a daily bimodal pattern of copulation activity, with copulations occurring most frequently in the evening. We used our data to test three predictions with regard to the paternity assurance hypothesis. Prediction 1, that within-pair copulations increase with local breeding density, was rejected because our models showed no evidence for it. Prediction 2, that within-pair copulations increase during the female fertile period, was marginally supported. Finally, Prediction 3, that mate attendance increases during the female fertile period, was also rejected because mate-guarding did not increase as the fertile period approached. However, mate-guarding was positively correlated with within-pair copulation frequency. Moderate copulation rates compared to other raptors and the absence of mate-guarding suggest that, in the study area, Bonelli´s Eagles exhibit only partially adaptive behaviour to assure their paternity. A possible explanation could be related to the low number of extra-pair encounters observed (opportunities for which appear to be rare), although the gradual increase in within-pair copulations during the female fertile period is consistent with the sperm competition hypothesis. The results are discussed based on the signalling hypothesis, which proposes that raptors signal territory ownership to conspecifics, and possibly to other raptor species, by copulating frequently and conspicuously in the defended nesting area."
https://openalex.org/W2945148120,"As burn injuries are a major cause of death and infirmity, successful service delivery is vital in health systems. In Iran, a few specialised burns hospitals (SBHs) located in big provinces provide burn services in which burn patients with more severe conditions are referred to. However, SBHs are faced with several challenges for delivering due treatment for burn patients. So, for the first time in Iran, the main aim of the study was to identify the challenges of delivering burn services in SBHs. For this purpose, we conducted a qualitative study during February 2017 to April 2018. Key informants were purposefully selected and interviewed at national and provincial levels from the Ministry of Health, medical universities, and informants working in eight SBHs. The saturation point was reached at 21 face-to-face semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis approach was employed to analyse transcribed documents assisted by MAXQDA Plus version 12. Our results reveal four themes and twelve subthemes on the challenges of delivering services in SBHs. Themes and (subthemes) including burn care continuum (preventive care, pre-hospital care, hospital care, follow-up, and home care), regionalisation of burning services (access to other specialties and medical services, access to specialized care in provinces without a SBH, standardised regionalisation system for burn related services (BRSs), costs of providing BRSs (expensive services and supplies and long hospitalisation), and non-compliance with standardised care (guidelines to provide burn care and physical space to provide BRSs). Results suggest that improving BRSs delivery in Iran may be reached by strengthening burn care continuum, regionalising burn care, allocating sufficient budgets to burn services and formulating burn care guidelines. These policy actions can be better addressed via intra-sectoral collaborations."

This study aimed to determine the evolution of the HIV transmission rate in children from 2008 to 2015 and to analyze associated factors, particularly the mother's treatment status and/or child's prophylaxis status and the feeding mode.The data were analyzed using EID reports from the reference laboratory. Information related to sociodemographic characteristics, HIV profiles, the mother's treatment status, the child's prophylaxis status, and the feeding mode was included. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.During the study period, a total of 5418 samples (5020 DBS and 398 buffy coat) from 168 primary prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) intervention sites in Senegal were tested. The samples were collected from 4443 children with a median age of 8 weeks (1-140 weeks) and a sex ratio (M/F) of 1.1 (2309/2095). One-third (35.2%; N = 1564) of the children were tested before 6 weeks of age. Twenty percent (N = 885) underwent molecular diagnostic testing more than once. An increased number of mothers receiving treatment (57.4%; N = 2550) and children receiving prophylaxis (52.1%; N = 2315) for protection against HIV infection during breastfeeding was found over the study period. The transmission rate decreased from 14.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4-18.3) in 2008 to 4.1% (95% CI: 2.5-7.5) in 2015 (p < 0.001). However, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independent predictors of HIV mother-to-child transmission included lack of mother's treatment (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.9-7.7; p˂0.001), lack of child's prophylaxis (aOR = 7.8, 95% CI: 1.7-35.7; p = 0.009), infant age at diagnosis (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1-4.3 for ≤6 weeks versus 12-24 weeks; p = 0.025) and protective effect of breastfeeding on ART against formula feeding (aOR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.7; p = 0.005).This study demonstrates the effectiveness of PMTCT interventions in Senegal but indicates also that increased efforts should be continued to reduce the MTCT rate to less than 2%."

A total of 43 Japanese post-menopausal ER-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative invasive breast cancer patients with tumors >2 cm or positive lymph nodes were enrolled. Exemestane alone was administered for 2 months. Neoadjuvant chemo-endocrine therapy included four cycles of doxorubicin plus paclitaxel followed by weekly paclitaxel. The immunohistochemical expression of Ki67 LI, CCND1, and PgR, and ER activity were evaluated using core needle biopsy samples at the pretreatment and post-exemestane alone stages. ER activity was evaluated through transfection of an adenovirus vector carrying an estrogen-response element-green fluorescent protein gene. In current study, marked pathological responses (including 4.7% with pathological complete response) were obtained in 34.9% of patients. Ki67 LI and PgR expression were significantly decreased after treatment. High Ki67 LI at pretreatment was a significant predictive factor of marked pathological response. At the stage of post-exemestane alone, Ki67 LI was not significantly associated with pathological response; however, high CCND1 expression was significantly correlated with high Ki67 LI. Moreover, low-level ER activity at the post-exemestane alone stage was significantly associated with marked pathological response. In conclusions, pretreatment Ki67 LI was a predictor of response to neoadjuvant chemo-endocrine therapy. CCND1 expression and ER activity at the post-endocrine therapy alone stage may be useful in determining further treatments."

To promote quality of nursing care of cervical cancer, we need to explore their perceptions and nursing experience in doing cervical-cancer care. This study was a qualitative descriptive design. Interviews were conducted with 14 registered nurses. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analyzed. Content analysis was performed. Fourteen nurses who had been working at wards and cancer education centers were recruited in this study. Nine key themes emerged from three categories such as nurses’ awareness of cervical cancer, awareness of cervical cancer patient and caring experience. Nurses expressed fear of cervical cancer and helplessness in the face of a life-threatening prognosis. Nurses stated that they might have prejudice about cervical cancer, since it is caused by a sexually transmitted disease. They also recalled that patients with cervical cancer were more sensitive and demanding. Our findings provide a comprehensive and in-depth perspective in understanding the experience of caring for cervical cancer patients. Clinical nurses showed complex emotional reactions to cervical cancer, and expressed prejudice against the sex life of cervical-cancer patients. More education is required to ensure that clinical nurses can provide a nurse-led intervention with patients by managing nurses’ fear, prejudice, and the care burden."

We find that the redistributive pressure exerted via the possibility of receiving a claim increases altruism, while the possibility of hiding from such claim reduces it. Our results indicate that sharing norms are crucial drivers of giving to other members of the network. We also find that pressure to share has a detrimental effect on the undertaking of profitable but risky investments."

Using data from a previously conducted study, a linear regression model was constructed to predict the aquatic development rates based on the average temperature, temperature fluctuation range, and larval density. Additional experiments were conducted with different parameters of average temperature and larval density to validate the model. Using a paired t-test, the model predictions were compared to experimental data and showed that the prediction models were not significantly different for average pupation rate, adult emergence rate, and juvenile mortality rate. The models developed will be useful for modeling and estimating the upper limit of the number of Aedes aegypti in the environment under different temperature, diurnal temperature variations, and larval densities."
https://openalex.org/W2945830941,"Introduction Fall is common after stroke. The Short-form Physiological Profile Assessment (S-PPA) was developed to assess the fall risks and underlying physiological factors, and it has been used in healthy older adults and older adults with stroke. This study aimed to establish the psychometric properties of the S-PPA among cognitively intact and ambulant community-dwelling older adults with stroke. Methods The S-PPA, Chinese version of the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC-C) scale and 3 balance measures, namely the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed “Up & Go” (TUG) and Functional Reach Test (FRT), were administered. Inter- and intra-rater reliability were assessed at baseline and after a 1-week interval, respectively. The validity of the S-PPA was assessed through correlations with balance measures and the ABC-C and by comparing the S-PPA scores between the stroke and healthy groups and between fallers and non-fallers in the stroke group. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the ability of balance measures to distinguish fall status in the stroke group. Results The S-PPA yielded good inter-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.83) and moderate intra-rater reliability (ICC = 0.74), correlated significantly with the 3 balance measures (rho = 0.49–0.70) and ABC-C (rho = 0.35) and revealed significant differences between stroke survivors and controls and between stroke survivors with and without a fall history. However, the ROC analysis revealed that the S-PPA had a poor ability to distinguish the fall statuses of community-dwelling stroke survivors. Conclusions The S-PPA is reliable and valid for evaluating fall risks but cannot adequately distinguish the fall statuses of stroke survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2945576189,"Background and aims Dronedarone is a new multichannel-blocking antiarrhythmic for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation. Our group has demonstrated that dronedarone produces regression of cardiac remodeling; however, its effect on the remodeling of the elastic arteries has not yet been reported. We aim to assess the effects of dronedarone on the regression of thoracic aortic remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Method Ten-month-old male SHRs were randomly assigned to an intervention group (SHR-D), where the animals received dronedarone treatment (100 mg/kg), to a control group (SHR) where rats were given vehicle, or to a group (SHR-A) where they were given amiodarone. A fourth group of normotensive control rats (Wistar-Kyoto rats, WKY) was also added. After two weeks of treatment, we studied the structure, the elastic fiber content of the thoracic aorta using histological techniques and confocal microscopy, and the vascular mechanical properties using an organ bath and isometric tension analysis. A mass spectrometric determination of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations was performed. Results SHR group developed the classic remodeling expected from the experimental model: outward hypertrophic remodeling, increased elastic fiber content and wall stiffness. However, the SHR-D group showed statistically significantly lower values for aortic tunica media thickness, wall to lumen ratio, external diameter, cross-sectional area, volume density of the elastic fibers, wall stiffness, and aortic SDMA concentration when compared to the SHR group. These parameters were similar in the SHR and SHR-A groups. Interestingly, the values for tunica media thickness, volume density of the elastic fibers, wall stiffness, and SDMA concentration obtained from the SHR-D group were similar to those measured in the WKY group. Conclusion These results suggest that dronedarone improves the structure and passive mechanical properties of the thoracic aorta in hypertensive rats, and that this protective effect could be associated with a reduction in the concentration of aortic SDMA."
https://openalex.org/W2945588265,"When one views a square-wave grating and dichoptically changes the average luminance or contrast of the monocular images, at least three perceptual phenomena might occur. These are the Venetian blind effect, or a perceived rotation of the bars around individual vertical axes; binocular luster, or a perceived shimmering; and binocular rivalry, or an alternating perception between the views of the two eyes. Perception of luster and rivalry occur when the ""light bars"" in the grating dichoptically straddle the background luminance (one eye's image has a higher luminance than the background and the other eye's image has a lower luminance than the background), with little impact from the ""dark bars."" Perception of rotation, on the other hand, is related to average luminance or contrast disparity, independent of whether or not the ""light bars"" straddle the background luminance. The patterns for perceived rotation versus binocular luster and binocular rivalry suggest at least two separate mechanisms in the visual system for processing luminance and contrast information over and above their differing physiological states suggested by their different appearances. While luster and rivalry depend directly on the relation between stimuli and the background, perceived rotation depends on the magnitude of the luminance or contrast disparity, as described by the generalized difference model."
