https://openalex.org/W4289262011,"Rare copy-number variants (rCNVs) include deletions and duplications that occur infrequently in the global human population and can confer substantial risk for disease. In this study, we aimed to quantify the properties of haploinsufficiency (i.e., deletion intolerance) and triplosensitivity (i.e., duplication intolerance) throughout the human genome. We harmonized and meta-analyzed rCNVs from nearly one million individuals to construct a genome-wide catalog of dosage sensitivity across 54 disorders, which defined 163 dosage sensitive segments associated with at least one disorder. These segments were typically gene dense and often harbored dominant dosage sensitive driver genes, which we were able to prioritize using statistical fine-mapping. Finally, we designed an ensemble machine-learning model to predict probabilities of dosage sensitivity (pHaplo & pTriplo) for all autosomal genes, which identified 2,987 haploinsufficient and 1,559 triplosensitive genes, including 648 that were uniquely triplosensitive. This dosage sensitivity resource will provide broad utility for human disease research and clinical genetics."

https://openalex.org/W4289518185,"Polar auxin transport is unique to plants and coordinates their growth and development1,2. The PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporters exhibit highly asymmetrical localizations at the plasma membrane and drive polar auxin transport3,4; however, their structures and transport mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report three inward-facing conformation structures of Arabidopsis thaliana PIN1: the apo state, bound to the natural auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and in complex with the polar auxin transport inhibitor N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). The transmembrane domain of PIN1 shares a conserved NhaA fold5. In the substrate-bound structure, IAA is coordinated by both hydrophobic stacking and hydrogen bonding. NPA competes with IAA for the same site at the intracellular pocket, but with a much higher affinity. These findings inform our understanding of the substrate recognition and transport mechanisms of PINs and set up a framework for future research on directional auxin transport, one of the most crucial processes underlying plant development."

https://openalex.org/W4289336429,"We used viral intersectional tools to map the entire projectome of corticospinal neurons associated with fine distal forelimb control in Fischer 344 rats and rhesus macaques. In rats, we found an extraordinarily diverse set of collateral projections from corticospinal neurons to 23 different brain and spinal regions. Remarkably, the vast weighting of this “motor” projection was to sensory systems in both the brain and spinal cord, confirmed by optogenetic and transsynaptic viral intersectional tools. In contrast, rhesus macaques exhibited far heavier and narrower weighting of corticospinal outputs toward spinal and brainstem motor systems. Thus, corticospinal systems in macaques primarily constitute a final output system for fine motor control, whereas this projection in rats exerts a multi-modal integrative role that accesses far broader CNS regions. Unique structural-functional correlations can be achieved by mapping and quantifying a single neuronal system’s total axonal output and its relative weighting across CNS targets."
https://openalex.org/W4289637525,"Music is increasingly being recognised as an adjuvant treatment for pain management. Music can help to decrease the experience of both chronic and experimental pain. Cognitive agency has been identified as a specific mechanism that may mediate the analgesic benefits of music engagement however, it is unclear if this specific mechanism translates to acute pain. Previous attempts to understand the cognitive mechanisms that underpin music analgesia have been predominantly lab-based, limiting the extent to which observed effects may apply to participants’ everyday lives. Addressing these gaps, in naturalistic settings, the present study examined the degree to which cognitive agency (i.e., perceived choice in music), music features (i.e., complexity), and individual levels of musical sophistication were related to perceived pain. In an online global experiment, using a randomised between groups experimental design with two levels for choice (no choice and perceived choice) and two levels for music (high and low complexity), a sample of 286 adults experiencing acute pain reported their pain intensity and pain unpleasantness pre- and post-music listening. A bespoke piece of music was co-created with a commercial artist to enable the manipulation of music complexity while controlling for familiarity, while facilitating an authentic music listening experience. Overall, findings demonstrated that increased perceived control over music is associated with analgesic benefits, and that perceived choice is more important than music complexity. Highlighting the importance of listener engagement, people who reported higher levels of active engagement experienced greater decreases of pain intensity in the perceived choice condition, than those who reported lower levels of active engagement. These findings have implications for both research and practice, emphasising the importance of facilitating freedom of choice, and sustained engagement with music throughout music listening interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4289520798,"By using the data from Chinese listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share market for the period 2007 to 2019 and the Report on the Work of the Government , this paper investigates the impact of the local government’s economic growth target constraints on enterprise technological innovation and its mechanism. It is found that the local government’s economic growth target constraints significantly inhibit enterprise technological innovation, which is more obvious in the samples of SOEs, regulated industries, and enterprises at low marketization levels. The change of government officials’ performance appraisal indicators from the quantity to quality of economic growth can alleviate the negative effect. The mechanism effect test indicates that the local government’s economic growth target constraints will aggravate enterprise financing constraints and decrease the contribution of R&amp;D investment to enterprise performance, and further inhibit enterprise technological innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4289522888,"Different methodologies rely on names, by assuming that people clearly and solely perceive signals of ethnic-national origin from names. This study examines the perception of names from an intersectional perspective in a West-European context. Firstly, we analyze whether people perceive signals of ethnic-national origin in names. Secondly, we test the excludability assumption by analyzing whether names signal also other factors. Thirdly, we distinguish between homogenous and mixed names. For these purposes, we collected data on the perception of 180 names in Belgium of Belgian, Moroccan, Turkish, Polish and Congolese origin. It appears that respondents distinguish Belgian from non-Belgian names rather than perceiving a specific ethnic-national origin. Besides, people perceive signals about a person's gender, religiosity, social class and educational level. This implies that scholars should be precautious with comparing discrimination against ethnic groups, if ethnic-national origin is only signaled through names. Moreover, the question arises as to what we are measuring exactly, since names contain complex signals."
https://openalex.org/W4289517901,"Biocontrol agents applied after fumigation play an important role to the soil microenvironment. We studied the effect of Trichoderma applied after dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) plus chloropicrin (PIC) fumigation on the cucumber growth, soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activity, taxonomic diversity, and yield through laboratory and field experiments. The results confirmed that Trichoderma applied after fumigation significantly improved soil physicochemical properties, cucumber growth, soil-borne pathogens, and soil enzyme activity. Genetic analysis indicated that Trichoderma applied after fumigation significantly increased the relative abundance of Pseudomonas, Humicola and Chaetomium, and significantly decreased the relative abundance of the pathogens Fusarium spp. and Gibberella spp., which may help to control pathogens and enhanced the ecological functions of the soil. Moreover, Trichoderma applied after fumigation obviously improved cucumber yield (up to 35.6%), and increased relative efficacy of soil-borne pathogens (up to 99%) and root-knot nematodes (up to 96%). Especially, we found that Trichoderma applied after fumigation increased the relative abundance of some beneficial microorganisms (such as Sodiomyces and Rhizophlyctis) that can optimize soil microbiome. It is worth noting that with the decline in the impact of the fumigant, these beneficial microorganisms still maintain a higher abundance when the cucumber plants were uprooted. Importantly, we found one tested biocontrol agent Trichoderma 267 identified and stored in our laboratory not only improved cucumber growth, reduced soil-borne diseases in late cucumber growth stages but also optimized micro-ecological environment which may have good application prospect and help to keep environmental healthy and sustainable development."
https://openalex.org/W4289521308,"Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is widely used in the evaluation of acute ischemic stroke patients for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). The stability of CTP core estimation is suboptimal and varies between software packages. We aimed to quantify the volumetric and spatial agreement between the CTP ischemic core and follow-up infarct for four ischemic core estimation approaches using syngo.via.We included successfully reperfused, EVT-treated patients with baseline CTP and 24h follow-up diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) (November 2017-September 2020). Data were processed with syngo.via VB40 using four core estimation approaches based on: cerebral blood volume (CBV)<1.2mL/100mL with and without smoothing filter, relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF)<30%, and rCBF<20%. The follow-up infarct was segmented on DWI.In 59 patients, median estimated CTP core volumes for four core estimation approaches ranged from 12-39 mL. Median 24h follow-up DWI infarct volume was 11 mL. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) showed moderate-good volumetric agreement for all approaches (range 0.61-0.76). Median Dice was low for all approaches (range 0.16-0.21). CTP core overestimation >10mL occurred least frequent (14/59 [24%] patients) using the CBV-based core estimation approach with smoothing filter.In successfully reperfused patients who underwent EVT, syngo.via CTP ischemic core estimation showed moderate volumetric and spatial agreement with the follow-up infarct on DWI. In patients with complete reperfusion after EVT, the volumetric agreement was excellent. A CTP core estimation approach based on CBV<1.2 mL/100mL with smoothing filter least often overestimated the follow-up infarct volume and is therefore preferred for clinical decision making using syngo.via."
https://openalex.org/W4289518029,"Corruption is a global wicked problem that threatens the achievement of health, social and economic development goals, including Sustainable Development Goal # 3: Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all. The COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting strain on health systems has heightened risks of corruption both generally and specifically within health systems. Over the past years, international organizations, including those instrumental to the global COVID-19 response, have increased efforts to address corruption within their operations and related programs. However, as attention to anti-corruption efforts is relatively recent within international organizations, there is a lack of literature examining how these organizations address corruption and the impact of their anti-corruption efforts. This study addresses this gap by examining how accountability, transparency, and anti-corruption are taken up by international organizations within their own operations and the reported outcomes of such efforts. The following international organizations were selected as the focus of this document analysis: the World Health Organization, the Global Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank Group. Documents were identified through a targeted search of each organization’s website. Documents were then analyzed combining elements of content analysis and thematic analysis. The findings demonstrate that accountability and transparency mechanisms have been employed by each of the four international organizations to address corruption. Further, these organizations commonly employed oversight mechanisms, including risk assessments, investigations, and audits to monitor their internal and external operations for fraud and corruption. All organizations used sanction strategies meant to reprimand identified transgressors and deter future corruption. Findings also demonstrate a marked increase in anti-corruption efforts by these international organizations in recent years. Though this is promising, there remains a distinct absence of evidence demonstrating the impact of such efforts on the prevalence and severity of corruption in international organizations."
https://openalex.org/W4289521349,"For pollinators such as bees, nectar mainly provides carbohydrates and pollen provides proteins, amino acids, and lipids to cover their nutritional needs. Here, to examine differences in pollinator resources, we compared the amino acid profiles and total amino acid contents of pollen from 32 common entomophilous plants in seven families. Our results showed that the amino acid profiles and contents in pollen samples differed according to the plant family and the chromatography method used, i.e., high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) versus ion exchange chromatography (IEX). Pollen from Boraginaceae species had the highest total amino acid contents (361.2–504 μg/mg) whereas pollen from the Malvaceae family had the lowest total amino acid contents (136–243.1 μg/mg). Calculating an amino acid score (AAS) that reflects pollen nutritional quality showed that slightly less than half of the species (19 out of 32) had the maximum nutritional score (AAS = 1) and offered high nutritional quality pollen amino acids for bee pollinators. Though they had high total amino acid contents, the amino acid composition of the studied Boraginaceae species and several members of the Fabaceae was not optimal, as their pollen was deficient in some essential amino acids, resulting in suboptimal amino acid scores (AAS &lt; 0.7). Except for cysteine, the measured amino acid contents were higher using IEX chromatography than using HPLC. IEX chromatography is more robust and is to be preferred over HPLC in future amino acid analyses. Moreover, our observations show that some bee-pollinated species fail to provide complete amino acid resources for their pollinators. Although the implications for pollinator behavior remain to be studied, these deficiencies may force pollinators to forage from different species to obtain all nutritionial requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4289596104,"Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) kinase is activated by DNA replication stress and also by various forms of DNA damage, including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Recruitment to sites of damage is insufficient for ATR activation as one of two known ATR activators, either topoisomerase II-binding protein (TOPBP1) or Ewing's tumor-associated antigen 1, must also be present for signaling to initiate. Here, we employ our recently established DSB-mediated ATR activation in Xenopus egg extract (DMAX) system to examine how TOPBP1 is recruited to DSBs, so that it may activate ATR. We report that TOPBP1 is only transiently present at DSBs, with a half-life of less than 10 minutes. We also examined the relationship between TOPBP1 and the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN), CtBP interacting protein (CtIP), and Ataxia Telangiectasia mutated (ATM) network of proteins. Loss of MRN prevents CtIP recruitment to DSBs, and partially inhibits TOPBP1 recruitment. Loss of CtIP has no impact on either MRN or TOPBP1 recruitment. Loss of ATM kinase activity prevents CtIP recruitment and enhances MRN and TOPBP1 recruitment. These findings demonstrate that there are MRN-dependent and independent pathways that recruit TOPBP1 to DSBs for ATR activation. Lastly, we find that both the 9-1-1 complex and MDC1 are dispensable for TOPBP1 recruitment to DSBs."
https://openalex.org/W4289521556,"Alpine meadows are strongly affected by climate change. Increasing air temperature prolongs the growing season and together with changing precipitation patterns alters soil temperature during winter. To estimate the effect of climate change on soil nutrient cycling, we conducted a field experiment. We transferred undisturbed plant-soil mesocosms from two wind-exposed alpine meadows at ~2100 m a.s.l. to more sheltered plots, situated ~300-400 m lower in the same valleys. The annual mean air temperature was 2°C higher at the lower plots and soils that were normally frozen at the original plots throughout winters were warmed to ~0°C due to the insulation provided by continuous snow cover. After two years of exposure, we analyzed the nutrient content in plants, and changes in soil bacterial community, decomposition, mineralization, and nutrient availability. Leaching of N and P from the soils was continuously measured using ion-exchange resin traps. Warming of soils to ~0°C during the winter allowed the microorganisms to remain active, their metabolic processes were not restricted by soil freezing. This change accelerated nutrient cycling, as evidenced by increased soil N and P availability, their higher levels in plants, and elevated leaching. In addition, root exudation and preferential enzymatic mining of P over C increased. However, any significant changes in microbial biomass, bacterial community composition, decomposition rates, and mineralization during the growing season were not observed, suggesting considerable structural and functional resilience of the microbial community. In summary, our data suggest that changes in soil temperature and snow cover duration during winter periods are critical for altering microbially-mediated processes (even at unchanged soil microbial community and biomass) and may enhance nutrient availability in alpine meadows. Consequently, ongoing climate change, which leads to soil warming and decreasing snow insulation, has a potential to significantly alter nutrient cycling in alpine and subalpine meadows compared to the current situation and increase the year-on-year variability in nutrient availability and leaching."
https://openalex.org/W4289525217,"Socioeconomic conditions across the life course may contribute to differences in multimorbidity and polypharmacy in old age. However, whether the risk of multimorbidity changes during ageing and whether life-course socioeconomic conditions are associated with polypharmacy remain unclear. We investigated whether disadvantaged childhood socioeconomic conditions (CSCs) predict increased odds of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in older adults, whether CSCs remain associated when adjusting for adulthood socioeconomic conditions (ACSs), and whether CSCs and ACSs are associated cumulatively over the life course. We used data for 31,432 participants (multimorbidity cohort, mean [SD] age 66·2[9] years), and 21,794 participants (polypharmacy cohort, mean age 69·0[8.9] years) from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (age range 50–96 years). We used mixed-effects logistic regression to assess the associations of CSCs, ASCs, and a life-course socioeconomic conditions score (0–8; 8, most advantaged) with multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (≥5 drugs taken daily). We found an association between CSCs and multimorbidity (reference: most disadvantaged; disadvantaged: odds ratio (OR) = 0·79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·70–0·90; middle: OR = 0·60; 95%CI 0·53–0·68; advantaged: OR = 0·52, 95%CI 0·45–0·60, most advantaged: OR = 0·40, 95%CI 0·34–0·48) but not polypharmacy. This multimorbidity association was attenuated but remained significant after adjusting for ASCs. The life-course socioeconomic conditions score was associated with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We did not find an association between CSCs, life-course socioeconomic conditions, and change in odds of multimorbidity and polypharmacy with ageing. Exposure to disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions in childhood or over the entire life-course could predict multimorbidity in older age."
https://openalex.org/W4289519484,"We previously showed that the matricellular protein CCN5 reverses established cardiac fibrosis (CF) through inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts (MyoFBs) but not in cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts (FBs). In this study, we set out to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CCN5-mediated selective apoptosis of MyoFBs. We first observed that the apoptotic protein p53 and the anti-apoptotic protein NFκB are simultaneously induced in MyoFBs. When the expression level of p53 was suppressed using a siRNA, CCN5 did not induce apoptosis in MyoFBs. By contrast, when NFκB signaling was inhibited using IKK VII, an IκB inhibitor, MyoFBs underwent apoptosis even in the absence of CCN5. SMAD7 is one of the downstream targets of CCN5 and it was previously shown to potentiate apoptosis in epithelial cells through inhibition of NFκB. In accordance with these reports, when the expression of SMAD7 was suppressed using a siRNA, NFκB signaling was enhanced, and CCN5 did not induce apoptosis. Lastly, we used a luciferase reporter construct to show that CCN5 positively regulated SMAD7 expression at the transcriptional level. Collectively, our data suggest that a delicate balance between the two mutually antagonistic proteins p53 and NFκB is maintained for MyoFBs to survive, and CCN5 tips the balance in favor of the apoptotic protein p53. This study provides insight into the anti-fibrotic activity of CCN5 during the regression of CF."
https://openalex.org/W4289519522,"Significant improvement in thiamin retention of canned cat food has not been achieved by altering processing conditions. Some ingredients, such as yeasts, may supply thiamin able to withstand thermal processing. Therefore, the study objective was to evaluate yeast ingredients as thiamin sources for canned cat food. Six yeast ingredients were screened for thiamin content, and values ranged from 9.9–4,283.8 mg/kg dry matter basis (DMB). Treatments for thermal processing were arranged as a 2×4 factorial with 2 levels of vitamin premix (with or without) and 4 yeast ingredients (NY = none and LBV, BY, or EA from the ingredient screening). Replicates (n = 3) were processed in a horizontal still retort to an average lethality of 79.23 minutes. Thiamin degradation was analyzed as a mixed model with pre-retort thiamin content as a covariate and production day as a random effect. Main effects of vitamin premix and yeast and their interaction were significant at P -values less than 0.05. The Fisher’s LSD post hoc comparison test was used to separate means. On average, experimental formulas retained 33.75% thiamin. The main effect of vitamin premix (average -42.9 mg/kg DMB) was not significant ( P &gt; 0.05). Thiamin degradation between NY (-31.3 mg/kg DMB) and BY (-33.8 mg/kg DMB) was similar ( P &gt; 0.05) whereas EA (-40.5 mg/kg DMB) and LBV (-55.6 mg/kg DMB) lost more ( P &lt; 0.05) thiamin than NY. The experimental formula of EA with vitamin premix (-70.3 mg/kg DMB) lost more ( P &lt; 0.05) thiamin than no yeast, BY, or EA without vitamin premix (average -17.4 mg/kg DMB) and all others (average -57.3 mg/kg DMB) were intermediate ( P &gt; 0.05). In summary, thiamin from yeast ingredients didn’t exhibit better thermal stability than thiamin mononitrate. However, those ingredients with similar degradation levels or uniquely high thiamin levels may provide added value."
https://openalex.org/W4289519870,"Although the simple diffusion model can effectively describe the movement of eukaryotic cells on a culture surface observed at relatively low sampling frequency, at higher sampling rates more complex models are often necessary to better fit the experimental data. Currently available models can describe motion paths by involving additional parameters, such as linearity or directional persistence in time. However sometimes difficulties arise as it is not easy to effectively evaluate persistence in presence of a directional bias. Here we present a procedure which helps solve this problem, based on a model which describes displacement as the vectorial sum of three components: diffusion, persistence and directional bias. The described model has been tested by analysing the migratory behaviour of simulated cell populations and used to analyse a collection of experimental datasets, obtained by observing cell cultures in time lapse microscopy. Overall, the method produces a good description of migration behaviour as it appears to capture the expected increase in the directional bias in presence of wound without a large concomitant increase in the persistence module, allowing it to remain as a physically meaningful quantity in the presence of a directional stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W4289521501,"Fungal infection causes deterioration, discoloration, and loss of nutritional values of food products. The use of lactic acid bacteria has diverse applications in agriculture to combat pathogens and to improve the nutritional values of cereal grains. The current research evaluated the potential of Loigolactobacillus coryniformis BCH-4 against aflatoxins producing toxigenic Aspergillus flavus strain. The cell free supernatant (CFS) of Loig. coryniformis was used for the protection of Zea mays L. treated with A. flavus. No fungal growth was observed even after seven days. The FT-IR spectrum of untreated (T1: without any treatment) and treated maize grains (T2: MRS broth + A. flavus; T3: CFS + A. flavus) showed variations in peak intensities of functional group regions of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Total phenolics, flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity of T3 were significantly improved in comparison with T1 and T2. Aflatoxins were not found in T3 while observed in T2 (AFB1 and AFB2 = 487 and 16 ng/g each). HPLC analysis of CFS showed the presence of chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid, salicylic acid, and benzoic acid. The presence of these acids in the CFS of Loig. coryniformis cumulatively increased the antioxidant contents and activity of T3 treated maize grains. Besides, CFS of Loig. coryniformis was passed through various treatments (heat, neutral pH, proteolytic enzymes and catalase), to observe its stability. It suggested that the inhibitory potential of CFS against A. flavus was due to the presence of organic acids, proteinaceous compounds and hydrogen peroxide. Conclusively, Loig. coryniformis BCH-4 could be used as a good bioprotecting agent for Zea mays L. by improving its nutritional and antioxidant contents."
https://openalex.org/W4289522800,"Metabolic depression and dormancy (i.e., stopping/greatly reducing activity and feeding) are strategies used by many animals to survive winter conditions characterized by food shortages and cold temperatures. However, controversy exists on whether the reduced metabolism of some fishes at cold temperatures is due to dormancy alone, or also involves active metabolic depression. Thus, we acclimated winter-dormant cunner [Tautogolabrus adspersus, a north temperate wrasse which in Newfoundland is at the northern limit of its distribution] and winter-active Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to winter (0°C; 8h light: 16h dark) and summer (10°C; 16h light: 8 h dark) conditions, and measured the thermal sensitivity of ATP-producing and O2-consuming processes in isolated liver mitochondria and hepatocytes when exposed in vitro to temperatures from 20 to 0°C and 10 to 0°C, respectively. We found that: 1) liver mitochondrial State 3 respiration and hepatocyte O2 consumption in cunner were only ~ one-third and two-thirds of that measured in salmon, respectively, at all measurement temperatures; 2) cunner mitochondria also have proton conductance and leak respiration (State 4) values that are only approximately one-third of those in salmon; 3) the mitochondria of cunner show a dramatic reduction in respiratory control ratio (from ~ 8 to 3), and a much greater drop in State 3 respiration, between 10 and 5°C (Q10 values in 10- and 0°C-acclimated fish of 14.5 and 141.2, respectively), as compared with salmon (3.9 and 9.6, respectively); and 4) lowering temperature from 5 to 0°C resulted in ~ 40 and 30% reductions in hepatocyte O2 consumption due to non-mitochondrial respiration and Na+-K+-ATPase activity, respectively, in cunner, but not in salmon. Collectively, these results highlight the intrinsic capacity for metabolic depression in hepatocytes and mitochondria of cunner, and clearly suggest that several cellular processes play a role in the reduced metabolic rates exhibited by some fishes at cold temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W4289523504,"Background Buruli ulcer is a tissue necrosis infection caused by an environmental mycobacterium called Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU). The disease is most prevalent in rural areas with the highest rates in West and Central African countries. The bacterium produces a toxin called mycolactone which can lead to the destruction of the skin, resulting in incapacitating deformities with an enormous economic and social burden on patients and their caregivers. Even though there is an effective antibiotic treatment for BU, the control and management rely on early case detection and rapid diagnosis to avert morbidities. The diagnosis of Mycobacterium ulcerans relies on smear microscopy, culture histopathology, and PCR. Unfortunately, all the current laboratory diagnostics have various limitations and are not available in endemic communities. Consequently, there is a need for a rapid diagnostic tool for use at the community health centre level to enable diagnosis and confirmation of suspected cases for early treatment. The present study corroborated the diagnostic performance and utility of fluorescent-thin layer chromatography (f-TLC) for the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer. Methodology/Principal findings The f-TLC method was evaluated for the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in larger clinical samples than previously reported in an earlier preliminary study Wadagni et al. (2015). A total of 449 patients suspected of BU were included in the final data analysis out of which 122 (27.2%) were positive by f-TLC and 128 (28.5%) by PCR. Using a composite reference method generated from the two diagnostic methods, 85 (18.9%) patients were found to be truly infected with M . ulcerans , 284 (63.3%) were uninfected, while 80 (17.8%) were misidentified as infected or noninfected by the two methods. The data obtained was used to determine the discriminatory accuracy of the f-TLC against the gold standard IS 2404 PCR through the analysis of its sensitivity, specificity, positive (+LR), and negative (–LR) likelihood ratio. The positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve Azevedo et al. (2014), and diagnostic odds ratio were used to assess the predictive accuracy of the f-TLC method. The sensitivity of f-TLC was 66.4% (85/128), specificity was 88.5% (284/321), while the diagnostic accuracy was 82.2% (369/449). The AUC stood at 0.774 while the PPV, NPV, +LR, and–LR were 69.7% (85/122), 86.9% (284/327), 5.76, and 0.38, respectively. The use of the rule-of-thumb interpretation of diagnostic tests suggests that the method is good for use as a diagnostic tool. Conclusions/Significance Larger clinical samples than previously reported had been used to evaluate the f-TLC method for the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer. A sensitivity of 66.4%, a specificity of 88.5%, and diagnostic accuracy of 82.2% were obtained. The method is good for diagnosis and will help in making early clinical decisions about the patients as well as patient management and facilitating treatment decisions. However, it requires a slight modification to address the challenge of background interference and lack of automatic readout to become an excellent diagnostic tool."
https://openalex.org/W4289523574,"World Health Organization recommends promoting breastfeeding without restricting its duration among HIV-positive women on lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART). There is little data on breastfeeding duration and mother to child transmission (MTCT) beyond 24 months. We compared the duration of breastfeeding in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children and we identified factors associated with postpartum-MTCT in a semi-rural population of Mozambique.This cross-sectional assessment was conducted from October-2017 to April-2018. Mothers who had given birth within the previous 48-months in the Manhiça district were randomly selected to be surveyed and to receive an HIV-test along with their children. Postpartum MTCT was defined as children with an initial HIV positive result beyond 6 weeks of life who initiated breastfeeding if they had a first negative PCR result during the first 6 weeks of life or whose mother had an estimated date of infection after the child's birth. Cumulative incidence accounting for right-censoring was used to compare breastfeeding duration in HIV-exposed and unexposed children. Fine-Gray regression was used to assess factors associated with postpartum-MTCT.Among the 5000 mother-child pairs selected, 69.7% (3486/5000) were located and enrolled. Among those, 27.7% (967/3486) children were HIV-exposed, 62.2% (2169/3486) were HIV-unexposed and for 10.0% (350/3486) HIV-exposure was unknown. Median duration of breastfeeding was 13.0 (95%CI:12.0-14.0) and 20.0 (95%CI:19.0-20.0) months among HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed children, respectively (p<0.001). Of the 967 HIV-exposed children, 5.3% (51/967) were HIV-positive at the time of the survey. We estimated that 27.5% (14/51) of the MTCT occurred during pregnancy and delivery, 49.0% (2551) postpartum-MTCT and the period of MTCT remained unknown for 23.5% (12/51) of children. In multivariable analysis, mothers' ART initiation after the date of childbirth was associated (aSHR:9.39 [95%CI:1.75-50.31], p = 0.001), however breastfeeding duration was not associated with postpartum-MTCT (aSHR:0.99 [95%CI:0.96-1.03], p = 0.707).The risk for postpartum MTCT was nearly tenfold higher in women newly diagnosed and/or initiating ART postpartum. This highlights the importance of sustained HIV screening and prompt ART initiation in postpartum women in Sub-Saharan African countries. Under conditions where HIV-exposed infants born to mothers on ART receive adequate PMTCT, extending breastfeeding duration may be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4289524374,"Dunaliella parva can produce abundant carotenoids under certain conditions. This paper optimized the extraction efficiency of carotenoids from D. parva. Different organic solvents were examined to determine the most suitable solvent for the extraction. After the determination of the solvent (dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO), the extraction conditions including time, temperature, and volume were then optimized to maximize the extraction efficiency of carotenoids from D. parva using response surface methodology. DMSO was identified as the most suitable solvent. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: temperature of 57.2°C, time of 11.35 min, the volume of 410 μl, and the optimal extraction efficiency reached 0.517‰. The results showed that the optimal extraction efficiency (0.517‰) improved 31.69% in comparison to the initial extraction efficiency (0.3926‰). In addition, The optimal levels of three influence factors (temperature of 57.2°C, time of 11.35 min, volume of 410 μl) decreased compared with the initial levels (temperature of 60°C, time of 20 min, volume of 1000 μl). In this paper, Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to optimize the extraction efficiency of carotenoids from D. parva, which would lay the groundwork for the extraction and utilization of carotenoids from D. parva in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4289637645,"This study provides a macro-level societal and health system focused analysis of child vaccination rates in 30 European countries, exploring the effect of context on coverage. The importance of demography and health system attributes on health care delivery are recognized in other fields, but generally overlooked in vaccination. The analysis is based on correlating systematic data built up by the Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) Project with data from international sources, so as to exploit a one-off opportunity to set the analysis within an overall integrated study of primary care services for children, and the learning opportunities of the 'natural European laboratory'. The descriptive analysis shows an overall persistent variation of coverage across vaccines with no specific vaccination having a low rate in all the EU and EEA countries. However, contrasting with this, variation between total uptake per vaccine across Europe suggests that the challenge of low rates is related to country contexts of either policy, delivery, or public perceptions. Econometric analysis aiming to explore whether some population, policy and/or health system characteristics may influence vaccination uptake provides important results-GDP per capita and the level of the population's higher education engagement are positively linked with higher vaccination coverage, whereas mandatory vaccination policy is related to lower uptake rates. The health system characteristics that have a significant positive effect are a cohesive management structure; a high nurse/doctor ratio; and use of practical care delivery reinforcements such as the home-based record and the presence of child components of e-health strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4289637837,"Background Previous research suggests that romantic relationships play a crucial role for perceived control. However, we know surprisingly little about changes in perceived control before and after the end of romantic relationships. Methods Based on data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), a nationally representative household panel study from Germany, we examined changes of perceived control in the years around separation from a partner ( N = 1,235), divorce ( N = 423), and the death of a partner ( N = 437). Results Multilevel analyses revealed that external control beliefs were higher in but not beyond the first year after separation from a partner. Internal and total control beliefs increased gradually in the years after separation. Moreover, internal control beliefs were higher in and especially beyond the first year after the death of a partner compared to the years before. No evidence was found that perceived control already changed in the years before relationship losses or in the years around a divorce. Conclusion Taken together, these findings point toward stress-related growth of perceived control after some relationship losses–especially separation and the death of a partner."
https://openalex.org/W4289638019,"Current estimates of U.S. property at risk of coastal hazards and sea level rise (SLR) are staggering—evaluated at over a trillion U.S. dollars. Despite being enormous in the aggregate, potential losses due to SLR depend on mitigation, adaptation, and exposure and are highly uneven in their distribution across coastal cities. We provide the first analysis of how changes in exposure ( how and when ) have unfolded over more than a century of coastal urban development in the United States. We do so by leveraging new historical settlement layers from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) to examine building patterns within and between the SLR zones of the conterminous United States since the early twentieth century. Our analysis reveals that SLR zones developed faster and continue to have higher structure density than non-coastal, urban, and inland areas. These patterns are particularly prominent in locations affected by hurricanes. However, density levels in historically less-developed coastal areas are now quickly converging on early settled SLR zones, many of which have reached building saturation. These “saturation effects” suggest that adaptation polices targeting existing buildings and developed areas are likely to grow in importance relative to the protection of previously undeveloped land."
https://openalex.org/W4289646903,"The exchange of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes between aquaculture and terrestrial microbial populations has emerged as a serious public health concern. However, the nature of the mobile genetic elements in marine bacteria is poorly documented. To gain insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying AMR gene transfer from marine bacteria, we mated a multidrug-resistant Vibrio alfacsensis strain with an Escherichia coli strain, and then determined the complete genome sequences of the donor and the transconjugant strains. Sequence analysis revealed a conjugative multidrug resistance plasmid in the donor strain, which was integrated into the chromosome of the recipient. The plasmid backbone in the transconjugant chromosome was flanked by two copies of a 7.1 kb unclassifiable integrative element harboring a β-lactamase gene. The 7.1 kb element and the previously reported element Tn 6283 share four coding sequences, two of which encode the catalytic R-H-R-Y motif of tyrosine recombinases. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing experiments revealed that these elements generate a circular copy of one specific strand without leaving an empty site on the donor molecule, in contrast to the movement of integron gene cassettes or ICE/IMEs discovered to date. These elements are termed SEs ( s trand-biased circularizing integrative e lements): SE-6945 (the 7.1 kb element) and SE-6283 (Tn 6283 ). The copy number and location of SE-6945 in the chromosome affected the antibiotic resistance levels of the transconjugants. SEs were identified in the genomes of other Vibrio species. Overall, these results suggest that SEs are involved in the spread of AMR genes among marine bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4289711878,"Meiosis has a principal role in sexual reproduction to generate haploid gametes in both sexes. During meiosis, the cell nucleus hosts a dynamic environment where some genes are transcriptionally activated, and some are inactivated at the same time. This becomes possible through subnuclear compartmentalization. The sex body, sequestering X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis and creating an environment for the meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) is one of the best known and studied subnuclear compartments. Herein, we show that MRNIP forms droplet-like accumulations that fuse together to create a distinct subnuclear compartment that partially overlaps with the sex body chromatin during diplotene. We demonstrate that Mrnip−/− spermatocytes have impaired DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, they display reduced sex body formation and defective MSCI. We show that Mrnip−/− undergoes critical meiocyte loss at the diplotene stage. Furthermore, we determine that DNA DSBs (induced by SPO11) and synapsis initiation (facilitated by SYCP1) precede Mrnip expression in testes. Altogether, our findings indicate that in addition to an emerging role in DNA DSB repair, MRNIP has an essential function in spermatogenesis during meiosis I by forming drop-like accumulations interacting with the sex body."
https://openalex.org/W3211725904,"This study aimed to determine the effect of interleukin-13 (IL13) on the stemness, differentiation, proliferation, clonogenicity, and morphology of cultured limbal epithelial cells (LECs). Human limbal explants were used to culture LECs up to the second passage (P0-P2) with or without IL13 (IL13+ and IL13-, respectively). Cells were analyzed by qPCR (for the expression of ΔNp63α, BMI-1, keratin (K) 3, K7, K12, K14, K17, mucin 4, and MKI67) and immunofluorescence staining for p63α. The clonogenic ability was determined by colony-forming assay (CFA), and their metabolic activity was measured by WST-1 assay. The results of the CFA showed a significantly increased clonogenic ability in P1 and P2 cultures when LECs were cultured with IL13. In addition, the expression of putative stem cell markers (ΔNp63α, K14, and K17) was significantly higher in all IL13+ cultures compared to IL13-. Similarly, immunofluorescence analysis showed a significantly higher percentage of p63α positive cells in P2 cultures with IL13 than without it. LECs cultures without IL13 lost their cuboidal morphology with a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio after P1. The use of IL13 also led to significantly higher proliferation in P2, which can be reflected by a higher ability to reach confluence in P2 cultures. On the other hand, IL13 had no effect on corneal epithelial cell differentiation (K3 and K12 expression), and the expression of the conjunctival marker K7 significantly increased in all IL13+ cultures compared to the respective cell culture without IL13. This study showed that IL13 enhanced the stemness of LECs by increasing the clonogenicity and the expression of putative stem cell markers of LECs while maintaining their stem cell morphology. We established IL13 as a culture supplement for LESCs, which increases their stemness potential in culture, even after the second passage, and may lead to the greater success of LESCs transplantation in patients with LSCD."
https://openalex.org/W4289518172,"Simultaneous imaging of l -dihydroxyphenylalanine ( l -DOPA), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) in the catecholamine metabolic pathway is particularly useful because l -DOPA is a neurophysiologically important metabolic intermediate. In this study, we found that 2,4,6-trimethylpyrillium tetrafluoroborate (TMPy) can selectively and efficiently react with target catecholamine molecules. Specifically, simultaneous visualization of DA and NE as metabolites of l -DOPA with high steric hinderance was achieved by derivatized-imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). Interestingly, l -DOPA showed strong localization in the brainstem, in contrast to the pattern of DA and NE, which co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In addition, to identify whether the detected molecules were endogenous or exogenous l -DOPA, mice were injected with l -DOPA deuterated in three positions (D 3 - l -DOPA), which was identifiable by a mass shift of 3Da. TMPy-labeled l -DOPA, DA and NE were detected at m/z 302.1, 258.1 and 274.1, while their D 3 versions were detected at 305.0, 261.1 and 277.1 in mouse brain, respectively. l -DOPA and D 3 - l -DOPA were localized in the BS. DA and NE, and D 3 -DA and D 3 -NE, all of which are metabolites of L-DOPA and D 3 - l -DOPA, were localized in the striatum (STR) and locus coeruleus (LC). These findings suggest a mechanism in the brainstem that allows l -DOPA to accumulate without being metabolized to monoamines downstream of the metabolic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4289518182,"DNA methylation regulates epigenetic gene expression in ischemic stroke. Decitabine attenuates ischemic stroke by inhibiting DNA methylation. However, the underlying mechanism of this effect is not known. A model of ischemic stroke in Sprague-Dawley rats was induced through middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion step. The rats were randomly treated with decitabine or vehicle by a one-time intraperitoneal injection. Sham rats received similar treatments. Four days after treatment, the rats were perfused with saline or 4% paraformaldehyde after which the brain was excised. DNA methylation level and brain infarct volume were determined by dot blot and histochemistry, respectively. The cellular co-localization and quantitative analysis of DNA methylation were assessed by immunohistochemistry and expression levels of cdkn1b (p27) mRNA and protein were measured by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The proliferation of astrocytes and number of neurons were determined by immunohistochemistry. Rats treated with decitabine showed hypomethylation and reduced infarct volume in the cortex. DNA methylation was decreased in astrocytes. Decitabine upregulated p27 mRNA and protein expression levels and attenuated the proliferation of astrocytes in vivo and vitro. Decitabine promotes p27 gene expression possibly by inhibiting its DNA methylation, thereby decreases the proliferation of astrocytes, neuronal death and infarct volume after ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W4289518787,"Sperm selection for assisted reproduction techniques is generally based on basic parameters, while key aspects of sperm competence and its journey from the deposition site to the fertilization site are overlooked. Consequently, identifying molecular markers in spermatozoa that can efficiently predict the fertility of a semen sample could be of great interest, particularly in cases of idiopathic male infertility. When spermatozoa reach the female reproductive tract, it provides to them the cellular and molecular microenvironment needed to acquire fertilizing ability. In this sense, considering the role that integrin α5β1 of spermatozoa plays in reproduction-related events, we investigated the correlation between the subcellular localization of sperm integrin α5β1 and early embryo development outcome after in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in human. Twenty-four semen samples from normozoospermic men and metaphase II (MII) oocytes from healthy women aged under 38 years, from couples who underwent IVF cycles, were used in this work. Sperm α5β1 localization was evaluated by immunofluorescence assay using an antibody against integrin α5 subunit. Integrin α5β1 was mainly localized in the sperm acrosomal region (45.33±7.89%) or the equatorial segment (30.12±7.43%). The early embryo development rate (data obtained from the Fertility Center) correlated positively with the localization of α5β1 in the acrosomal region (number of usable embryos / inseminated oocytes: ρ = 0.75; p<0.01 and number of usable embryos/total number of two pronuclear zygotes: ρ = 0.80; p<0.01). However, this correlation was not significant when the equatorial segment mark was evaluated. In addition, human sperm released from co-culture with bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOEC) showed a significant enrichment in the acrosomal localization pattern of α5β1 compared to those sperm that were not co-cultured with BOEC (85.20±5.35% vs 35.00±17.09%, respectively, p<0.05). In conclusion, the evaluation of sperm integrin α5β1 immunolocalization could be a useful tool to select sperm with fertilizing ability from human semen samples before IVF procedures."
https://openalex.org/W4289525133,"In the United States, a public debate remains about the existence and effects of anthropogenic climate change. This skepticism is present in the agricultural sector, rendering climate science communication challenging. Due to the polarization of climate change issues and the concurrent need for agricultural adaptation, we sought to examine how scientists communicate in this sector. A survey, administered to climate scientists and pertinent U.S. federal agency staff (response rate = 43%), was conducted to examine perspectives on communicating with five agricultural stakeholder groups: agribusinesses, crop advisors, general public, producers, and policymakers. We focused on three aspects of the communication process with these stakeholders to evaluate if scientists, as messengers, were following best practices–communicator training, knowledge of stakeholder, and terminology use. We found scientists valued communication training; however, the majority had not attended formal training. Scientists had different views on climate change than producers and crop advisors but understood their perspective and were deliberate with their communication with different audiences. This suggests stakeholder knowledge and terminology use do not hinder communication between scientist and stakeholder. We also highlight three communication challenges present across stakeholder groups–stakeholder knowledge, timescale, and scientific uncertainty–and others that were specific to each stakeholder group. Future research should support scientists by identifying and resolving barriers to training and effective communication strategies for each stakeholder group that addresses these challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4289637369,"We tested the hypothesis that dividing attention would strengthen the ability to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and specific cognitive abilities from Timed Up and Go (TUG) performance in the community setting. While wearing a belt-worn sensor, 757 dementia-free older adults completed TUG during two conditions, with and without a concurrent verbal serial subtraction task. We segmented TUG into its four subtasks (i.e., walking, turning, and two postural transitions), and extracted 18 measures that were summarized into nine validated sensor metrics. Participants also underwent a detailed cognitive assessment during the same visit. We then employed a series of regression models to determine the combinations of subtask sensor metrics most strongly associated with MCI and specific cognitive abilities for each condition. We also compared subtask performances with and without dividing attention to determine whether the costs of divided attention were associated with cognition. While slower TUG walking and turning were associated with higher odds of MCI under normal conditions, these and other subtask associations became more strongly linked to MCI when TUG was performed under divided attention. Walking and turns were also most strongly associated with executive function and attention, particularly under divided attention. These differential associations with cognition were mirrored by performance costs. However, since several TUG subtasks were more strongly associated with MCI and cognitive abilities when performed under divided attention, future work is needed to determine how instrumented dual-task TUG testing can more accurately estimate risk for late-life cognitive impairment in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4289637690,"Numerosity is the set size of a group of items. Numerosity perception is a trait shared across numerous species. Numerosity-selective neural populations are thought to underlie numerosity perception. These neurons have been identified primarily using electrical recordings in animal models and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Here we use electrical intracranial recordings to investigate numerosity tuning in humans, focusing on high-frequency transient activations. These recordings combine a high spatial and temporal resolution and can bridge the gap between animal models and human recordings. In line with previous studies, we find numerosity-tuned responses at parietal sites in two out of three participants. Neuronal populations at these locations did not respond to other visual stimuli, i.e. faces, houses, and letters, in contrast to several occipital sites. Our findings further corroborate the specificity of numerosity tuning of in parietal cortex, and further link fMRI results and electrophysiological recordings."
https://openalex.org/W4289638289,"Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Biomathematical modelling of the underlying disease and therapy processes might be a useful aid to develop and improve preventive and treatment concepts of atherosclerosis. We here propose a biomathematical model of murine atherosclerosis under different diet and treatment conditions including lipid modulating compound and antibiotics. The model is derived by translating known biological mechanisms into ordinary differential equations and by assuming appropriate response kinetics to the applied interventions. We explicitly describe the dynamics of relevant immune cells and lipid species in atherosclerotic lesions including the degree of blood vessel occlusion due to growing plaques. Unknown model parameters were determined by fitting the predictions of model simulations to time series data derived from mice experiments. Parameter fittings resulted in a good agreement of model and data for all 13 experimental scenarios considered. The model can be used to predict the outcome of alternative treatment schedules of combined antibiotic, immune modulating, and lipid lowering agents under high fat or normal diet. We conclude that we established a comprehensive biomathematical model of atherosclerosis in mice. We aim to validate the model on the basis of further experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W4289638357,"It has been suggested that engraved abstract patterns dating from the Middle and Lower Palaeolithic served as means of representation and communication. Identifying the brain regions involved in visual processing of these engravings can provide insights into their function. In this study, brain activity was measured during perception of the earliest known Palaeolithic engraved patterns and compared to natural patterns mimicking human-made engravings. Participants were asked to categorise marks as being intentionally made by humans or due to natural processes (e.g. erosion, root etching). To simulate the putative familiarity of our ancestors with the marks, the responses of expert archaeologists and control participants were compared, allowing characterisation of the effect of previous knowledge on both behaviour and brain activity in perception of the marks. Besides a set of regions common to both groups and involved in visual analysis and decision-making, the experts exhibited greater activity in the inferior part of the lateral occipital cortex, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and medial thalamic regions. These results are consistent with those reported in visual expertise studies, and confirm the importance of the integrative visual areas in the perception of the earliest abstract engravings. The attribution of a natural rather than human origin to the marks elicited greater activity in the salience network in both groups, reflecting the uncertainty and ambiguity in the perception of, and decision-making for, natural patterns. The activation of the salience network might also be related to the process at work in the attribution of an intention to the marks. The primary visual area was not specifically involved in the visual processing of engravings, which argued against its central role in the emergence of engraving production."
https://openalex.org/W4289518217,"Agricultural landscape pattern may enhance biocontrol services by supporting parasitoid populations, including parasitoids of Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). In this study, we selected four landscape types in Yunnan province, in south China, which were characterized by flower fields, mountain, river, and urban areas as their main elements. We then carried out systematic surveys in tomato fields found within each landscape type, to determine the diversity, occurrence, and parasitism rate of parasitoids. We found that parasitoids from the genus Encarsia and Eretmocerus were the main natural enemies present, and the most abundant species were recorded in the flower and the mountain landscapes. Also, Encarsia formosa (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea) formed the highest relative abundance regardless of the landscape type. We also found that the population density of B. tabaci in flower landscapes was the lowest than that in other landscape types. During the main activity period of B. tabaci, the parasitism rate in the flower landscape was higher than that in other landscape types. Our findings showed that the occurrence of B. tabaci was relatively mild in the flower landscapes. The landscape type was also beneficial to parasitoids as it enhanced their parasitism rate. Therefore, agriculture environmental schemes should consider increasing the size of flower fields in the surrounding landscape to enhance the sustainable control of B. tabaci by the natural agricultural ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W4289520938,"The advantage of sex, and its fixation in some clades and species all over the eukaryote tree of life, is considered an evolutionary enigma, especially regarding its assumed two-fold cost. Several likely hypotheses have been proposed such as (1) a better response to the negative frequency-dependent selection imposed by the “Red Queen” hypothesis; (2) the competition between siblings induced by the Tangled Bank hypothesis; (3) the existence of genetic and of (4) ecological factors that can diminish the cost of sex to less than the standard assumed two-fold; and (5) a better maintenance of genetic diversity and its resulting phenotypic variation, providing a selective advantage in randomly fluctuating environments. While these hypotheses have mostly been studied separately, they can also act simultaneously. This was advocated by several studies which presented a pluralist point of view. Only three among the five causes cited above were considered yet in such a framework: the Red Queen hypothesis, the Tangled Bank and the genetic factors lowering the cost of sex. We thus simulated the evolution of a finite mutating population undergoing negative frequency-dependent selection on phenotypes and a two-fold (or less) cost of sexuality, experiencing randomly fluctuating selection along generations. The individuals inherited their reproductive modes, either clonal or sexual. We found that exclusive sexuality begins to fix in populations exposed to environmental variation that exceeds the width of one ecological niche (twice the standard deviation of a Gaussian response to environment). This threshold was lowered by increasing negative frequency-dependent selection and when reducing the two-fold cost of sex. It contributes advocating that the different processes involved in a short-term advantage of sex and recombination can act in combination to favor the fixation of sexual reproduction in populations."

https://openalex.org/W4289521489,"Introduction Work overload in hospitals enforced reducing shifts length of physicians in many countries over the last decade. In Israel, the current shift standard is of 26 hours, however, there is a residents’ struggle alongside a governmental intent to short the shifts to 16 hour. We aim to evaluate residents and interns support and preferences regarding shortening shifts and their ramifications to quality of life and residency programs. Methods A structured questionnaire was distributed to all resident and interns in a single center. We evaluated their current quality of residency and life, their support in the shorter shifts model, offering alternative program components such as reduced pay, longer residency or replacement in order to allow rest. We compared those who support the new model to those who objected to identify common characteristics to draw a resident profile for acceptance of change. Results Overall, 151 physicians answer the questionnaire. 70.2% support the shorter shifts model. Residents above 35 years old and those reaching completion of residency, significantly less support the shortening shifts model. No other demographic nor professional parameters were different between the supporters and non-supporters. Option of reduced pay or longer residency dramatically reduced the support rate to less than 30% and 20%, respectively. Replacement by other physician (resident or senior physician) in order to allow rest was supported by only 40%. Conclusion Residents’ standpoints regarding a desirable change are crucial to plan a successful implementation. A national survey is required before a new model is introduced, to achieve an optimal transparent efficient process."
https://openalex.org/W4289522607,"There have been conflicting findings on the effect of body mass index (BMI) on lung functions in children. Therefore, we studied the relationship between spirometry parameters and BMI among healthy Sri Lankan school children aged 5-7 years.A cross-sectional study was conducted among 296 school children (5-7-year-old) without apparent lung disease. Recruitment was done with stratified random sampling. Spirometry parameters, FEV1, FVC, PEFR, and FEV1/FVC ratio were determined. The acceptable and reproducible spirometry recordings were included in the analysis. Simple and multivariate linear regression analysis examined possible associations of lung function parameters with BMI, socio-demographic variables and indoor risk factors. Also, the mediator effect of gender on lung function through BMI was explored.The participants' mean age (SD) was 6.4 (0.65) years. One-third were thin/severely thin (37%). A statistically significant difference in FVC (p = 0.001) and FEV1 (p = 0.001) was observed between BMI groups (obesity/overweight, normal, and thinness). Yet, PEFR or FEV1/FVC did not significantly differ among BMI groups (p = 0.23 and p = 0.84). Multivariate regression analysis showed that FEV1 and FVC were significantly associated with BMI, child's age, gender, family income, father's education, having a pet, and exposure to mosquito coil smoke. Interaction between gender and BMI for lung functions was not significant. The thin children had significantly lower FVC (OR: -0.04, 95%CI: -0.077, -0.012, p = 0.008) and FEV1 (OR: -0.04, 95%CI: -0.075, -0.014, p = 0.004) than normal/overweight/obese children. Family income demonstrated the greatest effect on lung functions; FVC and FEV1 were 0.25L and 0.23L smaller in low-income than the high-income families.Lower lung function parameters (FVC and FEV1) are associated with thinness than normal/overweight/obese dimensions among children without apparent lung disease.

https://openalex.org/W4289523112,"Errorful learning suggests that, when perfect learning has not yet been attained, errors can enhance future learning if followed by corrective feedback. Research on memory updating has shown that after retrieval, memory becomes more malleable and prone to change. Thus, retrieval of a wrong answer might provide a good context for the incorporation of feedback. Here, we tested this hypothesis using sentences including pragmatic sentence implications, commonly used for the study of false memories. Across two experiments with young adults, we hypothesized that corrective feedback would be more efficient at reducing false memories if provided immediately after retrieval, when memory is more malleable than after being exposed to the material. Participants’ memory was assessed as a function of the type of learning task (Experiment 1: retrieval vs. restudy; and Experiment 2: active vs. passive recognition); and whether participants received corrective feedback or not. In both experiments, we observed that retrieval not only improved correct recall (replicating the testing effect) but also promoted the correction of false memories. Notably, corrective feedback was more effective when given after errors that were committed during retrieval rather than after restudy (Experiment 1) or after passive recognition (Experiment 2). Our results suggest that the benefits of retrieval go beyond the testing effect since it also facilitates false memories correction. Retrieval seems to enhance memory malleability, thus improving the incorporation of feedback, compared to the mere presentation of the information. Our results support the use of learning strategies that engage in active and explicit retrieval because, even if the retrieved information is wrong—when immediate feedback is provided—memory updating is promoted and errors are more likely to be corrected."
https://openalex.org/W4289524294,"Fluctuations in a person's arousal accompany mental states such as drowsiness, mental effort, or motivation, and have a profound effect on task performance. Here, we investigated the link between two central instances affected by arousal levels, heart rate and eye movements. In contrast to heart rate, eye movements can be inferred remotely and unobtrusively, and there is evidence that oculomotor metrics (i.e., fixations and saccades) are indicators for aspects of arousal going hand in hand with changes in mental effort, motivation, or task type. Gaze data and heart rate of 14 participants during film viewing were used in Random Forest models, the results of which show that blink rate and duration, and the movement aspect of oculomotor metrics (i.e., velocities and amplitudes) link to heart rate-more so than the amount or duration of fixations and saccades. We discuss that eye movements are not only linked to heart rate, but they may both be similarly influenced by the common underlying arousal system. These findings provide new pathways for the remote measurement of arousal, and its link to psychophysiological features."
https://openalex.org/W4289544980,"Minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2-7) form a hexameric complex that unwinds DNA ahead of a replicative fork. The deficiency of Mcm proteins leads to replicative stress and consequent genomic instability. Mice with a germline insertion of a Cre cassette into the 3′UTR of the Mcm2 gene (designated Mcm2Cre) have decreased Mcm2 expression and invariably develop precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T LBL), due to 100–1000 kb deletions involving important tumor suppressor genes. To determine whether mice that were protected from pre-T LBL would develop non-T-cell malignancies, we used two approaches. Mice engrafted with Mcm2Cre/Cre Lin−Sca-1+Kit+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells did not develop hematologic malignancy; however, these mice died of hematopoietic stem cell failure by 6 months of age. Placing the Mcm2Cre allele onto an athymic nu/nu background completely prevented pre-T LBL and extended survival of these mice three-fold (median 296.5 vs. 80.5 days). Ultimately, most Mcm2Cre/Cre;nu/nu mice developed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). We identified recurrent deletions of 100–1000 kb that involved genes known or suspected to be involved in BCP-ALL, including Pax5, Nf1, Ikzf3, and Bcor. Moreover, whole-exome sequencing identified recurrent mutations of genes known to be involved in BCP-ALL progression, such as Jak1/Jak3, Ptpn11, and Kras. These findings demonstrate that an Mcm2Cre/Cre hypomorph can induce hematopoietic dysfunction via hematopoietic stem cell failure as well as a “deletor” phenotype affecting known or suspected tumor suppressor genes."
https://openalex.org/W4289637423,"Spatial patterns of stable isotopes in animal tissues or ""isoscapes"" can be used to investigate animal origins in a range of ecological and forensic investigations. Here, we developed a feather hydrogen isotope (δ2Hf) isoscape for Brazil based on 192 samples of feathers from the family Thraupidae from scientific collections. Raw values of δ2Hf ranged from -107.3 to +5.0‰, with higher values at the Caatinga biome (northeast Brazil) and lower values at the Amazon and Pantanal. A Random Forest (RF) method was used to model the spatial surface, using a range of environmental data as auxiliary variables. The RF model indicated a negative relationship between δ2Hf and Mean Annual Precipitation, Precipitation in the Warmest Quarter, and Annual Temperature Range and positive relationships for amount-weighted February-April precipitation δ2H (δ2Hp(Feb-April)) and Mean Annual Solar Radiation. Modelled δ2Hf values ranged from -85.7 to -13.6‰. Ours is the first δ2Hf isoscape for Brazil that can greatly assist our understanding of both ecological and biogeochemical processes controlling spatial variation in δ2H for this region. This isoscape can be used with caution, due to its poor predictive power (as found in other tropical regions) and can benefit from new sample input, new GNIP data, ecological and physiological studies, and keratin standard material better encompassing the range in feather samples from Brazil. So, we encourage new attempts to build more precise feather H isoscapes, as well as isoscapes based on other elements."

However, in recent years, this pathologizing vision has begun to shift towards a perspective that focuses on the diversity of transgender peoples’ experiences. However, some transgender people still face denial of services, discrimination, harassment, and even violence by healthcare professionals, causing them to avoid seeking ongoing or preventive healthcare. This article describes the health experiences of transgender people in Barcelona regarding their access and use of non-specialized health services. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a descriptive phenomenological approach with sixteen transgender people between December 2018 and July 2019. The data were analyzed descriptively and thematically following the method proposed by Colaizzi with the help of the Atlas.ti8 software. Transgender people care experiences were divided into three categories: overcoming obstacles, training queries, and coping strategies. Participants identified negative experiences and difficulties with the health system due to healthcare providers’ lack of competence. Discriminatory, authoritarian, and paternalist behaviors are still present and hinder the therapeutic relationship, care, and access to healthcare services. There is a fundamental need for the depathologization of transgender reality and training for healthcare professionals in the field of sexual diversity. Training in sexual and gender diversity must be included in the curricula of university courses in the health sciences."
https://openalex.org/W4289637821,"Museum personnel and the general public have become quite familiar with the presence of shrunken heads in museum collections, but the procedures to authenticate the history and origin of these unique cultural items are not yet reliable. These shrunken heads, called tsantsas, are meant to be the cultural material remains of ceremonies conducted by the Shuar and Achuar Peoples of South America. This project seeks to integrate the use of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scanning with methods used in previous studies (clinical computed tomography (CT) and visual inspections) to examine authentication procedures of shrunken heads (tsantsas) held in contemporary museum collections. We use a correlative tomographic approach using several scans at successively higher resolutions to determine whether a tsantsa was created from human remains, and if so, what key features can best contribute to its authentication. Conclusively, our correlative tomographic approaches provide new insights into the determination process of whether a tsantsa was created from real human remains or not. Also, this study questions whether the previously conceptualized dichotomy of ceremonial or commercial might be better thought of as a continuum of practice. Investigating and redefining the examination and authentication procedures of tsantsas is crucial for future ethical curation, management, and repatriation efforts of this unique cultural material of the Shuar and Achuar Peoples."
https://openalex.org/W4289638292,"We formulate and apply a novel paradigm for characterization of genome data quality, which quantifies the effects of intentional degradation of quality. The rationale is that the higher the initial quality, the more fragile the genome and the greater the effects of degradation. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is ubiquitous, and that quantified measures of degradation can be used for multiple purposes, illustrated by outlier detection. We focus on identifying outliers that may be problematic with respect to data quality, but might also be true anomalies or even attempts to subvert the database."
https://openalex.org/W4289638378,"Shorter distance events in track and field are replete with folk tales about which lane assignments on the track are advantageous. Estimating the causal effect of lane assignments on race times is a difficult task as lane assignments are typically non-random. To estimate these effects I exploit a random assignment rule for the first round of races in short distance events. Using twenty years of data from the IAAF world athletic championships and U20 world championships, there is no evidence of lane advantages in the 100m. Contrary to popular belief, the data suggest that outside lanes in the 200m and 400m produce faster race times. In the 800m, which is unique in having a lane break, there is some weak evidence that outside lanes producer slower race times, possibly reflecting the advantage of inside lanes having an established position on the track at the lane break. Given that these results do not support common convictions on lane advantages, they also serve as an interesting case study on false beliefs."
