https://openalex.org/W2883933020,"A ferroelectric is a material with a polar structure whose polarity can be reversed (switched) by applying an electric field1,2. In metals, itinerant electrons screen electrostatic forces between ions, which explains in part why polar metals are very rare3-7. Screening also excludes external electric fields, apparently ruling out the possibility of ferroelectric switching. However, in principle, a thin enough polar metal could be sufficiently penetrated by an electric field to have its polarity switched. Here we show that the topological semimetal WTe2 provides an embodiment of this principle. Although monolayer WTe2 is centro-symmetric and thus non-polar, the stacked bulk structure is polar. We find that two- or three-layer WTe2 exhibits spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization that can be switched using gate electrodes. We directly detect and quantify the polarization using graphene as an electric-field sensor8. Moreover, the polarization states can be differentiated by conductivity and the carrier density can be varied to modify the properties. The temperature at which polarization vanishes is above 350 kelvin, and even when WTe2 is sandwiched between graphene layers it retains its switching capability at room temperature, demonstrating a robustness suitable for applications in combination with other two-dimensional materials9-12."
https://openalex.org/W2884101170,"A long-standing question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers communicate with their target promoters, and specifically how chromatin topology dynamically relates to gene activation. Here, we combine genome editing and multi-color live imaging to simultaneously visualize physical enhancer-promoter interaction and transcription at the single-cell level in Drosophila embryos. By examining transcriptional activation of a reporter by the endogenous even-skipped enhancers, which are located 150 kb away, we identify three distinct topological conformation states and measure their transition kinetics. We show that sustained proximity of the enhancer to its target is required for activation. Transcription in turn affects the three-dimensional topology as it enhances the temporal stability of the proximal conformation and is associated with further spatial compaction. Furthermore, the facilitated long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Our approach offers quantitative insight into the spatial and temporal determinants of long-range gene regulation and their implications for cellular fates."
https://openalex.org/W2884747366,"The rapid elimination of dying neurons and nonfunctional synapses in the brain is carried out by microglia, the resident myeloid cells of the brain. Here we show that microglia clearance activity in the adult brain is regionally regulated and depends on the rate of neuronal attrition. Cerebellar, but not striatal or cortical, microglia exhibited high levels of basal clearance activity, which correlated with an elevated degree of cerebellar neuronal attrition. Exposing forebrain microglia to apoptotic cells activated gene-expression programs supporting clearance activity. We provide evidence that the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically restricts the expression of genes that support clearance activity in striatal and cortical microglia. Loss of PRC2 leads to aberrant activation of a microglia clearance phenotype, which triggers changes in neuronal morphology and behavior. Our data highlight a key role of epigenetic mechanisms in preventing microglia-induced neuronal alterations that are frequently associated with neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2883972171,"Millions of human genomes and exomes have been sequenced, but their clinical applications remain limited due to the difficulty of distinguishing disease-causing mutations from benign genetic variation. Here we demonstrate that common missense variants in other primate species are largely clinically benign in human, enabling pathogenic mutations to be systematically identified by the process of elimination. Using hundreds of thousands of common variants from population sequencing of six non-human primate species, we train a deep neural network that identifies pathogenic mutations in rare disease patients with 88% accuracy and enables the discovery of 14 new candidate genes in intellectual disability at genome-wide significance. Cataloging common variation from additional primate species would improve interpretation for millions of variants of uncertain significance, further advancing the clinical utility of human genome sequencing. Using common variants in six non-human primate species, the authors train a deep neural network that identifies pathogenic mutations in patients with rare disease with 88% accuracy and enables the discovery of 14 new candidate genes in intellectual disability."
https://openalex.org/W2883392746,"Environmental cues, through Pavlovian learning, become conditioned stimuli that guide animals toward the acquisition of rewards (for example, food) that are necessary for survival. We tested the fundamental role of midbrain dopamine neurons in conferring predictive and motivational properties to cues, independent of external rewards. We found that brief phasic optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons, when presented in temporal association with discrete sensory cues, was sufficient to instantiate those cues as conditioned stimuli that subsequently both evoked dopamine neuron activity on their own and elicited cue-locked conditioned behavior. Notably, we identified highly parcellated functions for dopamine neuron subpopulations projecting to different regions of striatum, revealing dissociable dopamine systems for the generation of incentive value and conditioned movement invigoration. Our results indicate that dopamine neurons orchestrate Pavlovian conditioning via functionally heterogeneous, circuit-specific motivational signals to create, gate, and shape cue-controlled behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2883220169,"Mesenchymal tumor subpopulations secrete pro-tumorigenic cytokines and promote treatment resistance1–4. This phenomenon has been implicated in chemorefractory small cell lung cancer and resistance to targeted therapies5–8, but remains incompletely defined. Here, we identify a subclass of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) that engages innate immune signaling in these cells. Stimulated 3 prime antisense retroviral coding sequences (SPARCS) are oriented inversely in 3′ untranslated regions of specific genes enriched for regulation by STAT1 and EZH2. Derepression of these loci results in double-stranded RNA generation following IFN-γ exposure due to bi-directional transcription from the STAT1-activated gene promoter and the 5′ long terminal repeat of the antisense ERV. Engagement of MAVS and STING activates downstream TBK1, IRF3, and STAT1 signaling, sustaining a positive feedback loop. SPARCS induction in human tumors is tightly associated with major histocompatibility complex class 1 expression, mesenchymal markers, and downregulation of chromatin modifying enzymes, including EZH2. Analysis of cell lines with high inducible SPARCS expression reveals strong association with an AXL/MET-positive mesenchymal cell state. While SPARCS-high tumors are immune infiltrated, they also exhibit multiple features of an immune-suppressed microenviroment. Together, these data unveil a subclass of ERVs whose derepression triggers pathologic innate immune signaling in cancer, with important implications for cancer immunotherapy. Retroelements located in antisense orientation within interferon-regulated genes are reactivated in a subset of cancer cells and initiate a STING- and MAVS-dependent feed-forward inflammatory loop, driving antitumor immunity and exhaustion."
https://openalex.org/W2883431999,"Metformin, the universal first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, exerts its therapeutic glucose-lowering effects by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, the primary molecular mechanism of this biguanide remains unclear, though it has been suggested to act, at least partially, by mitochondrial complex I inhibition. Here we show that clinically relevant concentrations of plasma metformin achieved by acute intravenous, acute intraportal or chronic oral administration in awake normal and diabetic rats inhibit gluconeogenesis from lactate and glycerol but not from pyruvate and alanine, implicating an increased cytosolic redox state in mediating metformin's antihyperglycemic effect. All of these effects occurred independently of complex I inhibition, evidenced by unaltered hepatic energy charge and citrate synthase flux. Normalizing the cytosolic redox state by infusion of methylene blue or substrates that contribute to gluconeogenesis independently of the cytosolic redox state abrogated metformin-mediated inhibition of gluconeogenesis in vivo. Additionally, in mice expressing constitutively active acetyl-CoA carboxylase, metformin acutely decreased hepatic glucose production and increased the hepatic cytosolic redox state without altering hepatic triglyceride content or gluconeogenic enzyme expression. These studies demonstrate that metformin, at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis in a redox-dependent manner independently of reductions in citrate synthase flux, hepatic nucleotide concentrations, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, or gluconeogenic enzyme protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2885002489,"Despite decades of research, our understanding of the processes controlling late-stage atherosclerotic plaque stability remains poor. A prevailing hypothesis is that reducing inflammation may improve advanced plaque stability, as recently tested in the Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) trial, in which post-myocardial infarction subjects were treated with an IL-1β antibody. Here, we performed intervention studies in which smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage-tracing Apoe-/- mice with advanced atherosclerosis were treated with anti-IL-1β or IgG control antibodies. Surprisingly, we found that IL-1β antibody treatment between 18 and 26 weeks of Western diet feeding induced a marked reduction in SMC and collagen content, but increased macrophage numbers in the fibrous cap. Moreover, although IL-1β antibody treatment had no effect on lesion size, it completely inhibited beneficial outward remodeling. We also found that SMC-specific knockout of Il1r1 (encoding IL-1 receptor type 1) resulted in smaller lesions nearly devoid of SMCs and lacking a fibrous cap, whereas macrophage-selective loss of IL-1R1 had no effect on lesion size or composition. Taken together, these results show that IL-1β has multiple beneficial effects in late-stage murine atherosclerosis, including promotion of outward remodeling and formation and maintenance of an SMC- and collagen-rich fibrous cap. Interleukin-1β promotes an atheroprotective phenotype in late-stage lesions of mice, suggesting the possibility of deleterious effects of interleukin-1β blockade in the setting of myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2884899270,"Transposable elements, known colloquially as 'jumping genes', constitute approximately 45% of the human genome. Cells utilize epigenetic defenses to limit transposable element jumping, including formation of silencing heterochromatin and generation of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small RNAs that facilitate clearance of transposable element transcripts. Here we utilize Drosophila melanogaster and postmortem human brain samples to identify transposable element dysregulation as a key mediator of neuronal death in tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders that are pathologically characterized by deposits of tau protein in the brain. Mechanistically, we find that heterochromatin decondensation and reduction of piwi and piRNAs drive transposable element dysregulation in tauopathy. We further report a significant increase in transcripts of the endogenous retrovirus class of transposable elements in human Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, suggesting that transposable element dysregulation is conserved in human tauopathy. Taken together, our data identify heterochromatin decondensation, piwi and piRNA depletion and consequent transposable element dysregulation as a pharmacologically targetable, mechanistic driver of neurodegeneration in tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2883542372,"Lateral hypothalamus (LH) neurons containing the neuropeptide hypocretin (HCRT; orexin) modulate affective components of arousal, but their relevant synaptic inputs remain poorly defined. Here we identified inputs onto LH neurons that originate from neuronal populations in the bed nuclei of stria terminalis (BNST; a heterogeneous region of extended amygdala). We characterized two non-overlapping LH-projecting GABAergic BNST subpopulations that express distinct neuropeptides (corticotropin-releasing factor, CRF, and cholecystokinin, CCK). To functionally interrogate BNST→LH circuitry, we used tools for monitoring and manipulating neural activity with cell-type-specific resolution in freely behaving mice. We found that Crf-BNST and Cck-BNST neurons respectively provide abundant and sparse inputs onto Hcrt-LH neurons, display discrete physiological responses to salient stimuli, drive opposite emotionally valenced behaviors, and receive different proportions of inputs from upstream networks. Together, our data provide an advanced model for how parallel BNST→LH pathways promote divergent emotional states via connectivity patterns of genetically defined, circuit-specific neuronal subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2883168056,"To guide navigation, the nervous system integrates multisensory self-motion and landmark information. We dissected how these inputs generate spatial representations by recording entorhinal grid, border and speed cells in mice navigating virtual environments. Manipulating the gain between the animal's locomotion and the visual scene revealed that border cells responded to landmark cues while grid and speed cells responded to combinations of locomotion, optic flow and landmark cues in a context-dependent manner, with optic flow becoming more influential when it was faster than expected. A network model explained these results by revealing a phase transition between two regimes in which grid cells remain coherent with or break away from the landmark reference frame. Moreover, during path-integration-based navigation, mice estimated their position following principles predicted by our recordings. Together, these results provide a theoretical framework for understanding how landmark and self-motion cues combine during navigation to generate spatial representations and guide behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2883810206,"Risk variants for schizophrenia affect more than 100 genomic loci, yet cell- and tissue-specific roles underlying disease liability remain poorly characterized. We have generated for two cortical areas implicated in psychosis, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, 157 reference maps from neuronal, neuron-depleted and bulk tissue chromatin for two histone marks associated with active promoters and enhancers, H3-trimethyl-Lys4 (H3K4me3) and H3-acetyl-Lys27 (H3K27ac). Differences between neuronal and neuron-depleted chromatin states were the major axis of variation in histone modification profiles, followed by substantial variability across subjects and cortical areas. Thousands of significant histone quantitative trait loci were identified in neuronal and neuron-depleted samples. Risk variants for schizophrenia, depressive symptoms and neuroticism were significantly over-represented in neuronal H3K4me3 and H3K27ac landscapes. Our Resource, sponsored by PsychENCODE and CommonMind, highlights the critical role of cell-type-specific signatures at regulatory and disease-associated noncoding sequences in the human frontal lobe."

https://openalex.org/W2883066454,"The degree of intrinsic and interpatient phenotypic heterogeneity and its role in tumor evolution is poorly understood. Phenotypic drifts can be transmitted via inheritable transcriptional programs. Cell-type specific transcription is maintained through the activation of epigenetically defined regulatory regions including promoters and enhancers. Here we have annotated the epigenome of 47 primary and metastatic estrogen-receptor (ERα)-positive breast cancer clinical specimens and inferred phenotypic heterogeneity from the regulatory landscape, identifying key regulatory elements commonly shared across patients. Shared regions contain a unique set of regulatory information including the motif for transcription factor YY1. We identify YY1 as a critical determinant of ERα transcriptional activity promoting tumor growth in most luminal patients. YY1 also contributes to the expression of genes mediating resistance to endocrine treatment. Finally, we used H3K27ac levels at active enhancer elements as a surrogate of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity to track the expansion and contraction of phenotypic subpopulations throughout breast cancer progression. By tracking the clonality of SLC9A3R1-positive cells, a bona fide YY1-ERα-regulated gene, we show that endocrine therapies select for phenotypic clones under-represented at diagnosis. Collectively, our data show that epigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in systemically treated breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2883500808,"There has been an increased use of medical Cannabis in the United States of America as more states legalize its use. Complete chemical analyses of this material can vary considerably between producers and is often not fully provided to consumers. As phytochemists in a state with legal medical Cannabis we sought to characterize the accumulation of phytochemicals in material grown by licensed commercial producers. We report the development of a simple extraction and analysis method, amenable to use by commercial laboratories for the detection and quantification of both cannabinoids and terpenoids. Through analysis of developing flowers on plants, we can identify sources of variability of floral metabolites due to flower maturity and position on the plant. The terpenoid composition varied by accession and was used to cluster cannabis strains into specific types. Inclusion of terpenoids with cannabinoids in the analysis of medical cannabis should be encouraged, as both of these classes of compounds could play a role in the beneficial medical effects of different cannabis strains."
https://openalex.org/W2884219988,"Cellular transformation is accompanied by extensive rewiring of many biological processes leading to augmented levels of distinct types of cellular stress, including proteotoxic stress. Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL. Notably, we demonstrate that the central T-ALL oncogene NOTCH1 hijacks the cellular stress response machinery by inducing the expression of HSF1 and its downstream effectors. The NOTCH1 signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition. Our data demonstrate an integral crosstalk between mediators of oncogene and non-oncogene addiction and reveal critical nodes of the heat shock response pathway that can be targeted therapeutically. Oncogenic NOTCH1 controls transcriptional activation of the heat shock response in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and uncovers potential biomarkers of sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2883214941,"Plasmodium vivax causes approximately 100 million clinical malaria cases yearly1,2. The basis of protective immunity is poorly understood and thought to be mediated by antibodies3,4. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells protect against other intracellular parasites by detecting parasite peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen class I on host cells. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells kill parasite-infected mammalian cells and intracellular parasites by releasing their cytotoxic granules5,6. Perforin delivers the antimicrobial peptide granulysin and death-inducing granzymes into the host cell, and granulysin then delivers granzymes into the parasite. Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were thought to have no role against Plasmodium spp. blood stages because red blood cells generally do not express human leukocyte antigen class I7. However, P. vivax infects reticulocytes that retain the protein translation machinery. Here we show that P. vivax–infected reticulocytes express human leukocyte antigen class I. Infected patient circulating CD8+ T cells highly express cytotoxic proteins and recognize and form immunological synapses with P. vivax–infected reticulocytes in a human leukocyte antigen–dependent manner, releasing their cytotoxic granules to kill both host cell and intracellular parasite, preventing reinvasion. P. vivax–infected reticulocytes and parasite killing is perforin independent, but depends on granulysin, which generally efficiently forms pores only in microbial membranes8. We find that P. vivax depletes cholesterol from the P. vivax–infected reticulocyte cell membrane, rendering it granulysin-susceptible. This unexpected T cell defense might be mobilized to improve P. vivax vaccine efficacy. T cells kill blood-stage Plasmodium vivax, providing a rationale for the development of a T cell vaccine against this parasite."
https://openalex.org/W2884172031,"Many intracellular proteins are reversibly modified by O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc), a post-translational modification that dynamically regulates fundamental cellular processes in response to diverse environmental cues. Accumulating evidence indicates that both excess and deficiency of protein O-GlcNAcylation can have deleterious effects on the cell, suggesting that maintenance of O-GlcNAc homeostasis is essential for proper cellular function. However, the mechanisms through which O-GlcNAc homeostasis is maintained in the physiologic state and altered in the disease state have not yet been investigated. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a homeostatic mechanism involving mutual regulation of the O-GlcNAc–cycling enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) at the transcriptional level. Specifically, we found that OGA promotes Ogt transcription through cooperation with the histone acetyltransferase p300 and transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ). To examine the role of mutual regulation of OGT and OGA in the disease state, we analyzed gene expression data from human cancer data sets, which revealed that OGT and OGA expression levels are highly correlated in numerous human cancers, particularly in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Using a KrasG12D-driven primary mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line, we found that inhibition of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling decreases OGA glycosidase activity and reduces OGT mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that ERK signaling may alter O-GlcNAc homeostasis in PDAC by modulating OGA-mediated Ogt transcription. Our study elucidates a transcriptional mechanism that regulates cellular O-GlcNAc homeostasis, which may lay a foundation for exploring O-GlcNAc signaling as a therapeutic target for human disease.

https://openalex.org/W2884103058,"Cancer stem cell (CSC)-dictated intratumor heterogeneity accounts for the majority of drug-resistance and distant metastases of breast cancers. Here, we identify a SIRT1-PRRX1-KLF4-ALDH1 circuitry, which couples CSCs, chemo-resistance, metastasis and aging. Pro-longevity protein SIRT1 deacetylates and stabilizes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) inducer PRRX1, which inhibits the transcription of core stemness factor KLF4. Loss of SIRT1 destabilizes PRRX1, disinhibits KLF4, and activates the transcription of ALDH1, which induces and functionally marks CSCs, resulting in chemo-resistance and metastatic relapse. Clinically, the level of PRRX1 is positively linked to SIRT1, whereas KLF4 is reversely correlated. Importantly, KLF4 inhibitor Kenpaullone sensitizes breast cancer cells and xenograft tumors to Paclitaxel and improves therapeutic effects. Our findings delineate a SIRT1-centered circuitry that regulates CSC origination, and targeting this pathway might be a promising therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2883006152,"Food choice is critical for survival because organisms must choose food that is edible and nutritious and avoid pathogenic food. Many organisms, including the nematode C. elegans, use olfaction to detect and distinguish among food sources. C. elegans exhibits innate preferences for the odors of different bacterial species. However, little is known about the preferences of C. elegans for bacterial strains isolated from their natural environment as well as the attractive volatile compounds released by preferred natural bacteria isolates. We tested food odor preferences of C. elegans for non-pathogenic bacteria found in their natural habitats. We found that C. elegans showed a preference for the odor of six of the eight tested bacterial isolates over its standard food source, E. coli HB101. Using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we found that four of six attractive bacterial isolates (Alcaligenes sp. JUb4, Providenica sp. JUb5, Providencia sp. JUb39, and Flavobacteria sp. JUb43) released isoamyl alcohol, a well-studied C. elegans attractant, while both non-attractive isolates (Raoultella sp. JUb38 and Acinetobacter sp. JUb68) released very low or non-detectable amounts of isoamyl alcohol. In conclusion, we find that isoamyl alcohol is likely an ethologically relevant odor that is released by some attractive bacterial isolates in the natural environment of C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2883780752,"BRD4 is a transcriptional co-activator functioning to recruit regulatory complexes to acetylated chromatin. A subset of High-grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC) patients are typified by focal, recurrent BRD4 gene amplifications. Despite previously described cancer dependencies, it is unclear whether BRD4 amplification events are oncogenic in HGSOC. We find that physiologically relevant levels of expression of BRD4 isoforms in non-transformed ovarian cells result in cellular transformation. Transcriptional profiling of BRD4-transformed ovarian cells, and BRD4-amplified HGSOC patient samples revealed shared expression patterns, including enriched MYC, and E2F1 gene signatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a novel BET inhibitor, AZD5153, is highly active in BRD4-amplified patient derived xenografts and uncover Neuregulin-1 as a novel BRD4 effector. Experiments involving Neuregulin-1 inhibition and exogenous addition, demonstrate Neuregulin-1 as necessary and sufficient for BRD4-mediated transformation. This study demonstrates the oncogenic potential of BRD4 amplification in cancer and establishes BRD4-amplified HGSOC as a potential patient population that could benefit from BET inhibitors."

We hypothesized that a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) containing oestrogen enhances a lactobacilli-dominated vaginal microbial community despite biomass accumulation on the CVR's surface.We enrolled 120 women for 12 weeks in an open-label NuvaRing® study at Rinda Ubuzima, Kigali, Rwanda. Vaginal and ring microbiota were assessed at baseline and each ring removal visit by Gram stain Nugent scoring (vaginal only), quantitative PCR for Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae, and fluorescent in situ hybridization to visualize cell-adherent bacteria. Ring biomass was measured by crystal violet staining.Bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevalence was 48% at baseline. The mean Nugent score decreased significantly with ring use. The presence and mean log10 concentrations of Lactobacillus species in vaginal secretions increased significantly whereas those of G. vaginalis and presence of A. vaginae decreased significantly. Biomass accumulated on the CVRs with a species composition mirroring the vaginal microbiota. This ring biomass composition and optical density after crystal violet staining did not change significantly over time.NuvaRing® promoted lactobacilli-dominated vaginal microbial communities in a population with high baseline BV prevalence despite the fact that biomass accumulated on the rings."
https://openalex.org/W2884729712,"Background The exact cause and mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear. Dysregulation of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) has been reported in the brains of ASD-like mutant mice and ASD brain tissues. However, the role and methylation of LINE-1 in individuals with ASD remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether LINE-1 insertion is associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to assess LINE-1 methylation in ASD. Methods To identify DEGs associated with LINE-1 in ASD, we reanalyzed previously published transcriptome profiles and overlapped them with the list of LINE-1-containing genes from the TranspoGene database. An Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of DEGs associated with LINE-1 insertion was conducted. DNA methylation of LINE-1 was assessed via combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) of lymphoblastoid cell lines from ASD individuals and unaffected individuals, and the methylation levels were correlated with the expression levels of LINE-1 and two LINE-1-inserted DEGs, C1orf27 and ARMC8. Results We found that LINE-1 insertion was significantly associated with DEGs in ASD. The IPA showed that LINE-1-inserted DEGs were associated with ASD-related mechanisms, including sex hormone receptor signaling and axon guidance signaling. Moreover, we observed that the LINE-1 methylation level was significantly reduced in lymphoblastoid cell lines from ASD individuals with severe language impairment and was inversely correlated with the transcript level. The methylation level of LINE-1 was also correlated with the expression of the LINE-1-inserted DEG C1orf27 but not ARMC8. Conclusions In ASD individuals with severe language impairment, LINE-1 methylation was reduced and correlated with the expression levels of LINE-1 and the LINE-1-inserted DEG C1orf27. Our findings highlight the association of LINE-1 with DEGs in ASD blood samples and warrant further investigation. The molecular mechanisms of LINE-1 and the effects of its methylation in ASD pathobiology deserve further study."
https://openalex.org/W2883484453,"Background Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex condition involving multiple organ systems and characterized by persistent/relapsing debilitating fatigue, immune dysfunction, neurological problems, and other symptoms not curable for at least 6 months. Disruption of DNA methylation patterns has been tied to various immune and neurological diseases; however, its status in ME/CFS remains uncertain. Our study aimed at identifying changes in the DNA methylation patterns that associate with ME/CFS. Methods We extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 13 ME/CFS study subjects and 12 healthy controls and measured global DNA methylation by ELISA-like method and site-specific methylation status using Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays. Pyrosequencing validation included 33 ME/CFS cases and 31 controls from two geographically distant cohorts. Results Global DNA methylation levels of ME/CFS cases were similar to those of controls. However, microarray-based approach allowed detection of 17,296 differentially methylated CpG sites in 6,368 genes across regulatory elements and within coding regions of genes. Analysis of DNA methylation in promoter regions revealed 307 differentially methylated promoters. Ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that genes associated with differentially methylated promoters participated in at least 15 different pathways mostly related to cell signaling with a strong immune component. Conclusions This is the first study that has explored genome-wide epigenetic changes associated with ME/CFS using the advanced Illumina MethylationEPIC microarrays covering about 850,000 CpG sites in two geographically distant cohorts of ME/CFS cases and matched controls. Our results are aligned with previous studies that indicate a dysregulation of the immune system in ME/CFS. They also suggest a potential role of epigenetic de-regulation in the pathobiology of ME/CFS. We propose screening of larger cohorts of ME/CFS cases to determine the external validity of these epigenetic changes in order to implement them as possible diagnostic markers in clinical setting."

Backfilling is a basic method of controlling the loss of groundwater and reducing surface subsidence. In order to reduce the porosity of the backfill material and control the compression ratio of the backfill body, the grain gradation of the local aeolian sand was studied based on the geological conditions of the shallow buried coal seam in the Yulin mining area, Shaanxi province. Subsequently, aeolian sand was selected as the backfilling aggregate, and tests were implemented. The optimum proportion and slurry concentration of the backfill material were then obtained. The engineering application shows that the strength and stability of the backfill body based on the close packing theory can satisfy the requirements of supporting the overlying strata, and the integrity of overburden strata is competent. The maximum accumulated surface subsidence was measured to be 38mm, indicating that the aeolian sand-based backfill material in shallow and thick underground coal seam mining is able to protect the eco-environment and control the geo-environmental hazards, which are critical for the sustainable development of the mining industry and economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2884269808,"Notch hyperactivation dominates T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia development, but the mechanisms underlying “pre-leukemic” cell dissemination are still unclear. Here we describe how deregulated Notch3 signaling enhances CXCR4 cell-surface expression and migratory ability of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, possibly contributing to “pre-leukemic” cell propagation, early in disease progression. In transgenic mice overexpressing the constitutively active Notch3 intracellular domain, we detect the progressive increase in circulating blood and bone marrow of CD4+CD8+ cells, characterized by high and combined surface expression of Notch3 and CXCR4. We report for the first time that transplantation of such CD4+CD8+ cells reveals their competence in infiltrating spleen and bone marrow of immunocompromised recipient mice. We also show that CXCR4 surface expression is central to the migratory ability of CD4+CD8+ cells and such an expression is regulated by Notch3 through β-arrestin in human leukemia cells. De novo, we propose that hyperactive Notch3 signaling by boosting CXCR4-dependent migration promotes anomalous egression of CD4+CD8+ cells from the thymus in early leukemia stages. In fact, in vivo CXCR4 antagonism prevents bone marrow colonization by such CD4+CD8+ cells in young Notch3 transgenic mice. Therefore, our data suggest that combined therapies precociously counteracting intrathymic Notch3/CXCR4 crosstalk may prevent dissemination of “pre-leukemic” CD4+CD8+ cells, by a “thymus-autonomous” mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2883433758,"Objective To evaluate both the performance and acceptability of a method coupling self-sampling with detection of cervical malignancy via elevated HPV 16 and 18 E6 oncoproteins (OncoE6™ Cervical Test) in remote areas in Brazil. Methods Women living in rural villages in proximity to Coari city, Amazonas, Brazil were invited to participate in a cervical cancer screening study. 412 subjects were enrolled; there were no refusals. In addition to E6 protein detection, DNA was extracted from the brushes and evaluated for HPV genotypes by PCR (PGMY09/11), followed by typing by the Papillocheck™ if positive. Subjects who were found to be positive for OncoE6 or HPV-DNA were referred for colposcopy. Results For 110 subjects (27%) this was the first cervical cancer exam. Overall the HPV-DNA prevalence was 19.1% (n = 79); 1.4% (n = 6) were positive by the OncoE6 Test. Fifty-six women attended the invitation for colposcopy where nine had an abnormal cervix and were subsequently biopsied. Histopathological analysis revealed 2 CIN3, 2 carcinomas and 5 CIN1. OncoE6 called two out of the three HPV 16 or 18 associated CIN3+ lesions. Conclusions The findings suggest that self-administered sample collection in combination with OncoE6 Test is feasible in this population. This could enable expanded screening coverage while ensuring a high specificity which is imperative given the remote geographic location, since women bearing abnormal test results would necessitate travel and logistical burden to access colposcopy and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2884383622,"Introduction Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies among men in Western populations. Evidence reported in the literature suggests that zinc may be related to prostate cancer. In this study we evaluated the association of serum zinc levels and polymorphisms in genes encoding zinc-dependent proteins with prostate cancer in Poland. Methods The study group consisted of 197 men affected with prostate cancer and 197 healthy men. Serum zinc levels were measured and 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms in MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-13, MT2A genes were genotyped. Results The mean serum zinc level was higher in prostate cancer patients than in healthy controls (898.9±12.01 μg/l vs. 856.6±13.05 μg/l, p<0.01). When compared in quartiles a significant association of higher zinc concentration with the incidence of prostate cancer was observed. The highest OR (OR = 4.41, 95%CI 2.07–9.37, p<0.01) was observed in 3rd quartile (>853.0–973.9 μg/l). Among five analyzed genetic variants, rs11568818 in MMP-7 appeared to be correlated with 2-fold increased prostate cancer risk (OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.19–4.82, p = 0.015). Conclusion Our results suggest a significant correlation of higher serum zinc levels with the diagnosis of prostate cancer. The polymorphism rs11568818 in MMP-7 gene was also associated with an increased prostate cancer risk in Poland."
https://openalex.org/W2884085601,"Hereditary mutations in BRCA1/2 genes increase the risk of breast cancer by 60-80% and ovarian cancer by about 20-40% in female carriers. Detection of inherited mutations in asymptomatic carriers allows for the implementation of appropriate preventive measures. BRCA1/2 genotyping is also important for poly(adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor administration. This work addresses the need for next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology for the detection of BRCA1/2 mutations in Poland where until recently mostly founder mutations have been tested, and whether BRCA diagnostics should be extended beyond the panel of founder mutations in this population. The study comprises 2931 patients who were referred for genetic counseling and tested for founder and recurrent mutations in BRCA1 (5382insC (c.5266dupC; p.Gln1756Profs), c.5370C>T (c.5251C>T; p.R1751*), 300T>G (c.181T>G; p.Cys61Gly), 185delAG (c.68_69delAG; p.Glu23Valfs), and 4153delA (c.4035delA; p.Glu1346Lysfs)) by high-resolution melting/Sanger sequencing. A total of 103 (3.5%) mutations were detected, including 53 (51%) in healthy subjects and 50 (49%) in cancer patients. Then, based on more stringent clinical and pedigree criteria, sequencing of all BRCA1/2 exons was performed in 454 (16%) patients without founder mutations by NGS, which detected 58 mutations (12.8%), 40 (8.8%) of which were pathogenic. In 14 (3.1%) subjects, variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were detected, and in four (0.9%) subjects, the detected mutations were benign. In total, 161 mutations were detected using our two-step algorithm (founder test and NGS), of which 64% were founder mutations, 25% were NGS-detected pathogenic mutations, 9% were VUS, and 2% were benign. In addition, 38 mutations not yet reported in the Polish population were detected. In total, founder mutations accounted for only 64% of all detected mutations, and the remaining mutations (36%) were dispersed across the BRCA1/2 gene sequences. Thus, in Poland, testing for constitutional mutations in BRCA1/2 should be carried out in two stages, where NGS is performed in qualifying subjects if founder mutations are not identified."
https://openalex.org/W2883633077,"Grandmothers provide key care to their grandchildren in both contemporary and historic human populations. The length of the grandmother-grandchild relationship provides a basis for such interactions, but its variation and determinants have rarely been studied in different contexts, despite changes in age-specific mortality and fertility rates likely having affected grandmotherhood patterns across the demographic transition. Understanding how often and long grandmothers have been available for their grandchildren in different conditions may help explain the large differences between grandmaternal effects found in different societies, and is vital for developing theories concerning the evolution of menopause, post-reproductive longevity, and family living. Using an extensive genealogical dataset from Finland spanning the demographic transition, we quantify the length of grandmotherhood and its determinants from 1790-1959. We found that shared time between grandmothers and grandchildren was consistently low before the demographic transition, only increasing greatly during the 20th century. Whilst reduced childhood mortality and increasing adult longevity had a role in this change, grandmaternal age at birth remained consistent across the study period. Our findings further understanding of the temporal context of grandmother-grandchild relationships, and emphasise the need to consider the demography of grandmotherhood in a number of disciplines, including biology (e.g. evolution of the family), sociology (e.g. changing family structures), population health (e.g. changing age structures), and economics (e.g. workforce retention)."

SCFA levels were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At 6 h bowel appearance was assessed, histologic and molecular analysis of intestine were performed. Gut inflammation (p65 NF-κB, TLR4, TNF-α, IL-1β), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3, BAX, apoptosis) and tight junction proteins (claudin-2, occludin) were measured.SCFAs were increased in FF. Small bowel from FF piglet's demonstrated inflammation, coagulative necrosis and pneumatosis resembling human NEC. Histologic gut injury (injury score, mast cell activation) were increased by Bacteria, but more severe in FF piglets. Intestinal expression of p65 NF-κB, NF-κB activation, TNF-α and IL-1β were increased in BO and markedly increased in the FF group (P<0.05 vs. FO). Intestine from Bacteria piglets demonstrated increased apoptotic index, pro-apoptotic protein expression and decreased tight junction proteins. These changes were more severe in FF piglets.Our piglet model demonstrates the findings of NEC in human neonates: systemic acidosis, intestinal inflammation, pneumatosis and portal venous gas. Bacteria alone can initiate intestinal inflammation, injury and apoptosis, but bacterial fermentation of formula generates SCFAs which contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC."
https://openalex.org/W2883875559,"Autophagy is a highly regulated evolutionarily conserved metabolic process induced by stress and energy deprivation. Here, we show that DNA polymerase gamma (Polγ) deficiency activates a selective prosurvival autophagic response via mitochondria-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) activities. In keratinocytes, Polγ deficiency causes metabolic adaptation that triggers cytosolic sensing of energy demand for survival. Knockdown of Polγ causes mitochondrial stress, decreases mitochondrial energy production, increases glycolysis, increases the expression of autophagy-associated genes, and enhances AKT phosphorylation and cell proliferation. Deficiency of Polγ preferentially activates mTORC2 formation to increase autophagy and cell proliferation, and knocking down Rictor abrogates these responses. Overexpression of Rictor, but not Raptor, reactivates autophagy in Polγ-deficient cells. Importantly, inhibition of ROS by a mitochondria-selective ROS scavenger abolishes autophagy and cell proliferation. These results identify Rictor as a critical link between mitochondrial stress, ROS, and autophagy. They represent a major shift in our understanding of the prosurvival role of the mTOR complexes and highlight mitochondria-mediated ROS as a prosurvival autophagy regulator during cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2883909528,"In order to investigate the release of aluminium ions from food contact materials, three different types of uncoated aluminium menu trays for single use were tested with the foodstuffs sauerkraut juice, apple sauce and tomato puree, as well as with the food simulants 5 g/L citric acid solution and artificial tap water. To mimic a consumer relevant exposure scenario, the aluminium trays were studied using time and temperature gradients according to the Cook & Chill method, also taking into account storage time at elevated temperatures during the delivery period. The release of aluminium was found to exceed the specific release limit (SRL) of 5 mg aluminium per kilogram of food specified by the Council of Europe by up to six times. Furthermore, a release of thallium was also detected unexpectedly. Kinetic studies showed a comparable behaviour in the release of aluminium, manganese and vanadium as components of the aluminium alloy itself. In contrast, thallium could be identified as a surface contaminant or impurity because of an entirely different kinetic curve. Kinetic studies also allowed activation energy calculations. Additional camping saucepans were tested as an article for repeated use. In three subsequent release experiments with citric acid (5 g/L), artificial tap water and tomato puree as benchmark foodstuffs, the results were comparable to those of the uncoated wrought alloy aluminium trays."
https://openalex.org/W2884706178,"One of the most important fungal agents of pistachio dieback disease belongs to the ascomycete genus Paecilomyces that has been identified as P. variotii. In 2012–2014, 700 plant samples from pistachio trees and 27 other plant species with dieback symptoms were collected from 10 provinces of Iran. Of the 567 pistachio samples, 277 Paecilomyces strains were obtained and from the 133 samples of other plants (except pistachio and including Pistacia mutica, Punica granatum, Prunus amygdalus, Caesalpinia gilliesii, Nerium oleander, Tamarix aphylla, Tamarix hispida and Haloxylon sp.), 23 fungal isolates were recovered and five isolates were obtained from the air of infected pistachio orchards. Based on morphology, all 305 isolates were identified as P. variotii. Physiological studies revealed that 299 isolates belong to P. formosus. Three isolates were assigned to P. variotii, while three isolates could not be assigned to any of the known species. Of the 305 isolates, 62 were selected for phylogenetic analysis based on DNA variation (ITS, β-tubulin and calmodulin). This analysis showed that all of our isolates form a clade with P. formosus. P. formosus consists of the three former species P. formosa, P. lecythidis and P. maximus. This study shows that our isolates form a strongly supported clade with strains of P. lecythidis. So, the causal agent of dieback disease of pistachio and other examined trees is P. formosus which is closely related to the former species P. lecythidis and has some differences with the former species P. formosa and P. maximus. Based on phylogenetic studies P. formosus thus seems to be a species complex that could be divided into three separate species."
https://openalex.org/W2884036861,"Background Approximately 1 in 650 boys are born with an extra X chromosome. Boys and men with 47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome) are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and specific cognitive impairments. This study was focused on social anxiety and social cognition. The aim was to assess if these aspects of the phenotype are related to testosterone deficiency, which is typically seen in 47,XXY from puberty onwards. Methods In the study 20 boys with 47,XXY and 25 non-clinical controls between 8 and 19 years participated. None had ever used testosterone supplements. Cognitive tests measuring the labeling of facial expressions and perspective taking (Theory of Mind) were administered. Self-report questionnaires were used to assess social anxiety. Testosterone was measured in saliva. Results Within the 47,XXY group lower levels of salivary testosterone were significantly associated with higher levels of social anxiety. The correlation was strong, andindependent of age and pubertal development. However, salivary levels of testosterone were uncorrelated to social cognitive skills. Discussion These findings point out that lower testosterone levels might contribute to high social anxiety in 47,XXY, suggesting that anxiety should be monitored in pubertal boys with XXY presenting with testosterone deficiency. This should be done in addition to exploring cognitive behavioral therapy or psychopharmacologic treatments targeting anxiety, which are more evidence based. In contrast, testosterone levels were not associated with social cognitive functioning, suggesting that other mechanisms are driving vulnerabilities in this domain."
https://openalex.org/W2884907175,"Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of tacrolimus, based on blood concentrations, shows an imperfect correlation with the occurrence of rejection. Here, we tested whether measuring NFATc1 amplification, a member of the calcineurin pathway, is suitable for TDM of tacrolimus.NFATc1 amplification was monitored in T cells of kidney transplant recipients who received either tacrolimus- (n = 11) or belatacept-based (n = 10) therapy. Individual drug effects on NFATc1 amplification were studied in vitro, after spiking blood samples of healthy volunteers with either tacrolimus, belatacept or mycophenolate mofetil.At day 30 after transplantation, in tacrolimus-treated patients, NFATc1 amplification was inhibited in CD4+ T cells expressing the co-stimulation receptor CD28 (mean inhibition 37%; p = 0.01) and in CD8+CD28+ T cells (29% inhibition; p = 0.02), while this was not observed in CD8+CD28- T cells or belatacept-treated patients. Tacrolimus pre-dose concentrations of these patients correlated inversely with NFATc1 amplification in CD28+ T cells (rs = -0.46; p < 0.01). In vitro experiments revealed that 50 ng/ml tacrolimus affected NFATc1 amplification by 58% (mean; p = 0.02).In conclusion, measuring NFATc1 amplification is a direct tool for monitoring biological effects of tacrolimus on T cells in whole blood samples of kidney transplant recipients. This technique has potential that requires further development before it can be applied in daily practice."
https://openalex.org/W2884354397,"Sepsis-induced skeletal muscle wasting may lead to various severe clinical consequences. Understanding molecular mechanisms of the regulation of the loss of skeletal muscle mass in septic patients remains a significant clinical challenge. The current study was conducted to establish septic mouse models to explore the relationship between microRNA (miR)-351 and the transcription element apical (TEA) domain transcription factor (Tead)-4 gene and to investigate its effects on the skeletal muscle through mediating the Hippo signaling pathway in mice with acute sepsis. A total of 60 mice were collected to establish mouse models of acute sepsis. The positive expression rate of Tead-4 and the apoptotic index (AI) were measured. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to verify the targeting relationship between miR-351 and Tead-4. Furthermore, the muscle fiber diameter (MFD) and area (MFA) and the content of 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) and tyrosine (Tyr) were assessed. The expression levels of miR-351, p38-MAPK, Yes-associated protein, Tead-4, B-cell lymphoma X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 were determined with quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Finally, cell viability, apoptosis, and levels of inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6, IGF-1, TNF-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, and ELISA. Initially, Tead-4 protein expression was higher in skeletal muscle tissues of mice with acute sepsis. Tead-4 was identified to negatively regulate miR-351. Upregulation of miR-351 increased MFA and MFD, muscle weight water content, Bcl-2 expression levels, and cell viability. Up-regulation of miR-351 reduced AI; 3-MH and Tyr content; positive expression of Tead-4 protein; the expression levels of p38-MAPK, Yap, Tead-4, Bax, and Caspase-3; apoptosis; and inflammatory responses. The current study demonstrated that up-regulation of miR-351 inhibits the degradation of skeletal muscle protein and the atrophy of skeletal muscle in mice with acute sepsis by targeting Tead-4 through suppression of the Hippo signaling pathway. Thus, miR-351 overexpression may be a future therapeutic strategy for acute sepsis.—Zhang, L.-N., Tian, H., Zhou, X.-L., Tian, S.-C., Zhang, X.-H., Wu, T.-J.

Recently, a protective effect of the T allele of rs12979860 IL28B Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) against CMV infection in the allogenic stem cell transplantation was suggested. We investigate whether the rs12979860 IL28B SNP and the relative rs368234815 (IFNλ4) genotype may affect the incidence of active CMV infection in Autologous stem cell transplantation (Auto-SCT) setting. The study included 99 patients who underwent to Auto-SCT. IL28 and IFNΔ4 SNPs were correlated with CMV reactivation along with other clinical and treatment parameters. CMV reactivation by CMV DNAemia was evaluated once a week until day 100 from Auto-SCT. CMV reactivation was documented in 50% (TT-ΔG/ΔG), 35% (CC-TT/TT) and 29.2% (CT-TT/ΔG) of the patients respectively. No differences in CMV copies number were recorded at reactivation between different IL28/IFNλ4 genotypes. The analysis of patients older than 60 years showed a significantly higher incidence of active CMV infection in the TT-ΔG/ΔG (83%) population with respect to CC-TT/TT (21%) and CT-TT/ΔG (40%) patients. Our data suggest a negative role of TT-ΔG/ΔG genotype in the CMV reactivation in Auto-SCT. The exposure to rituximab and the pre-infusion presence of anti CMV IgG also significantly influenced CMV reactivation."

However, it is unknown how cellular signals regulate those processes. Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a protein kinase that regulates cell migration and invasion, phosphorylates PIPKIγ90 at S453, and that Cdk5-mediated PIPKIγ90 phosphorylation is essential for cell invasion. Moreover, Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation down-regulates the activity of PIPKIγ90 and the secretion of fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that regulates cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, inhibition of PIPKIγ activity with the chemical inhibitor UNC3230 suppresses fibronectin secretion in a dose-dependent manner, whereas depletion of Cdk5 enhances fibronectin secretion. With total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we found that secreted fibronectin appears as round dots, which colocalize with Tks5 and CD9 but not with Zyxin. These data suggest that Cdk5-mediated PIPKIγ90 phosphorylation regulates cell invasion by controlling PIPKIγ90 activity and fibronectin secretion.—Li, L., Kotodziej, T., Jafari, N., Chen, J., Zhu, H., Rajfur, Z., Huang, C.

https://openalex.org/W2883899357,"Introduction Although the worldwide incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is slowly decreasing, annual infection rates in Peru remain among the highest in the Americas. Pharmacies could play an important role in facilitating early detection of TB. However, the awareness, expertise and cooperation of pharmacy workers is fundamental. This study explored the TB-related knowledge, attitudes and practices of pharmacy workers in a district with one of the highest incidences of TB in Peru. Methods This cross-sectional study applied a questionnaire that was administered face to face using smartphones with one pharmacy worker at each of 45 randomly selected pharmacies in the El Agustino district of Lima, Peru. Results Participants were primarily female (78%) and had an average age of 31.3 years old (range 18–57 years old). Only 11% of participants were pharmacists with complete university training. The pharmacy workers’ knowledge was adequate; however, workers had important knowledge gaps and myths regarding prevention of TB transmission. Most pharmacy workers (77%) reported they would send a client with a history of cough for more than two weeks to a healthcare center, while 23% reported they would offer them antitussive medication or antibiotics. Almost all workers reported talking with clients about diseases and reported respiratory symptoms as one of the most common causes for consultation (60%). Most participants expressed interest in learning more about TB and expanding their involvement in the fight against TB in their community. Conclusion Pharmacy workers have adequate knowledge about TB. However, we identified gaps in knowledge with respect to prevention of TB transmission. Pharmacy workers commonly see patients with respiratory symptoms and some offer recommendations, including for treatment. Pharmacy workers are willing to learn more and contribute to TB control and could be a valuable asset in the control and prevention of TB in Peru. To achieve this integration of pharmacy workers into TB control and prevention, more research is needed."

Maintenance space is a key factor in determining how well a product can be maintained. If the work space is sufficiently considered in the design stage, it will benefit both the user and the maintainer. From a maintenance perspective, this paper proposes a quantitative method to evaluate the maintenance space by virtual simulation and consideration of ergonomics. In this method, maintenance operations are concisely classified into three types. Based on the virtual simulation of the maintenance process and maintainer data, the swept volume of a hand is built using envelope theory. The operation range of the maintainer is derived by establishing a mathematical model for the upper limb. Combining the swept volume and operation range, the maintenance space can be quantitatively evaluated. A concise validation demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for evaluating the maintenance space to improve the space design. The proposed method could be applied to the space design of a complex product."
https://openalex.org/W2883094845,"Ring1 and yin yang 1-binding protein (RYBP) are central components of noncanonical polycomb-repressive complex 1 (nc-PRC1), which represses target gene expression and is required for normal organismal development. However, the molecular function of RYBP in this complex is obscure. In this study, we showed that RYBP inhibits the polyubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of Ring1B independently of its ubiquitin (Ub)-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) ligase activity, leading to its stabilization and increased catalytic activity toward monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119. Mechanistic dissection further disclosed that RYBP directly binds to ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) to promote its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in an autoubiquitination-independent manner. The resultant reduction of UBE3A protein level alleviates its effect on ubiquitination-mediated degradation of Ring1B, therefore resulting in increased stability and enhanced transcriptional repressor activity on its target genes. Thus, our current findings lay a foundation for understanding how RYBP functions in nc-PRC1 complexes, which is involved in development, stem cell maintenance, and carcinogenesis.-Li, M., Zhang, S., Zhao, W., Hou, C., Ma, X., Li, X., Huang, B., Chen, H., Chen, D.

TbCMT1 was dispensable for parasite proliferation in in vitro culture. However, significantly decreased parasitemia was observed in mice inoculated with TbCMT1 null and conditional null cell lines. Using RNA-Seq, we observed that several cysteine peptidase mRNAs were downregulated in TbCMT1 null cells lines. The cysteine peptidase Cathepsin-L was also shown to be reduced at the protein level in TbCMT1 null cell lines.

Feasibility endpoints included; physician engagement, accrual rates, physician compliance and patient satisfaction with the integrated consent model. Our anticipated pilot trial sample size was 35 randomised patients in one year.Between August 30th, 2016 and January 31st 2017, 2 patients met eligibility and were randomised. A survey of 10 participating oncologists was performed to identify potential strategies to enhance accrual. Most investigators (9/10) believed that the best regimen for TNBC was unknown, and 4/10 felt this was a pressing clinical question. Physicians' responses suggested that poor accrual was due to: a lack of interest in some study arms as oncologists already had a preferred regimen (4/10) and concerns about trial demands in busy clinics (3/10). The pilot feasibility endpoints were not met and the study was closed.Despite initial interest in the trial question and multiple investigators agreeing to approach patients, this trial failed to meet feasibility endpoints. The reasons for poor accrual were multiple and require further evaluation if this important patient-centred question is to be answered.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02688803."
https://openalex.org/W2883995070,"A key step in the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication is the binding of the activator protein Cdc45 to promote MCM helicase unwinding of the origin template. We show here that the c-myc origin DNA unwinding element-binding protein, DUE-B, interacts in HeLa cells with the replication initiation protein Treslin to allow Cdc45 loading onto chromatin. The chromatin loading of DUE-B and Treslin are mutually dependent, and the DUE-B–Treslin interaction is cell cycle–regulated to peak as cells exit G1 phase prior to the initiation of replication. The conserved C-terminal domain of DUE-B is required for its binding to TopBP1, Treslin, Cdc45, and the MCM2-7 complex, as well as for the efficient loading of Treslin, Cdc45, and TopBP1 on chromatin. These results suggest that DUE-B acts to identify origins by MCM binding and serves as a node for replication protein recruitment and Cdc45 transfer to the prereplication complex."
https://openalex.org/W2884195837,"Visual performance is asymmetric across the visual field, but locational biases that occur during dichoptic viewing are not well understood. In this study, we characterized horizontal, vertical and naso-temporal biases in visual target detection during dichoptic stimulation and explored whether the detection was facilitated by non-spatial auditory tones associated with the target's location. The detection time for single monocular targets that were suppressed from view with a 10 Hz dynamic noise mask presented to the other eye was measured at the 4° intercardinal location of each eye with the breaking Continuous Flash Suppression (b-CFS) technique. Each target was either combined with a sound (i.e., high or low pitch tone) that was congruent or incongruent with its vertical location (i.e., upper or lower visual field) or presented without a sound. The results indicated faster detection of targets in the upper rather than lower visual field and faster detection of targets in the nasal than temporal hemifield of each eye. Sounds generally accelerated target detection, but the tone pitch-elevation congruency did not further enhance performance. These findings suggest that visual detection during dichoptic viewing differs from standard viewing conditions with respect to location-related perceptual biases and crossmodal modulation of visual perception. These differences should be carefully considered in experimental designs employing dichoptic stimulation techniques and in display applications that utilize dichoptic viewing."

The aim of this study is to explore the impact of different cardiorespiratory fitness expression methods, measured by the maximal cycle ergometer test, on the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and academic achievement. A cross-sectional study consisting of 303 Icelandic 4th grade students (163 girls) was conducted. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a graded maximal cycle ergometer test and scores of standardized tests in Icelandic and math obtained from the Icelandic National Examination Institute. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured as absolute power output in watts in a maximal progressive cycle ergometer test. To adjust for different body sizes, the power output was scaled to body weight, body height, body surface area, and allometrically expressed body weight. In addition, linear regression scaling was also used to adjust for different body sizes. No significant relationship was found between any of the cardiorespiratory fitness expressions and academic achievement, using both univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. The use of different methods to express cardiorespiratory fitness does not significantly affect the association with the academic achievement of fourth grade students."
