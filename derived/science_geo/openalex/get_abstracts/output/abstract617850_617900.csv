https://openalex.org/W2891139847,"Probiotics are live microorganisms which confer health benefits to the host, and may be isolated from several sources, such as vegetable foodstuffs. Sauerkraut is a cabbage product resulting from fermentation by a lactic acid bacteria microbial succession, and is a potential source for probiotics. The aim of the present study was the isolation and characterization of probiotic microorganisms from sauerkraut fermentations. Four distinct fermentations were performed, from which lactic acid bacteria were recovered. Overall, 114 isolates were obtained, phenotypically and genotypically characterized, identified to the genus level and evaluated regarding safety and probiotic potential. Representative bacteria were selected for further analysis, 52% being Lactobacillus spp. and 33% belonging to Leuconostoc spp. genus. One isolate revealed to be β-hemolytic, 42% possessed potentially mobile antimicrobial resistance, 88% were resistant to bile and 20% to low pH. The six most promising candidates were further characterized and presented antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, three being resistant to lower pH values. Thus, global analysis of data gathered during this study highlighted the identification of three Lactobacillus strains with putative probiotic potential, suggesting the applicability of sauerkraut fermentations as a source for probiotic isolation. Due to their origin these strains should be suited for future application in the food industry, namely vegetable products such as sauerkraut itself."
https://openalex.org/W2891666943,"Reports of emotions experienced over the past week can be influenced by memory bias, which is more pronounced for people with depression. No studies, however, have examined memory bias for specific emotion clusters (e.g., sadness, anxiety, and anger) experienced on a day-to-day basis among people with depression or a history of depression. Participants (N = 1,657) from the Midlife in the United States Study were assessed for depression. Approximately 6 months later, participants reported their emotional experiences for 8 days and recalled these experiences on the final day. Differences in recalled and reported emotion were compared between participants with and without a history of depression. Participants overestimated experience only of negative emotions, particularly anger, and this negativity bias was greatest for participants with a history of depression. Feelings related to anger were prone to greater overestimation than sadness or anxiety. These findings emphasize the role of memory bias in retrospective reports of specific emotions and illustrate the presence of an amplified memory bias among people who are at a greater risk for recurrent depressive episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2890516904,"Language context (native vs. foreign) affects people’s choices and preferences in a wide variety of situations. However, emotional reactions are a key component driving people’s choices in those situations. In six studies, we test whether foreign language context modifies biases and the use of heuristics not directly caused by emotional reactions. We fail to find evidence that foreign language context modifies the extent to which people suffer from outcome bias (Experiment 1a & 1b) and the use of the representativeness heuristic (Experiment 2a & 2b). Furthermore, foreign language context does not modulate decision-making in those scenarios even when emotion is brought into the context (Experiment 1c & 2c). Foreign language context shapes decision-making, but the scope of its effects might be limited to decision-making tendencies in which emotion plays a causal role."
https://openalex.org/W2891142511,"Scientific communication through social media, particularly Twitter has been gaining importance in recent years. As such, it is critical to understand how information is transmitted and dispersed through outlets such as Twitter, particularly in emergency situations where there is an urgent need to relay scientific information. The purpose of this study is to examine how original tweets and retweets on Twitter were used to diffuse radiation related information after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Out of the Twitter database, we purchased all tweets (including replies) and retweets related to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident and or radiation sent from March 2nd, 2011 to September 15th, 2011. This time frame represents the first six months after the East Japan earthquake, which occurred on March 11th, 2011. Using the obtained data, we examined the number of tweets and retweets and found that only a small number of Twitter users were the source of the original posts that were retweeted during the study period. We have termed these specific accounts as “influencers”. We identified the top 100 influencers and classified the contents of their tweets into 3 groups by analyzing the document vectors of the text. Then, we examined the number of retweets for each of the 3 groups of influencers, and created a retweet network diagram to assess how the contents of their tweets were being spread. The keyword “radiation” was mentioned in over 24 million tweets and retweets during the study period. Retweets accounted for roughly half (49.7%) of this number, and the top 2% of Twitter accounts defined as “influencers” were the source of the original posts that accounted for 80.3% of the total retweets. The majority of the top 100 influencers had individual Twitter accounts bearing real names. While retweets were intensively diffused within a fixed population, especially within the same groups with similar document vectors, a group of influencers accounted for the majority of retweets one month after the disaster, and the share of each group did not change even after proven scientific information became more available."
https://openalex.org/W2891550186,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can be found in various organisms, and could be considered an alternative for pesticides used to control plant pathogens, including those affecting citrus. Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of frozen concentrated orange juice in the world. However, the citrus industry has been affected by several diseases such as citrus canker and huanglongbing (HLB), caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X.citri) and Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas), respectively. In order to control these pathogens, putative AMPs were prospected in databases containing citrus sequences. Furthermore, AMPs already reported in the literature were also used for in vitro and in vivo assays against X.citri. Since CaLas cannot be cultivated in vitro, surrogates as Sinorhizobium meliloti and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were used. This study reports the evaluation of six AMPs obtained from different sources, two of them from Citrus spp. (citrus-amp1 and citrus-amp2), three from amphibians (Hylin-a1, K0-W6-Hy-a1 and Ocellatin 4-analogue) and one from porcine (Tritrpticin). Peptides K0-W6-Hy-a1, Ocellatin 4-analogue, and citrus-amp1 showed bactericidal activity against X.citri and S. meliloti and bacteriostatic effect on A. tumefaciens. These results were confirmed for X.citri in planta. In addition cytotoxicity evaluations of these molecules were performed. The AMPs that showed the lowest hemolytic activities were Triptrpticin, citrus-amp1 and citrus-amp2. Citrus-amp1 and citrus-amp2 not presented toxicity in experiments using in vivo model, G. mellonella and U87 MG cells. To verify the interaction of these AMPs with bacteria and erythrocyte cell membranes, vesicles mimicking these cells were built. Citrus-amp1 and Tritrpticin exhibited higher affinity to bacterial membranes, while Ocellatin 4-analogue and Hylin-a1 showed higher affinity to erythrocyte membranes; exclude their use in citrus. This work demonstrates an essential alternative, trough AMPs obtained from Citrus spp., which can be feasibly used to control bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2892141339,"Breast cancer represents the main malignancy in women and autologous fat grafting is a diffuse procedure in the management of post-surgical breast defects causing patients' psychosocial problems, with high costs for the public health. Recently, beneficial effects of fat grafting during post-surgical breast reconstruction have been amplified from the enrichment with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) present in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adult adipose tissue isolated during intraoperatory procedures. The major concern about the ASC enrichment during post-surgery breast reconstruction depends on their potential ability to release growth factors and hormones that can promote proliferation of residual or quiescent cancer cells, with the risk of de novo cancer development or recurrence. The recent description that adult stem cells primed in vitro may be vehicle for anti-cancer drug delivery offers a new vision concerning the role of ASCs in breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent acting as a microtubule-stabilizing drug inhibiting cancer cell mitotic activity. We optimized PTX loading and release in cultured ASCs and then analyzed the effects of PTX-loaded ASCs and their conditioned medium on CG5 breast cancer survival, proliferation and apoptosis in vitro, and inCG5 xenograft in vivo. We documented that ASCs can uptake and release PTX in vitro, with slight cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, PTX-loaded ASCs in co-culture, as well as conditioned medium alone, inhibited CG5 cell proliferation and survival in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. The antitumor effect of PTX-loaded ASCs may offer a new perspective concerning the use of ASCs during breast reconstruction becoming an additional local preventive chemotherapeutic agent against tumor recurrence. However, further experiments in vitro and in vivo are needed to collect more evidence confirming the efficacy and safety in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2889744629,"Background Lesishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic in Bihar, India. Inappropriate health seeking behaviour of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients may increase the disease duration, severity and transmissibility. Simultaneously, lack of knowledge and perceived stigma may also increase the length of delay in receiving treatment. This ultimately effects the kala-azar elimination program. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in 120 confirmed PKDL patients, aged 18 years and older. Data related to knowledge and health seeking behaviour was collected by a pre-tested questionnaire. EMIC stigma scale was used for assessing the perceived stigma. Patients were personally interviewed after taking informed consent. Data analysis was done by using SPSS 16 software. Results The time between appearance of symptoms and first medical consultation (patient delay) ranged from 15 days to 5475 days (15 years) with a median of 285 days. The time between first medical consultations to onset of specific treatment (system delay) ranged from 2 to 5475 days with a median of 365 days. Many patients approached first to quacks (8.4%), homeopathic and ayurvedic practitioners (25.8%) upon recognition of symptoms. Majority of the patients (68.3%) had poor knowledge about PKDL and its vector. Type of skin lesions and gender had significant association with patient delay and system delay respectively (p<0.05). Distance to primary health centre (PHC) had significant association with patients delay as well as system delay (p<0.05). Patients with younger age, unmarried and polymorphic lesions had higher stigma (p<0.05). Patients with PKDL feel stigmatized in different areas. Conclusion PKDL treatment delays were unacceptably high and patients had poor knowledge compounded with feelings of stigmatization. To reduce the delay, a system may be evolved to establish some sort of public-private collaboration, besides awareness programs should be tailored, and implemented for improving the patient education regarding the disease and its linkage with VL."
https://openalex.org/W2890302620,"Behaviors are important indicators for assessing the health and well-being of dairy cows. The aim of this study is to develop and validate an ensemble classifier for automatically measuring and distinguishing several behavior patterns of dairy cows from accelerometer data and location data. The ensemble classifier consists of two parts, our new Multi-BP-AdaBoost algorithm and a data fusion method based on D-S evidence theory. We identify seven behavior patterns: feeding, lying, standing, lying down, standing up, normal walking, and active walking. Accuracy, sensitivity, and precision were used to validate classification performance. The Multi-BP-AdaBoost algorithm performed well when identifying lying (92% accuracy, 93% sensitivity, 82% precision), lying down (99%, 82%, 86%), standing up (99%, 74%, 85%), normal walking (97%, 92%, 86%), and active walking (99%, 94%, 89%). Its results were poor for feeding (80%, 52%, 55%) and standing (80%, 46%, 58%), which are difficult to differentiate using a leg-mounted sensor. Position data made it possible to differentiate feeding and standing. The D-S evidence fusion method for combining accelerometer data and location data in classification was used to fuse two pieces of basic behavior-related evidence into a single estimation model. With this addition, the sensitivity and precision of the two difficult behaviors increased by approximately 20 percentage points. In conclusion, the classification results indicate that the ensemble classifier effectively recognizes various behavior patterns in dairy cows. However, further work is needed to study the robustness of the feature and model by increasing the number of cows enrolled in the trial."
https://openalex.org/W2805346827,"Field-based data collection provides an extraordinary opportunity for comparative research. However, the demands of pursuing research away from home creates an expectation of unburdened individuals who have the temporal, financial, and social resources to conduct this work. Here we examine whether this myth of the socially unencumbered scholar contributes to the loss of professionals and trainees. To investigate this, we conducted an internet-based survey of professional and graduate student anthropologists (n = 1025) focused on the challenges and barriers associated with developing and maintaining a fieldwork-oriented career path and an active family life. This study sought to determine how (1) family socioeconomic status impacts becoming an anthropologist, (2) expectations of field-based research influence family planning, and (3) fieldwork experiences influence perceptions of family-career balance and stress. We found that most anthropologists and anthropology students come from educated households and that white men were significantly more likely to become tenured professionals than other demographic groups. The gender disparity is striking because a larger number of women are trained in anthropology and were more likely than men to report delaying parenthood to pursue their career. Furthermore, regardless of socioeconomic background, anthropologists reported significant lack of family-career balance and high stress associated with the profession. For professionals, lack of balance was most associated with gender, age, SES, tenure, and impacts of parenting on their career, while for students it was ethnicity, relative degree speed, graduate funding, employment status, total research conducted, career impact on family planning, and concern with tenure (p < .05). Anthropology bridges the sciences and humanities, making it the ideal discipline to initiate discussions on the embedded structural components of field-based careers generalizable across specialties."
https://openalex.org/W2891098070,"Resistance to antitumor immunity can be promoted by the oncogenic pathways operational in human cancers, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. Here we studied if and how EGFR downstream signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can affect the attraction of immune cells. HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC cell lines were analyzed in vitro for CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6 and IL-1β expression and the attraction of T cells under different conditions, including cetuximab treatment and stimulation with IFNγ and TNFα using qPCR, ELISA and migration experiments. Biochemical analyses with chemical inhibitors and siRNA transfection were used to pinpoint the underlying mechanisms. Stimulation of HNSCC cells with IFNγ and TNFα triggered the production of T-cell attracting chemokines and required c-RAF activation. Blocking of the EGFR with cetuximab during this stimulation increased chemokine production in vitro, and augmented the attraction of T cells. Mechanistically, cetuximab decreased the phosphorylation of MEK1, ERK1/2, AKT, mTOR, JNK, p38 and ERK5. Chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling showed a consistent and pronounced chemokine production with MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and JNK inhibitor SP600125, but not with inhibitors of p38, PI3K or mTOR. Combination treatment with cetuximab and a MEK1/2 or JNK inhibitor induced the highest chemokine expression. In conclusion, overexpression of EGFR results in the activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways that act simultaneously to suppress type 1 cytokine stimulated production of chemokines required to amplify the attraction of T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2891825751,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility. We sought to replicate the associations of 61 GWAS-identified SNPs at 42 loci with pancreatic cancer in Japanese and to develop a risk model for the identification of individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer development in the general Japanese population. The model was based on data including directly determined or imputed SNP genotypes for 664 pancreatic cancer case and 664 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Stepwise logistic regression uncovered five GWAS-identified SNPs at five loci that also showed significant associations in our case-control cohort. These five SNPs were included in the risk model and also applied to calculation of the polygenic risk score (PRS). The area under the curve determined with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.66) or 0.61 (0.58–0.64) for versions of the model that did or did not include cigarette smoking and family history of pancreatic cancer in addition to the five SNPs, respectively. Individuals in the lowest and highest quintiles for the PRS had odds ratios of 0.62 (0.42–0.91) and 1.98 (1.42–2.76), respectively, for pancreatic cancer development compared with those in the middle quintile. We have thus developed a risk model for pancreatic cancer that showed moderately good discriminatory ability with regard to differentiation of pancreatic cancer patients from control individuals. Our findings suggest the potential utility of a risk model that incorporates replicated GWAS-identified SNPs and established demographic or environmental factors for the identification of individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2890085392,"Introduction Antenatal care (ANC), health facility birth and postnatal care services are proved to reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. In Ethiopia, even though antenatal care coverage is good, still home birth is high. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of home birth among women who were booked for ANC in public hospitals in Wolaita zone, southern Ethiopia. Methods A cohort study was conducted from February to May 2017 among 554 third trimester pregnant mothers who visited public hospitals of Wolaita Zone, southern Ethiopia for ANC service. All women were interviewed twice: the first interview was done face-to-face in the health facility in which they were having ANC follow up to gather information about basic socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics; the second interview was done via telephone after they gave birth to get information about the place of birth. Epi-Data version 3.1 was used for data entry and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was used for data analysis. Results A total of 68 (13.5%; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 10.5%-16.6%) women who were booked for ANC gave birth at home. Being uneducated (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: [1.10–5.10]), starting ANC visit late (>16weeks) (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI: [1.14–4.50]), time taken to reach at health facility for ANC service (>30minutes) (AOR = 8.94, 95% CI: [4.50–17.72]), waiting time of greater than 30 minutes for ANC in health facilities (AOR = 1.18, 95% CI: [1.06–2.30]) and lack of knowledge about danger signs of pregnancy (AOR = 4.18, 95%CI: [1.80–9.70]) were significantly associated with home birth. Conclusions Home birth among ANC booked women is low compared to other studies. Yet, giving attention to women with no education and those coming from far areas while providing advice on birth preparedness and pregnancy danger signs may be useful to further reduce the rate of home birth. Advising mothers to start ANC early and trying to reduce ANC waiting time could also be of importance."
https://openalex.org/W2890212712,"This paper proposes a novel robust control method for the control of a 7-DOF exoskeleton robot. The external disturbances and unknown dynamics in the form of friction forces, different upper-limb’s mass, backlash, and input saturation make robot unstable, which prevents the robot from correctly following the defined path. A new fractional sliding mode controller (NFSMC) is designed, which is robust against unknown dynamic and external disturbances. Fractional PID controller (FPID) has high trajectory tracking, but it is not robust against external disturbances. Therefore, by combining NFSMC and FPID controllers, a new compound fractional PID sliding mode controller (NCFPIDSMC) is proposed, which benefits high trajectory tracking of FPID and robustness of NFSMC. The stability of the proposed control method is verified by Lyapunov theory. A random noise is applied in order to confirm the robustness of the proposed control method."
https://openalex.org/W2891017842,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis periprosthetic joint infection (TBPJI) is a rare complication of hip/knee joint arthroplasty. The outcomes of hip/knee TBPJI treatment are still unreported. The objective of this study was to investigate the outcomes of hip/knee TBPJI following treatment with two-stage exchange arthroplasty.From 2003 to 2013, 11 patients with TBPJI (six hips and five knees) were treated with two-stage exchange arthroplasty at our institution. We collected and analyzed variables including demographic data, comorbidities, microbiological data, duration of symptoms, and types of antibiotic used in bone cement.At the most recent follow-up, the success rate of two-stage exchange arthroplasty was 63.3% (7 of 11). All five knee treatments resulted in infection eradication and successful prosthesis reimplantation. However, only two hip TBPJI treatments resulted in successful outcomes; two patients died and two experienced chronic infection. Overall, secondary bacterial infections were common in patients with TBPJI (5 of 11 cases, 45.5%). Streptomycin in bone cement increased the success rate (83.33% vs. 40%).More than one third of the patients treated with two-stage exchange arthroplasty for TBPJI showed infection relapse or uncontrolled infection. Streptomycin-loaded interim cement spacers appeared to help ensure successful treatment. Routine M. tuberculosis culture is recommended when treating TBPJI in areas of high tuberculosis prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2890423583,"The aim of this study is to investigate different effects on pain perception among randomly assigned volunteers practicing meditation compared to a relaxation condition. The study examines whether participants of the experimental conditions (meditation versus relaxation) differ in the change of pain perception and heart rate measurement and in religious and spiritual well-being after an intervention.147 volunteers (long-term practitioners and novices) were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions with a headphone guided 20-minute single session intervention. The change in their pre- and post-intervention pain perception was measured using Quantitative Sensory Testing and Cold Pressor Testing (CPTest), their stress-level was compared by monitoring heart rate, and their religious and spiritual well-being by using the Multidimensional Inventory for Religious/Spiritual Well-Being (MI-RSB48). Additionally, dimensions of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) measured the psychological resilience of the participants; pain and stress experience, and the state of relaxation and spirituality experience were assessed. Five persons were excluded due to failure in measuring the heart rate and 29 participants had to be excluded because of high values on the BSI.The meditation group showed an increase in their pain tolerance on the CPTest and a decrease in their pain intensity for heat after the experimental condition, in contrast to the relaxation group. Futhermore, the meditation group showed a higher level of religious spiritual well-being (MI-RSB48 Total score) as well as in the sub-dimensions General Religiosity, Forgiveness, and Connectedness after the experimental condition, compared to the relaxation group. Our data is consistent with the hypothesis that meditation increases pain tolerance and reduces pain intensity, however, further work is required to determine whether meditation contains similar implications for pain patients."
https://openalex.org/W2890530516,"Host plants, pathogens and their herbivore vectors systems have complex relationships via direct and indirect interactions. Although there are substantial gaps in understanding these systems, the dynamics of the relationships may influence the processes of virus transmission and plant disease epidemics. Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is mainly vectored by green rice leafhoppers (GRLHs), Nephotettix cincticeps (Uhler) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in a persistently circulative manner. In this study, host plant selection preferences of non-viruliferous and viruliferous (carrying RDV) GRLHs between RDV-free and RDV-infected plants were tested. Non-viruliferous GRLHs preferred RDV-infected rice plants over RDV-free rice plants, and viruliferous GRLHs preferred RDV-free rice plants over RDV-infected rice plants. In odor selection preference bioassay using a four-field olfactometer, non-viruliferous GRLHs preferred odors of RDV-infected rice plants over healthy rice and viruliferous GRLHs preferred odors of RDV-free rice plants over RDV-infected ones. In 6 h plant penetration behavior bioassay using electrical penetration graphs, non-viruliferous GRLHs spent shorter time in non-penetration and much longer time in xylem feeding on RDV-infected, compared to RDV-free rice plants. Viruliferous GRLHs exhibited more salivation and stylet movement on RDV-free rice plants than on RDV-infected rice plants. We infer from these findings that RDV influences these vector behaviors by altering host plant physiology to promote viral transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2890963023,"We investigated the prognostic impact and clinical utility of serum free light chains (sFLC) and serum heavy-light chains (sHLC) in patients with multiple myeloma treated according to the GEM2005MENOS65, GEM2005MAS65, and GEM2010MAS65 PETHEMA/GEM phase III clinical trials. Serum samples collected at diagnosis were retrospectively analyzed for sFLC (n = 623) and sHLC (n = 183). After induction or autologous transplantation, 309 and 89 samples respectively were available for sFLC and sHLC assays. At diagnosis, a highly abnormal (HA) sFLC ratio (sFLCr) (<0.03 or >32) was not associated with higher risk of progression. After therapy, persistence of involved-sFLC levels >100 mg/L implied worse survival (overall survival [OS], P = 0.03; progression-free survival [PFS], P = 0.007). Among patients that achieved a complete response, sFLCr normalization did not necessarily indicate a higher quality response. We conducted sHLC investigations for IgG and IgA MM. Absolute sHLC values were correlated with monoclonal protein levels measured with serum protein electrophoresis. At diagnosis, HA-sHLCrs (<0.29 or >73) showed a higher risk of progression (P = 0.006). Additionally, involved-sHLC levels >5 g/L after treatment were associated with shorter survival (OS, P = 0.001; PFS, P = 0.018). The HA-sHLCr could have prognostic value at diagnosis; absolute values of involved-sFLC >100 mg/L and involved-sHLC >5 g/L could have prognostic value after treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2890279486,"Spermatogenesis in many species including Drosophila melanogaster is accompanied by major reorganisation of chromatin in post-meiotic stages, involving a nearly genome-wide displacement of histones by protamines, Mst77F and Protamine-like 99C. A proposed prerequisite for the histone-to-protamine transition is massive histone H4 hyper-acetylation prior to the switch. Here, we investigated the pattern of histone H3 lysine acetylation and general lysine crotonylation in D. melanogaster spermiogenesis to elucidate a possible role of these marks in chromatin reorganisation. Lysine crotonylation was strongest prior to remodelling and the deposition of this mark depended on the acetylation status of the spermatid chromatin. In contrast to H4 acetylation, individual H3 acetylation marks displayed surprisingly distinct patterns during the histone-to-protamine transition. We observed that Nejire, a histone acetyl transferase, is expressed during the time of histone-to-protamine transition. Nejire knock down led to strongly reduced fertility, which correlated with misshaped spermatid nuclei and a lack of mature sperm. protA and prtl99C transcript levels were reduced after knocking down Nejire. ProtB-eGFP, Mst77F-eGFP and Prtl99C-eGFP were synthesized at the late canoe stage, while histones were often not detectable. However, in some cysts histones persist in parallel to protamines. Therefore, we hypothesize that complete histone removal requires multiple histone modifications besides H3K18ac and H3K27ac. In summary, H3K18 and H3K27 acetylation during Drosophila spermatogenesis is dependent on Nejire or a yet uncharacterized acetyl transferase. We show that Nejire is required for male fertility since Nejire contributes to efficient transcription of protA and prtl99C, but not Mst77F, in spermatocytes, and to maturation of sperm."
https://openalex.org/W2890399715,"Relatively few details of hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting ecology exist within the Arabian Gulf. Moreover, little is known about how their nesting dynamics compare to nesting populations throughout the rest of the world. Due to the extreme environmental setting, nesting ecology of hawksbills in the Arabian Gulf is of significant interest to researchers and conservationists. The current research reports on a long-term tagging and monitoring program undertaken at Fuwairit beach, Qatar. To investigate nesting behavior, site surveys and tagging were employed from 2010 to 2016. Presence of nests and clutch sizes were confirmed by excavation. Over the entire study period, nesting hawksbills had a mean curved carapace length of 70.8 cm (SD±2.8). A total 187 nests were confirmed, which contained a mean 78.9 eggs per clutch (SD±17.1), over an annual nesting season that lasted an average of 52.2 days (SD±6.3) from the start of April to the start of June. Meta-analysis with other global regions showed these characteristics to be significantly reduced when compared to nesting hawksbills from other populations. Meteorological data analysis showed air temperatures in the Arabian Gulf to increase on average 13.2°C (SD±0.26) from start to the end of nesting annually, which is significantly greater than other global nesting regions. Their smaller body size and reduced fecundity coupled with the extreme change in ambient air temperatures support the hypothesis that hawksbills in the region are more at risk than the already critically endangered hawksbill populations elsewhere in the world."
https://openalex.org/W2891179020,"Surveillance of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) is crucial to ensuring the continued success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs. With the concern of reduced genotyping sensitivity of HIV on dried blood spots (DBS), DBS for HIVDR surveillance have been limited to ART-naïve populations. To investigate if DBS under certain conditions may also be a feasible sample type for HIVDR testing in ART patients, we piloted nationwide surveys for HIVDR among ART patients using DBS in two African countries with rapid scale-up of ART.EDTA-venous blood was collected to prepare DBS from adult and pediatric ART patients receiving treatment during the previous 12-36 months. DBS were stored at ambient temperature for two weeks and then at -80°C until shipment at ambient temperature to the WHO-designated Specialized HIVDR Laboratory at CDC in Atlanta. Viral load (VL) was determined using NucliSENS EasyQ® HIV-1 v2.0 kits; HIVDR genotyping was performed using the ATCC HIV-1 Drug Resistance Genotyping kits.DBS were collected from 1,368 and 1,202 ART patients; 244 and 255 these specimens had VL ≥1,000 copies/mL in Kenya and Tanzania, respectively. The overall genotyping rate of those DBS with VL ≥1,000 copies/mL was 93.0% (95% CI: 89.1%-95.6%) in Kenya and 91.8% (87.7%-94.6%) in Tanzania. The turnaround times for the HIVDR surveys from the time of collecting DBS to completing laboratory testing were 6.5 months and 9.3 months for the Kenya and Tanzania surveys, respectively.The study demonstrates a favorable outcome of using DBS for nationwide surveillance of HIVDR in ART patients. Our results confirm that DBS collected and stored at ambient temperature for two weeks, and shipped with routine courier services are a reliable sample type for large-scale surveillance of acquired HIVDR."

This study aimed to evaluate the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR among hospital pharmacists in Pakistan.A descriptive, cross sectional study design was employed. Data were collected between 1st December, 2017 and 1st March, 2018 from 130 hospital pharmacists employed in 41 hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A survey instrument comprising of six sections was designed to determine the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR. Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The normality of the data was determined through Shapiro-Wilks and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Independent Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test were carried out to test if there were differences among the characteristics of the hospital pharmacists. Logistic regression analysis was used to figure out the factors associated with attitude, perceptions, willingness and motivation towards PBR. A p-value <0.05 was used for statistical significance of differences.A total of 141 pharmacists were approached. Among them, 130 responded to the survey (response rate 92%). Out of a maximum score i.e., 5 (100%) the respondents obtained a median score of 4 (IQR = 0) for attitude, perception and motivation towards PBR; whereas, a median score of 4 (IQR = 1) was obtained for willingness thus demonstrating fair positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards PBR. The most common barrier limiting the pharmacists' participation in PBR was lack of time (23.8%) followed by lack of incentives (16.2%) and lack of support (14.6%). Results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that hospital pharmacists practicing in the inpatient settings had 4.56 times more positive attitude towards PBR (OR = 4.56, 95%CI = 1.07─19.42, p-value = 0.040) as compared to those practicing in the outpatient settings. The male hospital pharmacists (OR = 8.86, 95%CI = 1.15-53.74, p-value = 0.017), those practicing in the outpatient (OR = 23.51, 95%CI = 2.04─271.53, p-value = 0.011) and inpatient settings had increased motivation towards PBR (OR = 12.24, 95%CI = 1.61─94.66, p-value = 0.016).Despite the presence of several barriers, the respondents had fair positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards PBR which is a promising finding."
https://openalex.org/W2891302958,"It is well accepted that influenza A virus predisposes individuals to often more severe superinfections with Streptococcus pneumonia. However, the mechanisms that lead to this synergy are not clearly understood. Recent data suggests that competent Th17 immunity is crucial to clearance and protection from invasive pneumococcal disease of the lung. We demonstrate that early influenza infection significantly reduced levels of pneumococcus driven IL-12p70, IL-23 and IL-27 in human monocytes with significant impairment of IL-17A and IFN-γ in HKSP-treated allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures. We also provide evidence to suggest that the hemagglutinin component of the virus is at least partially responsible for this downward pressure on IL-17 responses but surprisingly this suppression occurs despite robust IL-23 levels in hemagglutinin-treated monocyte cultures. This study demonstrates that influenza can directly affect the immunological pathways that promote appropriate responses to Streptococcus pneumonia in human immune cells. Importance Influenza virus is highly contagious and poses substantial public health problems due to its strong association with morbidity and mortality. Approximately 250,000–500,000 deaths are caused by seasonal influenza virus annually, and this figure increases during periods of pandemic infections. Most of these deaths are due to secondary bacterial pneumonia. Influenza-bacterial superinfection can result in hospitalisation and/or death of both patients with pre-existing lung disease or previously healthy individuals. The importance of our research is in determining that influenza and its component haemagglutinin has a direct effect on the classic pneumococcus induced pathways to IL-17A in our human ex vivo model. Our understanding of the mechanism which leaves people exposed to influenza infection during superinfection remain unresolved. This paper demonstrates that early infection of monocytes inhibits an arm of immunity crucial to bacterial clearance. Understanding this mechanism may provide alternative interventions in the case of superinfection with antimicrobial resistant strains of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2891580501,"An automated melanocytic lesion image-analysis algorithm is described that aims to reproduce the decision-making of a dermatologist. The utility of the algorithm lies in its ability to identify lesions requiring excision from lesions not requiring excision. Using only wavelet coefficients as features, and testing three different machine learning algorithms, a cohort of 250 images of pigmented lesions is classified based on expert dermatologists' recommendations of either excision (165 images) or no excision (85 images). It is shown that the best algorithm utilises the Shannon4 wavelet coupled to the support vector machine, where the latter is used as the classifier. In this case the algorithm, utilising only 22 othogonal features, achieves a 10-fold cross validation sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 and 0.87, resulting in a diagnostic-odds ratio of 261. The advantages of this method over diagnostic algorithms-which make a melanoma/no melanoma decision-are twofold: first, by reproducing the decision-making of a dermatologist, the average number of lesions excised per melanoma among practioners in general can be reduced without compromising the detection of melanoma; and second, the intractable problem of clinically differentiating between many atypical dysplastic naevi and melanoma is avoided. Since many atypical naevi that require excision on clinical grounds will not be melanoma, the algorithm-in contrast to diagnostic algorithms-can aim for perfect specificities without clinical concerns, thus lowering the excision rate of non-melanoma. Finally, the algorithm has been implemented as a smart phone application to investigate its utility in clinical practice and to streamline the assimilation of hitherto unseen tested images into the training set."
https://openalex.org/W2889593927,"In the mammalian intestine, glutamine assimilation by the absorptive villus cells is mediated by Na-glutamine co-transport, specifically by B0AT1. In a rabbit model of chronic intestinal inflammation, B0AT1 is inhibited secondary to a decrease in the number of co-transporters in the brush border membrane (BBM). This inhibition can be reversed by treatment with a broad-spectrum immune modulator such as glucocorticoid suggesting that immune inflammatory mediators may regulate B0AT1 during chronic intestinal inflammation. Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites (AAM) are increased during chronic intestinal inflammation. However, whether AAM may regulate B0AT1 during chronic intestinal inflammation is unknown. Treatment of rabbits with ATK, to prevent the release of AAM reversed the inhibition of B0AT1. AAM are products of cyclooxygenase (COX) and/or lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways. Inhibition of COX with piroxicam, therefore reduction of prostaglandin formation in the chronically inflamed intestine, reversed the inhibition of B0AT1 to its normal levels. In contrast, inhibition of LOX with MK886, thus reduction of leukotriene formation during chronic enteritis, did not affect the inhibition of B0AT1. Kinetic studies showed that the mechanism of restoration of B0AT1 by ATK or piroxicam was secondary to the restoration of BBM co-transporter numbers. Western Blot analysis also demonstrated restoration of BBM B0AT1 co-transporter numbers. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Na-glutamine co-transport mediated by B0AT1 in villus cells is regulated by prostaglandins rather than leukotrienes in the chronically inflamed intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2889731256,"Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) can cause a wide range of cognitive deficits, but its underlying nature is still unknown. We investigated the correlation between cognitive performance and specific patterns of resting-state brain metabolism in a NF1 sample. Sixteen individuals diagnosed with NF1 underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT brain imaging followed by a neuropsychological assessment. Principal component analysis was performed on 17 measures of cognitive function and a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression was used to individually predict the components that represented most of the variance in the neuropsychological data. The accuracy of the method was estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation and its significance through permutation testing. We found that only the first component could be accurately predicted from resting state metabolism (r = 0.926, p<0.001). Multiple and heterogeneous measures contribute to the first component, mainly WISC/WAIS Procedure and Verbal IQ, verbal memory and fluency. Considering the accurate prediction of measures of neuropsychological performance based on brain metabolism in NF1 patients, this suggests an underlying metabolic pattern that relates to cognitive performance in this group."
https://openalex.org/W2890929836,"To reduce the increasing need for corneal transplantation, attempts are currently aiming to restore corneal clarity, one potent source of cells are multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC®). These cells release a powerful cocktail of paracrine factors that can guide wound healing and tissue regeneration. However, their role in corneal regeneration has been overlooked. Thus, we sought to explore the potential of combining the cytoprotective storage feature of alginate, with MAPC to generate a storable cell-laden gel for corneal wound healing. 72 hours following hypothermic storage, alginate encapsulation was shown to maintain MAPC viability at either 4 or 15°C. Encapsulated MAPC (2 x106 cells/mL) stored at 15°C presented the optimum temperature that allowed for cell recovery. These cells had the ability to reattach to tissue culture plastic whilst exhibiting normal phenotype and this was maintained in serum-free and xenobiotic-free medium. Furthermore, corneal stromal cells presented a significant decrease in scratch-wounds in the presence of alginate encapsulated MAPC compared to a no-cell control (p = 0.018). This study shows that immobilization of MAPC within an alginate hydrogel does not hinder their ability to affect a secondary cell population via soluble factors and that these effects are successfully retained following hypothermic storage."
https://openalex.org/W2891318986,"The distributions of two bitterling fish (subfamily: Acheilognathinae), Tanakia lanceolata and T. limbata, overlap in western Japan. Acheilognathinae fish lay their eggs in the gills of freshwater bivalves, and the early juvenile stage develops in the gills. Populations of freshwater bivalves are declining worldwide, which has limited the number of spawning substrate for bitterlings. T. limbata has been artificially introduced to some rivers in Ehime, Japan, where it coexists with native T. lanceolata, and some hybrids have been observed. We collected both species from several sites in western Japan, and from the Kunichi River system in Ehime, and analyzed genetic population structure based on six microsatellite loci and sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Structure analysis identified three genetically distinct populations: T. lanceolata, T. limbata “West Kyushu”, and T. limbata “Setouchi”. Two clades of T. limbata were also supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses based on cytochrome b. Hybrids in Ehime originated mostly from interbreeding between male T. lanceolata and female T. limbata “West Kyushu”, and made up 10.2% of all collected fish, suggesting that hybrids occurred frequently between females of colonizing species and males of native species. On the other hand, interspecific hybrids were detected at rates of 40.0%, 20.0%, and 17.6% in the Ima River (Fukuoka), Midori River (Kumamoto), and Kase River (Saga), respectively, which are naturally sympatric regions. We found a few T. limbata “Setouchi” in the Midori and Kase Rivers, which were supposed to be introduced from other regions, coexisting with native T. limbata “West Kyushu”, and this cryptic invasion may have triggered the interspecific hybridization. These results suggest that artificial introduction of a fish species, a decline in the unionid population, and degradation of habitat have caused broad hybridization of bitterlings in western Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2891654939,"Elevated levels of FGF23 in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with adverse health outcomes, such as increased mortality, large vessel disease, and reduced white matter volume, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Apart from the well-known link between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, especially diabetes and hypertension, and cerebrovascular damage, elevated FGF23 is also postulated to be associated with cerebrovascular damage independently of CKD. Elevated FGF23 predisposes to vascular calcification and is associated with vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in the general population with normal renal function. These factors may lead to microangiopathic changes in the brain, cumulative ischemia, and eventually to the loss of white matter fibers. The relationship between FGF23 and brain integrity in individuals without CKD has hitherto not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between FGF23, and white matter integrity in a cohort of 50 participants with varying degrees of CV risk burden, using high resolution structural human brain connectomes constructed from MRI diffusion images. We observed that increased FGF23 was associated with axonal loss in the frontal lobe, leading to a fragmentation of white matter network organization. This study provides the first description of the relationship between elevated levels of FGF23, white matter integrity, and brain health. We suggest a synergistic interaction of CV risk factors and FGF23 as a potentially novel determinant of brain health."
https://openalex.org/W2890310674,"The ability to restrict low molecular weight compounds to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may enable an enhanced therapeutic index for molecular targets known to be associated with systemic toxicity. Using a triazolopyrazine CSF1R inhibitor scaffold, a broad range of prodrugs were synthesized and evaluated for enhanced delivery to the colon in mice. Subsequently, the preferred cyclodextrin prodrug moiety was appended to a number of CSF1R inhibitory active parent molecules, enabling GI-restricted delivery. Evaluation of a cyclodextrin prodrug in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse colitis model resulted in enhanced GI tissue levels of active parent. At a dose where no significant depletion of systemic monocytes were detected, the degree of pharmacodynamic effect-measured as reduction in macrophages in the colon-was inferior to that observed with a systemically available positive control. This suggests that a suitable therapeutic index cannot be achieved with CSF1R inhibition by using GI-restricted delivery in mice. However, these efforts provide a comprehensive frame-work in which to pursue additional gut-restricted delivery strategies for future GI targets."
https://openalex.org/W2891743686,"Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico were exposed to oil and various associated clean-up activities that may have compromised oyster reef health. Included in the exposure was oil, dispersant, and in some locales, atypical salinity regimes. Oil and dispersants can be detrimental to oysters and the effects of salinity depend on the level. In addition to these extrinsic factors, genetic diversity of oyster populations may help the oysters respond to stressors, as demonstrated in other systems. We used a 3×3×2 factorial design to experimentally examine the effects of oil/dispersed oil, intraspecific genetic diversity, and salinity on juvenile (ca. 25 mm shell height) oyster survivorship and growth during a 21-d exposure in a closed, recirculating system. The genetic effect was weak overall, oil and dispersed oil negatively affected juvenile oyster survivorship, and low salinity mitigated mortality in oil and dispersed oil treatments. Survivorship was about 40% greater in low-salinity than in mesohaline water for both oil and dispersed oil treatments, bringing survivorship in low salinity oil-only treatments to a similar level with low salinity controls (no oil). Oyster growth was minimal after 21 d but appeared to be negatively affected by oil and dispersed oil, and had a significant interaction with salinity. Our results may be informative for future decisions regarding oil spill response activities and suggest that a pulse of low salinity water may be a viable short-term mitigation option for oysters if filtration characteristics, exposure time, and water temperatures are all considered, in addition to weighing the costs and benefits of this type of response on other organisms and habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2889985839,"Objective To explore the operational feasibility of using mobile health clinics to reach the chronically underserved population with maternal and child health (MCH) services in Tanzania. Design We conducted fifteen key informant interviews (KIIs) with policy makers and district health officials to explore issues related to mobile health clinic implementation and their perceived impact. Main results Policy makers’ perspective indicates that mobile health clinics have improved coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions; however, they face financial, human resource-related and logistic constraints. Reported are the increased engagement of the community and awareness of the importance of MCH services, which is believed to have a positive effect on uptake of services. Key informants (KIs)’ perceptions and opinions were generally in favour of the mobile clinics, with few cautioning on their potential to provide care in a manner that promotes a continuum of care. Immunization, antenatal care, postnatal care and growth monitoring all seem to be successfully implemented in this mode of service delivery. Nevertheless, all informants perceive mobile clinics as a resource intensive yet unavoidable mode of service delivery given the current situation of having women and children residing in remote settings. Conclusion While the government shows the clear motive, the need and the willingness to continue providing services in this mode, the plan to sustain them is still a puzzle. We argue that the continuing need for these services should go hand in hand with proper planning and resource mobilization to ensure that they are being implemented holistically and to promote the provision of quality services and continuity of care. Plans to evaluate their costs and effectiveness are crucial, and that will require the collection of relevant health information including outcome data to allow sound evaluations to take place."
https://openalex.org/W2890654384,"Pathological synchronization in the basal ganglia network has been considered an important component of Parkinson’s disease pathophysiology. An established treatment for some patients with Parkinson’s disease is deep brain stimulation, in which a tonic high-frequency pulse train is delivered to target regions of the brain. In recent years, a novel neuromodulation paradigm called coordinated reset stimulation has been proposed, which aims to reverse the pathological synchrony by sequentially delivering short high-frequency bursts to distinct sub-regions of the pathologically synchronized network, with an average intra-burst interval for each sub-region corresponding to period of the pathological oscillation. It has further been proposed that the resultant desynchronization can be enhanced when stimulation is interrupted periodically, and that it is particularly beneficial to precisely tune the stimulation ON and OFF time-windows to the underlying pathological frequency. Pre-clinical and clinical studies of coordinated reset stimulation have relied on these proposals for their stimulation protocols. In this study, we present a modified ON-OFF coordinated reset stimulation paradigm called periodic flashing and study its behavior through computational modeling using the Kuramoto coupled phase oscillator model. We demonstrate that in contrast to conventional coordinated reset stimulation, the periodic flashing variation does not exhibit a need for precise turning of the ON-OFF periods to the pathological frequency, and demonstrates desynchronization for a wide range of ON and OFF periods. We provide a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed sensitivities and demonstrate that they are an artifact of the specific ON-OFF cycling paradigm used. As a practical consequence, the periodic flashing paradigm simplifies the tuning of optimal stimulation parameters by decreasing the dimension of the search space. It also suggests new, more flexible ways of delivering coordinated reset stimulation."

The main objective of the present study was to analyze the apoptosis pathways activated during follicular loss at multiple time points in a diabetic mouse model. Twenty BALB/c mice were used in this study, and diabetes mellitus was induced by streptozotocin injection. Three diabetic and two control animals were sacrificed on days 15, 20, 70 and 80 posttreatment. The ovaries were then removed; one was used for follicular counting, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, while the other was used for Western blot analysis. The proteins studied were BAX, BCL2, t-BID, FAS, FASL, active caspase 8, active caspase 9 and active caspase 3. Follicular apoptosis decreased over time, with the highest values observed at 15 days posttreatment. Granulosa cells were positive for active caspase 3, which showed constant expression levels at all time points. FAS, FASL, t-BID and active caspase 8 showed strong cytoplasmic immunostaining in the oocytes and granulosa cells of the diabetic mice, with significant increases observed at 15, 20 and 70 days posttreatment. BAX expression was slightly higher in the diabetic mouse ovaries than in the control ovaries at 15, 20 and 70 days posttreatment, whereas the highest active caspase 9 expression was at observed 20 days posttreatment. Low BCL2 protein levels were detected in the diabetic mouse ovaries at all time points. This study describes for the first time the behavior of apoptosis-related proteins in the diabetic mouse ovary and shows not only that the FAS/FASL pathway contributes to follicular loss but also that antral follicles are the most affected."
https://openalex.org/W2797576193,"Purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs) play an important role in the blood fluke parasite Schistosoma mansoni as a key enzyme of the purine salvage pathway. Here we present the structural and kinetic characterization of a new PNP isoform from S. mansoni, SmPNP2. Thermofluorescence screening of different ligands suggested cytidine and cytosine are potential ligands. The binding of cytosine and cytidine were confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry, with a KD of 27 μM for cytosine, and a KM of 76.3 μM for cytidine. SmPNP2 also displays catalytic activity against inosine and adenosine, making it the first described PNP with robust catalytic activity towards both pyrimidines and purines. Crystal structures of SmPNP2 with different ligands were obtained and comparison of these structures with the previously described S. mansoni PNP (SmPNP1) provided clues for the unique capacity of SmPNP2 to bind pyrimidines. When compared with the structure of SmPNP1, substitutions in the vicinity of SmPNP2 active site alter the architecture of the nucleoside base binding site thus permitting an alternative binding mode for nucleosides, with a 180° rotation from the canonical binding mode. The remarkable plasticity of this binding site enhances our understanding of the correlation between structure and nucleotide selectivity, thus suggesting new ways to analyse PNP activity."
https://openalex.org/W2890445098,"Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) have been reported to be present in 15-20% of sera from subjects with periodontitis at concentrations exceeding those found in 95% of the healthy adult population. These antibodies, albeit at concentrations exceeding those generally found in periodontitis subjects, are typically present in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss. aCL from APS patients are proinflammatory and can activate trophoblasts, macrophages, and platelets via cell-surface interactions with their target antigen beta-2-glycoprotein-I (β2GPI). β2GPI is an anionic phospholipid-binding serum protein that can associate with toll-like receptors (TLR's) on the cell-surface, leading to cell activation following interaction with autoimmune aCL. We examined an expanded series of 629 sera from clinically characterized subjects for aCL content, and observed that 14-19% of these sera contained elevated (>95th %-tile) levels of aCL. We purified IgG from 16 subjects with elevated or normal levels of aCL and examined their ability to activate TLR2- or TLR4-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and observed that IgG from periodontitis patients with elevated aCL activated HEK-TLR4 cells, but not HEK-TLR2 cells. Prior removal of aCL by immunoabsorption significantly reduced the ability of IgG preparations from these sera to activate TLR4. Further experiments using a human first trimester trophoblastic cell line (HTR8 sv/neo) revealed that aCL from periodontitis patients stimulated IL-8 production, which was profoundly decreased if aCL was removed by immunoabsorption or if HTR8 sv/neo were pretreated with blocking anti-TLR4 antibodies. Thus, it appears that aCL from periodontitis patients can be proinflammatory, activating cells via TLR4. Since these antibodies are likely produced via molecular mimicry due to similarities between oral bacterial antigens and β2GPI, the data indicate that circulating serum aCL may induce or influence inflammatory responses at sites distant from the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2889939599,"Betacyanins have been reported as water-soluble, nitrogenous pigments found in the order Caryophyllales, and they are known for powerful natural antioxidant. The biofortification of secondary metabolites such as anthocyanins and betacyanins has recently been performed in food crops by metabolic engineering through genetic modification. However, the distribution of genetically modified foods is strictly regulated. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new method for biofortifying natural antioxidants, betacyanins, without genetic modification. We first detected the presence of betacyanins in red-tube spinach (Spinacia oleracea) through ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We then hydroponically cultivated plants in the presence of three candidate compounds for betacyanin biofortification: dopamine, Ca2+, and sucrose. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and antioxidant activity analyses showed that sucrose was most successful in biofortifying betacyanins, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that several genes involved in betacyanin biosynthesis were induced by sucrose. Therefore, strategic hydroponics represents a new approach for cultivating betacyanin-enriched vegetables."
https://openalex.org/W2890083775,"Exosomes, extracellular nanovesicles that carry nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, have been the subject of several studies to assess their ability to transfer functional cargoes to cells. We recently characterized extracellular nanovesicles released from glioblastoma cells that carry active Ras in complex with proteins regulating exosome biogenesis. Here, we investigated whether a functional transfer of Ras from exosomes to other cells can initiate intercellular signaling. We observed that treatment of serum-starved, cultured glioblastoma cells with exogenous glioblastoma exosomes caused a significant increase in cellular viability over time. Moreover, we detected fluorescent signal transfer from lipophilic dye-labeled exogenous glioblastoma exosomes into cultured glioblastoma cells. To probe possible signaling from cell-to-cell, we utilized bimolecular luciferase complementation to examine the ability of K-Ras in exosomes to interact with the Raf-Ras Binding domain (Raf-RBD) expressed in a recipient cell line. Although the K-Ras/Raf-RBD interaction was readily detectable upon co-expression in a single cell line, or following lysis of co-cultured cell lines separately expressing K-Ras and RBD, bearing in mind the limitations of our assay, we were unable to detect the interaction in the intact, co-cultured cell lines or upon treatment of the Raf-RBD-expressing cells with exosomes containing K-Ras. Furthermore, HA-Tag-BFP fused to the K-Ras hypervariable region and CAAX sequence failed to be transferred at significant levels from extracellular vesicles into recipient cells, but remained detectable in the cell supernatants even after 96 hours of culture of naïve cells with extracellular vesicles. We conclude that if transfer of functional K-Ras from extracellular vesicles into the cytoplasm of recipient cells occurs, it must do so at an extremely low efficiency and therefore is unlikely to initiate Ras-ERK MAP kinase pathway signaling. These results suggest that studies claiming functional transfer of protein cargoes from exosomes should be interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2891761417,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are characterized by pathological high flow, low resistance connections between arteries and veins. Treatment is critically dependent on correct interpretation of angioarchitectural features. However, some microfistular AVMs do not match the characteristics described in current AVM classification systems. Therefore, we propose a new subgroup of microfistular AVMs, composed of enlarged, fistulous paths on the venous half of capillaries and/or dilated draining venules (hyperdynamic, capillary-venulous malformation [CV-AVM]). CV-AVMs still ensure arterial flow to the periphery and fistulous venous drainage is less pronounced than in classical AVMs such that these lesions are often misinterpreted as venous malformations.We developed a computational model to study the effects of microvascular anomalies on local hemodynamics, as well as their impact on angiographic contrast propagation. Flow rates and pressures were computed with a lumped parameter description, while contrast propagation was determined by solving the 1D advection-diffusion equation.For the newly proposed CV-AVM angioarchitecture, the computational model predicts increased arterio-venous contrast agent transit times and highly dispersive transport characteristics, compared to microfistular, interstitial type IV AVMs and high flow type II and III AVMs. We related these findings to time-contrast intensity curves sampled from clinical angiographies and found that there is strong evidence for the existence of CV-AVM."
https://openalex.org/W2891858815,"Background An increased fracture risk has been described as a complication of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical prediction models for general population have a limited predictive accuracy for fractures in T2DM patients. The aim was to develop and validate a clinical prediction tool for the estimation of 5-year hip and major fracture risk in T2DM patients. Methods and results A cohort of newly diagnosed T2DM patients (n = 51,143, aged 50–85, 57% men) was extracted from the Information System for the Development of Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database, containing computerized primary care records for >80% of the population of Catalonia, Spain (>6 million people). Patients were followed up from T2DM diagnosis until the earliest of death, transfer out, fracture, or end of study. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the 5-year risk of hip and major fracture. Calibration and discrimination were assessed. Hip and major fracture incidence rates were 1.84 [95%CI 1.64 to 2.05] and 7.12 [95%CI 6.72 to 7.53] per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Both hip and major fracture prediction models included age, sex, previous major fracture, statins use, and calcium/vitamin D supplements; previous ischemic heart disease was also included for hip fracture and stroke for major fracture. Discrimination (0.81 for hip and 0.72 for major fracture) and calibration plots support excellent internal validity. Conclusions The proposed prediction models have good discrimination and calibration for the estimation of both hip and major fracture risk in incident T2DM patients. These tools incorporate key T2DM macrovascular complications generally available in primary care electronic medical records, as well as more generic fracture risk predictors. Future work will focus on validation of these models in external cohorts."
https://openalex.org/W2889619133,"We describe and correlate environmental, floristic and structural vegetation traits of a large portion of Australian rangelands. We analysed 351 one hectare vegetation plots surveyed by Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) using the AusPlots Rangelands standardized method. The AusPlots Rangelands method involves surveying 1010 one meter-spaced point-intercepts (IPs) per plot. At each IP, species were scored, categorised by growth-form, converted to percentage cover as the input for the plot x species matrix. Vegetation structure is depicted by growth-form configuration and relative importance. The floristic and structural distance matrices were correlated with the Mantel test. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) related floristic composition to environmental variables sourced from WorldClim, the Atlas of Living Australia and TERN's Soil and Landscape Grid. Differences between clusters were tested with ANOVA while principal component analysis (PCA) ordered the plots within the environmental space. Our plot x species matrix required segmentation due to sparsity and high β-diversity. Based on the ordination of plots latitude within environmental space, the matrix was segmented into three ""superclusters"": the winter rain and temperate Mediterranean, the monsoonal rain savannas and the arid deserts. Further classification, with the UPGMA linkage method, generated two, four and five clusters, respectively. All groupings are described by species richness, diversity indices and growth form conformation. Several floristic disjunctions were apparent and their possible causes are discussed. For all superclusters, the correspondence between the floristic and the structural or growth form matrices was statistically significant. CCA ordination clearly demarcated all groupings. Aridity, rainfall, temperature, seasonality, soil nitrogen and pH are significant correlates to the ordination of superclusters and clusters. At present, our results are influenced by incomplete sampling. As more sites are surveyed, this pioneer analysis will be updated and refined providing tools for the effective management of Australian rangelands."
https://openalex.org/W2889990817,"In pest eradication programs, traps can directly reduce pest populations; however, their application to gastropod programs remains relatively unexplored. The South Florida Giant African Snail, Liassachatina fulica (Pulmonata: Achatinidae), eradication program allowed a realistic evaluation of their utility. Field studies were conducted to determine the best bait, barrier and trap for use during the eradication program. Immature and adult snails were attracted to banana fruit and a commercially produced bait but only the commercially produced bait did not attract non-target and pest mammals. Four commercially produced traps and 4 barriers were field evaluated for snail retention efficacy. Snails escaped all traps and trap/barrier combinations but the rate of escape ranged from 10–100% after 24 hrs. Laboratory studies confirmed that snails can survive crossing a 5 cm barrier of copper tape, salt, insect stickem or antifouling paint. In the laboratory study snails did not cross copper sulfate but they crossed the barrier in the field. Adding salt to traps as a means to retain snails reduced the number of snails trapped. Laboratory studies confirmed that dry salt decreased the number of snails entering traps and snails did not enter traps when the salt was dissolved in water. Two trap types and the commercial bait were selected for a large-scale program test. For three months, trapping along with hand collection and pesticide application were conducted on 114 properties in five locations. Traps caught snails when surveys and regular pesticide applications on the same properties did not detect them. On 21 occasions snails were only found in traps, and both immature and adult snails were caught. This study showed that traps could be effectively deployed in an eradication program and they could capture snails that may have escaped other control measures."

In three separate studies involving the prototypic MR 766 ZIKV strain and the human monocytic leukemia U937 cell line, ZIKV initially developed only a low-grade infection at a slow rate. After continuous culture for several months, persistently ZIKV-infected cell lines were observed with most, if not all, cells testing positive for ZIKV antigen. The infected cultures produced ZIKV RNA (v-RNA) and infectious ZIKVs persistently (""persistent ZIKVs"") with distinct infectivity and pathogenicity when tested using various kinds of host cells. When the genomes of ZIKVs from the three persistently infected cell lines were compared with the genome of the prototypic MR 766 ZIKV strain, distinct sets of mutations specific to each cell line were found. Significantly, all three ""persistent ZIKVs"" were capable of infecting fresh U937 cells with high efficiency at rapid rates, resulting in the development of a new set of persistently ZIKV-infected U937 cell lines. The genomes of ZIKVs from the new set of persistently ZIKV-infected U937 cell lines were further analyzed for their different mutations. The 2nd generation of persistent ZIKVs continued to possess most of the distinct sets of mutations specific to the respective 1st generation of persistent ZIKVs. We anticipate that the study will contribute to the understanding of the fundamental biology of adaptive mutations and selection during viral persistence. The persistently ZIKV-infected human cell lines that we developed will also be useful to investigate critical molecular pathways of ZIKV persistence and to study drugs or countermeasures against ZIKV infections and transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2891193639,"Shading of windows influences building cooling and heating loads through control of solar heat gains, and lighting load through access to available daylight. Shading shape thus presents an important factor both in building energy analysis and building aesthetics. Curvilinearity of solar paths suggests that the optimal shading shape may be curvilinear as well, and our aim here is to test this expectation. To accommodate curvilinearity of shading shape, outer edges of shading, which consists of overhang, western and eastern fins, are modeled as non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) curves, a widely accepted representation standard for curves in design industry. As a case study, a cellular office is considered in the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) office building model, with its overhang lined up by seven control points, and the fins lined up by five control points each, with two ending control points joint for the overhang and the fins. With control points allowed to take on nine different alternative depths, genetic optimisation is employed for 16 representative USA climates with respect to total equivalent source energy for heating, cooling and lighting loads. The main finding is that in a very close proximity to optimal shadings found by genetic optimisation there exist shadings with much simpler control point structure, obtained by identifying depths of successive control points, that have nearly rectangular overhangs. Since the difference between these simpler shadings and the optimal ones is less than 0.24%, this partially rejects the expectation that the optimal shading shape should be curvilinear. Structure of these near-optimal shadings also suggests a new way to partition shadings into independent regions: the lower and the upper parts of the western fin, joints of the overhang with the western and the eastern fin, the interior part of the overhang and the rest of the eastern fin."
https://openalex.org/W2891228854,"Chromatin structure, a key contributor to the regulation of gene expression, is modulated by a broad array of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). Taken together, these “histone marks” comprise what is often referred to as the “histone code”. The quantitative analysis of histone PTMs by mass spectrometry (MS) offers the ability to examine the response of the histone code to physiological signals. However, few studies have examined the stability of histone PTMs through the process of isolating and culturing primary cells. To address this, we used bottom-up, MS-based analysis of histone PTMs in liver, freshly isolated hepatocytes, and cultured hepatocytes from adult male Fisher F344 rats. Correlations between liver, freshly isolated cells, and primary cultures were generally high, with R2 values exceeding 0.9. However, a number of acetylation marks, including those on H2A K9, H2A1 K13, H3 K4, H3 K14, H4 K8, H4 K12 and H4 K16 differed significantly among the three sources. Inducing proliferation of primary adult hepatocytes in culture affected several marks on histones H3.1/3.2 and H4. We conclude that hepatocyte isolation, culturing and cell cycle status all contribute to steady-state changes in the levels of a number of histone PTMs, indicating changes in histone marks that are rapidly induced in response to alterations in the cellular milieu. This has implications for studies aimed at assigning biological significance to histone modifications in tumors versus cancer cells, the developmental behavior of stem cells, and the attribution of changes in histone PTMs to altered cell metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2890188186,"The objective of this study was to investigate a possible mechanism of action of metronomic chlorambucil on glioma by studying the in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-angiogenic effects on glioma and endothelial cells, respectively. The in vitro LD50 and IC50 of chlorambucil were determined using human SF767 and U87-MG glioma cell lines, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) and human endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). Results were analyzed in the context of chlorambucil concentrations measured in the plasma of tumor-bearing dogs receiving 4 mg m-2 metronomic chlorambucil. The LD50 and IC50 of chlorambucil were 270 μM and 114 μM for SF767, and 390 μM and 96 μM for U87-MG, respectively. The IC50 of chlorambucil was 0.53 μM and 145 μM for the HMVECs and ECFCs, respectively. In pharmacokinetic studies, the mean plasma Cmax of chlorambucil was 0.06 μM. Results suggest that metronomic chlorambucil in dogs does not achieve plasma concentrations high enough to cause direct cytotoxic or growth inhibitory effects on either glioma or endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2891620783,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB3 is a functional HLA class II gene, which has a limited allele diversity in the human population. Furthermore, the HLA-DRB3 gene is only present in a subset of individuals. Therefore, in organ transplantation, this HLA molecule is frequently mismatched between patient and graft donor and thus antibodies against this mismatched HLA molecule can develop. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and reactivity of these antibodies and aimed to identify factors that underlie antibody formation against HLA-DRB3. We showed in our patient cohort that HLA-DRB3 antibodies are identified in about 7% of all patients that were screened with solid phase assays. In these assays, we observed multiple antibody reactivity patterns indicating that HLA-DRB3 harbours multiple epitopes. In those cases, where we succeeded at tracing back the induction of these antibodies to the molecular HLA typing of the immunogenic event, we noticed a different frequency of HLA-DRB1 allele groups in the donors as compared to a control group. To a certain extent this distribution (e.g. HLA-DRB1*11 individuals) could be linked to an altered expression level. However, it also appears that different HLA-DRB3 alleles (e.g. HLA-DRB3*01 group) vary in their immunogenicity without having an expression difference. In conclusion, our study provides information on the immunogenicity and reactivity patterns of antibodies against HLA-DRB3 in kidney transplantation, and it points towards the possibility of HLA expression as a factor underlying antibody formation."
https://openalex.org/W2891049991,"To prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis, Hunan Province launched a free syphilis screening and treatment programme in 2011. Thus far, the programme has been implemented for 6 years. This study aimed to assess progress toward the elimination of MTCT of syphilis in Hunan Province from 2011-2016. Estimates of syphilis-related adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) were based on the health service delivery model developed by the WHO, which were then translated into disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Default values in the model were replaced by a Chinese version. The progress of this programme was assessed through the reduction of estimated DALYs with and without screening and treatment services. The results showed that the estimated number of syphilis-related APOs in Hunan Province from 2011 to 2016 was 3,840, more than 70% of which occurred among women who had at least one antenatal care visit but were not screened or treated for syphilis during pregnancy. The public health burden resulting from maternal syphilis-related APOs was 192,528 DALYs over six years, and with the current screening and treatment coverage, approximately 163,794 expected DALYs (46%) were averted. Our estimates indicate that in Hunan Province, syphilis in pregnancy continues to be an important cause of APOs, which can lead to substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality. Approximately half of the expected public health burden resulting from syphilis-related APOs was averted by the current screening and treatment services, which suggests progress toward the elimination of MTCT of syphilis in Hunan Province."
