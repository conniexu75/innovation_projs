https://openalex.org/W2023173825,"Polymer solutions and solids that contain light-sensitive molecules can undergo photo-contraction, whereby light energy is converted into mechanical energy. Here we show that a single film of a liquid-crystal network containing an azobenzene chromophore can be repeatedly and precisely bent along any chosen direction by using linearly polarized light. This striking photomechanical effect results from a photoselective volume contraction and may be useful in the development of high-speed actuators for microscale or nanoscale applications, for example in microrobots in medicine or optical microtweezers."

https://openalex.org/W1983250328,"Long-ranged forces between surfaces in a liquid control effects from colloid stability to biolubrication, and can be modified either by steric factors due to flexible polymers, or by surface charge effects. In particular, neutral polymer 'brushes' may lead to a massive reduction in sliding friction between the surfaces to which they are attached, whereas hydrated ions can act as extremely efficient lubricants between sliding charged surfaces. Here we show that brushes of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) attached to surfaces rubbing across an aqueous medium result in superior lubrication compared to other polymeric surfactants. Effective friction coefficients with polyelectrolyte brushes in water are lower than about 0.0006-0.001 even at low sliding velocities and at pressures of up to several atmospheres (typical of those in living systems). We attribute this to the exceptional resistance to mutual interpenetration displayed by the compressed, counterion-swollen brushes, together with the fluidity of the hydration layers surrounding the charged, rubbing polymer segments. Our findings may have implications for biolubrication effects, which are important in the design of lubricated surfaces in artificial implants, and in understanding frictional processes in biological systems."

We demonstrate that 2′-C-methyl ribonucleosides are efficient chain-terminating inhibitors of HCV genome replication. Characterization of drug-resistant HCV replicons defined a single S282T mutation within the active site of the viral polymerase that conferred loss of sensitivity to structurally related compounds in both replicon and isolated polymerase assays. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that resistance at the level of the enzyme results from a combination of reduced affinity of the mutant polymerase for the drug and an increased ability to extend the incorporated nucleoside analog. Importantly, the combination of these agents with interferon-α results in synergistic inhibition of HCV genome replication in cell culture. Furthermore, 2′-C-methyl-substituted ribonucleosides also inhibited replication of genetically related viruses such as bovine diarrhea virus, yellow fever, and West African Nile viruses. These observations, together with the finding that 2′-C-methyl-guanosine in particular has a favorable pharmacological profile, suggest that this class of compounds may have broad utility in the treatment of HCV and other flavivirus infections.

The prevalence of HCV infection is estimated to be ∼5-fold greater than HIV infection and ranges from 1–5% in most developed countries (1.Liang J.T. Hoofnagle J.H. Hepatitis C, Biomedical Research Reports. Academic Press, London, UK2000: 185-203Google Scholar). Current therapy is both poorly tolerated and has limited efficacy, with less than 50% response rates among patients infected with the most prevalent virus genotype (1b) (1.Liang J.T. Hoofnagle J.H. Hepatitis C, Biomedical Research Reports. Academic Press, London, UK2000: 185-203Google Scholar). Currently approved drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C are interferon-α and ribavirin, neither of which appears to act directly on the virus, and their antiviral effects appear to be mediated by multiple, indirect mechanisms. Therefore, there is a need for more efficient and better tolerated anti-HCV agents.The success of antiviral therapies based on chemotherapeutic agents targeting viral polymerases has prompted intense efforts to develop inhibitors of HCV NS5B, the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Studies with HIV reverse transcriptase validate the clinical utility of two distinct classes of viral polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors. Nucleoside inhibitors function as competitive substrate analogs that prevent RNA chain elongation when incorporated by the viral enzyme, resulting in premature chain termination (2.Wilson J. Porter D. Reardon J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 398-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 3.el Kouni M.H. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HIV reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors bind to a site residing outside the enzyme active site and inhibit catalysis by an allosteric mechanism (4.Tucker T. Lumma W. Culberson J.C.

Several putative allosteric binding sites on the surface of HCV NS5B have been suggested based on recent structural studies (6.Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J.

Although these compounds inhibit both purified HCV NS5B and viral replication using the cell-based replicon system, their mechanism of action has not yet been genetically validated and therefore it remains to be demonstrated that they possess direct antiviral activity. We recently reported the identification of two nucleoside inhibitors, 2′-C-methyl-adenosine (2′-C-Me-A) and 2′-O-methyl-cytidine (2′-O-Me-C), that inhibit HCV replication in a cell-based replicon assay, and their corresponding triphosphates inhibit NS5B activity (10.Carroll S.S. Tomassini J.E. Bosserman M. Getty K. Stahlhut M.W. Eldrup A.B. Bhat B. Hall D. Simcoe A.L. LaFemina R. Rutkowski C.A. Wolanski B. Yang Z. Migliaccio G. De Francesco R. Kuo L.C. MacCoss M. Olsen D.B.

Here, we report genetic data demonstrating that inhibition of HCV replication by 2′-modified nucleosides in cell culture is due to direct NS5B inhibition and present evidence suggesting that members of this compound class might have clinical utility against a broad spectrum of related positive strand viruses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSelection of Drug-resistant Replicons—Parental Huh-7 and the replicon harboring cells HBI10A were cultured as described (11.Trozzi C. Bartholomew L. Ceccacci A. Biasiol G. Pacini L. Altamura S. Narjes F. Muraglia E. Paonessa G. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Clones resistant to 2′-C-Me-A were selected as described previously (11.Trozzi C. Bartholomew L. Ceccacci A. Biasiol G. Pacini L. Altamura S. Narjes F. Muraglia E. Paonessa G. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, HBI10A cells were plated in 15-cm tissue culture dishes at a density of 3 × 103/cm2 and cultured in the presence of 0.8 mg/ml G418 and 2′-C-Me-A at concentrations increasing from 1 to 5 μm. Approximately 15 days after beginning of selection, small colonies of cells resistant to the inhibitor and the antibiotic became visible and were isolated. The sequence of HCV replicons present in drug-resistant cell clones was obtained following extraction of replicon RNA from resistant cell clones, reverse transcriptase PCR, and direct sequencing of PCR products (11.Trozzi C. Bartholomew L. Ceccacci A. Biasiol G. Pacini L. Altamura S. Narjes F. Muraglia E. Paonessa G. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).HCV Replicon Assays—An in situ RNase protection assay that measures viral RNA with a riboprobe complementary to HCV NS5B was used to measure the effect of inhibitors on viral genome replication. Conditions for the in situ RNase protection assays were as described previously (10.Carroll S.S. Tomassini J.E. Bosserman M. Getty K. Stahlhut M.W. Eldrup A.B. Bhat B. Hall D. Simcoe A.L. LaFemina R. Rutkowski C.A. Wolanski B. Yang Z. Migliaccio G. De Francesco R. Kuo L.C. MacCoss M. Olsen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11979-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Transient genome replication assays were performed by transfection of replicons harboring the NS5A S232I adaptive mutation that expressed the β-lactamase reporter, and replication was measured by quantitation β-lactamase reporter activity as described previously (12.Murray E.M. Grobler J.A. Markel E.J. Pagnoni M.F. Paonessa G. Simon A.J. Flores O.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2928-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The S282T mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using standard techniques. Transfected cells were cultured in the absence of drug for 4 days and in the presence of inhibitor compound for 48 h prior to reading. IC50 determinations were calculated as a percent of the Me2SO control by fitting the data to a 4-parameter fit function using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).NS5B Enzyme Assays—HCV (genotype 1b) NS5BΔ55 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (13.Carroll S.S. Sardana V. Yang Z. Jacobs A.R. Mizenko C. Hall D. Hill L. Zugay-Murphy J. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8243-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Km for ATP and kcat values were determined from a nonlinear least square fit of initial rates as a function of substrate concentration assuming Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Assays were performed with 10 nm wild type (WT) NS5BΔ55 or 25 nm S282T mutant enzyme and 40 nm heteropolymeric RNA template (22.Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.05% Triton X-100, 2% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.25 units/μl RNasin, and 5 mm MgCl2. The NS5B protein was preincubated with template RNA for 15 min at room temperature, and elongation reaction was started by the addition of 100 μm UTP, CTP, and GTP and increasing amounts of ATP and [α-32P]ATP (0.06 μCi/μm cold ATP). Elongation was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C, and the activity was measured as the radioactivity present in the acid-insoluble material. Under these conditions, reaction rates at the highest concentration of ATP approached saturation. IC50 values were determined in NS5B-catalyzed reactions that included 25 nm wild type NS5BΔ55 or 90 nm S282T NS5BΔ55 in a 50-μl reaction containing 90 nm template t500 (13.Carroll S.S. Sardana V. Yang Z. Jacobs A.R. Mizenko C. Hall D. Hill L. Zugay-Murphy J. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8243-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 unit/μl rRNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.2% polyethylene glycol-8000, 50 μm EDTA, 1 μm NTPs (unless otherwise noted), and ∼ 0.2–0.5 μCi of either [α-33P]GTP or -ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were initiated by the addition of a mixture of NTPs and inhibitor after preincubation of the enzyme and template for 30 min at room temperature. Reactions proceeded for 2 h at room temperature and were quenched with 0.5 m EDTA. Product formation was determined by DE-81 filter binding (Whatman) as described previously (13.Carroll S.S. Sardana V. Yang Z. Jacobs A.R. Mizenko C. Hall D. Hill L. Zugay-Murphy J. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8243-8249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The inhibitor concentration at which the enzyme catalyzed rate is reduced by half (IC50) was determined by fitting the relative rate data to the Hill equation,Fractioninhibition=(1-vi/v0)=[I]n/([I]n+IC50n)(Eq. 1) where vi is the reaction velocity in the presence of inhibitor, v0 is the reaction velocity in the absence of inhibitor, and n is the Hill coefficient. Data fitting was carried out using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software).The incorporation and extension of 2′-C-Me triphosphates were analyzed in reactions measuring incorporation of cold nucleoside analogs into 5′-32P end-labeled oligoribonucleotide templates. Templates were designed to fold into a hairpin structure with the first available template base as a U followed by an A (Fig. 2A) or C followed by A (Fig. 2B). Reaction conditions for incorporation and extension of 2′-C-Me analogs were as described previously (10.Carroll S.S. Tomassini J.E. Bosserman M. Getty K. Stahlhut M.W. Eldrup A.B. Bhat B. Hall D. Simcoe A.L. LaFemina R. Rutkowski C.A. Wolanski B. Yang Z. Migliaccio G. De Francesco R. Kuo L.C. MacCoss M. Olsen D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11979-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).Replicase Assay—HCV replication complexes were isolated by differential centrifugation from HB1 or 2′-C-Me-A-resistant HB1 cells and assayed as described previously (14.Tomassini J.E. Boots E. Gan L. Graham P. Munshi V. Wolanski B. Fay J.F. Getty K. LaFemina R. Virology. 2003; 313: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of 2′-C-Me triphosphates. Reaction products were separated on denaturing 1% agarose gels and quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis.Synergism Studies—HBI10A cells (11.Trozzi C. Bartholomew L. Ceccacci A. Biasiol G. Pacini L. Altamura S. Narjes F. Muraglia E. Paonessa G. Koch U. De Francesco R. Steinkuhler C. Migliaccio G. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were plated 16 h before drug addition. The two drugs to be combined were diluted serially 2-fold in 100% Me2SO, such that the IC50 falls in the middle of 8 point titrations, and were added to cells at a final 1% Me2SO concentration. The compounds were tested separately in replicate or in combination by adding one set of compound dilutions horizontally and the second vertically to the wells from the highest to lowest concentration such that the titrations overlap. The plates were analyzed using a 96-well in situ RNase protection assay format at 48 h post-drug addition. The percentage inhibition was determined in comparison with untreated control cells, and the data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression model (15.Barton C.N. Braunberg R.C. Friedman L. Biometrics. 1993; 49: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to determine whether the combination is additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. Additivity curves were predicted from the data for each compound alone using the similar or joint action model, fitted by including a parameter for additivity (λ = 0) or non-additivity (λ > 0). Combined data that fall above the curves indicate synergism (λ > 0) and below the curve (λ < 0) indicate antagonism.Antiviral Activity with Additional Viruses—Non-HCV antiviral assays were performed at the Utah State University Institute for Antiviral Research under the direction of Dr. Robert Sidwell. The EC50 and CC50 values of 2′-C-Me-A and 2′-C-methyl-guanosine (2′-C-Me-G) were determined in cell culture antiviral assays against the following 13 viruses (strain): West Nile (New York isolate), dengue type 2 (New Guinea), yellow fever (17D), rhino type 2 (HGP), rhino type 14 (1059), polio 3 (WM-3), western equine encephalitis (California), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (Trinidad), respiratory syncytial (A2), measles (Chicago), human cytomegalovirus (AD-169), herpes type 1 (McCrae), and herpes type 2 (E194). The preceding assays, with the exception of human cytomegalovirus, are described by Sidwell and Huffman (16.Sidwell R.W. Huffman J H. Appl. Microbiol. 1971; 22: 797-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were used in the reports of in vitro antiviral activity of ribavirin (17.Sidwell R.W. Huffman J.H. Khare G.P. Allen L.B. Witkowski J.T. Robins R.K. Science. 1972; 177: 705-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 18.Huffman J.H. Sidwell R.W. Khare G.P. Witkowski J.T. Allen L.B. Robins R.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1973; 3: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Once cellular monolayers were established, compound dilutions were added corresponding to 4-point or 7-point titrations followed by the addition of virus after ∼5 min. Toxicity measurements were determined from cells treated with compound without the addition of virus. Cells were incubated with compound and virus until viral controls had adequate cytopathic effect (CPE) (≥3 days for all viruses) for measurement. The cells were then microscopically examined for both virus-induced CPE and compound related toxicity. The EC50 and CC50 values were calculated by regression analysis of the viral CPE data and toxicity control data. A Neutral Red Assay confirmation of the viral CPE results, as described previously (19.Barnard D.L. Stowell V.D. Seley K.L. Hegde V.R. Das S.R. Rajappan V.P. Schneller S.W. Smee D.F. Sidwell R.W. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 2001; 12: 220-331Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was performed, and the results are listed in Table IV. The human cytomegalovirus protocol is based on a plaque reduction assay described previously (20.Sidwell R.W. Huffman J.H. Barnard D.L. Reist E.J.

Open table in a new tab Pharmacokinetic Studies—Compounds were formulated in saline at 1.0 mg/ml and dosed intravenously at 1.0 mg/kg and orally at 2.0 mg/kg in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood was collected in heparinized tubes and spun down in a centrifuge, and the plasma was decanted and frozen until analyzed. Plasma samples (50 μl) were pretreated via protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Samples were analyzed using a PerkinElmer high pressure liquid chromatography with a 2 × 50-mm Zorbax SB-CN (Mac-Mod Analytical, Chadds Ford, PA) column connected to a Sciex API 3000 (Toronto, Canada) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray source operated in the positive selected reaction monitoring mode. Data were collected and analyzed using Sciex Analyst 1.0 Software. Pharmacokinetic calculations were performed using Watson version 6.02.0.02 for Windows (Pharmaceutical Software Systems, Inc., Wayne, PA). Plasma clearance and elimination half-life were calculated using data from the intravenously dosed subjects. Oral bioavailability was calculated as the area under the curve (AUC) from the oral dose divided by the AUC from the intravenous dose times 100.Construction of NS5B Model with Bound Inhibitor—The active sites of the HCV NS5B polymerase (Protein Data Bank code 1GX6; Ref. 6.Bressanelli S.

Next, the side chain of Arg-158 in NS5B was manually repositioned to bind the NTP β-phosphate as observed in the Φ6 crystal structure. A 12-Å zone of NS5B around the active site was extracted and divided into the following subzones: incoming NTP, primer, template, metal ions, residues within 4 Å of the NTP, and residues further than 4 Å from the NTP. The structure was optimized by iterative cycles of minimization of the complex to low gradient using different restraints on the various zones followed by decreasing restraints until a low energy structure was obtained without excessive motion relative to the initial complex. Minimization was performed in MacroModel (24.Mohamadi F. Richards N.G.J. Guida W.C. Liskamp R. Caufield C. Chang G. Hendrickson T. Still W.C. J. Comput.

The weakest constraints, initially 5 kcal/mol·Å2, were placed on the template; medium strength constraints, 20 kcal/mol·Å2, were placed on the NTP, primer, and side chains of nearby residues; and the strongest constraints, 400 kcal/mol·Å2, were placed on the metal ions, distant residues, and backbone atoms of nearby residues. Base-pairing was also enforced with high strength constraints. Following each minimization cycle, the restraint force constants were multiplied by 0.75. The minimization was stopped after 20 cycles.RESULTSCell Culture HCV Antiviral Activity of 2′-C-Methyl Nucleosides Is Directed against the Viral Polymerase—To further explore the contribution of the 2′-methyl-ribose in NS5B inhibition, 2′-C-Me-G was synthesized and characterized. The activity of 2′-C-Me-A and 2′-C-Me-G on viral replication was determined in Huh7 cells using the HCV replicon system (25.Lohman V. Körner F. Koch J.-O. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R.

Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), and their activity as triphosphates against purified NS5B was also determined in parallel experiments. Viral replication was quantified using an in situ ribonuclease protection assay that directly measures viral RNA. Both 2′-C-Me-substituted compounds and 2′-O-Me-C inhibited NS5B polymerase activity and HCV replication without overt toxicity to replicon cells in a 24-h assay (Table I), indicating that the 2′-Me modification confers antiviral activity irrespective of the base. HCV replication was inhibited to a similar extent following incubation of replicon cells with compound for 24 or 48 h, suggesting that phosphorylation is not rate-limiting in cells harboring HCV replicons. Importantly, quantitation of nucleoside triphosphate levels in Huh7 cells revealed a correlation between nucleoside phosphorylation and inhibition of HCV replication (Table I).Table IActivity of 2′-modified nucleosides and corresponding triphosphatesa IC50 values are means ± SD determined from three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Selection and Characterization of Resistant Mutants—To investigate whether the antiviral activity exhibited by these compounds was due to direct inhibition of the viral polymerase, HCV replicons resistant to 2′-C-Me nucleosides were selected and characterized. Following incubation of replicon harboring cells with G418 and escalating concentrations of 2′-C-Me-A, several drug-resistant cell clones were isolated and four were further characterized. Resistant cell clones were phenotypically similar to parental cells, as they exhibited identical growth rates and had comparable levels of both viral RNA and protein (data not shown). More importantly, these clones exhibited reduced susceptibility to 2′-C-Me-A, with IC50s at least four times higher than that of parental cells (Table II). The sensitivity of a representative cell clone to various inhibitors was characterized in detail and revealed cross-resistance to 2′-C-Me-G but not to the nucleoside 2′-O-Me-C, suggesting that resistance is directed against the 2′C-Me-ribose (Table II).Table IICharacterization of Huh7 cells harboring HCV replicons resistant to 2′-C-Me-A (HBI-R)CompoundReplicon IC50aDetermined in indicated replicon cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Replicase IC50bDetermined in in vitro assay using replicase isolated from indicated replicon cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”NS5B IC50cIn vitro NS5B assay using a heteromeric template.HBIHBI-RHBIHBI-RWTS282Tμmμmμm2′-C-Me-A/ATP0.176.62.5>1001.9842′-C-Me-G/GTP1.413.40.919.50.1202′-O-Me-C/CTP12.69.02.55.03.816.0a Determined in indicated replicon cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Determined in in vitro assay using replicase isolated from indicated replic"
https://openalex.org/W2019229910,"1-Amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS, EC 4.4.1.14) is the key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants. The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence revealed the presence of twelve putative ACS genes, ACS1–12, dispersed among five chromosomes. ACS1–5 have been previously characterized. However, ACS1 is enzymatically inactive whereas ACS3 is a pseudogene. Complementation analysis with the Escherichia coli aminotransferase mutant DL39 shows that ACS10 and 12 encode aminotransferases. The remaining eight genes are authentic ACS genes and together with ACS1 constitute the Arabidopsis ACS gene family. All genes, except ACS3, are transcriptionally active and differentially expressed during Arabidopsis growth and development. IAA induces all ACS genes, except ACS7 and ACS9; CHX enhances the expression of all functional ACS genes. The ACS genes were expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, and biochemically characterized. The quality of the recombinant proteins was verified by N-terminal amino acid sequence and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The analysis shows that all ACS isozymes function as dimers and have an optimum pH, ranging between 7.3 and 8.2. Their Km values for AdoMet range from 8.3 to 45 μm, whereas their kcat values vary from 0.19 to 4.82 s–1 per monomer. Their Ki values for AVG and sinefungin vary from 0.019 to 0.80 μm and 0.15 to 12 μm, respectively. The results indicate that the Arabidopsis ACS isozymes are biochemically distinct. It is proposed that biochemically diverse ACS isozymes function in unique cellular environments for the biosynthesis of C2H4, permitting the signaling molecule to exert its unique effects in a tissue- or cell-specific fashion. 1-Amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS, EC 4.4.1.14) is the key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants.

The structures show that the enzyme is a homodimer, and its overall fold and active sites are similar to those of aminotransferases even though the two enzymes have completely different catalytic activities.

The sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome revealed that ACS genes are putatively encoded by twelve genes (32.Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7165) Google Scholar). The question immediately arises as to why there are so many ACS isozymes for synthesizing ethylene in Arabidopsis. It has been postulated that the presence of ACS isozymes may reflect tissue-specific expression that satisfies the biochemical environment of the cells or tissues in which each isozyme is expressed (15.Rottmann W.E. Peter G.F. Oeller P.W. Keller J.A. Shen N.F. Nagy B.P. Taylor L.P. Campbell A.D. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 937-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For example, a group of cells or tissues with low concentration of the ACS substrate, AdoMet, would express a high affinity (low Km) ACS isozyme. Accordingly, the tissue-specific expression of distinct ACS isozymes, defined by their unique biochemical properties, would allow C2H4 to be made in a tissue-specific manner to mediate various biological responses. Herein, we report the biochemical characterization of the Arabidopsis ACS gene family members as a first step toward understanding the role of multigene families in plants in general and of ACS in particular. pET22, pET28, pET32 vectors, and thrombin protease (restriction grade) were purchased from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). pBAD-HisA vector was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)RIL strain was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Superdex™-200 was from Amersham Biosciences. pQE80 vector and Ni-NTA agarose were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Complete™-EDTA-free was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN).

Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no spurious mutations were introduced during mutagenesis. (a) Plant Material—A. thaliana ecotype Columbia seeds were surfaced sterilized for 8 min in 5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.15% Tween 20, excessively rinsed in distilled water, and plated on Petri dishes onto sterilized filter paper discs on top of 0.8% agar (Select Agar, Invitrogen) containing 0.5× Murashige-Skoog salts (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm MES, pH 5.7, 1% sucrose, 1× vitamin B5. The plates were incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 7 days after cold treatment at 4 °C for 2 days. Intact etiolated seedlings were removed and placed in Petri dishes containing 0.5× Murashige-Skoog salts solution buffered at pH 5.7 with 0.5 mm MES and supplemented with 20 μm IAA or 50 μm CHX. The seedlings were incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature with shaking (100 rev/min). Mock controls were incubated with an equal amount of solvent (ethanol) used to prepare the stock solution of the chemicals. Five g-fresh weight of seedlings were removed, briefly blotted dry, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Three-week-old light-grown plants were grown as described in the Arabidospsis Biological Resources Center (ABRC) manual. Roots, leaves, stems, flowers, and siliques were collected and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from 7-day old etiolated seedlings, treated with or without 20 μm IAA or 50 μm CHX, and from various parts of light grown plants, using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) or with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was removed by treating 1–2 mg of total RNA with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) by incubating for 15 min at 37 °C in 10 μlof1× DNase I buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 40 units of RNase inhibitor. 5 μg of DNase treated RNA primed with oligo (dT)24 primer were used for first strand synthesis with SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Full-length open reading frame clones (ORFs) for all the putative ACS genes were constructed by: 1) PCR from preexisting full-length cDNAs (ACS1 U26543; ACS2 M95595; ACS4 U23481; ACS5 L29261), using the following gene-specific primers: ACS1: F, (5′-GAATTCGGCCGTCAAGGCCAGAAGGAGATATAACCATGTCTCAGGGTGCATGTGAG-3′) and R, (5′-AGTCGACGGCCCATGAGGCCTTAAGCTCGAAGCAATGGTGA; ACS2: F, (5′-GAATTCGGCCGTCAAGGCCAGAAGGAGATATAACCATGGGTCTTCCGGGAAAAAAT-3′) and R, (5′-AGTCGACGGCCCATGAGGCCTCATGCTCGGAGAAGAGGTGA-3′); ACS4: F, (5′-GAATTCGGCCGTCAAGGCCAGAAGGAGATATAACCATGGTTCAATTGTCAAGAAAA-3′) and R,(5′-AGTCGACGGCCCATGAGGCCCTATCGTTCCTCAGCCTCACG-3′); ACS5: F, (5′-GAATTCGGCCGTCAAGGCCAGAAGGAGATATAACCATGAAACAGCTTTCGACAAAA-3′) and R, (5′-AGTCGACGGCCCATGAGGCCTCATCGTTCATCAGGTACACG-3′). 2) RT-PCR poly(A)+ RNA from CHX-treated etiolated seedlings was purified by oligo(dT) cellulose (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA with oligo dT18 as a primer and 1000 units of SuperScript II RT enzyme (Invitrogen) as previously described (36.Carninci P. Hayashizaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 19-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was re-suspended into 50 μlofdH2O after phenol/chloroform extraction followed by EtOH precipitation. Using gene-specific primers, 0.5 μl of 1st-strand cDNA and 3.75 units of Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), cDNAs were amplified using the following conditions. After initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C, touch-down PCR (37.Schunck B. Kraft W. Truyen U. J. Virol.

The ORFs were cloned into the pUNI51 vector and sequenced. pUNI51 was derived from pUNI50 (38.Liu Q.H. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr.

The sequences of all eleven putative ACS ORFs are error-free and can be transferred into any desirable expression vector by in vitro cre/lox recombination (38.Liu Q.H. Li M.Z. Leibham D. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1300-1309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their sequences have been deposited in GenBank™. The clones are publicly available through the ABRC (www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/abrchome.htm). All ACS isozymes were expressed in E. coli as N-terminal fusions with thioredoxin and His tags containing a thrombin cleavage site adjacent to the N terminus of ACS using the pBAD promoter (41.Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J.O.N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the overall strategy for constructing the expression vector, pBAD-Trx-His for achieving this goal. The NdeI site present in front of the thioredoxin ORF was changed to the NcoI site by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer P1, 5′-CTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACCATGGGAAGCGATAAAATTATTCACC-3′ (underlined shows the NcoI restriction site) giving rise to pET321. The NdeI site present in front of the His tag was deleted and replaced with the MscI-BglII linker, 5′-CCATCATCATCATCATCACTCTTCTGGA-3′ (underlined shows the His6 tag sequence) giving rise to pET322. A thrombin protease site and a NdeI site were introduced in front of the multicloning site (MCS) of pET32 with a KpnI-BamHI linker, 5′-CGGTGGTGGCTCCGGTCTGGTGCCACGCGGT AGTCATATGGATATCG-3′ (bold and underlined show thrombin and NdeI sites, respectively), replacing the KpnI/BamHI sites of pET322, giving rise to pET323. The pBAD-HisA vector was modified as follows: the NdeI site present downstream of the origin of replication was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer P2, 5′-CGGTATTTCACACCGCATATCGTGCACTCTCAGTACAATC-3′ (bold shows mutated base). The other NdeI site present in the MCS of pBAD-HisA was deleted by BglII/HindIII digestion and filling in with T4 DNA polymerase. An XbaI site was introduced between the pBAD promoter and the ribosome-binding site (rbs) by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer P3, 5′-CATACCCGTTTTTTTGGTCTAGAAGGAGGAATTAACCATG-3′ (underlined shows the XbaI site). Finally, the XbaI-XhoI fragment of pET323 containing the rbs, Trx tag, His tag, thrombin site, and MCS was subcloned into the XbaI/XhoI sites of the modified pBAD-HisA giving rise to the pBAD-Trx-His vector used in this study. Expression in E. coli—The ACS ORFs were subcloned into pBAD-Trx-His and pET22 vectors as NdeI/SacI fragments (ACS2, -4, -5, -6, -8, -9, and -12) or as NdeI/NotI fragments (ACS7, -10, and -11) (42.Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) giving rise to pBAD-ACS2–12 and pET22-ACS2–12 plasmids, respectively. The pBAD-Trx-His expression system produces His-tagged proteins that can be purified by affinity chromatography. The pET22 expression system (42.Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) produces native proteins that can be purified by conventional purification procedures (non-affinity chromatography). We decided to use the pBAD expression system because it gave the same levels of enzyme activities as the pET22 system (see Table I) while allowing protein purification by affinity chromatography. Attempts to purify the ACS isozymes using the IMPACT I (Intein mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag; New England Biolabs) expression system were unsuccessful.Table IActivity of the Arabidopsis ACS isozymes in E. coliGeneAmino acid no.Predicted mol. massIsoelectric pt.pET22pBADDanmol/100 μl/h at 30 °CACS148855,002.367.1600ACS249655,794.037.264.76.6ACS447454,075.918.171728ACS547053,593.457.4989227ACS649555,808.796.23204270ACS744750,946.115.927124ACS846953,651.297.82202165ACS947053,450.246.79133114ACS1055761,184.327.6700ACS1146052,079.416.356328ACS1249555,213.127.0400 Open table in a new tab E. coli transformants harboring the expression vectors pET22-ACS2–12 and pBAD-ACS2–12 were cultured in LB and RM media (1× M9 salts-2% Casamino acids-1 mm MgCl2) plus 0.2% glucose, respectively, with 150 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C in a buffered flask with constant shaking at 300 rpm, until the cell cultures reached an OD600 of 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (pET plasmid) or l-(+)-arabinose (pBAD plasmid) was added to each culture to a final concentration of 1 mm or 0.2% (w/v), respectively, and the cell cultures were then allowed to grow for an additional 4 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min, washed once in half of the original volume with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl, and stored at –70 °C. For large scale protein preparation, a single colony containing pBAD-ACS plasmid was first inoculated into 100 ml of RM plus glucose medium, incubated until OD600 reached 1.0, then transferred into 3 to 6 liters of the same medium containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin, and induced under the same conditions. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. ACS activity was assayed in a reaction mixture (total volume, 0.4 ml) containing 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0–10 μm PLP-120 μm AdoMet and an appropriate enzyme fraction. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated with 50 μl of 10 mm HgCl2. The amount of ACC formed was determined according to (43.Lizada M.C.C. Yang S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity converts 1 μmol of AdoMet to ACC per hour at 30 °C. The overall protein purification scheme is shown in Fig. 1B. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 1:20 of the original volume in extraction buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10 μm PLP, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NDSB201–100 μl/ml lysozyme, and proteinase inhibitor Complete™ (1 tablet per 50 ml of buffer). The cells were lysed by sonication. An aliquot of the cell extract was analyzed on SDS-PAGE. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was used as crude ACS solution. Twenty percent of the streptomycin sulfate solution was added to the crude ACS solution to the final concentration of 1.5% to precipitate genome DNA. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (100% saturation), and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation in a small volume of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 μm PLP, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm NDSB201-Complete™ and desalted on a Sephadex-25 column (2.5 × 30 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Imidazole solution, 1 m, pH 8.0, was added to the fraction with ACS activity, to a final concentration of 10 mm, and applied to Ni-NTA agarose column (1 × 3 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Weakly bound proteins were washed from the resin with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 μm PLP, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm NDSB201-Complete™. The His6-tagged protein was eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 μm PLP, 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 2 mm NDSB201-Complete™. Eluted fractions with ACS activity were buffer-exchanged on a Sephadex-25 m in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 μm PLP, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm NDSB201–2.5 mm CaCl2. Subsequently, thrombin protease (1 unit/mg ACS) was added to the thioredoxin-His6-tag-ACS solution and digested at 20 °C for 16 h. The digest was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in a small volume of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 μm PLP, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm NDSB201, and fractionated on a Superdex™-200 column (1 × 30 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid method (44.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18647) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis was done at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility. SDS-PAGE was carried out with 10% acrylamide gel according to (45.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) using marker proteins: β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97 kDa), fructose-6-phosphate kinase (84 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), glutamic dehydrogenase (55 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (36 kDa). Superdex™-200 (1 × 30 cm) column was calibrated with following marker proteins (Sigma): apoferritin (443 kDa), α-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). MALDI-TOF mass analysis was carried out on a Bruker Reflecton II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Samples were prepared by mixing one part of protein sample with nine parts of matrix (saturated sinapinic acid or cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% acetonitrile), and 1 μl of this solution was applied onto the sample probe. External calibration was carried out using two ion peaks from bovine serum albumin: [M + 2H]2+, 33,216; [M + H]+, 66,432. ACC synthase activity was measured at different AdoMet concentrations ranging from 3 to 200"
https://openalex.org/W1989541636,"Nrf1 and Nrf2 are members of the CNC family of bZIP transcription factors that exhibit structural similarities, and they are co-expressed in a wide range of tissues during development. Nrf2 has been shown to be dispensable for growth and development in mice. Nrf2-deficient mice, however, are impaired in oxidative stress defense. We previously showed that loss of Nrf1 function in mice results late gestational embryonic lethality. To determine whether Nrf1 and Nrf2 have overlapping functions during early development and in the oxidative stress response, we generated mice that are deficient in both Nrf1 and Nrf2. In contrast to the late embryonic lethality in Nrf1 mutants, compound Nrf1, Nrf2 mutants die early between embryonic days 9 and 10 and exhibit extensive apoptosis that is not observed in the single mutants. Loss of Nrf1 and Nrf2 leads to marked oxidative stress in cells that is indicated by elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and cell death that is reversed by culturing under reduced oxygen tension or the addition of antioxidants. Compound mutant cells also show increased levels of p53 and induction of Noxa, a death effector p53 target gene, suggesting that cell death is potentially mediated by reactive oxygen species activation of p53. Moreover, we show that expression of genes related to antioxidant defense is severely impaired in compound mutant cells compared with single mutant cells. Together, these findings indicate that the functions of Nrf1 and Nrf2 overlap during early development and to a large extent in regulating antioxidant gene expression in cells."

Foxo1 (also known as FKHR) is a winged helix transcription factor that, along with other Foxo family members including Foxo3 (FKHRL1) and Foxo4 (AFX), is implicated in several biological processes including but not limited to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and glucose homeostasis (reviewed in Refs. 14Kops G.J.

Insulin and other growth factors promote phosphorylation of Foxo factors on one or more phospho-acceptor sites resulting in exclusion and/or export from the nucleus. This appears to serve as the primary molecular switch that regulates Foxo factor activity. Growth factors induce activation of Akt/protein kinase B, which then phosphorylates Foxo factors (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J.

Recent evidence suggests that the phosphorylation status of Foxo1 might also regulate transcriptional activation properties in addition to regulating cytolocalization (24Perrot V. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26111-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Insulin-induced inactivation of Foxo1 appears to be one of the mechanisms through which insulin suppresses gluconeogenic gene expression as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, two enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, are encoded by Foxo1 target genes (25Hall R.K.

While regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase via this mechanism is controversial, recent evidence from Foxo1± mice supports such a mechanism for regulation of glucose-6-phosphatase (27Nakae J.

Extensive work in Caenorhabditis elegans has culminated in the identification of at least three conserved signaling pathways that influence metabolism, aging, stress tolerance, and/or cellular differentiation processes. Elucidation of complex interactions between C. elegans insulin, transforming growth factor-β, and NHR pathways has proven useful to understanding homologous vertebrate pathways (reviewed in Refs. 28Murakami S.

Science. 2003; 299: 1346-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In fact, clues as to the identification of Foxo factors as Akt substrates came from genetic analysis of the homologous pathway present in C. elegans. The nematode forkhead factor, DAF-16, most closely resembles members of the mammalian Foxo family (30Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 31Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), and DAF-16 is a likely ortholog of at least one Foxo factor (32Cahill C.M. Tzivion G. Nasrin N. Ogg S. Dore J. Ruvkun G.

Interestingly, detailed genetic analyses of daf-2 (insulin receptor), daf-16 (Foxo factor), and daf-12 (NHR) suggest interactions among these signaling components, but the molecular basis for such genetic interactions is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to isolate proteins expressed in adipocytes that interact with PPARγ and to examine the functional consequences of such interactions. Here we report the identification of Foxo1 as a PPARγ-interacting protein. Functional assays indicate that Foxo1 antagonizes PPARγ signaling and that PPARγ antagonizes Foxo1 signaling suggesting a reciprocal antagonistic interaction between these two transcription factors. In protein interaction assays, the C. elegans NHR, DAF-12, interacted with the C. elegans forkhead factor, DAF-16, in a manner analogous to the interaction between PPARγ and Foxo1 suggesting that NHR-forkhead factor interactions and cross-talk may be conserved throughout evolution. Considering the prominent roles played by PPARγ and Foxo1 in vertebrate insulin signaling pathways, and that of DAF-12 and DAF-16 in the homologous nematode insulin-like pathway, these findings may provide a foundation for a better mechanistic understanding of insulin action. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and 3T3-L1 Adipocyte Library Construction—The yeast two-hybrid screen was initiated by growing a 100 ml culture of the yeast reporter strain L40 transformed with the PPARγ bait plasmid (pBTM116/PPARγ ligand binding domain, encoding a LexA DNA binding domain fused to the PPARγ ligand binding domain residues 182–505) at 30 °C to an A 600 > 0.8. An aliquot of the frozen yeast strain BY4734 transformed with a 3T3-L1 adipocyte library was thawed and mated with the bait-transformed reporter strain in a 50-ml volume of 2× YPDA (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose/alanine) + 50 μg/ml kanamycin for 20 h at 30 °C with gentle shaking (50 rpm). The resulting diploid cells were then plated on 50 100-mm culture plates containing synthetic medium lacking tryptophan (to select for the reporter strain), leucine (to select for the library plasmid), and histidine (to select for HIS3 reporter activity). Library plasmids were recovered from colonies that grew on the screening plates, shuttled into Escherichia coli and sequenced. The regions of Foxo1 and RXRα isolated from the screen encompassed amino acids 436–652 and 257–467, respectively. Construction of the 3T3-L1 adipocyte library was described previously (35Dowell P.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were maintained and induced to differentiate as described previously (36Dowell P. Flexner C. Kwiterovich P.O. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41325-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using standard calcium phosphate reagents. Quantities of plasmids transfected per 6-cm plate were: 100 ng of β-galactosidase-encoding plasmid, 100 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid, and 100–200 ng of transcription factor-encoded expression plasmid (i.e. Foxo1, PPARγ, RXRα cDNAs as indicated in the figure legends to Figs. 3 and 4). 293T cells were transfected and 24 h later the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum.

Luciferase reporter assays were conducted in triplicate and luciferase activity normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity.Fig. 4Foxo1 antagonizes PPARγ. 293T cells were cotransfected as described in the legend to Fig. 3 with the indicated plasmids but with a PPARγ-responsive luciferase reporter in place of the Foxo1-responsive reporter. The DNA amounts transfected were as described in the legend to Fig. 3 (i.e. 100 ng of reporter, 100 ng of β-galactosidase plasmid, 200 ng of PPARγ and/or RXRα, and 100 or 200 ng of Foxo1 as indicated by “+” and “++,” respectively). Transfected cells were exposed to IGF-I (IGF) (20 ng/ml) and rosiglitazone (rosi) (5 μm) as indicated, harvested, and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. Addition of IGF-I alone did not significantly alter PPARγ/RXRα activation of the luciferase reporter (data not shown). Inset, whole cell extracts from 293T cells transfected with equal amounts of the indicated Foxo1 expression plasmids were subjected to immunoblot analysis with HA antibodies to demonstrate equal expression levels. All expressed Foxo1 cDNAs contain HA-epitope tags.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plasmid Constructs—The PPARγ yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid was constructed by subcloning a PPARγ cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 182–505 into pBTM116 in-frame with the encoded LexA DNA binding domain. Foxo1 wild type and Foxo1AAA cDNAs were as described previously (21Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Foxo1AAA/His212 (His212 mutated to Arg) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the Foxo1AAA cDNA using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All Foxo1 cDNAs contained HA-epitope tags and were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) as BamHI fragments. The Foxo1-responsive luciferase reporter was constructed by ligating three copies of the Foxo1 binding site from the IGFBP-1 gene promoter into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3promoter (Promega). The PPARγ-responsive luciferase reporter was constructed by ligating two regions of the 422/aP2 gene promoter into pGL3Basic (Promega). The first 422/aP2 region encompasses an enhancer from –5400 to –4900, which contains the PPARγ binding site (ARE7; Ref. 4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). The second 422/aP2 region encompasses the 5′-proximal promoter elements (–248 to +24) including basal promoter elements. Additional details on plasmid constructions and other plasmids described can be obtained upon request. DNA Binding Assays—The PPARγ/RXRα binding site from the 422/aP2 gene enhancer element (ARE7) was radioactively labeled. PPARγ, RXRα, and Foxo1 proteins were produced in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNT coupled lysate system, Promega). The labeled DNA probe was incubated with 0.2 μl of PPARγ and RXRα programmed lysate in the absence and presence of 5 μm rosiglitazone and allowed to bind for 10 min at room temperature with buffer conditions as described previously (36Dowell P. Flexner C. Kwiterovich P.O. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41325-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 1.0 μl of luciferase-programmed lysate (negative control) or Foxo1-programmed lysate was then added, and after 10 min at room temperature the binding reactions were electrophoresed on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Western Blotting and in Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays— Whole cell and nuclear extracts for immunoblot analyses were prepared as described previously (36Dowell P. Flexner C. Kwiterovich P.O. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41325-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). GST pull-down assays were as described (38Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The GST-Foxo1 fusion protein encoded amino acids 436–652 of Foxo1 (the Foxo1 region identical to that identified during the two-hybrid screen). The GST-DAF-12 fusion protein encoded the entire A1 isoform, and the labeled DAF-16 in pull-down experiments (Fig. 6) was the B isoform. The Foxo1 and HA-tag antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (catalog numbers 07-176 and 07-221, respectively). Identification of Foxo1 as a PPARγ-interacting Protein—A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted to identify PPARγ-interacting proteins. One clone isolated from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte library encoded a C-terminal fragment of the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1. A second clone encoded a C-terminal fragment of RXRα, the heterodimeric partner of PPARγ. As indicated by a quantitative β-galactosidase reporter assay in the yeast two-hybrid system, both Foxo1 and RXRα interacted with PPARγ (Fig. 1A). Rosiglitazone, a synthetic thiazolidinedione and PPARγ ligand, increased the reporter activity when Foxo1 was examined suggesting that rosiglitazone stimulates the interaction between PPARγ and Foxo1 (Fig. 1A). In vitro protein interaction assays were conducted to verify the identification of Foxo1 as a PPARγ-interacting protein. A GST-Foxo1 fusion protein interacted much more efficiently with PPARγ than with other PPAR family members (PPARα and PPARδ) in the absence of any PPAR ligands (Fig. 1B). The ability of rosiglitazone to stimulate the interaction between Foxo1 and PPARγ was not as pronounced in this assay as compared with that in the two-hybrid assay. Foxo1 Is Expressed in the 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte Cell Line and Responds to Insulin—Because the Foxo1 clone was isolated from an adipocyte library, we examined the protein expression level of this transcription factor during adipogenesis, a cellular process that is highly dependent on PPARγ function. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate and whole cell extracts were prepared every 48 h after induction. Foxo1 protein was detectable in uninduced preadipocytes (D0, Fig. 2A). The expression level increased progressively in differentiating cells with a peak around day 4 followed by a slight decrease in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 8 (D8) in Fig. 2A). Foxo1 protein was also detectable in mouse adipose tissue (EWAT, Fig. 2A). PPARγ was highly induced during adipogenesis as expected (Fig. 2A; Refs. 2Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D. Lazar M.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 3Dreyer C. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Laudet V. Krey G. Wahli W. Biol. Cell. 1993; 77: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Thus, Foxo1 and PPARγ are coexpressed during adipogenesis. Several investigators have shown that Foxo family members are excluded from the nucleus in response to insulin or other growth factors (see Introduction). At least one mechanism involves insulin/growth factor-stimulated activation of Akt which in turn phosphorylates Foxo proteins. The amount of Foxo1 protein present in nuclear extracts from insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes was much less than that compared with untreated adipocytes (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin inactivates Foxo1 by preventing accumulation of Foxo1 in the nucleus. This response is consistent with that observed in other cell lines and tissues upon exposure to insulin or other growth factors. PPARγ Antagonizes Foxo1—Transcription factor-driven reporter assays were used to examine the effects of PPARγ on Foxo1 activity and vice versa. 293T cells were chosen to conduct these assays because 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes transfect at a relatively low efficiency and often yield inconsistent results. The Foxo1 binding sequence from the IGFBP-1 gene (25Hall R.K. Yamasaki T. Kucera T. Waltner-Law M. O'Brien R. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30169-30175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) was placed upstream of a minimal promoter and luciferase reporter gene. When cotransfected with a Foxo1 expression vector, this luciferase reporter construct was activated 16-fold (Fig. 3). Cotransfection with increasing amounts of expression vectors encoding PPARγ and RXRα resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Foxo1-driven reporter activation (Fig. 3, ∼50% inhibition at maximal amount of PPARγ and RXRα cotransfected). As expected, treatment with IGF-I inhibited Foxo1-driven luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 3, ∼50% inhibition). Further inhibition was observed when PPARγ and RXRα were cotransfected in combination with IGF-I treatment (Fig. 3, ∼85% inhibition). Surprisingly, rosiglitazone alone inhibited Foxo1 activity slightly (Fig. 3, ∼20% inhibition) perhaps due to low but significant amounts of endogenous PPARγ. Rosiglitazone further augmented the inhibitory effect of PPARγ and RXRα on Foxo1 activity (Fig. 3, ∼80% inhibition). Combined treatment with IGF-I and rosiglitazone attenuated Foxo1 activity (∼65% inhibition) and, in combination with PPARγ and RXRα, reduced Foxo1 activity to near basal levels (Fig. 3, >90% inhibition). Thus, a functional PPARγ complex (e.g. a PPARγ/RXRα heterodimer, see Introduction) repressed Foxo1 activity. Foxo1 Antagonizes PPARγ—The effect of Foxo1 on PPARγ activity was examined in a manner similar to that described above. The PPARγ/RXRα binding site within the 422/aP2 gene (encoding a lipid-binding protein that is highly induced during adipogenesis; Refs. 4Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M.

Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) was placed upstream of a minimal promoter and luciferase reporter gene. As expected, either PPARγ or RXRα alone did not strongly stimulate reporter activity (Fig. 4). However, when cotransfected with both PPARγ and RXRα, the luciferase reporter gene was induced ∼10- and 25-fold in the absence and presence of rosiglitazone, respectively (Fig. 4). Cotransfecting increasing amounts of Foxo1 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of reporter activity both in the presence and absence of rosiglitazone (Fig. 4, ∼50% inhibition at maximal amount of Foxo1 cotransfected). This latter effect of Foxo1 was markedly reduced in the presence of IGF-I (Fig. 4, right group of bars), which is expected to prevent nuclear accumulation of Foxo1 (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

In contrast, IGF-I treatment did not alter the inhibitory effect of a constitutively active Foxo1 (Foxo1AAA). The Foxo1AAA mutant in which the three principal Akt phosphorylation sites have been replaced by alanine is resistant to growth factor-induced phosphorylation and cannot be inactivated by nuclear exclusion (17Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Consistent with this assumption, Foxo1AAA was even more potent than wild type Foxo1 in inhibiting PPARγ/RXRα activity (Fig. 4, ∼70% versus ∼50% inhibition, respectively). To examine whether the antagonistic effect of Foxo1 is dependent on Foxo1 binding to DNA, we examined a Foxo1AAA mutant in which the conserved His212 residue has been replaced by arginine (Foxo1AAA/His212). The His212 → Arg mutation has been shown to markedly impair the DNA binding activity of Foxo1 (40Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and we confirmed these results (data not shown). Therefore, Foxo1AAAA/His212 represents a constitutively nuclear, but DNA binding-defective, transcription factor. Cotransfection of Foxo1AAA/His212 inhibited PPARγ/RXRα-driven reporter activity to roughly the same extent as that of Foxo1AAA (Fig. 4). Thus, Foxo1 antagonizes PPARγ activity without a requirement for DNA binding. All three forms of Foxo1 examined were expressed at similar levels suggesting that the more potent antagonism exhibited by Foxo1AAA and Foxo1AAA/His212 was not due simply to higher expression levels (Fig. 4, inset). Foxo1 Inhibits PPARγ DNA Binding Activity—The effect of Foxo1 on PPARγ DNA binding activity was examined as a potential mechanism for the observed antagonism of PPARγ activity by Foxo1. PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers readily form a detectable protein-DNA complex when incubated with a known PPARγ response element and the presence of ligand stimulates DNA binding activity (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and 3) when receptor concentrations are low as described for PPARα (see Ref"

Recent genetic data have revealed that MURR1, a single copy gene on dog chromosome 10q26, is mutated in this disorder. This gene encodes a 190-amino acid open reading frame of unknown function that is highly conserved in vertebrate species. The Wilson disease protein is a copper transporting ATPase shown to play a critical role in biliary copper excretion. Here we demonstrate that the Wilson disease protein directly interacts with the human homologue of Murr1 in vitro and in vivo and that this interaction is mediated via the copper binding, amino terminus of this ATPase. Importantly, this interaction is specific for this copper transporter, a finding consistent with the observation that impaired copper homeostasis in affected terriers is confined to the liver. Our findings reveal involvement of Murr1 in the defined pathway of hepatic biliary copper excretion, suggest a potential mechanism for Murr1 function in this process, and provide biochemical evidence in support of the proposed role of the MURR1 gene in hepatic copper toxicosis.

Copper is an essential micronutrient that functions as an enzymatic cofactor in diverse metabolic pathways of all aerobic organisms (1Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the liver plays a critical role in copper homeostasis as both the storage site for this metal and the physiologic route for excretion through the biliary system (2Loudianos G. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the liver, hepatocytes are responsible for the uptake and storage of copper, as well as the regulation of excretion of this metal into the bile. The molecular mechanisms determining biliary copper excretion have become clearer following identification of the genetic defect in Wilson disease, an inherited disorder resulting in hepatic copper accumulation. The Wilson disease gene encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase localized to the trans-Golgi network of hepatocytes and required for biliary copper excretion (3Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). With an increase in the hepatocyte cytosolic copper concentration, this protein traffics to a vesicular compartment near the canalicular membrane where copper is accumulated for subsequent excretion into the bile (4Hung I.H.

The precise mechanisms involved in subsequent copper movement across the canalicular membrane are unknown. Although Wilson disease is the most common disorder resulting in hepatic copper overload, a distinct form of rapidly progressive cirrhosis associated with a marked increase in hepatic copper content has been described in young infants (8Muller T. van de Sluis B. Muller W. Pearson P. Wijmenga C. Eur. J. Med. Res. 1999; 4: 293-297PubMed Google Scholar). A similar form of copper-associated cirrhosis is also observed as an autosomal recessive disorder in inbred Bedlington terriers, and studies in these animals reveal a severe impairment in biliary copper excretion (9Hultgren B.D. Stevens J.B. Hardy R.M. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1986; 47: 365-377PubMed Google Scholar). Recent molecular genetic analysis in these dogs has revealed an in-frame deletion in MURR1, a gene highly conserved in the vertebrate genome and containing an open reading frame of 190 amino acids with no known protein motifs or homologies (10van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that human Murr1 directly interacts with the Wilson disease protein, providing biochemical evidence in support of the proposed role of the MURR1 gene in hepatic copper toxicosis. Cloning and Protein Expression—The coding region of Murr1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human liver cDNA using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sequence of the open reading frame of human Murr1 (9Hultgren B.D.

An HA epitope was inserted at the carboxyl terminus of human ceruloplasmin (11Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

For experiments utilizing glutathione S-transferase (GST) this fragment, absent in the HA epitope, was ligated into pGEX-1 (Amersham Bioscieces). pET-32a vector (Novagen) containing amino acids 1–650 corresponding to the copper-binding amino terminus of the human Wilson disease protein as well as recombinant protein produced from this vector were from Amy Rosenzweig.

Following binding, the beads were extensively washed in PBS, and protein complexes were released by the addition of sample buffer with dithiothreitol (DTT) and heating at 100 °C for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antisera as described previously (13Hamza I.

In vitro translation was performed using a reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine.

Cells were transfected with pCDNA3.1 containing Murr1, ceruloplasmin, or VDU1 utilizing LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 25,000 × g at 4 °C (14Casareno R.L.

Lysates were precleared overnight with normal rabbit serum and protein A beads (Repligen) followed by immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antisera to HA (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), human Wilson disease protein, or Menkes disease protein (15Yamaguchi Y.

The coimmunoprecipitated complex was released by addition of sample buffer with DTT followed by heating to 100 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antisera as described previously (4Hung I.H.

To generate Murr1-specific antisera, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 162–181 of human Murr1 was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into rabbits (Covance). The Wilson disease P-type ATPase transports copper into the secretory pathway of hepatocytes for subsequent excretion of this metal into bile (2Loudianos G. Gitlin J.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As an inherited deletion in the MURR1 gene results in impaired biliary copper excretion and hepatic copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, we sought to determine whether Murr1 interacts with the Wilson disease protein. Pull-down assays were performed utilizing GST-Murr1, GST-CCS, and GST-Atox1 immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and mixed with lysates from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the human Wilson disease cDNA. The inclusion of the copper chaperones CCS and Atox1 served as useful controls as we have previously reported specific interaction of the Wilson disease protein with Atox1 but not CCS using these same methods (13Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Following incubation, eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antisera specific for the human Wilson disease protein. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, the Wilson disease protein was readily detected following incubation of GST-Murr1 with this COS cell lysate. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by detection of the Wilson disease protein following incubation with GST-Atox1 (Fig. 1A, lane 4) but not with GST or GST-CCS (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). To determine whether a similar interaction occurs in cells endogenously expressing the Wilson disease protein, these pull-down assays were repeated using HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line known to express the Wilson disease protein (4Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). As observed with transfected COS cell lysates (Fig. 1B, lane 4), interaction of HepG2 lysate with GST-Murr1 resulted in readily detectable Wilson disease protein following analysis of the eluates by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, lane 6). This interaction between Murr1 and the Wilson disease protein was not dependent upon proteins specific to these cell lysates, as a similar interaction was detected when the pull-down assay was repeated using in vitro translated Wilson disease protein (Fig. 1C, lane 4). The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by confirming the interaction between Atox1 and the Wilson disease protein (Fig. 1C, lane 2) (13Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and CCS and SOD1 (Fig. 1C, lane 7) (14Casareno R.L. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) under these same conditions. To examine this interaction between Murr1 and the Wilson disease protein in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation of transfected COS-7 cells utilizing a polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for an HA epitope. Following immunoprecipitation and washing under gentle conditions, immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the presence of Wilson disease protein confirmed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation of Murr1 from lysates of cotransfected COS cells revealed abundant Wilson disease protein (Fig. 2A, lane 6). This was specific and not the result of the lysis or washing conditions as immunoprecipitation of HA-VDU1 or ceruloplasmin failed to result in detectable Wilson disease protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4) even though immunoblotting with antisera to HA (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–12) or the Wilson disease protein (data not shown) reveals equivalent expression of these proteins in the cell lysates. The specificity of this interaction was next examined by repeating these studies in COS cells transfected with the Menkes disease P-type ATPase. This ATPase is highly homologous in structure and function to the Wilson disease protein and functions to deliver copper into the secretory pathway of cells in the gastrointestinal tract, placenta, and blood-brain barrier (3Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the Menkes disease protein was readily detected in transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2B, lane 6), none was detected following immunoprecipitation of Murr1 (Fig. 2B, lane 3) despite abundant coimmunoprecipitation of the Wilson disease protein (Fig. 2D, lane 2) under these same conditions. In all cases, equivalent expression of Murr1 was observed in each of the transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–3). The faint signal detecting Menkes disease protein with the Wilson antisera (Fig. 2D, lane 6) is due to cross-reactivity from overexpression of the Menkes disease protein. The failure to detect interaction between Murr1 and the Menkes disease protein in these experiments supports the concept of a specific functional interaction between Murr1 and the Wilson protein in hepatocytes and is consistent with the liver-specific phenotype of impaired copper homeostasis observed in affected Bedlington terriers (9Hultgren B.D. Stevens J.B. Hardy R.M. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1986; 47: 365-377PubMed Google Scholar, 10van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of the Wilson disease protein is predicted to reside in the cytoplasm and contains several motifs that may play a role in the copper-dependent endocytic trafficking of this protein critical to the process of biliary copper excretion (3Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Voskoboinik I. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 60: 123-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As the homologous cytoplasmic tail in the Menkes disease protein has been shown to be required for the trafficking of this protein (17Petris M.J. Camakaris J. Greenough M. LaFontaine S. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 18Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we next sought to determine whether Murr1 interacts with this region of the Wilson disease protein. Full-length Wilson disease protein or a construct with a deletion of the entire cytoplasmic tail were co-transfected into COS cells with Murr1 followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as above. As can be seen in Fig. 2E, equivalent interaction was detected between Murr1 and both of these constructs (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 3) indicating that the cytoplasmic tail of the Wilson protein is not required for interaction with Murr1. Immunoblotting with antisera to HA (Fig. 2E, lanes 4–6) revealed equivalent expression of Murr1 in these cell lysates. Previous studies (13Hamza I. Schaefer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl.

As immunofluorescence studies indicate that Murr1 is localized to the cytoplasm (10van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this protein also interacts with Atox1. Pull-down assays were performed utilizing in vitro translated Murr1 and Wilson disease protein. Under these conditions, no interaction was detected between Murr1 and Atox1 (Fig. 3A, lane 3) despite readily detectable Wilson disease protein in eluates from the GST-Atox1 beads (Fig. 3A, lane 4). These in vitro translation reactions again revealed the interaction between Murr1 and the Wilson disease protein observed in previous experiments, and therefore, this method was next utilized to further define the region of the Wilson disease protein specifically interacting with Murr1. As noted previously, full-length in vitro translated Wilson disease protein interacts with Murr1 in this pull-down assay (Fig. 3B, lane 2), and the specificity of this interaction was confirmed by detection of Wilson disease protein following incubation with GST-Atox1 (Fig. 3B, lane 4) but not GST or GST-CCS (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 3). When this assay was repeated utilizing in vitro translated Wilson disease protein truncated to delete one (WDΔ1373) or both (WDΔ1010) of the largest cytoplasmic regions containing the ATP-binding domain, the critical aspartate phosphorylation site and the ATPase motif (3Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Voskoboinik I. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 60: 123-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), interaction with Murr1 was still detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 12). As previously, the specificity of this interaction was confirmed by detection of the truncated Wilson disease proteins retaining the amino-terminal domain following incubation with GST-Atox1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 14) but not with GST or GST-CCS (Fig. 3B, lanes 6, 8, 11, and 13). The carboxyl-terminal deletion studies (Figs. 2E and 3B) suggest that Murr1 may interact with the amino terminus of the Wilson disease protein. To directly examine this possibility, pull-down assays were repeated utilizing a recombinant protein containing all six of the copper-binding motifs in the amino terminus of the human Wilson disease protein. Analysis of the eluates by immunoblotting clearly demonstrated interaction with GST-Murr1 (Fig. 4A, lane 2). As anticipated this recombinant protein was also readily detected in eluates from beads containing GST-Atox1 (Fig. 4A, lane 4) but not GST or GST-CCS (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). As was observed previously (Fig. 1, A and C, and Fig. 3), more Wilson Disease protein associates with Atox1 than Murr1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4). This most likely represents greater avidity for Atox1 as the amount of Wilson Disease protein recovered is largely unaffected by increasing the quantity of GST-Murr1 (data not shown). To examine this interaction with endogenous Murr1, an antisera to human Murr1 was utilized to detect this protein in cell lysates. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, Murr1 was detected as a single species of 23 kDa present in each of the cell types examined. Analysis of COS cells transfected with HA-tagged Murr1 revealed a second, larger species corresponding to the epitope-tagged transfected protein (Fig. 4B, lane 4). When lysates from HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B, lane 5) were utilized in a pull-down assay with a His fusion protein containing the amino-terminal domain of the human Wilson disease protein, endogenous Murr1 was detected (Fig. 4B, lane 7), confirming the interaction between Murr1 and the Wilson disease protein amino terminus seen above. This interaction was specific as no Murr1 was detected in eluates from beads containing the vector alone or His-CCS (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 8). Inherited loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the human Wilson disease ATPase reveal a critical role for this protein in hepatic copper metabolism (24Tao T.Y. Gitlin J.D. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Wilson disease protein is localized to the trans-Golgi network of hepatocytes and with increasing intracellular copper concentrations traffics to a cytoplasmic vesicular compartment that distributes near the cannalicular membrane (5Schaefer M. Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G639-G646PubMed Google Scholar, 6Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F. Vonk R.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 782-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). While the dynamic processes involved in this localization of the Wilson disease protein as well as the biogenesis and trafficking of these vesicles at the cannalicular membrane are not well understood, the data in this current study place Murr1 directly in this known biochemical pathway for biliary copper transport. Recent studies on the molecular mechanisms of the biogenesis and trafficking of lysosome-related organelles have identified ubiquitously expressed, cytosolic proteins with no recognizable homologues in lower eukaryotes, which are essential for the cell-specific formation of melanosomes and platelet dense granules (25Starcevic M. Nazarian R. Dell'Angelica E.C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As Murr1 has similar biochemical properties (10van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to hypothesize that this protein may function in an analogous fashion to facilitate biliary copper excretion within hepatocytes. In support of such a mechanism, preliminary data indicate that Murr1 may form oligomeric heterocomplexes with other cellular proteins in addition to the Wilson disease protein. 2T. Y. Tao and J. D. Gitlin, unpublished observations. Taken together, the biochemical findings in this current study indicate a direct role for Murr1 in human biliary copper excretion, consistent with the metabolic observations in Bedlington terrier copper toxicosis as well as the recent genetic analysis revealing a deletion in the MURR1 gene in affected animals (9Hultgren B.D. Stevens J.B. Hardy R.M. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1986; 47: 365-377PubMed Google Scholar, 10van De Sluis B. Rothuizen J. Pearson P.L. van Oost B.A. Wijmenga C. Hum. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2094709506,"Oxygen activation occurs at a wide variety of enzyme active sites. Mechanisms previously proposed for the copper monooxygenase, dopamine beta-monooxygenase (DbetaM), involve the accumulation of an activated oxygen intermediate with the properties of a copper-peroxo or copper-oxo species before substrate activation. These are reminiscent of the mechanism of cytochrome P-450, where a heme iron stabilizes the activated O2 species. Herein, we report two experimental probes of the activated oxygen species in DbetaM. First, we have synthesized the substrate analog, beta,beta-difluorophenethylamine, and examined its capacity to induce reoxidation of the prereduced copper sites of DbetaM upon mixing with O2 under rapid freeze-quench conditions. This experiment fails to give rise to an EPR-detectable copper species, in contrast to a substrate with a C-H active bond. This indicates either that the reoxidation of the enzyme-bound copper sites in the presence of O2 is tightly linked to C-H activation or that a diamagnetic species Cu(II)-O2* has been formed. In the context of the open and fully solvent-accessible active site for the homologous peptidylglycine-alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase and by analogy to cytochrome P-450, the accumulation of a reduced and activated oxygen species in DbetaM before C-H cleavage would be expected to give some uncoupling of oxygen and substrate consumption. We have, therefore, examined the degree to which O2 and substrate consumption are coupled in DbetaM using both end point and initial rate experimental protocols. With substrates that differ by more than three orders of magnitude in rate, we fail to detect any uncoupling of O2 uptake from product formation. We conclude that there is no accumulation of an activated form of O2 before C-H abstraction in the DbetaM and peptidylglycine-alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase class of copper monooxygenases, presenting a mechanism in which a diamagnetic Cu(II)-superoxo complex, formed initially at very low levels, abstracts a hydrogen atom from substrate to generate Cu(II)-hydroperoxo and substrate-free radical as intermediates. Subsequent participation of the second copper site per subunit completes the reaction cycle, generating hydroxylated product and water."
https://openalex.org/W2016848332,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins constitute one of the widest families in all organisms, whose P-glycoprotein involved in resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy is an archetype member. Although three-dimensional structures of several nucleotide-binding domains of ABC proteins are now available, the catalytic mechanism triggering the functioning of these proteins still remains elusive. In particular, it has been postulated that ATP hydrolysis proceeds via an acid-base mechanism catalyzed by the Glu residue adjacent to the Walker-B motif (Geourjon, C., Orelle, C., Steinfels, E., Blanchet, C., Deléage, G., Di Pietro, A., and Jault, J.

H., and Ambudkar, S. V. (2002) Biochemistry, 41, 13989–14000). The equivalent glutamate residue (Glu504) of a half-ABC transporter involved in multidrug resistance in Bacillus subtilis, BmrA (formerly known as YvcC), was therefore mutated to Asp, Ala, Gln, Ser, and Cys residues. All these mutants were fully devoid of ATPase activity, yet they showed a high level of vanadate-independent trapping of 8-N3-α-32P-labeled nucleotide(s), following preincubation with 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP. However, and in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the use of 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP unequivocally showed that all the mutants trapped exclusively the triphosphate form of the analogue, suggesting that they were not able to perform even a single hydrolytic turnover. These results demonstrate that Glu504 is the catalytic base for ATP hydrolysis in BmrA, and it is proposed that equivalent glutamate residues in other ABC transporters play the same role.

Bouige P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These membrane proteins act as mechanical pumps that couple ATP hydrolysis to either the uptake or export of a wide diversity of substrates across biological membranes including ions, sugars, lipids, peptides, or complex organic molecules (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of such transporters represents a considerable challenge in the medical field. Indeed, ABC transporters can be responsible for antibiotic and antifungal resistances in micro-organisms (3Van Bambeke F. Balzi E. Tulkens P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and dysfunctions of many eukaryotic members are the molecular basis for severe sicknesses, such as cystic fibrosis or adrenoleukodystrophy (4Gottesman M.M.

The minimal architecture for an ABC transporter is four core domains that may be expressed as separate subunits, up to four, or can be fused together as a single multidomain polypeptide (2Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar); two hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains confer substrate specificity and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) provide, by hydrolyzing ATP, the chemical energy required to energize the transporter. The NBDs contains three functional signatures: two ATP-binding signatures known as the Walker-A and -B motifs and found in many ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes (7Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar), and the S signature of the family, a stretch of ∼12 residues usually starting with LSGGQ sequence (8Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). As inferred previously (9Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), several pieces of evidence now suggest that the S signature in one NBD physically contributes to the nucleotide-binding site of the opposite NBD (10Hopfner K.P.

In addition, and because they possessed the three characteristic sequence motifs, some proteins otherwise mostly involved in modification of nucleic acid are akin to the ABC transporters. Accordingly, these “non-transporters” ABC proteins have an ATP-binding fold related to that found in ABC transporters (10Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

This proposal was substantiated by the high resolution three-dimensinal structures of HisP and MJ0796 showing that this Glu residue seemed to be ideally positioned to activate a putative “attacking” water molecule (11Smith P.C.

Nevertheless, site-directed mutants of this residue in P-glycoprotein argued against its role as being directly catalytic, and it was proposed instead to be mainly involved in ADP release (19Urbatsch I.L.

This proposal was based on the ability of the Glu-to-Gln mutant(s) to trap a high amount of 8-N3-AD(T)P in a vanadate-insensitive manner. Vanadate trapping experiments have indeed proved to be an invaluable tool to pinpoint some of the steps in the catalytic mechanism of ATPase activity of many ABC transporters, especially since they should allow to detect even a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis (for reviews, see Refs. 21Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K.

Taking advantage of the high ATPase activity of BmrA (Bacillus multidrug resistance ATP; previously called YvcC) that we have recently characterized as being a half ABC transporter from Bacillus subtilis homologous to both LmrA (24van Veen H.W.

Jault, submitted for publication. we have re-investigated the role of this residue during ATP hydrolysis. Several site-directed mutants of the equivalent Glu residue in BmrA (E504) were constructed, and their propensity to trap 8-N3-AD(T)P was studied. Clearly, the results indicate that each mutant was able to trap a high amount of 8-N3-nucleotide, but the nucleotide species trapped was exclusively the ATP form. Therefore, Glu504 in BmrA is the catalytic base residue and is absolutely required, at least in this half-ABC transporter, to permit ATP hydrolysis, and it is proposed that equivalent glutamate residues in other ABC transporters play the same role. Site-directed Mutagenesis of BmrA—pET23b(+)/yvcC constructed as described previously (25Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). To screen for positive clones, oligonucleotides were designed to introduce simultaneously a new AatII restriction site, without modifying the protein sequence, and the desired mutation: E504A, GTCGAGACTTGACGTCGCTGCATCGAGCATAAG; E504Q, GTCGAGACTTGACGTCGCTTGATCGAGCATAAGA; E504C, GTCGAGACTTGACGTCGCACAATCGAG CATAAGA; E504D, GTCGAGACTTGACGTCGCATCATCGAGCATAAG; and E504S, GTCGAGACTTGACGTCGCTGAATCGAGCATAAGAA. All the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of BmrA—BmrA-enriched membranes were prepared as described previously (25Steinfels E. Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations in membranes were estimated by a Lowry protein assay (Pierce), after proteins precipitation by trichloroacetic acid. Typically, protein concentrations in membranes were between 30 and 70 mg/ml. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Membranes, diluted at 1.5 mg/ml proteins, were solubilized during 1 h under gentle stirring in 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 8, 15% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm leupeptine, 5 μm pepstatine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Ultracentrifugation was then performed (280,000 g, 1 h), and supernatant was incubated 45 min in the presence of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The slurry was put into a column and was washed overnight with 100 ml of buffer (50 mm potassium Pi, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were eluted by 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 200 mm imidazole, 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The eluate was dialyzed twice against 500 ml of buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and aliquotes were kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. Protein concentrations were estimated by using a “Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent” from Pierce. Protein Reconstitution—80 μl of Escherichia coli phospholipids total extract (Avanti Polar lipids) at 25 mg/ml (water) were incubated under stirring at room temperature with 20 μl of 10% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. After 1 h, 100 μg of protein were added in a final volume of 500 μl (50 mm Hepes, pH 8). After 45-min incubation, three successive additions, of 40 mg Bio-Beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) each, were performed every hour, and the proteoliposomes thus formed were kept at 4 °C. ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was measured by Pi release. Briefly, proteoliposomes were incubated 25 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm Mg2+, and a regenerating ATP system (4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 60 μg/ml pyruvate kinase) in a final volume of 50 μl. The reactions were stopped by addition of 1 ml of 20 mm H2SO4, and samples were immediately transferred on ice. The Pi released was then measured by a colorimetric method as described previously (27Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Vanadate-induced Trapping and Photoaffinity Labeling with 8-Azido-α- or 8-Azido-γ-32P-Labeled Nucleotides—Proteoliposomes containing either wild-type or mutant BmrA (2–3 μg of protein) were incubated with 8-azido-[α- (or γ-)32P]ATP (0.25–0.35 Ci/mmol) (see figure legends for Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 for details), in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 3 mm MgCl2, with or without 250 μm vanadate, and with or without 6 mm EDTA, in a total volume of 50 μl at the temperature and time indicated. Orthovanadate Na3VO4 was prepared as described previously (28Goodno C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85B: 116-123Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Incubations were started by addition of 8-azido-radioactive nucleotides and stopped by transferring on ice. Free and loosely bound labeled nucleotides were removed by centrifugation at 400,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes were then gently washed with 100 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of the same buffer, kept on ice, and irradiated with UV light for 5 min (260 nm, UVS-II Minerallight placed directly above the samples). Laemmli buffer was then added to the samples and, after 20-min mixing, samples were submitted to electrophoresis (12% SDS-PAGE). Gels were dried and submitted to autoradiography.Fig. 4Effect of temperature and vanadate on 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP trapping by wild-type BmrA.

Orelle C. Dalmas O. Penin F. Miroux B. Di Pietro A. Jault J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane vesicles (200 μg of wild-type or mutant proteins) were added into a 3-ml cuvette containing 2 ml of 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 8.5 mm NaCl, 40 μg pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) and 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate.

ATP was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the fluorescence intensity was monitored for several minutes. A Highly Conserved Glutamate Residue, Next to the Walker-B Motif, Is Crucial for Steady-state ATPase Activity in BmrA— The Glu residue immediately following the Asp residue of the Walker-B motif is highly conserved in many ABC transporters (Fig. 1A), but is sometimes replaced by Asp, Ser, or Asn in one of the two NBDs of some full-length ABC transporters, including for instance MRP1, CFTR, or PDR5, or in one of the two subunits constituting a heterodimer such as TAP1 in TAP1·TAP2 complex. Interestingly, substitution of the Glu residue seemed to occur invariably in NBD1 of these transporters. By contrast, a Glu residue is strictly conserved in ABC transporters with two identical NBDs, such as the bacterial importers HisP and MalK, or half-transporters likely to form homodimers such as BmrA and PMP70. In three-dimensional structures of NBDs solved at high resolution, namely HisP and MJ0796 (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively), this residue pointed toward a water molecule that seemed to be ideally positioned to act as the “attacking” water molecule responsible for the hydrolysis of the β-γ phosphodiester bond of ATP. However, previous reports using site-directed mutants of P-glycoprotein had suggested that this residue was rather involved in the release of ADP subsequent to ATP hydrolysis (19Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Sauna Z.E. Muller M. Peng X.H. Ambudkar S.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this glutamate residue in BmrA, it was replaced either by Asp, Gln, Cys, Ser, or Ala by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant proteins were purified according to the same procedure used for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2) and were recovered with a similar yield of purification (∼2 mg/liter). The purified mutants were then analyzed for their capacity to hydrolyze ATP. Whatever the substitution introduced, none of the mutants showed any detectable level of ATPase activity, and accordingly, mutations of this Glu residue also prevented Hoechst transport activity normally displayed by wild-type BmrA (Table I).Table IATPase and Hoechst 33342 transport activities of wild-type and Glu504 mutant enzymes of BmrA +++ indicates that a high transport rate was measured, and — indicates that no detectable transport activity was observed.

At 5 μm 8-N3-ATP, both E504D and E504C mutants were capable to bind this analogue, since they were photolabeled at least as well efficiently as the wild-type enzyme, whereas the E504S was somewhat less efficiently photolabeled (Fig. 3A). The two other mutants, namely E504Q and especially E504A, might have an impaired ability to bind the ATP analogue, as further confirmed by increasing its concentration up to 40 μm (Fig. 3B). However, one cannot exclude that the mutations might directly alter the efficiency of photolabeling of the bound analogue by slightly modifying either the positioning of the bound 8-N3-ATP, or the conformation of the protein in the ATP-binding site, or both (see “Discussion” in Ref. 29Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all the mutant enzymes showed a Mg2+ dependence for 8-N3-ATP binding, as observed for the wild-type BmrA. Such a Mg2+ dependence for 8-N3-ATP binding has also been observed previously with P-glycoprotein (30Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Next, trapping experiment using 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP was studied with the wild-type enzyme to delineate experimental conditions allowing detection of a high level of vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping, thus reflecting a trapping in a catalytic step subsequent to ATP hydrolysis. First, it is worthy to note that 8-N3-ATP is a fairly good substrate of BmrA as it was hydrolyzed at a rate of ∼1.2 μmol/min/mg of protein, in comparison with ∼6.5 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein (see Table I). As shown in Fig. 4, nucleotide trapping was observed at 37 °C with wild-type BmrA, only in the presence of both Mg2+ and vanadate, and it was highly reduced at 2 °C. Hence, these results suggested that the vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping seen with wild-type BmrA requires hydrolysis of 8-N3-ATP into 8-N3-ADP. Then, these optimized conditions were used to monitor the nucleotide trapping for each mutant. At 37 °C, all of them showed a level of trapping highly increased as compared with that of the wild-type (Fig. 5A). By contrast to the wild-type enzyme, however, nucleotide trapping in the mutants was unaffected by the presence of vanadate. When the trapping with mutant enzymes was performed on ice (Fig. 5B), it was greatly reduced for each of them, as also observed for the wild-type enzyme. In agreement with the binding experiment described previously (see Fig. 3), the trapping was even lower for some mutants, especially for the E504A, as compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. Nevertheless, trapping with all the mutants still occurred in a vanadate-independent manner at this low temperature. Each Glu504 Mutant Trapped the Triphosphate Form of the 8-N3-ATP Analogue, whereas the Wild-type Enzyme Trapped Only the Diphosphate Form—To ascertain the nature of the nucleotide trapped in the nucleotide-binding site of wild-type and mutant enzymes, a comparison of trapping was done in the presence of either 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP or 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP. First, the E504D mutant was chosen among all mutants for this experiment, since it is the most closely related to the wild-type enzyme on a chemical point of view. This mutant showed a similar level of trapping whether the radioactivity was brought by the γ- or the α-phosphate of the ATP analogue, and this trapping occurred independently of the presence of vanadate (Fig. 6A). This result was in sharp contrast to that obtained with the wild-type enzyme where only 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP enabled a detectable level of trapping. As a control and when 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP was used, no radioactivity was incorporated in either the wild-type or the E504D enzymes if the photo-irradiation step was omitted, ruling out the possibility that the incorporation of radioactivity seen in the mutant enzyme was due to a phosphorylation by a contaminating protein kinase. An experiment was also performed by using a higher 8-N3-ATP concentration (i.e. 50 μm instead of 5 μm), a longer time of incubation (i.e. 20 min), and without a chase by cold ATP, to improve the level of detection and to check if any 8-N3-ATP hydrolysis occurred during the time course of the experiment. Here, a similar level of labeling was seen in the wild-type and E504D enzymes when 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP was used, but 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP allowed to label as efficiently the E504D mutant as 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP, whereas it only labeled marginally the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6B). These results were confirmed by direct quantification of the radioactivity (Fig. 6C), and given that the same ratio of labeling was seen in the E504D mutant by using either 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP or 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP, this strongly suggests that this mutant was totally unable to hydrolyze 8-N3-ATP. Trapping experiments performed with the other mutants revealed that they all displayed a behavior similar to the E504D mutant, i.e. a level of trapping as high with 8-N3[γ-32P]ATP as with 8-N3-[α-32P]ATP, each labeling being vanadate-insensitive (Fig. 7). Therefore, and in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, mutant enzymes did not require 8-N3-ATP hydrolysis to bind tightly the nucleotide analogue, in a very stable conformation that prevented any subsequent exchange of 8-N3-ATP with cold ATP. The catalytic steps underlying the molecular mechanism of ABC transporters have been the focus of many studies, but, despi"

Phenolic compounds constitute one of the largest groups of natural products. They are predominantly found in plants, where they occur in a great variety of structures and functions. During the last century, the natural pool of phenolic compounds has been increased with products of industrial origin. Many of these synthetic compounds cause environmental pollution and human health problems as a result of their persistence, toxicity, and transformation into hazardous intermediates (1Timmis K.N.

Almost invariably, phenols are first converted into more reactive dihydroxylated intermediates and then subjected to intraor extradiol ring cleavage by molecular oxygen. The initial hydroxylation of the phenolic ring usually is catalyzed by single-component NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein monooxygenases (4Moonen M.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Rietjens I.M.C.M.

The reduced forms of these enzymes react with molecular oxygen to yield a transiently stable flavin C4a-hydroperoxide species that is involved in substrate oxygenation.

Structure. 1998; 6: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), it was shown that the oxygenation reaction takes place in the inner part of the protein and that this aprotic environment is crucial for preventing uncoupling of flavin reduction from substrate hydroxylation. With 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida, the binding of a second protein component prevents the uncoupling of substrate hydroxylation (16Arunachalam U. Massey V.

This enzyme is an unusual example of a two-component flavoprotein hydroxylase in which flavin reduction and substrate oxygenation take place in the same protein. Relatively little is known about the mineralization of phenolic compounds by thermophilic microorganisms (19Kim I.C. Oriel P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several Bacillus species isolated from geographically distinct thermal sources degrade phenol at 65 °C via the meta-cleavage pathway (Fig. 1) (20Mutzel A. Reinscheid U.M. Antranikian G. Müller R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 593-596Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Reinscheid U.M. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Biodegradation. 1996; 7: 455-461Crossref Google Scholar, 22Duffner F.M. Reinscheid U.M. Bauer M.P. Mutzel A. Müller R. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 20: 602-611Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The initial conversion of phenol to catechol in these microorganisms requires two protein components that are encoded by the pheA1 and pheA2 genes (23Duffner F.M. Müller R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 37-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the Bacillus phenol hydroxylase system appeared to be severely hampered by the low yield and instability of the purified enzymes. This prompted us to clone the Bacillus pheA genes in an Escherichia coli expression system (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the overexpression, purification, and characterization of the recombinant phenol hydroxylase of Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7. We show that this two-protein enzyme belongs to a newly recognized family of flavin-dependent monooxygenases that carry out the reductive and oxidative half-reactions on separate polypeptide chains. Members of this family are involved in various biological processes, including the biosynthesis of antibiotics (25Kendrew S.G. Harding S.E. Hopwood D.A. Marsh E.N. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other family members, the reductase component of phenol hydroxylase from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 harbors a tightly bound FAD. Evidence is provided that the FAD cofactor is directly involved in the reduction of free flavins. Chemicals, Bacterial Strains, and Plasmids—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and plasmid pET3a were used for expression of the pheA genes (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was purchased from Invitrogen. Phenyl-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, HiLoad Q-Sepharose, Superdex 200 pg, Superdex 200 HR10/30, Superdex 75 HR10/30, and PhastGel precast isoelectric focusing gels were from Amersham Biosciences. Macro-prep ceramic hydroxylapatite (type I, particle size of 20 μm) was obtained from Bio-Rad. FAD, FMN, riboflavin, and 3-acetylpyridine-adenine dinucleotide (AcPyAD+) 1The abbreviations used are: AcPyAD+3-acetylpyridine-adenine dinucleotideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyFeRferric reductase. were purchased from Sigma. NADH, NADPH, NAD+, and glucose oxidase (grade II) were from Roche Applied Science. Phenolic compounds were obtained from Aldrich. All other chemicals were from Merck and were of the purest grade available. 3-acetylpyridine-adenine dinucleotide high performance liquid chromatography N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine fast protein liquid chromatography ferric reductase. Enzyme Purification—All purification steps were carried out at room temperature. PheA1 and PheA2 were purified from transformed E. coli cells harboring the pheA1 and pheA2 genes (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), respectively. Recombinant cells were grown for 16 h in medium containing 10 g/liter Tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast, and 5 g/liter NaCl (pH 7.4) at 30 °C, followed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Purification of PheA1 (Oxygenase Component)—Washed recombinant E. coli cells (15 g) were suspended in 15 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg of DNase and passed two times through a precooled French press operating at 10,000 p.s.i. Following centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g to remove cellular debris, the supernatant was made 0.5% in protamine sulfate from a 2% stock solution. The protamine sulfate aggregates were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA (starting buffer). After washing with starting buffer, the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.6 m NaCl in 100 ml of starting buffer. The PheA1 protein eluting between 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM-30 membrane) and dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The PheA1 protein was then loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column (1.6 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). After washing, PheA1 was eluted with a linear gradient of 5–500 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) in 100 ml of water. Pooled fractions (80–200 mm) were concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at 5 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at –70 °C. Purification of PheA2 (Reductase Component)—The preparation of cell extract from recombinant E. coli cells, the protamine sulfate precipitation, and the ion exchange chromatography step were carried out under the same conditions as described above. HiLoad Q-Sepharose fractions containing FAD reductase activity (eluting between 0.1 and 0.5 m NaCl) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM-30 membrane). After the addition of pulverized ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 1.4 m, the protein solution was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1.4 m ammonium sulfate. After washing with starting buffer, bound protein was eluted with a linear descending gradient of ammonium sulfate (1.4 to 0.4 m) in 200 ml of starting buffer. Fractions containing reductase activity (0.4–1.0 m) were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and loaded onto a Superdex 200 preparative gel filtration column (2.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. Pure reductase fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at –70 °C. Activity Determinations—NADH:flavin reductase activity was determined at 25 or 53 °C in 25 mm potassium phosphate and 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0). To determine the specificity of the reaction, FMN, riboflavin, and NADPH were tested as substrates. NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by recording the NADH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm (ϵ550 = 21.1 mm–1 cm–1). The assay mixture contained 0.2 mm cytochrome c and 0.2 mm NADH in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). NADH oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 °C by monitoring the decrease in absorption of NADH at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1). The assay mixture contained 0.2 mm NADH in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The NADH-dependent reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol was measured at 25 °C by following the decrease in absorption of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 600 nm (ϵ600 = 21.0 mm–1 cm–1, pH 7.0). The assay mixture contained 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm KCl, 200 μm NADH, and varying concentrations of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The NADH-dependent reduction of AcPyAD+ (transhydrogenase activity) was measured at 25 °C by following the increase in absorption of reduced AcPyAD+ at 363 nm (ϵ363 = 5.6 mm–1 cm–1). The assay mixture contained 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm KCl, 200 μm NADH, and varying concentrations of AcPyAD+. Kinetic Analysis—NADH:flavin reductase activity was determined at 25, 40, and 53 °C in 25 mm potassium phosphate and 150 mm KCl (pH 7.0). For estimation of kinetic parameters, the NADH concentration was varied at a fixed flavin concentration and vice versa. Kinetic parameters were determined from saturation curves, fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation, using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. For estimation of the type of mechanism, the NADH:flavin reductase activity was determined as a function of FAD concentration at several constant levels of NADH and as a function of NADH at several constant levels of FAD. Reciprocal initial velocities were plotted against reciprocal substrate concentrations and fitted with a straight line determined by a linear regression program. Inhibition constants for NAD+ inhibition were determined according to Fromm (32Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Other Assays—Phenol monooxygenase activity was determined by measuring phenol consumption colorimetrically (33Gurujeyalakshmi G. Oriel P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 500-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (6 ml) contained 0.1 mm phenol, 0.5 mm NADH, 10 μm FAD, and 1.0 nm PheA2 in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). After equilibration at 50 °C and the addition of the desired amount of PheA1 (10–200 nm), samples of 1 ml were taken for 10 min at 1-min intervals. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 12 μl of 2% 4-aminoantipyrine followed by 40 μl of 2 n ammonium hydroxide and 40 μl of 2% potassium ferricyanide, and the final volume was adjusted to 2 ml with water. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 510 nm was read and compared with those of phenol standards. 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min under the assay conditions. Oxygen consumption was determined polarographically at 50 °C in a closed reaction vessel fitted with a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm phenol, 5–10 μm FAD, and 0.5 nm PheA2 in the absence or presence of 100 nm PheA1. NADH was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm to initiate the reaction. When oxygen consumption ceased, 90 units of catalase were added to determine the degree of uncoupling of hydroxylation. Thermostability—Studies on the thermostability of PheA1 and PheA2 were performed by incubating the enzymes (46 μm PheA1 or 48 μm PheA2) in closed vials at different temperatures (50, 60, 70, and 85 °C) in 25 mm phosphate (pH 7.0) for 2 h. At timed intervals, aliquots were withdrawn from the incubation mixtures and assayed for residual phenol hydroxylase (PheA1) and NADH:flavin reductase (PheA2) activities. Analytical Methods—HPLC experiments were performed with an Applied Biosystems pump equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Reaction products were separated with a 3.9 × 100-mm Lichrospher RP18 column running in methanol/water (50:50, v/v) containing 0.7% acetic acid. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out with 15% slab gels (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or with 16.5% Tricine gels (36Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The gels were scanned and analyzed with a computing densitometer system (Scanjet ADF, Hewlett-Packard Intelligent Scanning Technology). Analytical gel filtration was performed on an Amersham Biosciences Åkta FPLC system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column running in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 m NaCl. Isoelectric focusing was performed with a PhastSystem (Amersham Biosciences) using PhastGel 3–9 isoelectric focusing precast gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Spectral Analysis—Absorption spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer or an Aminco DW-2000 double-beam spectrophotometer. For anaerobic reduction experiments, enzyme and substrate solutions were made anaerobic by alternated flushing with deoxygenated argon and evacuating. Anaerobic reduction of PheA2 was performed by adding aliquots of oxygen-free NADH or dithionite to the enzyme solution, followed by spectral recording. Photoreduction in the presence of EDTA and 5-deazaflavin as catalyst was performed essentially as described (37de Jong E. van Berkel W.J.H. van der Zwan R.P. de Bont J.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were measured at 25 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C on an SLM-AMINCO SPF500C spectrofluorometer. Cofactor Analysis—The flavin prosthetic group of PheA2 was isolated by boiling an enzyme sample for 3 min. After removal of the protein precipitate, the nature of the extracted flavin was identified by fluorescence analysis (38Mayhew S.G. Wassink J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and reverse-phase HPLC (39Eppink M.H.M. Boeren S.A. Vervoort J. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6680-6687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine Determination—The estimation of sulfhydryl groups of native or unfolded PheA2 was carried out by the procedure of Ellman (40Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) employing the modifications of Habeeb (41Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). All thiol determinations were carried out on enzyme preparations that were freshly incubated with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm FAD, and 0.5 mm EDTA for 15 min and subsequently passed through a Bio-Gel P-6DG column equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The enzyme was diluted in 100 mm Tris sulfate (pH 8.0) immediately before assaying the time-dependent release of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate at 412 nm (final pH 7.9). Sequence Analysis—N-terminal protein sequence analysis was performed by Edman degradation with an Applied Biosystems Model 473A pulsed-liquid sequencer fitted with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analytical system following the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Protein sequence similarity searches were performed with PSI-BLAST (42Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) using the facilities offered by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Multiple sequence alignments were made with ClustalX (43Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) using the PAM350 matrix. Protein Homology Modeling—Model building of PheA2 was performed with MODELLER (44Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) using the CVFF force field (45Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). The structure of ferric reductase (FeR) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus with NADP+ bound (Protein Data Bank code 1IOS) (46Chiu H.-J. Johnson E. Schröder I. Rees D.C. Structure. 2001; 9: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The model was verified after several rounds of energy minimization. The stereochemical quality of the homology model was verified by PROCHECK (47Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the protein folding was assessed with PROSAII (48Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), which evaluates the compatibility of each residue with its environment independently. The FMN part of FAD was placed in the model structure at the same position and orientation as the FMN in the template structure. The AMP part of FAD was placed in the groove continuing from the binding pocket of FMN. NADP+ was oriented in the same position as found in the crystal structure of FeR. Overexpression of pheA Genes—Both protein components PheA1 and PheA2 from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 are required for phenol hydroxylase activity (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, E. coli cells containing a plasmid with the genes for PheA1 and PheA2 in tandem did not express PheA2, as only a clear protein band for PheA1 (but not for PheA2) could be detected by SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A likely explanation is that, in this construct, PheA2 expression must use its own B. thermoglucosidasius A7 ribosome-binding site, which might not be effective in E. coli. When PheA2 was expressed separately, expression was under the control of the highly efficient phage T7 promoter, and a clear protein band of PheA2 was visible upon SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, PheA1 and PheA2 were separately purified from E. coli cells containing the appropriate plasmid with the gene for PheA1 or PheA2. Purification of PheA1—Extracts of E. coli cells containing the plasmid with only the pheA1 gene exhibited phenol hydroxylase activity. Because these cells do not contain PheA2, this indicates that a flavin reductase activity present in the E. coli host substitutes for PheA2 to give substrate conversion. A similar observation was made for 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-monooxygenase from E. coli W (30Gálan B. Díaz E. Prieto M.A. García J.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). During purification of PheA1, phenol hydroxylase activity was determined with and without complementation with PheA2. The phenol hydroxylase activity determined in the absence of PheA2 decreased after every purification step (Table I). The specific activity of purified PheA1 determined in the presence of PheA2 was 0.32 units/mg. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified PheA1 protein revealed the presence of a single polypeptide chain corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼57 kDa (Fig. 2). This value is in good agreement with the molecular mass predicted from gene sequence analysis (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Table IPurification of the PheA1 oxygenase component of phenol hydroxylase from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 expressed in E. coli PH2StepProteinActivityaIn the absence of 1 mm PheA2.Specific activityaIn the absence of 1 mm PheA2.ActivitybIn the presence of 1 mm PheA2.Specific activitybIn the presence of 1 mm PheA2.Yieldmgunitsunits/mgunitsunits/mg%Cell extract764430.056460.060100Q-Sepharose3022.40.008160.05335Hydroxyapatite270.110.0048.60.32018a In the absence of 1 mm PheA2.b In the presence of 1 mm PheA2. Open table in a new tab Purified PheA1 did not contain any chromophore as judged by absorption spectral analysis and eluted from an analytical Superdex 200 HR10/30 column in a single symmetrical peak with an apparent molecular mass of 120 ± 5 kDa. This suggests that the PheA1 protein is a dimer composed of identical subunits. Isoelectric focusing of PheA1 revealed a main protein band with an isoelectric point of 5.2 ± 0.1. This value is considerably lower than the theoretical value of 6.29 calculated from the amino acid sequence. Purified PheA1 was stable for 2 h at 60 °C, as no significant decrease in phenol hydroxylase activity was observed in complementation experiments with PheA2. In contrast, at 70 °C, inactivation of PheA1 was complete after 10 min of incubation. The purified PheA1 protein was not very stable when stored at –70 °C because it formed aggregates after thawing. Therefore, PheA1 was stored as a protein precipitate in 80% ammonium sulfate at 4 °C. Purification of PheA2—The PheA2 protein expressed in E. coli cells containing the plasmid with the pheA2 gene was purified to apparent homogeneity using three chromatographic steps (Table II). The specific NADH:FAD reductase activity of the purified PheA2 protein at 53 °C was 800 units/mg. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of a single band corresponding to a polypeptide chain molecular mass of ∼18 kDa (Fig. 3). Again, this value is in good agreement with the molecular mass predicted from gene sequence analysis (17,660 Da) (24Duffner F.M. Kirchner U. Bauer M.P. Müller R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purified PheA2 protein was bright yellow and eluted from an analytical Superdex 200 HR10/30 column in a single symmetrical peak with an apparent molecular mass of 35 ± 3 kDa, indicative of a homodimer"
https://openalex.org/W2133112626,"The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins play essential roles in genomic stability. SMC heterodimers are required for sister-chromatid cohesion (Cohesin: Smc1 & Smc3), chromatin condensation (Condensin: Smc2 & Smc4), and DNA repair (Smc5 & Smc6). The SMC heterodimers do not function alone and must associate with essential non-SMC subunits. To gain further insight into the essential and DNA repair roles of the Smc5–6 complex, we have purified fission yeast Smc5 and identified by mass spectrometry the co-precipitating proteins, Nse1 and Nse2. We show that both Nse1 and Nse2 interact with Smc5 in vivo, as part of the Smc5–6 complex. Nse1 and Nse2 are essential proteins and conserved from yeast to man. Loss of Nse1 and Nse2 function leads to strikingly similar terminal phenotypes to those observed for Smc5–6 inactivation. In addition, cells expressing hypomorphic alleles of Nse1 and Nse2 are, like Smc5–6 mutants, hypersensitive to DNA damage. Epistasis analysis suggests that like Smc5–6, Nse1, and Nse2 function together with Rhp51 in the homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks. The results of this study strongly suggest that Nse1 and Nse2 are novel non-SMC subunits of the fission yeast Smc5–6 DNA repair complex. The structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins play essential roles in genomic stability. SMC heterodimers are required for sister-chromatid cohesion (Cohesin: Smc1 & Smc3), chromatin condensation (Condensin: Smc2 & Smc4), and DNA repair (Smc5 & Smc6).

We show that both Nse1 and Nse2 interact with Smc5 in vivo, as part of the Smc5–6 complex. Nse1 and Nse2 are essential proteins and conserved from yeast to man. Loss of Nse1 and Nse2 function leads to strikingly similar terminal phenotypes to those observed for Smc5–6 inactivation. In addition, cells expressing hypomorphic alleles of Nse1 and Nse2 are, like Smc5–6 mutants, hypersensitive to DNA damage. Epistasis analysis suggests that like Smc5–6, Nse1, and Nse2 function together with Rhp51 in the homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks. The results of this study strongly suggest that Nse1 and Nse2 are novel non-SMC subunits of the fission yeast Smc5–6 DNA repair complex. Maintenance of genomic integrity is crucial for cell viability and suppression of cancer priming genetic alterations. The genome cycle requires large amounts of DNA to be packaged and structurally manipulated, during replication, mitosis and repair. A superfamily of proteins called the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, structural maintenance of chromosomes; TAP, tandem affinity purification; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology.1The abbreviations used are: SMC, structural maintenance of chromosomes; TAP, tandem affinity purification; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; DAPI, 4′, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole; MudPIT, multidimensional protein identification technology. family play essential roles in all of these processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Jessberger R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar and 2Hirano T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes contain 6 SMC proteins, called SMC1–6. All SMC family proteins share a similar architecture, in that they contain N- and C-terminal Walker A and Walker B motifs, respectively, separated by an extensive region that forms a coiled-coil structure. These SMC proteins form specific heterodimers producing three distinct SMC complexes involved in different aspects of DNA metabolism. SMC1 and SMC3 form the basis of the cohesin complex that tethers sister chromatids together following passage of the replication fork. SMC2 and SMC4 are required for chromosome condensation during mitosis, and SMC5 and SMC6 are required for DNA repair as well as an enigmatic essential function (reviewed in Refs. 1Jessberger R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar and 2Hirano T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The SMC heterodimers do not function alone but require interaction with essential proteins called non-SMC subunits. Fission yeast cohesin (Smc1–3) requires the non-SMC subunits, Rad21 and psc3 (3Tomonaga T. Nagao K. Kawasaki Y. Furuya K. Murakami A. Morishita J. Yuasa T. Sutani T. Kearsey S.E. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Rad21 is cleaved by separase (Esp1) prior to anaphase, abolishing sister chromatid cohesion and allowing chromosomes to segregate (3Tomonaga T. Nagao K. Kawasaki Y. Furuya K. Murakami A. Morishita J. Yuasa T. Sutani T. Kearsey S.E. Uhlmann F. Nasmyth K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2757-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). An intriguing model has recently been proposed in which Smc1–3 encircle sister chromatids, with the circle held closed by interaction of Rad21 (Scc1) with the head groups of the asymmetric Smc1–3 heterodimer (4Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Rad21 (Scc1) by separase (Esp1) results in breakage of the Smc1–3 circle and loss of cohesion between sisters. Condensin requires at least three non-SMC subunits; Cnd1, Cnd2, and Cnd3 to compact chromosomes during mitosis (5Sutani T. Yuasa T. Tomonaga T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2271-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The non-SMC subunit requirements of the fission yeast Smc5–6 complex are currently poorly defined. Studies in fission yeast showed that the Smc5–6 complex appears to consist of six additional as yet unidentified non-SMC subunits (6Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Determining the function of the Smc5–6 complex would be greatly assisted by identification and study of its non-SMC subunits. Mutations have been isolated in SMC and non-SMC components of cohesin and condensin that yield DNA damage-sensitive phenotypes. For example, hypomorphic Rad21 mutants display sensitivity to radiation (7al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A recent study shows that cohesin may play direct roles in DNA repair at the damage site, rather than just maintaining chromosome cohesion (8Kim J.S. Krasieva T.B. LaMorte V. Taylor A.M. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45149-45153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, cohesin is specifically recruited to the sites of laser-induced DNA damage (8Kim J.S. Krasieva T.B. LaMorte V. Taylor A.M. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45149-45153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Notably, the fission yeast condensin mutant cnd2-1 maintains cell viability but renders cells sensitive to UV irradiation and replication arrest (9Aono N. Sutani T. Tomonaga T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Nature. 2002; 417: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). How condensin effects DNA repair is unknown. The Smc5–6 complex is often labeled as a DNA repair complex. Indeed, Smc6 (Rad18) was first identified in screens for DNA damage-sensitive mutants (6Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Lehmann A.R. Walicka M. Griffiths D.J. Murray J.M. Watts F.Z. McCready S. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7067-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 11Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is certainly involved in DNA repair but Smc5–6 is essential even in the absence of extrinsic DNA damage. Based on the essential nature of Smc5–6 and the fact that mutants of cohesin and condensin yield DNA damage sensitivity, it is likely that Smc5–6 has a genome “housekeeping” role. Support for such a role comes from the fact that in fission yeast, Smc6 (Rad18) mutations are synthetic lethal with topoisomerase II mutations (11Verkade H.M. Bugg S.J. Lindsay H.D. Carr A.M. O'Connell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2905-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, physical and genetic interactions were detected between Rad60 and the Smc5–6 proteins (12Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Morishita T. Tsutsui Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3537-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Like Smc5–6, Rad60 is essential and plays a role in DNA repair. The similarity between the phenotypes of Smc5–6 and Rad60 mutants suggests a co-dependent function of Rad60 and Smc5–6; however; the precise nature of the relationship needs further study. The identification and characterization of non-SMC subunits of cohesin and condensin greatly facilitated functional analysis of these complexes. Therefore, to gain insight into the function of the Smc5–6 complex and potentially Rad60, we purified Smc5-TAP from fission yeast and applied multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to identify co-purifying proteins (14McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Dis. Markers. 2002; 18: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar, 16Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of two non-SMC subunits of the fission yeast Smc5–6 complex. Recently, the identification of a budding yeast non-SMC component of the SMC5–6 complex called NSE1 was described (17Fujioka Y. Kimata Y. Nomaguchi K. Watanabe K. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21585-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found very weak homology between NSE1 and one of the proteins we identified. Therefore, to maintain a unifying nomenclature we refer to this fission yeast protein as non-SMC element Nse1 and the other as Nse2. Gel filtration analysis shows that Nse1 and Nse2 co-migrate with the characteristic high molecular weight Smc5–6 complex (6Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that Nse1 and Nse2 are indeed part of the Smc5–6 complex in vivo. Nse1 and Nse2 are both essential genes, hypomorphic mutations of which yield DNA damage-sensitive phenotypes. Epistasis analyses suggest that, like Smc5–6, Nse1 and Nse2 function in the homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks with the fission yeast Rad51 homologue, Rhp51. Together, these data strongly suggest that Nse1 and Nse2 are non-SMC subunits of the fission yeast Smc5–6 DNA repair complex. General Techniques—Standard fission yeast methods and media were used in these studies (18Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). UV and IR sensitivity assays were performed as described (19Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Generation of Tagged, Deleted, and Mutated Genes—Nse1 and Nse2 were deleted by replacement of the entire open reading frame (start to stop codon) of each gene with the kanMx6 module as described in Bahler et al. (20Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Phileppsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) producing heterozygous diploids (20Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Phileppsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged Nse1, Nse2 and Smc5 were also generated as described in Bahler et al., 1998, using the PCR-based method to place a Myc or TAP epitope at the C terminus of each protein and mark the allele with the kanMx6 gene. The tagged proteins were confirmed as fully functional. The nse1-1 and nse2-1 alleles were generated using PCR. Genomic DNA was isolated from yeast containing the epitope-tagged nse1-myc: kanMx6 and nse2-myc:kanMx6 alleles. The entire genomic locus containing each allele was amplified by PCR using standard conditions (from start codon to 100-bp downstream of KanMx6). The amplified loci were then re-amplified in 4 parallel PCR reactions. The PCR reactions were pooled and transformed into Schizosaccharomyces pombe using the transformation protocol described in Bahler et al. (20Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Phileppsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar) and transformants were selected by growth on YES media containing G418 (to select for kanMx6) at 25 °C. Stable transformants were tested for replacement of the endogenous nse1 and nse2 alleles by the transformed nse1-myc:kanMx6 and nse2-myc:kanMx6 alleles as described in Bahler et al. (20Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Phileppsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were then tested for temperature sensitivity and drug sensitivity by plating the strains on YES media at 36 °C or on YES plates containing 5 mm hydroxyurea. Strains that displayed temperature and/or hydroxyurea sensitivity were transformed with an episomal plasmid containing the wild-type genomic nse1 or nse2 genes to confirm that the strain defects were rescued by and therefore, allelic to the respective genes. Immunoblotting Gel Filtration and Microscopy Techniques—Immunoblotting was performed as described using extracts made from cells lysed in a bead beater (19Boddy M.N. Lopez-Girona A. Shanahan P. Interthal H. Heyer W.D. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8758-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed using in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resolved in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membrane, blocked in 5% milk in TBS and 0.3% Tween-20, and probed with antibodies to the epitope. Nse1-myc and Nse2-myc were detected with anti-Myc antibody (9E10 at 1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Smc5-TAP was detected with peroxidase anti-peroxidase reagent (PAP at 1:2000 dilution; Sigma). Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 200 column calibrated with high molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). The void volume was determined with blue dextran 2000 (Amersham Biosciences). Flow rate was 0.3 ml/min and fractions were 0.6 ml. Samples were lysed in buffer A and ∼300 μg of total protein was loaded via a 100-μl loop. For Smc5-TAP immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in buffer A and IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysates followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1.5 h with rotation. Complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A before resuspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using established methods (21Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). GFP was visualized in live cells that were co-stained with DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) at 25 μg/ml. Cells were photographed with Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix CCD camera. Identification of Smc5-interacting Proteins—Proteins associating with Smc5-TAP were identified by MudPIT using established methods (14McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Dis. Markers. 2002; 18: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 15Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat.

Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼ 50 g wet weight) expressing Smc5-TAP at the genomic locus were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lysed using a motorized mortar and pestle (Retsch) in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Smc5-TAP was purified from clarified lysate as described (23Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). The final eluate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (25% v/v) for 1 h on ice. The precipitate was centrifuged (Eppendorf) at a relative centrifugal force (r.c.f.) of 16. The pellet was washed twice with acetone (–20 °C) and air-dried. The sample was reduced and alkylated using dithothreitol and iodoacetamide and then sequentially digested with endonuclease lyse-C (Roche Applied Science) and soluble trypsin (Roche Applied Science) (24McCormack A.L. Schieltz D.M. Goode B. Yang S. Barnes G. Drubin D. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The resulting peptide mixture was analyzed by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (15Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar, 16Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) with modifications described by McDonald and Yates (14McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Dis. Markers. 2002; 18: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and MacCoss et al. (25MacCoss M.J. McDonald W.H. Saraf A. Sadygov R. Clark J.M. Tasto J.J. Gould K.L. Wolters D. Washburn M. Weiss A. Clark J.I. Yates III, J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7900-7905Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the latest version of the pompep data base to which common contaminants such as keratin and trypsin were added (These sequence data were produced by the S. pombe Sequencing Group at the Sanger Centre and can be obtained from ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/yeast/Pombe/Proteindata/). Search results were filtered and grouped using the DTASelect program and identifications confirmed through manual evaluation of spectra. Common background proteins were also excluded by comparing the Smc5-TAP data set to the large number of other data sets obtained by purification of unrelated proteins in the laboratory.

Identification of Nse1 and Nse2, Novel Smc5-associated Proteins—Smc5 and Smc6 form a highly stable heterodimer that is part of a larger complex consisting of at least six other unidentified proteins (6Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of the Smc5–6 complex of fission yeast, we purified tandem affinity purification (TAP) epitope-tagged Smc5 (Smc5-TAP) and used multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) to identify co-precipitating proteins (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) (15Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar, 23Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). We previously used the MudPIT system to identify the Mus81-Eme1 Holliday junction resolving activity from fission yeast (22Boddy M.N. Gaillard P.H. McDonald W.H. Shanahan P. Yates 3rd, J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2001; 107: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified an interaction between the DNA repair factor Rad60 and the Smc5-Smc6 complex (12Boddy M.N. Shanahan P. McDonald W.H. Lopez-Girona A. Noguchi E. Yates I.J. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The major benefits of this system are that it allows identification of proteins within a relatively complex mixture of peptides and that it is highly sensitive. Therefore, this system obviates the need for visualization and excision of protein bands from gels for peptide identification. Indeed, the MudPIT analysis of our TAP purifications typically identifies more than 100 unique proteins, most of which are not detectable by silver staining of gels. We therefore use immunoblotting to confirm that TAP epitope-tagged proteins have been efficiently precipitated before subjecting samples to mass spectrometric analysis. We have performed many TAP purifications of nuclear and cytosolic proteins under comparable conditions, allowing us to generate a list of common background proteins (e.g. ribosomes, metabolic enzymes, and actin). The list of proteins identified in the Smc5-TAP purification was compared with this list to exclude common background. For proteins that are unique to a particular purification, we use the number of peptides obtained, and the percentage coverage of each protein's primary sequence as a rough indication of their relative abundance. As expected, mass spectrometric analysis of the affinity purified Smc5-TAP sample revealed extensive peptide coverage of both Smc5 and its heterodimeric partner Smc6 (81.6 and 75.6% respectively; Fig. 1A , right panel). Interestingly, as judged by the extensive peptide coverage of each, two novel proteins were also stably co-precipitated with Smc5-TAP. Nse1 was identified by peptides covering 73% of its 232 amino acid primary sequence (Fig. 1A). The data base annotation for this gene is currently incorrect as it lacks an additional 3-prime exon. The annotated open reading frame encodes a protein of only 203 amino acids. This 203 amino acid truncated form of Nse1, unlike the 232 amino acid protein, is unable to complement the Nse1 deletion strain (data not shown). When the mass spectrometry data was again searched with full-length Nse1, we obtained peptide coverage of the 29 amino acids encoded by the extra exon. Importantly, the full-length Nse1 contains a RING-finger like domain (26Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), found in the Nse1 homologues from different species (Fig. 1A). Recently, NSE1 of budding yeast was described as a novel subunit of the SMC5–6 complex (17Fujioka Y. Kimata Y. Nomaguchi K. Watanabe K. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21585-21591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found that fission yeast Nse1 shows low homology to NSE1. Although BLAST scores are not statistically significant (expect 7.8), the similarity in size and domain content suggests that the two proteins are likely to be functional homologues. Alignments between the fission yeast and human Nse1 proteins produce highly significant scores (expect 2e-09). Peptides covering 71.5% of the primary sequence of a second novel protein, Nse2, were also obtained (Fig. 1, B and A , right panel). Nse2 is a 267 amino acid protein that is conserved from yeast to man, showing significant homology to the budding yeast gene MMS21 (expect 6e-06; Refs. 27Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Prakash S. Prakash L. Genetics. 1977; 87: 229-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Montelone B.A. Koelliker K.J. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The presumptive Nse2 homologues all share the highest sequence homology across their C-terminal regions, which contain a potential zinc stabilized structure. Interestingly, hypomorphic mutations in the essential gene MMS21 result in hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents (27Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Prakash S. Prakash L. Genetics. 1977; 87: 229-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Montelone B.A. Koelliker K.J. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the role of MMS21 in DNA repair and its protein partners are currently unknown. In particular, MMS21 has not been described as part of the budding yeast SMC5–6 complex. In Vivo Interaction of Nse1 and Nse2 with Smc5 and Smc6 —We identified Nse1 and Nse2 as Smc5-TAP co-purifying proteins using mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry data showed that Nse1, Nse2, and Smc6 stably co-precipitated with Smc5-TAP. To obtain independent confirmation of this observation, we epitope-tagged Nse1 and Nse2 at their genomic loci with the Myc epitope. Strains containing both Smc5-TAP and Nse1-myc or singly tagged strains were generated using standard yeast genetics. We found that Nse1-myc was readily detected in Smc5-TAP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). Neither Nse1-myc nor cross-reacting bands were observed in the negative control lanes (Nse1-myc, Smc5-TAP; Fig. 2A). A comparison of the input signals for Smc5-TAP and Nse1-myc with the signals for each protein following precipitation, suggests that the interaction of Smc5-TAP with Nse1-myc is avid (Fig. 2A). Although stoichiometry cannot be judged due to the different epitope tags, the ratio between the Smc5-TAP and Nse1-myc signals before and after precipitation did not change markedly (exposures were directly comparable). Nse2-myc, like Nse1-myc, specifically associates with Smc5-TAP (Fig. 2B). The apparent stability of the Smc5-TAP Nse1-myc/Nse1-myc interaction suggested that Nse1 and Nse2 might be subunits of the Smc5–6 DNA repair complex. Gel filtration analysis has previously established that Smc5 and Smc6 are part of a large (∼1.6 MDa) complex, containing about six other unidentified proteins (6Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nse1 and Nse2 are part of this Smc5-Smc6-based complex, we used double-tagged strains containing both Smc5-TAP and Nse1-myc or Nse2-myc. Comparison of the gel filtration profile of Smc5-TAP with those of Nse1-myc and Nse2-myc, shows that both Nse1-myc and Nse2-myc co-fractionate with Smc5-TAP (Fig. 2, C and D). Based on the above co-precipitation and gel filtration data, Nse1 and Nse2 appear to be subunits of the Smc5–6 complex in fission yeast. Nse1 and Nse2 Are Essential Genes Encoding Nuclear Proteins—If Nse1 and Nse2 play a direct role in DNA metabolism in the Smc5–6 complex, then they should localize to the nucleus as observed for Smc5 and Smc6 (11Verkade H.M.

To determine the localization of Nse1 and Nse2, we tagged each protein at its genomic locus with a C-terminal GFP epitope. Both fusion proteins were expressed from their endogenous promoters and were fully functional. Consistent with Nse1-GFP and Nse2-GFP being resident in the Smc5–6 complex, both are predominantly nuclear proteins at all stages of the cell cycle (Fig. 3, A and B and data not shown). Smc5 and Smc6 are essential genes in both fission and budding yeasts (6Fousteri M.I. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Lehmann A.R. Walicka M.

If Nse1 and Nse2 are functional subunits of the Smc5–6 complex we anticipated that they should also be essential. Heterozygous diploids were made in which the entire open reading frame of both Nse1 and Nse2 were replaced with the kanMX cassette (20Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie A. Steever A.B.

Early events in the establishment of infection involve interactions between N. gonorrhoeae and the mucosal epithelium, which leads to the local release of inflammatory mediators. Because of this, it is important to identify the bacterial virulence factors and host cell components that contribute to inflammation. Using a series of column chromatography steps, we purified a lipoprotein from N. gonorrhoeae strain F62 called Lip. This outer membrane antigen expresses a conserved epitope known as H.8, which is common to all pathogenic Neisseria species. We found the purified preparation of Lip to be a potent inflammatory mediator capable of inducing the release of the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 and the cytokine IL-6 by immortalized human endocervical epithelial cells and the production of IL-8 and the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells transfected with toll-like receptor (TLR) 2. Upon removal of Lip by immunoprecipitation, the ability of the H.8/Lip preparation to stimulate NF-κB activation was abolished. In addition to TLR2, the activation of NF-κB by H.8/Lip in HEK cells was enhanced upon coexpression of TLR1 but not TLR6. These observations provide evidence that Lip is capable of inducing the release of inflammatory mediators from epithelial cells in a TLR2-dependent manner.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a strictly human pathogen and the causative agent of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease of worldwide importance. Infection with gonorrhea usually remains localized to the lower genital tract where it commonly manifests as urethritis in men and cervicitis in women. In some cases it can ascend to the upper genital tract, which in women can lead to endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and fallopian tube scarring. In addition, certain strains are capable of dissemination, resulting in bacteremia, septic arthritis, and pustular skin lesions. During the early stages of infection, the initial interaction of N. gonorrhoeae with mucosal epithelial cells triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin (IL)-6 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinTLRtoll-like receptorNF-κBnuclear factor κBLPSlipopolysaccharideLOSlipooligosaccharideTNFαtumor necrosis factor αMALP-2mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2mAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineGLCgas/liquid chromatographyHEKhuman embryonic kidneyDEAE2-diethylamino-ethylIPimmunoprecipitation. and IL-8 (1Fichorova R.N.

A variety of host cell receptors have been implicated in the recognition of and response to bacteria and their components. These include the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, which is central to innate immune defenses (4Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.

The principal ligands that are recognized by the TLRs are conserved molecular patterns shared by a broad range of pathogens. For instance, TLR4 has been identified as the principle signal transducer in the recognition of LPS (5Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol.

For instance, peritoneal macrophages from TLR6-deficient mice do not produce significant levels of TNFα, nitric oxide, and IL-12 in response to diacylated mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) but maintain responsiveness to triacylated lipopeptides and lipoproteins (19Takeuchi O.

Moreover, macrophages derived from mice lacking TLR1 are hindered in the release of TNFα when treated with triacylated lipopeptides but respond normally to MALP-2, peptidoglycan, and LPS (17Takeuchi O.

In light of reports that an LPS-deficient strain of N. meningitidis primarily activates macrophages through TLR2 (20Ingalls R.R. Lien E. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2230-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Pridmore A.C. Wyllie D.H. Abdillahi F. Steeghs L. van der Ley P. Dower S.K. Read R.C. J. Infect.

Latz E. Golenbock D. Wetzler L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1533-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we examined other potential TLR2 ligands from the outer membrane of Neisseria. Many of the surface proteins of Neisseria are known to undergo significant antigenic variability; comparatively fewer are conserved within the pathogenic Neisseria species. One such conserved antigen is the Lip (or H.8 antigen) lipoprotein. The H.8 antigen is named after a mouse hybridoma antibody that recognizes a surface epitope that is common to pathogenic Neisseria species including N. gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis but absent from other commensal Neisseria species (23Cannon J.G. Black W.J. Nachamkin I. Stewart P.W. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 994-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the size and amino acid sequence of Lip can differ between Neisseria species and strains (24Trees D.L. Schultz A.J. Knapp J.S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2914-2916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it primarily consists of 11–20 pentameric AAEAP amino acid repeats and a lipid-modified N-terminal cysteine residue and lacks any aromatic residues (25Wagner D.A. Young V.R. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 80: 4518-4521Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 26Woods J.P. Spinola S.M. Strobel S.M. Cannon J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This latter property makes it virtually undetectable by most protein assay and staining methods and thus makes it an elusive potential contaminant of preparations purified from outer membranes derived from Neisseria. In addition to recognizing Lip, the H.8-specific monoclonal antibody is weakly cross-reactive to a second conserved protein from Neisseria known as Laz. This lipid-modified azurin-like protein contains imperfect AAEAP motifs at the N-terminal domain of the mature protein and a second domain with homology to the azurin protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27Gotschlich E. Seiff M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1987; 43: 253-255Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Kawula T. Spinola S. Klapper D. Cannon J. Mol.

In this report, we describe the proinflammatory activity of the Lip lipoprotein in terms of its ability to stimulate chemokine and cytokine production in human endocervical epithelial cells. In addition, we provide evidence using transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells suggesting that TLR2 and TLR1 are required for recognition of the Lip lipoprotein. Finally, preliminary biochemical analysis confirms the presence of lipid modification in the Lip lipoprotein and suggests that it may contain both short (C8–C10) and medium (C16) chain fatty acids.

The lysate from Borrelia burgdorferi strain cN40 was a gift from Dr. Timothy Sellati (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). Recombinant human soluble CD14 was obtained from Dr. Henri Lichenstein (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). The synthetic lipopeptide Pam3Cys-Lip, the nonlipidated Lip peptide, the Pam3Cys-SK4 lipopeptide, and the mycoplasmal lipopeptide MALP-2 were purchased from EMC Microcollections (Tuebingen, Germany). The Pam3Cys-Lip, which contains a tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine at the N terminus, was based on the N-terminal sequence of the N. gonorrhoeae F62 Lip protein (sequence CGGEKAAEAPAAEAS). The MALP-2 lipopeptide was derived from the MALP-2 membrane lipoprotein from Mycoplasma fermentans (sequence CGNNDESNISFKEK) and possesses a dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine at the N terminus. Protein G-agarose was from Sigma. Bacterial Strains—The N. gonorrhoeae laboratory strain F62 (nonpiliated, nonopaque; pil–/opa–), which was originally isolated from an individual with pelvic inflammatory disease, was used for these studies (36Schneider H. Griffiss J.M. Williams G.D. Pier G.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). Strain FA1090 and the H.8 deletion mutant FA1090ΔH.8 and the plasmid pHSS6 (ΔH.8) containing the FA1090 H.8 gene insertionally inactivated with a chloramphenicol resistance gene were gifts from Dr. Janne Cannon (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) (26Woods J.P. Spinola S.M. Strobel S.M. Cannon J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Piliated N. gonorrhoeae strain F62 was transformed with purified plasmid pHSS6 as previously described (37Biswas G.D. Sox T. Blackman E. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 983-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Carbonetti N. Simnad V. Elkins C. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol-resistant N. gonorrhoeae F62 colonies were selected on standard gonococcal culture medium supplemented with chloramphenicol at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Transformants were confirmed by immunoblot analysis showing the absence of the 2C3 epitope as described below. Nucleotide Sequencing of Lip from N. gonorrhoeae—N. gonorrhoeae strain F62 was grown overnight on chocolate agar. Crude DNA was isolated by resuspending approximately five colonies in 100 μl of sterile water, as described by Hobbs et al. (39Hobbs M.M. Alcorn T.M. Davis R.H. Fischer W. Thomas J.C. Martin I. Ison C. Sparling P.F. Cohen M.S. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Lip gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and chromosomal DNA from N. gonorrhoeae strain F62. The primers, derived from Trees et al. (24Trees D.L. Schultz A.J. Knapp J.S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2914-2916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that were used to amplify the Lip gene were CAAATTCAGCGATGAATTTCCAACCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TATGAAGGTCAGGCATGTTTGTCGG-3′ (reverse primer). The PCR conditions consisted of 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 68 °C for 2 min 30 s. The amplified PCR product of ∼500 base pairs was gel-purified and sequenced by the Boston University Molecular Genetics Core Facility using the ABI Prism Big DYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) performed on the ABI Prism 377-96 DNA sequencer. Outer Membrane Preparations—N. gonorrhoeae strain F62 was grown overnight on chocolate agar, and the outer membranes were prepared as described previously (33Gnehm H. Pelton S. Gulati S. Rice P. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 1645-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were harvested into shearing buffer (PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). The suspension was incubated at 60 °C for 30 min, and the outer membranes were sheared by passage through a 25-gauge needle, followed by homogenization for 10 s in a Waring blender. After two rounds of centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove unlysed bacteria and large cellular debris, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet from this ultracentrifugation step was resuspended in deoxycholate buffer (50 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5% deoxycholate, pH 9.5). Uniform solubilization of the membranes was achieved by increasing the pH of the suspension to 13.5 with 1 m NaOH, followed by immediate readjustment back to pH 9.5 with 0.5 n HCl. Purification of the H.8/Lip Lipoprotein from N. gonorrhoeae—The procedure for purifying H.8/Lip from Neisseria was described by Zollinger et al. (40Zollinger W. Ray J. Moran E. Seid R. Schoolnik G. The Pathogenic Neisseriae: Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium. American Society for Microbiology, Asilomar, CA1984: 579-584Google Scholar). Briefly, the solubilized outer membrane preparation was loaded onto a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 cm × 60 cm) equilibrated with deoxycholate buffer. Fractions (5 ml) were collected at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The presence of H.8 was confirmed by dot-blot analysis using the anti-H.8 mouse monoclonal IgG antibody 2C3, and the presence of other proteins and LOS was monitored by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels and/or BCA protein assay reagent A (Pierce). The fractions that were positive for H.8 and contained a low level of other proteins were pooled and dialyzed for 18 h against PBS (NaPO4, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl). This fraction was further clarified by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) column (1.5 × 12 cm; 20 ml) that was equilibrated with PBS. The bound material was eluted with a 50–400 mm NaCl gradient in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the fractions were collected every 4 min. Fatty Acid Analysis—The purified H.8/Lip fraction, the synthetic Pam3Cys-Lip lipopeptide, and gonococcal LOS were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 20 h at 95 °C. After extraction of the hydrolyzed products with isopropanol/hexane and 1 n H2SO4 (40:10:1), the hexane phase containing total lipid was concentrated by evaporation of the organic solvent under nitrogen gas, and the resulting product was redissolved in 100 μl of hexane and separated by TLC (hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid, 70:30: 1). The fraction that contained free fatty acids was scraped off and eluted with hexane. After drying down under N2 gas, methylation was performed by incubation in BF3-methanol solution (14%, v/v, BF3 in methanol) at 60 °C for 30 min. The fatty acid methyl ester was extracted into a hexane solution. The hexane solution was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and used directly for gas/liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis without further condensation. GLC analysis was performed on a Shimuzu 14A gas chromatograph with a Supelco SP™-2380 capillary column, with an initial oven temperature of 150 °C, a final temperature of 240 °C, a heating rate of 4 °C/min, an injector temperature of 220 °C, and a detector temperature of 240 °C. The carrier gas (helium) was at 50 kPa, make-up carrier gas (helium) was at 100 kPa, hydrogen gas was at 55 kPa, and compressed air was at 50 kPa. The sample was injected in 1–1.5 μl with splitting rate of 1:25. The peak assignment was done using Nu-Chek GLC reference for free fatty acids (063A) and bacterial acid methyl ester reference standards (catalog number 47080-U) from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). The results are presented as the percentages of each fatty acyl chain in the sample. Cell Culture—The HEK 293 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan UT) and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Bayer Corp., West Haven, CT). HEK 293 cells stably transfected with TLR2 (HEK-TLR2) were provided by Dr. Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). The human papillomavirus 16/E6E7 immortalized endocervical epithelial cell line (End/E6E7) was a gift from Dr. Raina Fichorova (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The End/E6E7 cells were grown in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with the provided 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.1 ng/ml recombinant epidermal growth factor, and 0.4 mm CaCl2 (keratinocyte serum-free growth medium). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Assays for IL-6 and IL-8 Secretion—End/E6E7, HEK 293, and HEK-TLR2 cell were grown in 96-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 5 × 104/well and allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells were treated with various concentrations of purified DEAE H.8/Lip fraction in a reaction volume of 100 μl. Control treatments were PBS or DEAE column elution buffer, IL-1β (5 ng/ml), TNFα (5 ng/ml), and LPS (100 ng/ml). Treatments of the End/E6E7 cells were in keratinocyte serum-free growth medium. Soluble CD14, at a concentration of 500 ng/ml, was added to the medium when indicated (41Fichorova R.N. Cronin A.O. Lien E. Anderson D.J. Ingalls R.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2424-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Treatments for the HEK 293 cells were in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 20 h at 37 °C, the culture supernatants were removed, diluted to the appropriate concentrations in keratinocyte serum-free medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and assayed for IL-6 or IL-8 using Eli-pair enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits from Cell Sciences (Norwood, MA). All of the cytokines were assayed in duplicate or triplicate, and the data are reported as the means ± the standard error or standard deviation, respectively. Expression Plasmids—The ELAM-1-luciferase reporter plasmid (pELAM-luc) was generated as described (5Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10689-10692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) by cloning a fragment (–241 to –54 base pairs) of the human E-selectin promoter into the pGL3 reporter plasmid (Promega). This expression plasmid reports luciferase in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Expression plasmids for human TLR1 (in the pFLAG-CMV vector), TLR2 (in the pFLAG-CMV vector), and TLR6 (in the pEF-BOS vector) were a gift of Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). All of the plasmid DNA was isolated with Endo-Free™ Maxi-prep columns from Qiagen. Transient Transfection and NF-κB Reporter Luciferase Assay—HEK 293 or HEK-TLR2 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates (4 × 105 cells/well) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Using the SuperFect™ Transfection Protocol (Qiagen), the cells were transfected with 250 ng of pELAM-luc reporter construct and one of the following expression vectors (described above): 100 ng of human TLR2, 500 ng of human TLR1, or 10 ng of human TLR6. The empty vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used as a control and to normalize the DNA concentration for all of the transfection reactions. The transfected cells were then allowed to recover for a period of 20 h. After triplicate treatments for 5 h, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Promega), snap frozen on dry ice, and assayed for luciferase activity by the use of a commercial luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of luciferase activity in each sample was quantified by a Monolight™ 3010 Luminometer (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The data are reported as the means ± the standard deviation. All of the transfection experiments were repeated at least twice. Immunoprecipitation of H.8 —Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 2 h at 4 °C in 70-μl reaction volumes containing 5 μl of purified H.8/Lip, 15 μg of protein G-agarose, 4 μg of bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of either anti-H.8 2C3 antibody or control IgG (0–10 μg/ml). After centrifugation, the IP supernatants were decanted, and the resulting IP pellets were washed three times with PBS. The proteins from both the pellet and the supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). H.8 antigen was detected using mAb 2C3 and visualized by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and substrate as described previously (42Blake M. Johnston K. Russell-Jones G. Gotschlich E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Gel Purification of Lip—H.8/Lip derived from the DEAE-Sephacel column was further purified by elution after electrophoresis on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel under denaturing conditions in the presence of lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen). Using the prestained molecular mass samples as a guide, the gel fragment that corresponded to the predicted migration of Lip was excised and incubated with 1 ml of endotoxin-free H2O for 18 h at 37 °C. The eluted material was analyzed by silver staining to assess for contaminants, and the presence of Lip was confirmed by immunoblotting with mAb 2C3 as described above. As a negative control, a gel fragment spanning the 60–70-kDa regions was also excised and treated similarly. Both samples were tested for contaminating endotoxin using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Pyrochrome kit from Associates of Cape Cod (Falmouth, MA). The limit of detection for the Pyrochrome kit is 0.005 endotoxin units/ml (12 endotoxin units = ∼1 ng of endotoxin). Endotoxin contamination in the concentrated H.8/Lip and gel control preparations was 6 and 5 endotoxin units/ml, respectively; preparations were used in the biological assays at dilutions of 1:50 to 1:1000. Purification of the H.8 Lipoprotein Lip from N. gonorrhoeae F62 Outer Membranes—It has been documented that small amounts of contaminating lipoproteins in LPS preparations can lead to TLR2-dependent cell activation (32Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J. Vogel S. Weis J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). We tested an LOS preparation from N. gonorrhoeae for activation of NF-κB in human endocervical epithelial cells. This cell line had previously been shown by our laboratory to be deficient in TLR4 and MD-2, the receptors required for responses to most species of endotoxin (41Fichorova R.N. Cronin A.O. Lien E. Anderson D.J. Ingalls R.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2424-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Rather unexpectedly, we found dose-dependent cell activation with LOS concentrations greater than 1 μg/ml (data not shown). However, upon repurification of the crude LOS preparation by phenol re-extraction (32Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J. Vogel S. Weis J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), the LOS-dependent activation disappeared. This suggested that cell activation was being driven by a phenol-soluble lipoprotein. Immunoblot analysis using mAb 2C3 revealed that the gonococcal outer membrane protein Lip (or H.8 antigen) was present in the original LOS preparation but not after re-extraction (data not shown). This observation prompted us to further examine the potential of the Lip lipopr"

In addition to their ability to regulate PPAR-mediated gene transcription, PPARα and γ ligands have recently been shown to induce activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which in turn phosphorylate PPARs, thereby affecting transcriptional activity. However, the mechanism for PPAR ligand-dependent MAPK activation is unclear. In the current study, we demonstrate that various PPARα (nafenopin) and γ (ciglitazone and troglitazone) agonists rapidly induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and/or p38 phosphorylation in rat liver epithelial cells (GN4). The selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors, PD153035 and ZD1839 (Iressa), abolished PPARα and γ agonist-dependent Erk activation. Consistent with this, PPAR agonists increased tyrosine autophosphorylation of the EGFR as well as phosphorylation at a putative Src-specific site, Tyr845. Experiments with the Src inhibitor, PP2, and the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine revealed critical roles for Src and reactive oxygen species as upstream mediators of EGFR transactivation in response to PPAR ligands. Moreover, PPARα and γ ligands increased Src autophosphorylation as well as kinase activity. EGFR phosphorylation, in turn, led to Ras-dependent Erk activation. In contrast, p38 activation by PPARα and γ ligands occurred independently of Src, oxidative stress, the EGFR, and Ras. Interestingly, PPARα and γ agonists caused rapid activation of proline-rich tyrosine kinase or Pyk2; Pyk2 as well as p38 phosphorylation was reduced by intracellular Ca2+ chelation without an observable effect on EGFR and Erk activation, suggesting a possible role for Pyk2 as an upstream activator of p38.

Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G. Wahli W. Cell. 1992; 68: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Genes regulated by PPARs have crucial roles in lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation, glucose homeostasis, eicosanoid signaling, and inflammation (2Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev.

These receptors have thus become an attractive target in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease, inflammation, and possibly cancer prompting the development of synthetic PPAR agonists by the pharmaceutical industry. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor EGF receptor 2-methyl-2-[p-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-napthyl)-phenoxyl]proionic acid (±)-5-[4-(1-methylcyclohexylmethoxy)-benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (±)-5-[4-[(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-yl)methoxy]-benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione pirinixic acid 4-[(3-bromophenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)-quinazoline 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene 1,2 bis-(o-aminophenyoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester reactive oxygen species protein kinase C estrogen receptor. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor EGF receptor 2-methyl-2-[p-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-napthyl)-phenoxyl]proionic acid (±)-5-[4-(1-methylcyclohexylmethoxy)-benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (±)-5-[4-[(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-yl)methoxy]-benzyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione pirinixic acid 4-[(3-bromophenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine 4-(3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy-6-(3-morpholinopropoxy)-quinazoline 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol[3,4-d]pyrimidine 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(2-aminophenylthio)butadiene 1,2 bis-(o-aminophenyoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester reactive oxygen species protein kinase C estrogen receptor. The efficacy of PPAR ligands in modulating lipid homeostasis has been largely attributed to their ability to modulate gene transcription in a PPAR-dependent manner. For example, PPARα ligands are unable to up-regulate the expression of genes involved in the cellular uptake and β-oxidation of fatty acids in PPARα knockout mice (4Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). PPARγ was shown to be necessary and sufficient to promote adipocyte differentiation (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3112) Google Scholar, 6Masugi J. Tamori Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies revealed that targeted activation of PPARδ in mice resulted in complete resistance to both high fat diet-induced and genetically predisposed obesity (7Wang Y.X. Lee C.H. Tiep S. Yu R.T. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R. Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of PPARs is clearly a critical mechanism by which PPAR agonists function. Recently, both PPARα and γ ligands were shown to activate members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (8Rokos C.L. Ledwith B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13452-13457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Mounho B.J. Thrall B.D. Toxicol. Appl.

Chem. 2003; 278: 263-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This event occurred at times too rapid to account for new protein synthesis, suggesting that these agonists also exert PPAR-independent effects. Although these “nongenomic” effects of PPAR ligands are contradictory to the classical mechanism of steroid hormone action, additional studies have illustrated that a variety of such compounds (e.g. progesterone, estrogen, and vitamin D) evoke similar rapid changes in kinase-mediated signal transduction pathways that contribute to their biological mechanism of action (12Losel R. Wehling M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments have revealed that PPARα and γ can be phosphorylated by some (α) or all three (γ) of the well known mammalian MAPKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) leading to modulation of transcriptional activity (13Juge-Aubry C.E. Hammar E. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Pernin A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Burger A.G. Meier C.A. J. Biol.

Transcriptional changes induced by PPARα and γ agonists can also be dissociated into distinct MAPK- and PPAR-dependent pathways (17Baek S.J. Wilson L.C. Hsi L.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5845-5853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that MAPKs alone mediate some of the cellular effects of PPAR ligands. Thus, kinase activation by PPAR agonists appears to play an important role in the mechanism of action of these compounds; yet few studies have investigated how PPAR agonists stimulate MAPKs. A classical mechanism for Erk activation is dependent upon the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (18Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Binding of an extracellular ligand (i.e. EGF) to the EGFR increases receptor autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues, which is followed by activation of Ras as well as Ras-dependent downstream kinase signaling cascades. Interestingly, recent reports showed that an EGFR kinase inhibitor blocked Erk activation by the PPARα agonist Wy-14,643 (19Pauley C.J. Ledwith B.J. Kaplanski C. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting possible cross-talk between EGFR and PPAR ligand-induced signaling. In addition to its role in relaying EGF-dependent signals to the cytosol, the EGFR has recently emerged as a critical transducer of intracellular signals in the absence of physiological ligands (20Zwick E. Hackel P.O. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Graves L.M. Han J. Earp H.S. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This ligand-independent EGFR “transactivation” has been implicated as a central integrator by which multiple endogenous and synthetic compounds activate intracellular kinases leading to a variety of cellular responses. In the present study, we provide evidence that PPARα and γ ligands induce ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation or transactivation in a liver epithelial cell line. EGFR phosphorylation appears to require the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, involves reactive oxygen species, and leads to downstream activation of Erk but not p38 MAPK. Collectively, these data depict a novel mechanism by which PPARα and γ agonists activate MAPKs and identify the EGFR as a key initiator of the mechanism of action of these compounds. Materials—Nafenopin (Ciba-Geigy) is a nonfibrate hypolipidemic PPARα agonist. The thiazolidinediones ciglitazone and troglitazone (Biomol) are PPARγ ligands. These compounds were prepared as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide. Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Invitrogen. PD153035, PP2, and PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem. ZD1839, synthesized as described previously (23Gibson, K. H. (June 23, 1998) U. S. Patent 5, 770, 599Google Scholar), was provided by David Rusnak of GlaxoSmithKline. U0126 was purchased from Promega, and BAPTA-AM was from Molecular Probes. MK886 and GM6001 were from Biomol, and 2-chloro-5-nitrobenzanilide was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Dexamethasone, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, glutathione, and 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-Erk monoclonal antibody (E-4), anti-Erk polyclonal antibody (C-14), anti-p38 polyclonal antibody (C-20-G), anti-Src monoclonal antibody (B-12), and anti-phosphotyrosine (pan) (PY99) monoclonal antibody were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Anti-Pyk2 monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-EGFR C-terminal polyclonal antibody (#22) and anti-Pyk2 C-terminal polyclonal antibody (#72) were generated as previously described (24Li X.L. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25Yu H. Li X.L. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

Cell Culture—Rat liver epithelial cells, GN4, were grown in Richter's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B as described previously (26Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X.L. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ras(N17) stable integrated GN4 cell lines were established as detailed elsewhere (24Li X.L. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Prior to experiments, cells at 70–80% confluency were serum-starved overnight in Richter's minimum essential medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. In certain experiments, Ras(N17) expression was induced at the time of serum starvation with 1 μm dexamethasone. Similarly, depletion of PKC was achieved by overnight treatment of cells with 5 μm 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Cell Lysate Preparation—Following stimulation for the times indicated, media was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then scraped into ice-cold RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 9.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) with freshly added 200 μm Na3VO4, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 nm microcysteine. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Immunoblotting—In a typical experiment, 10 μg of cell lysate was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature proteins. The lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE on Novex precast 10% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (Immobilon-P; Millipore). The immunoblots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBST, and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were then developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat Blue film). In certain instances, the membranes were stripped in buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 55 °C for 30 min and reprobed with another antibody. Immunoprecipitation—Following stimulation, the cells were rinsed as described above and scraped into ice-cold RIPA buffer without SDS. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation. 500 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the antibody overnight at 4 °C under slight agitation. Twenty μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to each sample, which were then incubated an additional hour at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and washed four times in ice-cold lysis buffer. The remaining wash buffer was carefully removed with a Hamilton syringe; the immune complexes were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. In Vitro Src Kinase Assay—Src kinase activity in stimulated GN4 cells was measured using a commercial Src assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, Src was immunoprecipitated as described above from 200 μg of cell lysate by overnight incubation with an anti-Src antibody (B-12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Src activity present in immune complexes was assessed by measuring the transfer of the γ-phosphate of [γ-32P]ATP to a specific Src substrate peptide for 10 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated substrate was then separated from residual [γ-32P]ATP using P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) and quantified with a scintillation counter. PPAR Ligands Activate Erk and p38 MAPK in GN4 Cells: Role of the EGFR—A rat liver epithelial cell line (GN4) was used to investigate the effects of PPAR ligands on MAPK activation. This cell line was used previously by our laboratory to examine the role of the EGFR and other kinases (e.g. prolinerich tyrosine kinase or Pyk2, also known as calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase/related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase/cell adhesion kinase β) in mediating angiotensin II-induced cell signaling (24Li X.L.

In addition, the hepato-specific effects of PPARα ligands are well documented, and the liver is considered to be a target organ for the insulin-sensitizing actions of thiazolidinediones (4Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 27Chao L.

Invest. 2000; 106: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar); thus, GN4 cells provided a model cell line for use in the current study. Treatment of GN4 cells with either the PPARα agonist nafenopin (Fig. 1A) or the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone (Fig. 1B) caused transient stimulation of Erk that reached a peak at 10 min and declined thereafter to basal levels over 45 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Both nafenopin and ciglitazone also transiently activated p38; however, the time course for p38 activation differed from that of Erk with maximal phosphorylation in response to nafenopin appearing 10–30 min after stimulation, whereas ciglitazone-induced p38 activation peaked between 5 and 10 min. MAPK activation by nafenopin and ciglitazone was also concentration-dependent over a 20–100 μm range (data not shown). Similar to ciglitazone, the PPARγ agonist troglitazone (Fig. 1C) induced p38 phosphorylation; in contrast, however, troglitazone was a weaker activator of Erk (Fig. 2C). Thus, these data demonstrate that both PPARα and γ agonists are capable of activating Erk and p38 in GN4 cells.Fig. 2PPARα and γ ligands rapidly activate Erk and p38 MAPKs in GN4 cells. Rat liver epithelial cells (GN4) were grown to near confluency and starved overnight in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. The cells were stimulated with 50 μm nafenopin (A), 50 μm ciglitazone (B), 50 μm troglitazone (C), or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1%) as a vehicle control for the indicated times. The cell lysates were prepared and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Activated Erk and p38 were detected by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-phospho-Erk and anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. The blots were then stripped and reprobed using antibodies directed against total Erk and p38, respectively. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Erk activation by the PPARα ligand Wy-14,643 was previously shown to be blocked by a nonspecific EGFR kinase inhibitor (19Pauley C.J. Ledwith B.J. Kaplanski C. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of the EGFR in MAPK activation by PPARα and γ ligands in GN4 cells, the ability of these compounds to activate Erk and p38 in the presence of specific EGFR kinase inhibitors, PD153035 and ZD1839, was evaluated. Pretreatment with either PD153035 or ZD1839 blocked EGF-induced Erk phosphorylation as expected (Fig. 3). Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR kinase activity also abolished nafenopin and ciglitazone-induced Erk activation. In contrast, EGFR kinase inhibition had no effect on p38 activation by these ligands. Taken together, these findings suggest that MAPK phosphorylation by PPAR ligands occurs via EGFR kinase-dependent as well as EGFR kinase-independent pathways. PPAR Agonists Induce EGFR Phosphorylation—The ability of a specific EGFR kinase inhibitor to prevent Erk activation by PPARα and γ ligands suggested that these compounds directly affect EGFR phosphorylation status and kinase activity. To test this hypothesis, EGFR phosphorylation in response to PPAR agonists was assessed. Immunoprecipitation of the EGFR followed by immunoblotting with a pan anti-phosphotyrosine antibody showed that treatment of GN4 cells with nafenopin and ciglitazone induced EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, these compounds displayed different potencies for activating the EGFR, with ciglitazone being much stronger than nafenopin. The time course for EGFR phosphorylation was rapid (∼5–10 min; data not shown) and closely resembled that observed for Erk activation, supporting our data that activation of Erk requires the EGFR. Indeed, pretreatment of GN4 cells with PD153035 or ZD1839 abolished receptor phosphorylation in response to nafenopin and ciglitazone (Fig. 4B). In comparison, troglitazone failed to significantly increase EGFR activation. This finding is consistent with its weaker effects on Erk activation. Ras Acts Downstream of EGFR to Mediate Erk but Not p38 Activation—Erk is known to be activated by both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent pathways in GN4 cells (24Li X.L. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In support of Ras-dependent Erk activation, PPAR agonists increased EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068 (data not shown), the major Grb2-binding site within the EGFR (28Batzer A. Rotin D. Urena J. EY S. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine whether Ras is required for PPARα and γ ligand-induced Erk activation, GN4 cells (S19) expressing a dominant negative form of Ha-Ras, Ras(N17), under the control of an inducible promoter, were used as described previously (24Li X.L. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To verify that induction of Ras(N17) in GN4.S19 cells was sufficient to interfere with endogenous Ras signaling, EGF-dependent Erk activation was assessed. As expected, EGF caused robust Erk phosphorylation in cells in the absence of Ras(N17) induction (Fig. 5A). In contrast, induction of Ras(N17) via dexamethasone pretreatment blocked EGF-dependent Erk activation. To determine whether Ras is required for MAPK activation by PPARα and γ ligands, MAPK phosphorylation was examined in GN4.S19 cells pretreated with or without dexamethasone. Although EGFR activation was unaffected (data not shown), induction of Ras(N17) prevented Erk phosphorylation by nafenopin and ciglitazone (Fig. 5A). This result suggests that PPAR ligands activate Erk through a Ras-dependent pathway in GN4 cells. In contrast, Ras(N17) had no effect on p38 phosphorylation by these compounds. To provide additional evidence that PPARα and γ agonist-induced Erk and p38 activation are triggered via Ras-dependent and independent pathways, respectively, MAPK phosphorylation in response to these ligands was determined in the presence of U0126, a MAPK kinase inhibitor. In agreement with the Ras(N17) data, U0126 inhibited Erk activation by nafenopin and ciglitazone (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, p38 phosphorylation was unaffected by U0126. Although PKC-dependent, Ras-independent signals have been implicated in Erk activation in GN4 cells (24Li X.L. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect PKC activation in response to PPARα and γ agonists. In addition, PKC down-regulation had no effect on Erk phosphorylation (data not shown). These data suggest that Erk activation by PPAR ligands is PKC-independent and supports our finding that Erk phosphorylation requires Ras. Role of Src in EGFR Activation by PPAR Ligands—Recent studies have revealed a central role for the EGFR in mediating MAPK activation in response to a variety of nonligands through a mechanism known as transactivation (21Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 29Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 30Luttrell L. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms have been shown to mediate EGFR transactivation, and they are largely dependent upon the particular stimulus. One potential mechanism responsible for EGFR transactivation involves the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src. Specifically, Src has been shown to directly phosphorylate the EGFR at Tyr845 and Tyr1101, leading to receptor activation (31Biscardi J.S. Maa M.-C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.-H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that recognizes the EGFR when phosphorylated at Tyr845, we observed that both nafenopin and ciglitazone induced phosphorylation of the EGFR at this site, whereas treatment with troglitazone did not (Fig. 6A and data not shown). To further determine the role of Src in PPARα and γ agonist-induced EGFR phosphorylation, the ability of"

In mammalian cells, Mre11/Rad50 (M/R) associates with a third component, Nbs1, that regulates its activities and is targeted by signaling pathways that initiate DNA damage-induced checkpoint responses. Mutations in the genes that encode Nbs1 and Mre11 are responsible for the human radiation sensitivity disorders Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder (ATLD), respectively, which are characterized by defective checkpoint responses and high levels of chromosomal abnormalities. Here we demonstrate nucleotide-dependent DNA binding by the human M/R complex that requires the Nbs1 protein and is specific for double-strand DNA duplexes. Efficient DNA binding is only observed with non-hydrolyzable analogs of ATP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis normally effects DNA release. The alleles of MRE11 associated with ATLD and the C-terminal Nbs1 polypeptide associated with NBS were expressed with the other components and found to form triple complexes except in the case of ATLD 3/4, which exhibits variability in Nbs1 association. The ATLD 1/2, ATLD 3/4, and p70 M/R/N complexes exhibit nucleotide-dependent DNA binding and exonuclease activity equivalent to the wild-type enzyme, although the ATLD complexes both show reduced activity in endonuclease assays. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the recombinant human complexes indicates that Mre11 is a stable dimer, Mre11 and Nbs1 form a 1:1 complex, and both M/R and M/R/N form large multimeric assemblies of ∼1.2 MDa.

The mre11 and rad50 mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were originally named for the deficiencies in meiotic recombination and ionizing radiation survival observed in mutant strains (1Game J.C.

Homologs of Mre11 and Rad50 have been identified in every organism that has been genetically characterized, as well as some bacteriophage, indicating that the functions of the complex are fundamental to DNA transactions. Proteins analogous to the Xrs2 component have not been identified in prokaryotes or archaebacteria, however, suggesting that this part of the complex is unique to eukaryotic cells. In mammals, the Mre11 and Rad50 proteins associate with a protein called Nbs1 (also nibrin and p95) (16Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H.

Nbs1 has little if any sequence similarity to Xrs2, but has clinical significance because mutations in the NBS1 gene have been identified as causal factors in the human autosomal recessive genetic disorder Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) (17Varon R. Vissinga C. Platzer M. Cerosaletti K.M. Chrzanowska K.H. Saar K. Beckmann G. Seemanova E. Cooper P.R. Nowak N.J. Stumm M. Weemaes C.M. Gatti R.A. Wilson R.K. Digweed M. Rosenthal A. Sperling K. Concannon P. Reis A. Cell. 1998; 93: 467-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Patients with NBS exhibit radiation sensitivity, immune system deficiency, and a high rate of malignancy (18Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 635-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, abnormalities include a defective S-phase checkpoint response and an elevated rate of chromosomal breakage and translocations, although few overt deficiencies in DNA repair are found. It was recently demonstrated that the most common NBS allele, 657del5, can generate a C-terminal polypeptide through the use of an internal ribosome entry site upstream of the 5-nucleotide deletion (19Maser R.S. Zinkel R. Petrini J.H. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This translation product (p70) is capable of binding Mre11; thus, the 657del5 NBS allele is very likely a hypomorphic allele that can supply a subset of the normal functions of Nbs1. The clinical presentation of NBS patients constitutes a subset of the phenotype of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), a related radiation sensitivity disorder. A-T is caused by mutations in the A-T-mutated gene (ATM), which encodes a large protein kinase that initiates DNA damage signaling in response to DNA double-strand breaks in eukaryotic cells. A biochemical connection between the two disorders was established with the demonstration that the ATM protein kinase phosphorylates the Nbs1 protein, in addition to many other targets, and that Nbs1 phosphorylation by ATM is essential for a normal S-phase checkpoint response (20Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 21Lim D.S. Kim S.T.

An additional connection between M/R/N and ATM arose with the identification of two families with A-T-like disorder (ATLD), clinically identical to A-T, yet caused by mutations in the MRE11 gene (24Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). The two known ATLD mutations are quite different; the ATLD 1/2 allele contains a premature stop codon resulting in a truncation of the C-terminal domain, whereas the ATLD 3/4 allele contains a missense mutation within the nuclease domain in the N terminus. The biochemical basis of the abnormalities seen in ATLD patients has not yet been elucidated. Using a recombinant baculovirus system, we have expressed the human Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 proteins together and found that they form a large protein complex that exhibits several distinct enzymatic activities on DNA substrates. The Mre11 protein contains highly conserved phosphoesterase motifs that are responsible for the manganese-dependent nuclease activities of M/R/N. By itself and in association with Rad50 and Nbs1, Mre11 exhibits a distributive, 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity on blunt and 3′ recessed ends (25Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 26Trujillo K.M. Yuan S.S. Lee E.Y. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21447-21450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), as well as a weak endonuclease activity on distorted DNA substrates such as hairpin structures. Association of Nbs1 with Mre11 stimulates the endonuclease function to act on hairpin structures and on 3′ overhangs (27Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), although Nbs1 itself has no apparent enzymatic activities. The Rad50 protein contains conserved Walker A and Walker B ATPase motifs that are closely related to the ABC transporter family of membrane-associated ATPases. A long coiled-coil region separates the N-terminal and C-terminal ATP binding domains, which are thought to associate with each other via intramolecular, antiparallel association of the coiled-coil region along its length, a hypothesis supported by microscopy data and by analogy with the SMC family of related coiled-coil proteins (28de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C.

M/R can catalyze a limited DNA unwinding reaction on DNA ends that is stimulated by ATP and also requires Nbs1 (27Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the catalytic cores of Mre11 and Rad50 homologs from the archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus illuminate the essential components of the active sites for both the phosphoesterase and the ATPase (31Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 32Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D. Fairley C. Tainer J.A. Carney J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6036-6041Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with the P. furiosus Rad50 protein also indicated that ATP binding induced dimerization of the Walker A/Walker B catalytic unit, and that this dimerization interface promoted ATP-dependent DNA binding by the protein. S. cerevisiae Rad50 had previously been shown to exhibit nucleotide-dependent binding to DNA as well (33Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ATP-binding motifs of Rad50 in budding yeast have been shown to be equivalent to null mutations with respect to meiotic recombination, mitotic recombination, and growth rate (3Alani E. Padmore R. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 419-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), so ATP binding (and likely also hydrolysis) is essential to Rad50 function. In this study, we have investigated the nucleotide-dependent biochemical properties of the human M/R/N complex, focusing on the role of the Nbs1 protein. Nbs1 stimulates nucleotide-dependent DNA binding by Mre11/Rad50 (M/R), and these complexes are promoted and stabilized by the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. Nucleotide-bound M/R/N binds specifically to double-stranded DNA duplexes, but does not show an obvious preference for DNA ends. Association of Nbs1 with the rest of the complex is destabilized in one of the ATLD M/R/N complexes (ATLD 3/4) but not in the other (ATLD 1/2), but both ATLD complexes show reduced levels of endonuclease activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. The M/R/N(p70) complex exhibits enzymatic activities essentially equivalent to the wild-type enzyme. Finally, sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the complex shows that Mre11 is clearly a dimer in solution, whereas both M/R and M/R/N are extremely large protein assemblies of ∼1.2 MDa. Plasmid Expression Constructs—Baculovirus expression constructs for human Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 have been described previously (25Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar): pTP17, pTP11, and pTP36, respectively. The ATLD 1/2 allele of Mre11 was generated by PCR from pTP17, generating a 6-histidine tag and stop codon at arginine 633, to form pTP219. A bacmid was made from this plasmid using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen), to form pTP221. The ATLD 3/4 allele of Mre11 was generated using the QuikChange system (Stratagene), introducing the N117S mutation into pTP17 to make pTP131 and subsequently the bacmid form, pTP133. The S1202R version of Rad50 was also generated using QuikChange in the hRad50 gene in pFastBac1 to make pTP140, and the bacmid version, pTP141. The p70 version of Nbs1 was constructed in two steps. First, a 5-nucleotide deletion was made at position 657 in the Nbs1 gene using QuikChange to re-create the 657del5 Nbs1 allele. Second, an N-terminal truncated version of this allele was generated by PCR, using the ATG at position 602 of the original gene as the initiator codon. This version of Nbs1 was cloned into pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) without an affinity tag, generating pTP270 and the bacmid form, pTP271. GST-Nbs1 was constructed by insertion of the glutathione S-transferase gene from pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) into pTP36 (27Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) to create a fusion protein with GST at the N terminus of Nbs1. All of the alleles generated by PCR were sequenced in their entirety. Each of the bacmids was used to make recombinant baculovirus according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Substrate DNA—The substrate in the gel mobility shift assays and in the 3′ overhang cutting assay consisted of TP423 (CTGCAGGGTTTTTGTTCCAGTCTGTAGCACTGTGTAAGACAGGCCAGATC) annealed to TP424 (CACAGTGCTACAGACTGGAACAAAAACCCTGCAGTACTCTACTCATCTC). TP423 was labeled with 32P at the 5′ end for the gel mobility shift assays, or at the 3′ end for the 3′ overhang cutting assay. Labeling was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase on the 5′ end (New England Biolabs) using [γ-32P]ATP, or with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase on the 3′ end (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using [α-32P]cordycepin. The single-stranded DNA used in Fig. 2A consisted of labeled TP423 only. The plasmid DNA used as a competitor in Fig. 2 was a derivative of the topo 2.1 vector (Invitrogen), unrelated in sequence to the substrate oligonucleotides. The substrate used in Fig. 6A for the exonuclease assay consisted of TP74 annealed to TP124 (34Paull T.T. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6409-6414Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), with TP74 labeled with 32P at the 5′ end. The hairpin substrate consisted of TP355 (CATCCATGCCTACCTGAGTACCAGTAGCTACTGGTACTCAGGTAGGCATGGATGCCAGATCGAC), labeled with 32P at the 5′ end.Fig. 6Sedimentation equilibrium profiles for Mre11 (H217Y) (A), the Mre11(ATLD1/2)/Nbs1 complex (B), the Mre11/Rad50 complex (C), and the M/R/N triple complex (D) shown as a distribution of A 280 at equilibrium.

Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The mutant M/R/N complexes were purified using the same protocol as with the wild-type complex. All of the Mre11 proteins and Rad50 contain a C-terminal histidine tag. Nbs1 (wild-type and p70) expressed with Mre11 or with both Mre11 and Rad50 did not contain an affinity tag. GST-Nbs1 was expressed by itself in the baculovirus system and purified over a glutathione-Sepharose column, followed by ion exchange chromatography on Q Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). GST-Nbs1 eluted from the Q Sepharose at ∼0.2 m NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Pierce) and confirmed by comparison with protein standards in Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Western blotting of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 was performed with antibodies PC388 (Oncogene), MS-RAD10 (Genetex), and MS-NBS10 (Genetex), respectively, on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using standard immunoblotting techniques. Assay Conditions—Gel mobility shift assays were performed in a volume of 10 μl with 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.5 mm AMP-PNP or ATP as indicated, and 1 nm oligonucleotide substrate, with M/R/N complex added as indicated in the figure legends (between 20 and 120 ng, which is 1.7–10 nm assuming 1.2 × 106 g/mol for M/R/N). In Fig. 2 (B and C), unlabeled plasmid DNA or single-stranded DNA (TP423) was added to the reaction before the addition of protein. M/R/N was incubated with the DNA and other reaction components for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of 1 μl of 50% glycerol and separation on a 0.7% agarose, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) gel at 5.7 V/cm for 100 min. Gels were dried and analyzed using a phosphorimager (Amersham Biosciences). In the competitor assays, the amount of complex formed by M/R/N in the absence of competitor was considered 100%, and the decreases in complex formation relative to that amount were determined by quantitative phosphorimager analysis. Nuclease assays were performed in a volume of 10 μl with 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm manganese chloride, 1 nm oligonucleotide substrate, with M/R/N complex added as indicated at 20–25 nm (hairpin and 3′ overhang assays) or 2.0–2.5 nm (exonuclease assays). M/R/N was incubated with the DNA and other reaction components at 37 °C for 90 min (hairpin and 3′ overhang assays) or 15–30 min (exonuclease assays) before the addition of 1 μl of 2% SDS, 0.1 m EDTA. ATP (0.5 mm) was included in the 3′ overhang nuclease assays as indicated in Fig. 5C. Reactions were lyophilized, resuspended in 7 μl of formamide loading buffer, separated on a denaturing, 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gel, and analyzed by phosphorimager. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 protein complexes were dialyzed overnight against buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) (Mre11) or buffer B (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) (Mre11/Rad50, Mre11 ATLD 1/2/Nbs1 and Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) at 4 °C. Samples were loaded and studied at nominal loading concentrations of 0.35 (Mre11), 0.11 (Mre11/Rad50), 0.31 (Mre11 ATLD1/2/Nbs1), and 0.08–0.20 (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) A 280. In the case of the double (Mre11/Rad50) and triple complexes loaded at 0.11 and 0.08 A 280, respectively, data were also collected at shorter wavelengths of 230 and 225 nm. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 4.0 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Mre11 samples were studied at 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000 rpm. Complexes of Mre11 with Rad50 and with both Nbs1 and Rad50 were studied at rotor speeds of 3,000, 3,500, and 4,000 rpm, whereas complexes of Mre11 ATLD1/2 with Nbs1 were studied at rotor speeds of 6,000, 7,000, and 8,000 rpm. Data were acquired as an average of eight absorbance measurements at 280 nm and a radial spacing of 0.001 cm. Scans were collected at 6-h intervals until equilibrium was reached. Data were analyzed in terms of a single ideal solute to obtain the buoyant molecular mass, M 1(1 – vρ), using the Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman, Microcal Origin 3.78). In the case of Mre11 ATLD1/2 with Nbs1, data were analyzed in terms of two non-interacting solutes. Residuals were calculated. A random distribution of the residuals around zero was obtained as a function of the radius. A global analysis in terms of a single ideal solute performed in Sigma Plot 2001 as described (49Ghirlando R. Keown M.B. Mackay G.A. Lewis M.S. Unkeless J.C. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13320-13327Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) yields similar results. Values of the molecular mass, M, were obtained from the buoyant molecular mass, M 1(1 – vρ), and calculated using densities, ρ, at 4.0 °C obtained from standard tables. Values of v = 0.7303, 0.7326, and 0.7339 ml g–1 were calculated for Mre11, ATLD1/2, and Nbs1, respectively, based on the amino acid composition using consensus data for the partial specific molar volumes of amino acids (50Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 15: 169-180Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Otherwise, a consensus protein value of 0.73 ml g–1 was utilized. Nucleotide-dependent DNA Binding by M/R/N—The crystallographic structure of the P. furiosus Rad50 enzyme suggested that heterodimeric Rad50 catalytic domains further dimerize into a tetrameric unit in the presence of ATP (31Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). This change in multimeric state, stabilized by ATP, was hypothesized to facilitate DNA binding by the enzyme. Rad50 from S. cerevisiae has also been reported to bind DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (33Raymond W.E. Kleckner N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3851-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Despite this compelling evidence, we have not observed any significant ATP dependence in DNA binding by the human M/R/N enzyme (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5 and data not shown). When we measured DNA binding by wild-type M/R/N in the presence of magnesium and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP, however, we observed ∼20–40-fold higher levels of DNA binding compared with reactions with ATP or without added nucleotides (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 7). The protein concentrations used here are 2–3-fold lower than the concentrations previously used to demonstrate M/R/N binding of DNA in the absence of nucleotides (27Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We have also observed a similar phenomenon with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS, and in each case, magnesium is absolutely required for formation of the protein-DNA complex (data not shown). We also tested subcomplexes of M/R/N for AMP-PNP-dependent DNA binding and found that Mre11/Rad50 (M/R) was incapable of binding DNA under these conditions, suggesting that the presence of Nbs1 in the complex is necessary for nucleotide-dependent DNA binding (Fig. 1B). We confirmed this to be the case by performing DNA-binding assays with M/R plus varying amounts of GST-Nbs1, which was expressed and purified in the absence of Mre11 and Rad50. As shown in Fig. 1C, the addition of GST-Nbs1 restored AMP-PNP-dependent DNA binding to the M/R complex (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6), yet did not exhibit any DNA-binding capability alone (lane 7). The Rad50 protein is the only component of the complex that contains ATP-binding motifs and is therefore the likely source of nucleotide-dependent DNA binding by M/R/N. To confirm this, we expressed a mutant form of Rad50 containing a single amino acid change (S1202R) that is equivalent to the mutation made in the P. furiosus enzyme (S793R), which was previously shown to abolish ATP-driven dimerization of the ATP-binding domain (31Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The S1202R Rad50 mutant in association with wild-type Mre11 and Nbs1 failed to bind DNA in the presence of AMP-PNP, verifying that the ATP-binding domain of the Rad50 protein is required for the protein-DNA complex observed with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1D). The AMP-PNP-dependent M/R/N complex is only formed on double-stranded DNA duplexes and not on single-stranded oligonucleotides, as shown in Fig. 2A. Addition of increasing amounts of M/R/N to the labeled double-stranded DNA in the presence of magnesium and AMP-PNP actually generates two types of protein-DNA complex; the low mobility species previously indicated (complex I), and a higher mobility species that migrates close to the unbound DNA (complex II). Formation of each complex is highly cooperative, normally appearing at a threshold of ∼30–60 ng of M/R/N per 10-μl reaction (equivalent to 2.5–5nm, considering a molecular mass of 1.2 MDa). The relative amounts of labeled DNA in the two species do not change with increasing M/R/N concentration, although the mobility of both complexes decreases, suggesting that more protein can be incorporated into each complex with additional M/R/N. Under these conditions, essentially 100% of the DNA is incorporated into one or the other of these forms, with a majority of the DNA in complex II. Preliminary off-rate experiments suggest that complex I has an off-rate on the order of several minutes, whereas the off-rate of complex II is less than 30 s (data not shown). Competition studies with M/R/N on DNA duplexes indicated that both linear and uncut plasmid DNA could compete effectively with short DNA duplexes for M/R/N binding in complex I (Fig. 2B). Thus, DNA ends are not essential for nucleotide-dependent binding by M/R/N. Single-stranded oligonucleotide (Fig. 2B) and tRNA (data not shown) did not compete for binding. In contrast, single-stranded DNA was able to partially compete with the double-stranded duplex in complex II (Fig. 2C), indicating that complex II is less specific for duplex DNA. Mre11 protein alone is capable of forming a complex similar to complex II in gel mobility shift assays (27Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes"
https://openalex.org/W2119021831,"We found a novel human glycosyltransferase gene carrying a hypothetical β1,4-glycosyltransferase motif during a BLAST search, and we cloned its full-length open reading frame by using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. It encodes a type II transmembrane protein of 999 amino acids with homology to chondroitin sulfate synthase in its C-terminal region (GenBank™ accession number AB089940). Its putative orthologous gene was also found in mouse (accession number AB114826). The truncated form of the human enzyme was expressed in HEK293T cells as a soluble protein. The recombinant enzyme transferred GalNAc to GlcNAc β-benzyl. The product was deduced to be GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAcβ-benzyl based on mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. We renamed the enzyme β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-III (β4GalNAc-T3). β4GalNAc-T3 effectively synthesized N,N′-diacetylgalactosediamine, GalNAcβ1–4GlcNAc, at non-reducing termini of various acceptors derived not only from N-glycans but also from O-glycans. Quantitative real time PCR analysis showed that its transcript was highly expressed in stomach, colon, and testis. As some glycohormones contain N,N′-diacetylgalactosediamine structures in their N-glycans, we examined the ability of β4GalNAc-T3 to synthesize N,N′-diacetylgalactosediamine structures in N-glycans on a model protein. When fetal calf fetuin treated with neuraminidase and β1,4-galactosidase was utilized as an acceptor protein, β4GalNAc-T3 transferred GalNAc to it. Furthermore, the majority of the signal from GalNAc disappeared on treatment with glycopeptidase F. These results suggest that β4GalNAc-T3 could transfer GalNAc residues, producing N,N′-diacetylgalactosediamine structures at least in N-glycans and probably in both N- and O-glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2115594128,"When the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum infects erythrocytes, proteins associated with host-derived detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) rafts are selectively recruited into the newly formed vacuole, but parasite proteins that contribute to raft-based vacuole development are unknown. In mammalian cells, DRM-associated integral membrane proteins such as caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 that form oligomers have been linked to the formation of DRM-based invaginations called caveolae. Here we show that the P. falciparum genome does not encode caveolins or flotillins but does contain an orthologue of human band 7 stomatin, a protein known to oligomerize, associate with non-caveolar DRMs and is distantly related to flotillins. Stomatins are members of a large protein family conserved in evolution and P. falciparum (Pf) stomatin appears to be a prokaryotic-like molecule. Evidence is presented that it associates with DRMs and may oligomerize, suggesting that these features are conserved in the stomatin family. Further, Pfstomatin is an integral membrane protein concentrated at the apical end of extracellular parasites, where it co-localizes with invasion-associated rhoptry organelles. A resident rhoptry protein, RhopH2 also resides in DRMs. This provides the first evidence that rhoptries of an apicomplexan parasite contain DRM rafts. Further, when the parasite invades erythrocytes, rhoptry Pfstomatin and RhopH2 are inserted into the newly formed vacuole. Thus, like caveolin-1 and flotillin-1, a stomatin may also associate with non-clathrin coated, DRM-enriched vacuoles.

We propose a new model of invasion and vacuole formation involving DRM-based interactions of both host and parasite molecules. Plasmodium falciparum is an apicomplexan parasite that causes the most virulent form of human malaria. During the blood stages of infection, it invades mature human erythrocytes and develops within a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM). 1The abbreviations used are: PVMparasite vacuolar membraneDRMdetergent-resistant membraneSLP-2stomatin-like protein 2GFPgreen fluorescent proteinDOPCdioleyl l-α-phosphatidylcholinePPMparasite plasma membraneMSP-1merozoite surface protein 1Mes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline. These host cells are enucleated, have no intracellular organelles and under steady-state conditions have no dedicated machinery for endocytosis of their plasma membrane (1Schrier S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 149: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Yet electron microscopy studies suggest that the nascent vacuole induced by Plasmodium is formed by an invagination of the erythrocyte membrane (2Bannister L.H. Mitchell G.H. J. Protozool. 1989; 36: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although major erythrocyte proteins are excluded from the PVM, proteins that reside in buoyant cholesterol-rich detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) rafts concentrate in the vacuole (3Nagao E. Seydel K.B. Dvorak J.A. Exp. Parasitol. 2002; 102: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 4Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, mild depletion of erythrocyte cholesterol that has no significant effect on major erythrocyte membrane function but disrupts DRM rafts, blocks malarial infection (5Samuel B.U. Mohandas N. Harrison T. McManus H. Rosse W. Reid M. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29319-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that DRM rafts play a role in membrane curvature (6Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell.

Together these studies imply that PVM formation may involve recruitment of erythrocyte DRM components induced by P. falciparum (9Haldar K. Mohandas N. Samuel B.U. Harrison T. Hiller N.L. Akompong T. Cheresh P. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, parasite molecules and mechanisms contributing to raft-based vacuole biogenesis remain unknown. parasite vacuolar membrane detergent-resistant membrane stomatin-like protein 2 green fluorescent protein dioleyl l-α-phosphatidylcholine parasite plasma membrane merozoite surface protein 1 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline. Malarial infection of the erythrocyte is initiated by the extracellular merozoite stage. As the merozoite enters, it appears to release content from apical secretory organelles into the junction of invasion: specifically, contents of organelles called rhoptries are thought to be delivered to the newly forming vacuole. This is seen in both Plasmodium as well as the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (reviewed in Refs. 10Berzins K. Chem Immunol. 2002; 80: 125-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 11Blackman M.J. Bannister L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, studies have suggested that the vacuolar membrane is derived mostly from lipids of the apical organelles (12Dluzewski A.R. Mitchell G.H. Fryer P.R. Griffiths S. Wilson R.J. Gratzer W.B. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 527-532PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dluzewski A.R. Zicha D. Dunn G.A. Gratzer W.B. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 446-449PubMed Google Scholar). In T. gondii the current model suggests that the newly formed PVM is extensively modified by fusion of rhoptry-derived secretory vesicles (14Hakansson S. Charron A.J. Sibley L.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3132-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, the contents of the rhoptries are thought to play a critical role in formation of the PVM, but direct evidence that rhoptry proteins insert into the new vacuolar bilayer and insight into their membrane properties have been lacking. Further, although homologues of apical proteins that contribute to plasmodial entry are found in T. gondii (reviewed in Ref. 11Blackman M.J. Bannister L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), none appear to be related to known proteins identified in other eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. Thus, other than host cell adhesion, it has been difficult to gain insight into the membrane properties of apicomplexan apical organellar proteins, especially those of the rhoptries that may contribute to vacuole biogenesis. The best-defined, raft-based plasma membrane invaginations in mammalian cells are caveolae (reviewed in Ref. 15Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). These structures are non-clathrin-coated, implicated in a variety of signaling processes and have been shown to be specialized forms of DRM rafts (reviewed in Ref. 15Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). A prominent resident DRM raft protein of caveolae is caveolin-1, which is integrally associated with the cytoplasmic face of caveolae (16Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11193-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this protein is sufficient to induce caveolae in cells (20Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K.

The protein flotillin-1, which is DRM-associated and forms oligomers has also been shown to induce caveolae formation in cells that do not express caveolin-1 (25Volonte D. Galbiati F. Li S.

Forgett B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26358-26363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, despite its name, stomatin is not linked to stomatocytosis (31Zhu Y.

Further, although multiple stomatin orthologues have been identified and linked to the regulation of channels in Caenorhabditis elegans, the precise function of stomatins is still unknown (32Huang M. Gu G. Ferguson E. Chafle M. Nature. 1995; 378: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 33Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J.

Nature. 2002; 415: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Recent, cumulative evidence suggests that band 7 stomatin may modulate membrane functions especially those in DRM rafts (reviewed in Ref. 38Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), but whether DRM association is a conserved property of the stomatin family and whether stomatins reside at the cytoplasmic face of endovacuolar membranes to nucleate rafts remains unknown. Here we show that the P. falciparum genome encodes an orthologue of band 7 stomatin (designated Pfstomatin), but not of caveolins or flotillins. Pfstomatin is most similar to stomatin-like protein-2 (SLP-2) (39Wang Y. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a prokaryotic-like orthologue of band 7 stomatin that is also expressed in mammalian erythrocytes. Both Pfstomatin and SLP-2, like stomatin, associate with DRM rafts. In the extracellular merozoite stage, Pfstomatin co-localizes with rhoptries. Along with another rhotpry DRM protein it is delivered to the cytoplasmic face of the PVM induced by infection. On the basis of these results we propose a new model of PVM biogenesis where movement of DRM raft proteins from parasite rhoptries as well as DRM-associated host erythrocyte proteins underlie vacuolar development in the erythrocyte. Culturing and Synchronization of P. falciparum—The P. falciparum 3D7 line was cultured as previously described (40Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar, 41Haldar K. Ferguson M.A. Cross G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4969-4974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary, parasite growth was synchronized to within a 4-h window by using a 65% Percoll gradient (Amersham Biosciences) and sorbitol (42Haldar K. Elmendorf H.G. Das A. Li W.L. Ferguson D.J. Elford B.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 221-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cloning of Pfstomatin—The 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides ATGAACACTTTTTTTTTAAGTAGATTTAG and CTCGAGGTTGTTCATATCAGAATGAATTTG were used in a PCR reaction to amplify the complete open reading frame of Pfstomatin (accession number NP_473293) from a cDNA library made from asexual parasites. The PCR reaction was performed using PWO enzyme (Roche Applied Science), and initiated with five cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 45 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C to allow for annealing of highly A/T rich primers; followed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 61 °C, and 1 min 45 s at 72 °C. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into pGEM-T cloning vector (Invitrogen). Phylogenetic and Sequence Analysis—Blast and PSI-Blast searches against the non-redundant protein sequence database, using Pfstomatin as a query, were used to identify orthologues of Pfstomatin. For phylogenetic analyses, alignments of DNA or protein sequences were performed using ClustalW software (www.embnet.org), followed by manual editing. Using the PAUP program (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA), maximum parsimony with the branch and bound algorithm was used as a tree searching method in Fig. 1D, and distance (minimum evolution) was used in Fig. 1B. The statistical reliability of the branches was established by bootstrapping using 1000 repetitions. The TreeView program (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html) was used to visualize the unrooted trees. Sequences were checked for mitochondrial targeting signals using MitoPro II (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter). Production and Purification of a Recombinant Fragment of Pfstomatin—To produce a recombinant Pfstomatin C-terminal fragment, the full-length DNA sequence was amplified and directionally cloned into pET29c (to produce a protein that contains an N-terminal S-tag and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag) using 5′-end NcoI and 3′-end XhoI, and transformed into the BL21 Codon Plus (DE3) RIL cell line (Strategene). For protein expression, the transformed cells were grown in LB plus kanamycin (OD600 = 0.6). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Eppendorf) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were incubated for 4-6 h at 37 °C. Protein purification was performed using the Xpress System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were harvested, lysed in guanidinium lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.8), sonicated, and spun to remove insoluble debris. The supernatant was added to a pre-equilibrated nickel column. The column was washed multiple times with denaturing wash buffers (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride) at pH 8.0, pH 6.0, and pH 5.3. Recombinant Pfstomatin was eluted from the column using wash buffer at pH 4.0. The Bradford assay was used to measure the protein concentration of all fractions. Colloidal Coomassie staining of a 12% reducing SDS-PAGE gel was used to establish protein purity of peak fractions (Fig. 2Ai). Depending on the preparation, 90-95% of the total purified protein corresponded to an 18 kDa C-terminal fragment containing the last 161 residues of the 374 amino acid protein, as confirmed by protein sequencing (performed at the Medical College of Wisconsin). The N-terminal residue was methionine 214, which is marked with a blue dot in Fig. 1A, suggesting the presence of an internal initiation of translation start site. The remaining 5-10% of protein corresponded to full-length Pfstomatin (see 49-kDa band in Fig. 2Ai). To test whether Pfstomatin forms disulfide-linked oligomers, a preparation of the recombinant protein was subjected to a 12% SDS-PAGE gel in the presence and absence of 100 mm dithiothreiotol. The Western blot was probed with S-protein, which forms a high affinity interaction with the S-tag (Novagen), and only detects the full-length protein (Fig. 2Aii). The Western blot was probed with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and processed using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Production of Anti-Pfstomatin Polyclonal Antibody—Polyclonal rat serum was produced against preparations of recombinant Pfstomatin (that contained 95% of the 18-kDa C-terminal fragment and 5% full-length protein, see above and Fig. 2Ai). Rodents were inoculated four times, at 21-day intervals with 50 μg of protein mixed with Ribi MPL+TDM adjuvant (Ribi Immunochemical). Seven days following the last inoculation rodents were exsanguinated. An IgG fraction was obtained by dilution of sera 1:1 into wash/binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and affinity purification using a protein G-agarose column. After six washes in binding/wash buffer, bound antibody was eluted with 4 ml of 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0 and neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Purified rat antibody was used at a dilution of 1:250 in Western blots and at a dilution of 1:400 in indirect immunofluorescence assays. Fluorescence Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence assays were carried out by a modification of procedures described by Lauer et al. (4Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 and then resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml, and allowed to adhere to coverslips pre-coated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine in 5% sodium bicarbonate for 30 min at room temperature. After three 5-min washes in PBS, the cells were fixed in 1% or 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS or 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 0.2% fish skin gelatin in PBS. Cells were probed with the relevant primary antibodies (diluted 1:100 to 1:8000) and secondary antibodies in blocking solution. Mouse monoclonal anti-merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) was supplied by MR4, and mouse monoclonal anti-EXP1 was kindly supplied by Dr. J. McBride. In studies using Mito Tracker (Molecular Probes) cells were stained with 150 nm Mito Tracker for 45 min before fixation. For apicoplast localization, 3D7 cells transfected with pHRPACPGFP were used (43Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For all cells, parasite nuclei (blue) were stained by treatment with 10 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) for 10 min. High resolution image capture and processing was done as previously described (43Cheresh P. Harrison T. Fujioka H. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16265-16277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with an Olympus IX inverted fluorescent microscope and a Photometrix cooled CCD camera driven by Delta Vision software (Applied Precision Inc., Seattle, WA). Isolation of DRM Rafts—DRM rafts were isolated as previously described (4Lauer S. VanWye J. Harrison T. McManus H. Samuel B.U. Hiller N.L. Mohandas N. Haldar K.

Briefly, vacuolar parasites freed from the red cell membrane or uninfected erythrocytes were extracted on ice in 2 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl pH 7.4) for 30 min in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) containing a broad spectrum of serine, cysteine, and metalloprotease inhibitors as well as caspain and 1 mm EDTA. This extract was mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose and overlaid with 5 ml of 35% sucrose in TBS and 2 ml of 5% sucrose in TBS. The gradient was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g in a Beckman SW41 rotor for3hat4 °C. After centrifugation, the top 1 ml (corresponding to 5% sucrose) was collected as fraction 1, and sequential fractions 2 to 6 were collected as 2-ml aliquots. The Bradford assay was used to measure protein concentration and, where necessary, proteins were concentrated using acetone precipitation. Samples, containing between 5 and 80 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% gels under reducing conditions. For blotting the following primary antibodies were used: rat polyclonal anti-Pfstomatin, rabbit polyclonal anti-ERD2 (44Elmendorf H.G. Haldar K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-SLP-2 (39Wang Y. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8062-8071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-RhopH2 (45Ling I.T. Kaneko O. Narum D.L. Tsuboi T. Howell S. Taylor H.M. Scott-Finnigan T.J. Torii M. Holder A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 127: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal anti-MSP-1 produced against recombinant 19kDa MSP-1 (MR4). Finally, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used to probe the blot and membranes were processed using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Membrane Association of Pfstomatin—Synchronized late stage parasites (5 × 107 parasites at 36-48 h, see above) expressing cytosolic GFP (46Kadekoppala M. Kline K. Akompong T. Haldar K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2328-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were washed twice in PBS and treated in 0.01% saponin for 10 min to release parasites from the host erythrocyte membrane. Intact parasites were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS, and lysed in 100 volumes of water in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C. These lysates were supplemented with Na2CO3, NaCl, or water, such that they were at a final concentration of 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.3, or 0.5 m NaCl, or in water alone. Integral membrane proteins do not dissociate from the membrane even after a wash in Na2CO3 pH 11.3, while peripheral membrane proteins are released from the membrane after a wash in Na2CO3 pH 11.3 but not after a wash in NaCl. These samples were subjected to centrifugation at 214,000 × g for 1 h to collect the membrane fractions. Pellets and supernatants were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, subjected to 12% reducing SDS-PAGE, and probed in Western blots with rat anti-Pfstomatin and rabbit polyclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Clontech), followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Reconstitution of Recombinant Pfstomatin Fragment into Proteoliposomes—Liposomes were prepared with dioleoyl l-α-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (Sigma) or 1:1 molar ratios of DOPC and cholesterol (Sigma). After dissolving in chloroform and drying in N2, the lipids were resuspended in M/N buffer (20 mm Mes, 140 mm NaCl, pH 6.3) (47Murata M. Peranen J. Schreiner R. Wieland F. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10339-10343Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). This solution was sonicated in a water bath for 30 min at room temperature (temperatures were maintained above 23 °C and below 30 °C). M/N buffer was added to make a final solution of 2 μmol of lipid in 2 ml, and the preparation was subjected to centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (1 ml) containing liposomes was mixed with recombinant Pfstomatin (see above) at 250 μg/ml previously dialyzed into M/N buffer, 5 m urea, and 50 mm n-octyl glucoside (Sigma). A total of 10 μg of protein was slowly added to the lipid solution during continuous mixing over 10 min. This preparation was mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose/M/N buffer and overlaid with 3 ml of 35% sucrose in M/N buffer, 3 ml of 27% sucrose in M/N buffer, and 2 ml of 10% sucrose in M/N buffer. The sample was subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 4 h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, subjected to acetone precipitation and processed for a Western blot. The blot was probed using mouse monoclonal anti-histidine antibodies (Oncogene) and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and processed using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Selective Permeabilization of the Infected Red Cell Membrane Using Tetanolysin—Tetanolysin is a bacterial toxin that can be used to selectively permeabilize cellular plasma membranes (48Riese M.J.

Infected red cells (0-8-h post-invasion) were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips as described above. After 30 min they were treated with 40 μl of 50 units/ml of tetanolysin (List Biological Laboratories) for 30 min at 37 °C. Control cells were treated with tetanolysin as well as 40 μl of 0.01% saponin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in PBS for 5 min, blocked in 0.2% fish skin gelatin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. As a control for PVM permeabilization, cells were also probed with antibodies to MSP-1. Cells were washed 10 times for 2 min, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and quenched in NH4Cl for 10 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS for 5 min, permeabilized in 0.05% saponin in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and incubated with 1:200 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibodies for1hat room temperature. Finally cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, and samples were subjected to high resolution fluorescence microscopy. Identification of a Stomatin Orthologue in the P. falciparum Genome—A BLASTP search of the P. falciparum genome (49Bahl A. Brunk B. Coppel R.L. Crabtree J. Diskin S.J. Fraunholz M.J. Grant G.R.

https://openalex.org/W1972163091,"Overexpression of JNK binding domain inhibited glucose deprivation-induced JNK1 activation, relocalization of Daxx from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) oligomerization in human prostate adenocarcinoma DU-145 cells. However, SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, did not prevent relocalization of Daxx and oligomerization of ASK1 during glucose deprivation. Studies from in vivo labeling and immune complex kinase assay demonstrated that phosphorylation of Daxx occurred during glucose deprivation, and its phosphorylation was mediated through the ASK1-SEK1-JNK1-HIPK1 signal transduction pathway. Data from immunofluorescence staining and protein interaction assay suggest that phosphorylated Daxx may be translocated to the cytoplasm, bind to ASK1, and subsequently lead to ASK1 oligomerization. Mutation of Daxx Ser667 to Ala results in suppression of Daxx relocalization during glucose deprivation, suggesting that Ser667 residue plays an important role in the relocalization of Daxx. Unlike wild-type Daxx, a Daxx deletion mutant (amino acids 501–625) mainly localized to the cytoplasm, where it associated with ASK1, activated JNK1, and induced ASK1 oligomerization without glucose deprivation. Taken together, these results show that glucose deprivation activates the ASK1-SEK1-JNK1-HIPK1 pathway, and the activated HIPK1 is probably involved in the relocalization of Daxx from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) observed that Daxx activates ASK1 by displacing an inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the NH2 and COOH termini of the kinase, thereby opening up the kinase into an active conformation. Previous studies have also shown that ASK1 is located in the cytoplasm and Daxx is mainly located in the nucleus (13Ko Y.G. Kang Y.S. Park H. Seol W. Kim J. Kim T. Park H.S. Choi E.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39103-39106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It is well known that Daxx relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to stress (15Charette S.J. Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7602-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Thus, relocalization of Daxx is required prior to its interaction with ASK1. A fundamental question is what molecular change(s) regulate the relocalization of Daxx from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to stress? Here we provide a possibility that the initial activation of JNK1 during glucose deprivation induces Daxx relocalization through phosphorylation. The relocalized Daxx induces ASK1 oligomerization. Cell Culture and Glucose Deprivation—Human prostate adenocarcinoma (DU-145) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 26 mm sodium bicarbonate for monolayer cell culture. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and air at 37 °C. For glucose deprivation, cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then exposed to glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Shuttle Vector Construction—pFLAG-CMV2-Daxx was kindly provided by Dr. Horikoshi (Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology in Washington University, St. Louis, MO). pAdlox-FLAG-Daxx was made by inserting the SpeI/BamHI fragment from pFLAG-CMV2-Daxx into SpeI/BamHI-cut pAdlox shuttle vector (16Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Various Daxx deletion mutants FLAG-tagged at their N-terminal and restriction enzyme recognition sites at the flanking sides (5′, EcoRI; 3′, BamHI) were produced by PCR. For Daxx 1–625 (amino acids 1–625), sense primer was 5′-GAGCGAATTCAGCCACCGCTAACAGCATCATC-3′ and antisense primer was 5′-CTGCGGATCCCTAACCAGAATCTCCCCAGTTGTG-3′. For Daxx 1–500 (amino acids 1–500), sense primer was the same as that of Daxx 1–625, and antisense primer was 5′-CTATGGATCCCTACTGTAGTGAGGACATGGGGCTC-3′. For Daxx 501–625 (amino acids 501–625), sense primer was 5′-GCTCGAATTCAATCTCCAATG-AAAAGAACCTGG-3′, and antisense primer was the same as that of Daxx 1–625. For Daxx 626–739 (amino acids 626–739), sense primer was 5′-GGTTGAATTCACCCCCCTGCAAAAATCTCGG-3′, and antisense primer was 5′-CTATGGATCCCTAATCAGAGTCTGAGAGCAC-3′. pcDNA3.1/His A-Daxx was made by inserting the PCR product of Daxx digested with KpnI/EcoRI to KpnI/EcoRI-cut pcDNA3.1/His A. Sense primer was CTGTGGTACCTGCCACCGCTAACAGCATCATC-3′, and antisense primer was 5′-GACTGAATTCCTAATCAGAGTCTGAGAGCACG-3′. pAdlox-His-Daxx was made by inserting SpeI/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3.1-His A-Daxx into SpeI/EcoRI-cut pAdlox. pcDNA3-HA-ASK1 was kindly provided by Dr. Ichijo (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). pAdlox-HA-ASK1 was made by inserting the SpeI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-HA-ASK1 into XbaI-cut pAdlox. pcDNA3-Myc-ASK1 was made by inserting the PCR product of ASK1 to pcDNA3-Myc. Sense primer was 5′-ATTATACGTATAGCACGGAGGCGGACGAGGG-3′ introducing a SnaBI site, and antisense primer was 5′-CGCGTCTAGATCAAGTCTGTTTGTTTCGAAAGTCAATG-3′ introducing a XbaI site for inserting into pcDNA3-Myc (BamHI → Klenow → XbaI). pAdlox-Myc-ASK1 was made by inserting the SpeI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-Myc-ASK1 into SpeI/XbaI-cut pAdlox. pAdlox-FLAG-JBD was made by inserting the SpeI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-FLAG-JBD into SpeI/XbaI-cut pAdlox. pAdlox-His-JNK1 was also made by inserting the SpeI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3.1-His A-JNK1 into SpeI/XbaI-cut pAdlox. Adenoviral Vector Construction—All recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by employing the Cre-lox recombination system (16Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective cell line CRE8 has a β-actin-based expression cassette driving a Cre recombinase gene with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal stably integrated into 293 cells. Transfections were done by using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen). 5 × 105 cells were split into a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. For the production of recombinant adenovirus, 2 μg of SfiI/ApaI-digested Adlox/HA or Myc-ASK1 fragment or Adlox/FLAG-JBD or SfiI-digested Adlox/FLAG-Daxx including various Daxx deletion mutants or His-Daxx fragment or Adlox/His-JNK1 and 2 μg of Ψ5 viral genomic DNA were co-transfected into CRE8 cells. The recombinant adenoviruses were generated by intermolecular homologous recombination between the shuttle vector and Ψ5 viral DNA. A new virus has an intact packaging site and carries a recombinant gene. Plaques were harvested, analyzed, and purified. The insertion of HA-ASK1 or Myc-ASK1 or FLAG-JBD or various FLAG-Daxx or His-Daxx or His-JNK1 to adenovirus was confirmed by Western blot analysis, after infection of corresponding recombinant adenovirus into DU-145 cells. In Vivo Binding of ASK1 with Daxx—To examine the interaction between ASK1 and Daxx, adenovirus of HA-tagged ASK1 (Ad.HAASK1) and FLAG-tagged Daxx (Ad.FLAG-Daxx) at an MOI of 10 were co-infected into DU-145 cells in 10-cm culture plates. For immunoprecipitation, after 48 h of infection, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 80 μm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, and the lysates were incubated with 3 μg of anti-FLAG M2 mouse IgG1 (Sigma) or 0.5 μg of rat anti-HA (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) for 2 h, respectively. After the addition of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the lysates were incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with rat anti-HA or mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science) antibodies or mouse anti-FLAG. Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the ECL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Immune Complex Kinase Assay and in Vivo Labeling—The PCR product of human Daxx having restriction enzyme sites at the flanking sides (5′, NdeI; 3′, BamHI) was produced using the pFLAG/CMV2-Daxx as a template. Sense primer was 5′-GCTGCATATGGCCACCGCTAACAGCATCATC-3′, and antisense primer was 5′-CTGCGGATCCCTAATCAGAGTCTGAGAGCAC-3′. pET15b/Daxx was made by inserting NdeI/BamHI fragment from Daxx PCR product into NdeI/BamHI-cut pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI). pET15b/Daxx was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS, and Daxx expression was confirmed by anti-Daxx (Sigma). His-Daxx was purified by using His-bind column (Novagen). For the immune complex kinase assay, DU-145 cells were infected with Ad.His-JNK1 at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were in glucose-free medium for 1 h and lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and protein G-agarose. The beads were washed twice with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution and washed once with the kinase buffer solution, and then they were subjected to kinase assays. To examine whether the Daxx was a direct substrate of JNK1, 1 μg of His-Daxx or GST-c-Jun was incubated with immunoprecipitated His-JNK1 in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, and 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 1 h. Finally, the reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. For direct [32P]orthophosphate labeling of His-Daxx, DU-145 cells were infected with Ad.His-Daxx at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were pre-equilibrated in phosphate-free medium for 3 h prior to the addition of 50 μCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate (ICN, Irvine, CA) in phosphate and glucose-free medium for 1 h and then lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-His antibody and protein G-agarose. The beads were washed three times with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution. The immune complex was separated by SDS-PAGE, and dried gel was visualized by autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS under reducing conditions, and the proteins in the gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with 7% (w/v) skim milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and then reacted with primary antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit anti-ACTIVE JNK was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Monoclonal mouse anti-actin antibody was purchased from ICN. After washing three times with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG. Then the proteins were detected with the ECL reagent. Immunofluorescence—Cellular localization of FLAG-Daxx (or His-Daxx) was investigated using fluorescence microscopy. The cells were plated onto a Lab-Tek chamber slide (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) and infected with Ad/FLAG-Daxx (or Ad/His-Daxx) at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were fixed in 100% cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. After washing twice with cold PBS, the cells were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin plus 10% rabbit or goat serum (depending on the source of second antibody) for 1 h at room temperature. They were then incubated with anti-FLAG (clone M2; mouse) or anti-His (penta-His; mouse) antibodies containing 1% bovine serum albumin plus 10% rabbit or goat serum for1hat room temperature, followed by three washes with cold PBS. Samples of FLAG-Daxx (or His-Daxx) were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. After washing three times with cold PBS, the slides were mounted in 90% glycerol. Production of HIPK1 Protein—To prepare HIPK1 substrate proteins for kinase assay, a plasmid containing GST-HIPK1 was constructed in the EcoRI/SmaI site of pGEX-4T-2 by inserting the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3.1Myc.His-HIPK1 (kindly provided by P. Leder (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA). pGEX-4T-2/HIPK1 was transformed into JM109, and HIPK1 expression was confirmed by anti-HIPK1 antibody (kindly provided by P. Leder) and purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to make point mutations in Daxx protein. Two serine residues in Daxx (Ser667 and Ser670) were replaced with alanine. Sense primer oligonucleotide (5′-GTACCCTGCCCGCCCCACCTTCCC-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotide (5′-GGGAAGGTGGGGCGGGCAGGGTAC-3′) were for S667A. Sense primer oligonucleotide (5′-GCCCAGCCCACCTGCCCCCTTAGCTTC-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotide (5′-GAAGCTAAGGGGGCAGGTGGGCTGGGC-3′) were for S670A. PCR was prepared by adding 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 20 ng of double-stranded DNA template (pFLAGCMV2-Daxx), 125 ng of each sense primer, 125 ng of each antisense primer, 1 μl of dNTP mix, double-distilled water to a final volume of 50 μl, and 1 μl of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl). PCR was performed with 12 cycles (95 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 1 min; 68 °C for 14 min for S667A and 95 °C for 30 s; 58 °C for 1 min; 68 °C for 14 min for S670A) with an initial incubation at 95 °C for 30 s. Following temperature cycling, the reaction was placed on ice for 2 min to cool the reaction. After PCR, 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme (10 units/μl) was added directly to each amplification reaction and incubated at 37 °Cfor1hto digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded DNA. The DpnI-treated double-stranded DNA was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were selected, and each plasmid (pFLAGCMV2-Daxx) was subcloned into pAdlox-Flag-Daxx, followed by digestion with HindIII/KpnI. Its fragment containing the mutation site was subcloned into pBluescript SK(-). Each pBluescript SK(-)-Daxx fragment was sequenced using T7 primer to confirm mutation. Oligomerization of ASK1 and Interaction between Daxx and ASK1 during Glucose Deprivation—Previous studies have shown that oligomerization of ASK1 occurs during treatment with TNF in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (11Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Activation of ASK1 requires reactive oxygen species-mediated dissociation of TRX from ASK1 followed by the binding of TRAF2 and consequent ASK1 homo-oligomerization (11Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether Daxx also plays a role in the oligomerization of ASK1 during glucose deprivation. Fig. 1A shows that homo-oligomerization of ASK1 occurred during glucose deprivation or H2O2 treatment. Unlike ASK1, Daxx existed as an oligomer form irrespective of oxidative stress (Fig. 1B). Several researchers have shown that Daxx, a Fas-binding protein, binds to ASK1, thereby activating the ASK1 kinase (12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 17Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). We investigated whether glucose deprivation induces interaction between Daxx and ASK1. Fig. 2 shows that Daxx associated with ASK1 during oxidative stress (glucose deprivation or H2O2 treatment).Fig. 2Interaction between Daxx and ASK1 during oxidative stress. DU-145 cells were co-infected with Ad.HA-ASK1 at an MOI of 10, and adenoviral vectors containing FLAG-tagged Daxx (Ad.FLAGDaxx) at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for 1 h or 500 μm of H2O2 30 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody (top panels). The presence of FLAG-Daxx in the lysates was verified by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (bottom panel). WB, Western blot; IP, immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Daxx Binding Site to ASK1 and Localization of Various Deletion Mutant Types of Daxx—We further examined which domain of Daxx is responsible for interacting with ASK1. Cells were co-infected with Ad.HA-ASK1 and adenoviral vectors containing wild-type Daxx or its various Daxx deletion mutants (amino acids 1–625, 1–500, 501–625, and 626–739). Fig. 3A shows that wild-type Daxx and Daxx deletion mutants (aa 1–625 and 501–625) interacted with ASK1 during glucose deprivation. Fig. 3B shows that wild-type Daxx, which contains two nuclear localization signals (18Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is mainly located in the nucleus. Wild-type Daxx relocalized to the cytoplasm during glucose deprivation. In contrast, the Daxx deletion mutant (aa 501–625) is mainly located in the cytoplasm irrespective of the extracellular glucose concentration. Other deletion mutants (aa 1–625, 1–500, and 626–739), which contain one nuclear localization signal, localize to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3B). Glucose deprivation did not significantly alter the intracellular distribution of any of the deletion mutants (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that intracellular location of Daxx as well as amino acid residues of the Daxx domain play an important role in the interaction between Daxx and ASK1. This possibility was further examined. As shown previously in Fig. 2, wild-type Daxx associated with ASK1 during glucose deprivation (Fig. 4A, lane 3). However, unlike wild-type Daxx, Daxx deletion mutant (aa 501–625) interacted with ASK1 regardless of whether glucose was present or absent from the medium (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5). We also investigated whether Daxx is involved in the homo-oligomerization of ASK1. Fig. 4B shows that oligomerization of ASK1 induced by glucose deprivation was unaffected by overexpressed wild-type Daxx (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 5). Unlike wild type Daxx, expression of Daxx deletion mutant (aa 501–625) caused oligomerization of ASK1 even in the presence of glucose (Fig. 4B, lane 6). The differential roles of wild-type Daxx and deletion mutant-type Daxx (aa 501–625) can be explained by differential localization of these proteins (Fig. 3B). Previous studies have shown that Daxx deletion mutant (aa 501–625) is largely responsible for JNK activation (17Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Fig. 4C shows that overexpression of Daxx deletion mutant (aa 501–625) indeed activates JNK1 even in the presence of glucose. These results suggest that physical interaction between Daxx and ASK1 is sufficient to cause ASK1 oligomerization and subsequent JNK1 activation.Fig. 4Effect of 501–625 deletion mutant-type Daxx on interaction between Daxx and ASK1, oligomerization of ASK1, and JNK1 activation in DU-145 cells.A, cells were co-infected with Ad.HA-ASK1 and adenoviral vectors containing FLAG-tagged wild-type Daxx (WT) or 501–625 deletion mutant-type Daxx at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were exposed to complete medium or glucose-free medium for 1 h. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody (upper panel). The presence of HA-ASK1 or FLAG-Daxx in the lysates was verified by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody (lower panels). B, cells were co-infected with Ad.HA-ASK1 and Ad.Myc-ASK1 at an MOI of 10 and then Ad.FLAG-Daxx (either wild-type Daxx or deletion mutant-type Daxx (aa 501–625) or Ad.EGFP at an MOI of 10.

The DNA polymerase β from the trypanosomatid Crithidia fasciculata, however, was the first mitochondrial enzyme of this type described. Upon searching the nearly completed genome data base of the related parasite Trypanosoma brucei, we discovered genes for two pol β-like proteins. One is ∼70% identical to the C. fasciculata pol β and is likely the homolog of this enzyme. The other, although ∼30% identical within the polymerase region, has unusual structural features including a short C-terminal tail and a long N-terminal extension rich in prolines, alanines, and lysines. Both proteins, when expressed recombinantly, are active as DNA polymerases and deoxyribose phosphate lyases, but their polymerase activity optima differ with respect to pH and KCl and MgCl2 concentrations. Remarkably, green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and immunofluorescence demonstrate that both are mitochondrial, but their locations with respect to the mitochondrial DNA (kinetoplast DNA network) in this organism are strikingly different.

Trypanosoma brucei belongs to a family of parasitic protozoa that are responsible for a growing human health problem. T. brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, a disease that threatens millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa, and related species are responsible for diseases such as Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis. Trypanosomes are among the earliest diverging eukaryotes that contain a mitochondrion (1.Cavalier-Smith T. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 6-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 2.Sogin M.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and perhaps because of this niche in evolution they exhibit some unique biological hallmarks. A prominent example is the fascinating structure and organization of their mitochondrial genome, known as kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). 1The abbreviations used are: kDNAkinetoplast DNApolpolymerasedRP5′-deoxyribose phosphatedTMPdeoxythymidine 5′-monophosphatePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideGFPgreen fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: kDNAkinetoplast DNApolpolymerasedRP5′-deoxyribose phosphatedTMPdeoxythymidine 5′-monophosphatePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideGFPgreen fluorescent protein. The kDNA contains several thousand DNA minicircles catenated together into a large network resembling medieval chain mail in its topology. In vivo this network is tightly condensed into a disk-shaped structure that associates with the basal body of the single flagellum of the parasite (see Ref. 3.Shapiro T.A. Englund P.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 117-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar for a review on kDNA). kinetoplast DNA polymerase 5′-deoxyribose phosphate deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride green fluorescent protein. kinetoplast DNA polymerase 5′-deoxyribose phosphate deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride green fluorescent protein. With the topological constraints imposed by the unusual network organization of this mitochondrial DNA, it is difficult to imagine a priori how this genome might be replicated in an orderly fashion. Several proteins involved in this process have been identified, and they have distinct localizations with respect to the kDNA disk. This organization suggests the events of replication are spatially regulated, and knowledge of the functions and locations of these proteins has led to a fairly detailed model for kDNA replication (for recent reviews see Refs. 4.Klingbeil M.M. Drew M.E. Liu Y. Morris J.C. Motyka S.A. Saxowsky T.T. Wang Z. Englund P.T. Protist. 2001; 152: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and 5.Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Saxowsky T.T. Wang Z. Englund P.T. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, minicircles are released from the network, presumably by a topoisomerase, prior to their replication. Release is vectorial into the kinetoflagellar zone, the space between the kDNA disk and the mitochondrial membrane nearest the flagellar basal body (6.Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the kinetoflagellar zone, they encounter the origin binding protein UMSBP (7.Abu-Elneel K. Robinson D.R. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. Shlomai J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a DNA primase (8.Li C. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20787-20792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), two Pol I-like DNA polymerases (Pol IB and Pol IC) (9.Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and likely other proteins that promote replication initiation. Replication via a theta structure intermediate is unidirectional and as such results in sister progeny containing either a single gap in the continuously synthesized strand or multiple gaps between Okazaki fragments on the discontinuously synthesized lagging strand. It is not known whether minicircle replication is completed in the kinetoflagellar zone, but eventually newly replicated minicircles migrate to two discrete sites flanking the kDNA disk known as the antipodal sites. Here they encounter SSE1 (10.Engel M.L. Ray D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), an enzyme with RNase H activity that can remove RNA primers (11.Hines J.C. Engel M.L. Zhao H. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase β (12.Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which presumably fills in most of the gaps between Okazaki fragments. Once this processing takes place, the newly replicated minicircles are reattached to the periphery of the kDNA network by a topoisomerase II (13.Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) that also localizes to the antipodal sites (14.Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one or two gaps are retained on the newly replicated minicircles after they have been reattached to the network (15.Ryan K.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3212-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16.Ryan K.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 823-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The residual gaps are thought to represent a counting mechanism that distinguishes molecules that have completed replication from those that have not yet begun the process (and are still covalently closed). Once the entire network has been replicated, the remaining gaps are filled, and the network is divided for segregation of the progeny into daughter cells. Although much of what we know of kDNA replication has come from biochemical studies of purified proteins from the organism Crithidia fasciculata, the advent of the T. brucei genome project has facilitated a genomics approach to identify other replication proteins. In a search for the mitochondrial pol β homolog from T. brucei, we also anticipated finding a conventional nuclear enzyme as well. We report here the discovery of two pol β proteins in T. brucei, but remarkably both target to the mitochondrion. These two proteins have different intramitochondrial localizations with respect to the kDNA disk and prefer strikingly different buffer conditions for optimal polymerase activity. These differences suggest that the two pol βs have distinct nonredundant roles. The discovery of this second mitochondrial pol β brings the tally of trypanosome mitochondrial DNA polymerases to the astounding number of six, including the previously described pol β (17.Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3495-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and four pol I-like polymerases (9.Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Identification and Cloning of Full-length Genes—A TBLASTN search of the T. brucei genome data bases (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb and (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei/) using the C. fasciculata pol β protein sequence as the query pulled out two distinct sets of sequences. These sequences were used to design primers, and the full-length coding sequences for both genes were acquired from PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the T. brucei cell line 29-13. The primers used are indicated in subsequent sections. All of the PCRs utilized 30 cycles of 94 °C melting (30 s), 55 °C annealing (30 s), and 72 °C extension (3 min). The accession numbers are AY354517 for pol β and AY354516 for pol β-PAK, the second pol β. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The coding sequence for T. brucei pol β lacking the putative mitochondrial localization signal (first 11 amino acids, based on homology to the C. fasciculata pol β) was amplified using the primers B-Nde(F) (5′-CATATGCTCAGACGAACCTTCTTC) and B-Bam(R) (5′-GGATCCCTATGGGTCCCGATTCTC) and cloned into the pET14b expression vector between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites allowing for expression of an N-terminal His6-tagged protein. After electroporation into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), expression of the tagged protein in a 2-liter culture was induced for 3.5 h at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were lysed by sonication (six 10-s bursts at full power using a Branson sonicator). The lysates were centrifuged (30,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatants were applied to a 5-ml DEAE-cellulose column that had been equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer A, and the flow-through and wash fractions were combined and applied to a 5-ml phosphocellulose column also equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A, and protein was eluted with a 45-ml salt gradient to 0.6 m KCl. Fractions containing pol β (0.28–0.43 m KCl) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF), and applied to a 0.5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 9 ml of buffer B, and protein was eluted with 5 ml of buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. Through all of the chromatography steps, the pol β protein was identified by Western blot using a rabbit antibody against the C. fasciculata pol β (18.Saxowsky T.T. Matsumoto Y. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37201-37206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (1:5000 dilution), which cross-reacted with the T. brucei protein. The purified protein was dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF. After dialysis, glycerol was added to 50%, and the final preparation was stored at –20 °C. This purification yielded 3.8 mg of protein as determined using a Bradford assay. Fig. 1A (lane 1) shows the purified protein preparation analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The entire coding sequence for T. brucei pol β-PAK was PCR-amplified using the primers P-Xho(F) (5′-CTCGAGATGCTTTTGTTCCGCCCC) and P-Xho(R) (5′-CTCGAGTCATTTTGATCTTCGTTT) and cloned into the XhoI site of the pET14b vector. This construct was electroporated into BL21(DE3) E. coli, and protein expression was induced in 2 liters of culture by the addition of 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 6 h at room temperature. The cells were harvested and lysed, and the lysate was passed over a DEAE column as described above. The combined DEAE flow-through and wash fractions were applied to a 5-ml SP Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A, and protein was eluted with 15 ml each of buffer A containing 200, 400, or 600 mm KCl. The 400 mm KCl fraction, which contained pol β-PAK, was applied to a 1-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column that had been equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm PMSF). The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer C, and protein was eluted with 5 ml of buffer C supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Through all of the chromatography steps, the pol β-PAK protein was identified by Western blot using a rabbit antibody that recognized the His tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1000 dilution). The purified protein was dialyzed against buffer C lacking imidazole and concentrated to ∼200 μl in a Vivaspin 6 concentration device (Sartorius; 10,000 molecular weight cut off). Glycerol was added to 50%, and the resulting protein preparation was stored at –20 °C. This purification yielded 0.8 mg of protein. The protein preparation analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining is shown in Fig. 1A (lane 2). Recombinant C. fasciculata pol β was prepared as described previously (19.Marchetti M.A. Tschudi C. Kwon H. Wolin S.L. Ullu E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Please note that a small error in the sequence of the C. fasciculata pol β has been corrected in GenBank™ (accession number U19912). Antibody Generation—Antibodies to pol β were generated in rats against soluble recombinant protein. For pol β-PAK, antibodies were raised in rabbits. Although the initial immunization was with the soluble protein preparation, all of the subsequent boosts were with polyacrylamide gel slices containing only the full-length protein. All of the immunizations were conducted following standard protocol at Co-calico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). The sera were collected after four boosts. Western Blots—Procyclic form trypanosomes (29-13, a derivative of strain 427) and bloodstream form trypanosomes (427 cells expressing VSG 221) were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Procyclic cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, vortexed, and boiled. Each lane represents 5 × 106 cell equivalents. SDS-PAGE gels were run, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by standard methods. The membranes were blocked in TNT (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and rinsed once with TNT. Primary antibody (JHR-56 for pol β and JH-690 for pol β-PAK) diluted 1:5000 into TNT plus 5% nonfat dry milk was added for an additional 1 h. The blots were washed three times for 10 min in TNT and then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rat for pol β and goat anti-rabbit for pol β-PAK, both conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, from Sigma) for 1 h. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 into TNT containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min with TNT, and the blots were developed by addition of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-3-indolyl phosphate, toluidine salt (Roche Applied Science). Activity Assays—The Schiff base trap and dRP lyase reactions were described previously (19.Marchetti M.A. Tschudi C. Kwon H. Wolin S.L. Ullu E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate concentration was 2 μm, and the enzyme concentrations were 0.5 μm. For each 10-μl reaction, 1 μl was spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose, and the remainder was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Polymerase assay conditions were previously described (19.Marchetti M.A. Tschudi C. Kwon H. Wolin S.L. Ullu E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that the primer:template was 40 μg of a poly(dA):oligo(dT) mixture (Amersham Biosciences). In determining optimal buffer conditions, only one component was varied from the standard buffer conditions (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in each case. Where the pH was varied, all of the buffers were Tris-based. Generation of Cell Lines Overexpressing GFP Fusion Proteins—Full-length sequences for each gene were amplified by PCR using the primers B-Hind(F) (5′-AAGCTTATGCTCAGACGAACCTTC) and B-Nhe(R) (5′-GCTAGCCGGGTCCCGATTCTCCGG) for pol β and P-Hind(F) (5′-AAGCTTATGCTTTTGTTCCGCCCC) and P-Nhe(R) 5′-GCTAGCTTTTGATCTTCGTTTTTTATC for pol β-PAK. The PCR products were cloned into the pXSGFPMUS3 vector (20.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 498Google Scholar) (kind gift of Christian Tschudi, Yale University) between the HindIII and NheI restriction enzyme sites to generate the C-terminal GFP fusion protein. This vector drives overexpression of the fusion protein with a strong procyclin promoter. The vector was linearized with MluI to allow for stable integration into the tubulin intergenic region. Transfections into procyclic Ytat 1.1 trypanosomes and imaging of GFP-expressing cells were described previously (9.Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence methods were described previously (13.Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) except that cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, and methanol permeabilization was overnight. Primary antibody (Pol β-PAK antibody JH690) that had been affinity-purified on recombinant antigen bound to Immobilon P (21.Hausler T. Stierhof Y.D. Blattner J. Clayton C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 240-251PubMed Google Scholar) was diluted 1:20 into phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and applied to slides for 90 min. The slides were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexafluor 488 (Molecular Probes) for 60 min. Microscopy was performed as previously described (6.Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). The images were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (SenSys; Photometrics Ltd.) using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc.). T. brucei Has Two Genes Encoding pol β-like Proteins—Our search of the T. brucei genome data base identified two genes, tandemly linked on chromosome V, that encode candidate pol β proteins. A schematic of the proteins encoded by the two pol β genes is compared with that of the C. fasciculata protein in Fig. 2A. The smaller of the two open reading frames encodes a 46-kDa protein that is ∼70% identical to the C. fasciculata pol β, including a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at the N terminus. The two proteins are likely homologs, and thus we have designated the trypanosome protein as T. brucei pol β. The other gene encodes a much larger protein of 87 kDa. Within the polymerase domain, this protein shares ∼30% sequence identity with both the C. fasciculata and T. brucei pol β proteins. Interestingly, this protein has a 19-amino acid C-terminal tail as well as a ∼300-amino acid N-terminal extension rich in prolines, alanines, and lysines (PAK domain), both of which are absent in the other proteins. Because of the latter domain, we have designated this protein as T. brucei pol β-PAK. Although we initially expected this second pol β to be nuclear, it also contains a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at its N terminus based on sequence characteristics outlined previously (22.Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The sequence of the PAK domain (Fig. 2B) has unusual properties. It accounts for ∼30 kDa of the total protein, and 65% of its sequence is composed of the amino acids proline, alanine, and lysine. At neutral pH it is predicted to carry a charge of +48. Within this domain are three near perfect 60-amino acid repeats (shown in bold type). A BLAST search using only this sequence pulls out no homology from any organism, but its amino acid content is reminiscent of two proteins cloned from C. fasciculata, kinetoplast-associated protein 1 (23.Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4786-4792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA primase. 2C. Li, J. C. Morris, and P. T. Englund, unpublished data. Interestingly, both of these proteins are mitochondrial and associate with the kDNA. Both Procyclic and Bloodstream Form Parasites Express pol β and pol β-PAK—To determine whether expression of either pol β or pol β-PAK was dependent on the life cycle stage of the parasite, we used SDS-PAGE to fractionate whole cell lysates from both procyclic and bloodstream form parasites. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed using sera containing specific antibodies generated against the recombinant proteins (Fig. 1B). The rat anti-pol β antibodies recognized a specific band of ∼46 kDa in both procyclic and bloodstream form lysates, in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of this enzyme (46.1 kDa). The rabbit anti-pol β-PAK antibodies recognized a band of ∼105 kDa in lysates from both life cycle stages. This protein runs with significantly lower mobility than expected for its predicted molecular mass (87.2 kDa). Its migration is likely hindered by the large positive charge of the PAK domain, and the possibility of post-translational modification cannot be ruled out. Recombinant pol β and pol β-PAK Are Active as DNA Polymerases—Inspection of the sequences of T. brucei pol β and pol β-PAK indicates that amino acid residues important for DNA polymerase activity are conserved in both enzymes (data not shown). To ascertain whether they are indeed active, we assayed recombinant proteins using buffer conditions previously published for the C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β (24.Johnson C.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An enzyme titration indicated that the T. brucei pol β and C. fasciculata pol β have similar levels of polymerase activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, T. brucei pol β-PAK displays less than half as much activity under these conditions. To determine whether the compromised polymerase activity of pol β-PAK was an intrinsic property of the protein or a function of the buffer conditions used, we varied the concentrations of KCl and MgCl2 or the pH of the assay (Fig. 3B). Again, the T. brucei pol β and the C. fasciculata pol β behaved similarly. The activities of both were highest at low KCl and MgCl2 concentrations, and their activity declined dramatically at pH levels lower than 9.0. For T. brucei pol β-PAK, however, the optimal buffer conditions differed greatly from the pol β proteins. The activity of pol β-PAK was stimulated by higher concentrations of KCl and MgCl2. Also, it was much more tolerant of changes in pH over the small range examined. The buffer component whose concentration influenced the polymerase activity most markedly was KCl (Fig. 3C). In assays where pol β-PAK showed the greatest specific activity (200 mm KCl), it was able to incorporate 54 pmol of dTMP/pmol protein/min, surpassing the greatest specific activity shown by the C. fasciculata pol β (50 mm KCl) of 33 pmol dTMP/pmol protein/min incorporated. These data confirm that pol β-PAK is not intrinsically less active as a DNA polymerase than pol β. Recombinant pol β and pol β-PAK Have dRP Lyase Activity— Because the catalytic amino acids required for dRP lyase activity are also conserved, we wanted to test whether both pol β and pol β-PAK are active in this capacity. We incubated the recombinant proteins with a radiolabeled dRP-containing substrate for 0 or 5 min and then reduced the intermediates with NaBH4 (see Fig. 3 in Ref. 19.Marchetti M.A. Tschudi C. Kwon H. Wolin S.L. Ullu E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for the dRP lyase reaction mechanism showing intermediates). Portions of the reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% gel; Fig. 4A), and the E-DNA and E-dRP intermediates were visualized by autoradiography. For both pol β and pol β-PAK, at time 0 when enzyme and NaBH4 were added simultaneously, the E-DNA intermediate accumulated (lanes 3 and 5). However, if the enzyme was incubated with substrate for 5 min prior to reduction, much of the initial E-DNA intermediate had been converted to the E-dRP intermediate (lanes 4 and 6) or the final unsaturated dRP product (see next paragraph). This pattern was similar to that observed for the C. fasciculata pol β used as a control (lanes 1 and 2). We also resolved the free unsaturated dRP derivative, the final product of the reaction, by polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography. For all of the proteins, accumulation of this product was similar to background (Fig. 4B, lane 1) if the mixture was reduced at time 0 (lanes 3, 5, and 7). Accumulation of unsaturated dRP did occur when the reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min prior to reduction, however, and this accumulation was protein-dependent (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Thus, both pol β and pol β-PAK can function as dRP lyases. pol β and pol β-PAK Are Both Mitochondrial—Although the predicted protein sequences of both T. brucei pol β-like genes included putative mitochondrial localization signals (22.Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we wanted to verify the intracellular targeting of these proteins. We cloned the complete coding sequence of each gene into the pXSGFPMUS3 vector, allowing us to express pol β and pol β-PAK as C-terminal GFP fusions under control of the strong procyclin promoter. We then identified the location of the fusion proteins by fluorescence microscopy of live cells. Imaging of live T. brucei cells expressing the pol β-GFP fusion protein revealed 5–10% of cells in which the GFP fluorescence accumulated at two bright spots flanking the kDNA disk (Fig. 5A shows two examples). All cells displaying this pattern of GFP had one nucleus and one kDNA and were likely in S phase. Thus, the T. brucei pol β localizes to the antipodal sites similar to its homolog in C. fasciculata (12.Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In cells with dividing kDNA, a weak GFP signal corresponding to the kDNA was observed; however no accumulation of pol β-GFP was seen in cells in which the nucleus had also undergone division (data not shown). Because its expression is driven by the strong procyclin promoter, the pol β-GFP fusion protein is probably overexpressed relative to the endogenous protein, and at longer exposures we detected some spillover of GFP fluorescence into the entire tubular mitochondrial matrix (data not shown). In cells in which the two brightly staining antipodal sites were not detected, this background fluorescence was still apparent. The antipodal localization in only a portion of GFP-expressing cells indicates that, like its C. fasciculata homolog (18.Saxowsky T.T. Matsumoto Y. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37201-37206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), accumulation in this location is cell cycle-dependent. Unfortunately, although we have specific antibodies to this protein (Fig. 1B), we were unable to obtain immunofluorescence data despite many attempts with a myriad of fixation, permeabilization, and detergent extraction conditions. When we imaged live T. brucei cells expressing the pol β-PAK-GFP fusion protein, we were surprised to find that this protein localized not in the antipodal sites but exclusively to the kDNA disk (Fig. 5B). Immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies affinity-purified against full-length recombinant pol β-PAK confirmed this localization (Fig. 5C). In higher eukaryotes it is firmly established that pol β is a nuclear enzyme involved in DNA repair. The pol β from the trypanosomatid parasite C. fasciculata was the first example of a mitochondrial enzyme of this type (12.Ferguson M. Torri A.F. Ward D.C. Englund P.T. Cell. 1992; 70: 621-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Torri A.F. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3495-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25.Torri A.F. Kunkel T.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8165-8171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the related parasite T. brucei has two genes encoding pol β-like proteins, and remarkably, both localize to the mitochondrion. Interestingly, data base searches have yet to reveal a third pol β gene that might represent the nuclear homolog in this organism. Perhaps, like the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (26.Haltiwanger B.M. Matsumoto Y. Nicolas E. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Taraschi T.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), T. brucei lacks a nuclear pol β and has evolved other mechanisms to repair its nuclear DNA. Surprisingly, the pol β homolog from Leishmania infantum, also a trypanosomatid parasite, has been reported to localize to the nucleus (27.Taladriz S. Hanke T. Ramiro M.J. Garcia-Diaz M. de Lacoba M.G. Blanco L. Larraga V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3822-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This localization needs further study given that the Leishmania protein is 93% identical to the C. fasciculata mitochondrial pol β (using the Clustal alignment program) and includes an N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. Although pol β and pol β-PAK share ∼30% sequence identity, including the active site residues essential for both the DNA polymerase and dRP lyase activities, there are striking differences between these two enzymes. One significant difference is the long N-terminal extension rich in the amino acids proline, alanine, and lysine for which pol β-PAK is named. This region is highly positively charged and contains three 60-amino acid repeats of unknown significance. The PAK domain could possibly assist in targeting this protein to the kDNA disk or anchoring it in this location. Alternatively, this domain could serve a regulatory role in modulating the enzymatic activities of this protein in vivo (see below). Because of the conservation of gene synteny between T. brucei and related organisms, we were able to identify pol β-PAK homologs upstream of the pol β genes in both the Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi genomes. Interestingly, although the coding sequences of the second gene include N-terminal extensions in both species, neither the length nor the sequence of the PAK domain is well conserved. Additionally, the short C-terminal tail is also missing in these homologs. We failed to identify a third pol β that might represent the nuclear enzyme in genome searches of these organisms as well. T. brucei pol β and pol β-PAK have different buffer preferences in in vitro polymerase assays. Although pol β prefers low concentrations of KCl and MgCl2, and its activity declines rapidly at pH below 9.0, the polymerase activity of pol β-PAK is stimulated by higher KCl and MgCl2 concentrations and is less sensitive to lower pH. The high salt content preferred by pol β-PAK in vitro could stabilize the enzyme by facilitating an important conformational change or affecting the aggregational state of the enzyme. The size of pol β-PAK, as well as its propensity for salt activation, raises the possibility that this enzyme corresponds to a second T. brucei mitochondrial polymerase activity observed previously (28.Fuenmayor J. Zhang J. Ruyechan W. Williams N. J. Euk. Microbiol. 1998; 45: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although there are some differences (for instance, in optimal MgCl2 concentration), it should be noted that these previous analyses were done on crudely fractionated mitochondrial extracts. The second active fraction could have contained pol β-PAK, one or more of the pol I-like polymerases (9.Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), or other proteins that might affect polymerase activity. Finally, although both pol β and pol β-PAK reside in the mitochondrion, they have different submitochondrial localizations with respect to the kDNA disk. These data suggest that these two pol β proteins have distinct and nonredundant roles in kDNA replication or maintenance. We propose the following model to invoke the need for two pol βs (Fig. 6). Prior to replication, all of the minicircles in the network are covalently closed (black circles). Minicircles are released from the network and replicated, giving rise to one daughter molecule with a single gap (blue circles) and one with multiple gaps (red circles). Although the singly gapped molecules are capable of network reattachment with little or no alteration (29.Birkenmeyer L. Ray D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2362-2368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kitchin P.A. Klein V.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3844-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the multiply gapped circles undergo some processing in the antipodal sites prior to their reattachment to the kDNA network. In this processing step, pol β is thought to fill many of the gaps between Okazaki fragments, leaving only one or two on the molecules that are ultimately reattached (16.Ryan K.A. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 823-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As replication proceeds, the central zone of covalently closed minicircles dwindles, and the peripheral zones of gapped molecules grow until finally the network consists entirely of gapped molecules. At this point, pol β-PAK is perfectly poised to fill these remaining gaps. Once the gaps are repaired, the network splits in two and the progeny networks are segregated to daughter cells. Because gap repair does not occur until minicircle replication is complete, there must be a regulatory mechanism to suppress pol β-PAK activity until the appropriate time. We are currently testing this model by determining the in vivo functions of these two enzymes using an RNA interference-based strategy. In higher eukaryotes, only one DNA polymerase (pol γ) has been rigorously shown to be involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance (31.Burgers P.M.J. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial discovery of a mitochondrial pol β in a trypanosomatid organism was certainly novel, and our report of a second mitochondrial pol β enzyme is even more so. Also, although the canonical pol γ is lacking in these cells, trypanosomes instead import a family of four pol I-like DNA polymerases into their mitochondrion (9.Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Currently, then, the tally of mitochondrial DNA polymerases in trypanosomes stands at six, an unprecedented multitude. The unusual and complicated structure of the kDNA, as well as the importance of its integrity to the parasite, seems to demand a more sophisticated system to ensure that this mitochondrial genome is properly maintained.

Signal initiation requires cell surface receptors, a G protein heterotrimer, and down-stream effectors. Signal inactivation requires Sst2, a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein that accelerates GTPase activity. We conducted a quantitative analysis of RGS and G protein expression and devised computational models that describe their activity in vivo. These results indicated that pheromone-dependent transcriptional induction of the RGS protein constitutes a negative feedback loop that leads to desensitization. Modeling also suggested the presence of a positive feedback loop leading to resensitization of the pathway. In confirmation of the model, we found that the RGS protein is ubiquitinated and degraded in response to pheromone stimulation. We identified and quantitated these positive and negative feedback loops, which account for the transient response to external signals observed in vivo.

One measure of our understanding of biological systems is our ability to predict their behavior in detail. One aspect of this endeavor is to model signal transduction events, defined here as the dynamic changes that occur within a cell in response to an external stimulus (1Bhalla U.S. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 297: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Riccobene T.A. Omann G.M. Linderman J.J. J. Theor.

Such models can help us to understand how small changes outside a cell produce strongly amplified changes within a cell, how graded signals are converted to all-or-none responses (4Ferrell Jr., J.E. Machleder E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), or how activators of one pathway influence the function of a second pathway (5Bhalla U.S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). A second goal, and the focus of this work, is to understand how transient external signals are prevented from being propagated indefinitely within the cell. Here we describe the molecular basis for signal activation, desensitization, and eventual resensitization of G proteins by receptors and RGS 1The abbreviations used are: RGSregulator of G protein signalingSUMOsmall ubiquitin-related modifierGFPgreen fluorescent proteinE1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligase. proteins. The experimentally observed behavior is described mechanistically by computational modeling of the pathway. regulator of G protein signaling small ubiquitin-related modifier green fluorescent protein ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin ligase. For these studies we investigated the mating pheromone signaling pathway in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast mating response is arguably the best characterized signal transduction pathway of any eukaryote, and it has long served as a prototype for hormone, neurotransmitter, and sensory response systems in humans (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Disruption or activation of pathway components leads to highly specific changes that can be easily quantified. Finally, because it is a unicellular eukaryote, every cell in a population is genetically and phenotypically identical (all cells are “typical”). Mating in yeast is the fusion of a and α haploid cell types to form an a/α diploid. The events leading to fusion are initiated by specific pheromones: α-type cells secrete α-factor pheromone, which binds to a specific receptor (Ste2) on a-cells, while a-cells secrete a-factor that binds to receptors (Ste3) on α-cells. Upon pheromone binding to its receptor, the G protein α subunit (Gpa1) releases GDP, binds to GTP, and liberates the G protein βγ subunits (Ste4/Ste18). Sustained signaling requires multiple effectors that bind to the dissociated Gα (7Guo M. Aston C. Burchett S.A. Dyke C. Fields S. Rajarao S.J.R. Uetz P. Young K. Dohlman H.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 517-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Gβγ components (8Dohlman H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These effectors go on to activate a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, leading to new gene transcription, morphological changes, cell division arrest, and ultimately cell fusion to form the a/α diploid (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Following GTP hydrolysis, the G protein subunits reassociate and signaling stops (9Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). One of the pheromone-induced genes encodes the prototype RGS protein Sst2. We have shown previously that Sst2 interacts genetically (10Dohlman H.G. Apaniesk D. Chen Y. Song J. Nusskern D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3635-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 11DiBello P.R. Garrison T.R. Apanovitch D.M. Hoffman G. Shuey D.J. Mason K. Cockett M.I. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with Gpa1 and can accelerate its GTPase activity more than 40-fold (13Apanovitch D.M. Slep K.C. Sigler P.B. Dohlman H.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4815-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutants lacking SST2 are ∼100-fold more sensitive to pheromone (12Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chan R.K. Otte C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Chan R.K. Otte C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This pattern of induction and regulation of pheromone signaling suggests that Sst2 is part of a feedback inhibition loop that promotes desensitization. Although intuitively reasonable, this concept has never been tested explicitly. Moreover, while computational models of G protein activation and inactivation have been devised previously, they have not been rigorously tested in vivo due to a lack of information about expression levels or about specificity of coupling of receptors and G proteins (3Shea L.D. Neubig R.R. Linderman J.J. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Shea L. Linderman J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we devise a detailed model that describes the behavior of cells treated with pheromone and demonstrate the predictive power of that model through experimentation. Strains and Plasmids—Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The yeast S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ) or BY4741-derived deletion mutants lacking sst2, ubr1, ubc2/rad6, ubc4, ubc5, ubc7/qri8, ubc8, ubc10/pex4, ubc11, ubc12, and ubc13 (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). UBC-related gene deletion mutants not tested were ubc1 (inviable), ubc3/cdc34 (inviable), ubc6 (unavailable), and ubc9 (required for SUMOylation rather than ubiquitination). Expression plasmids used in this study were those containing STE2, GPA1, STE4, STE18, and SST2. Each gene was amplified using flanking PCR primers that anneal 600 bp upstream or 600 bp downstream of the open reading frame. The PCR products were then subcloned by digestion with BamHI and either KpnI (SST2 and STE4) or XhoI (STE2, GPA1, and STE18) (restriction site encoded by the PCR primers) and ligation to pRS316 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other plasmids described previously are SST2-myc (12Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell.

For immunoblot detection, cell growth was stopped by the addition of 10 mm NaN3 and transfer to an ice bath. To monitor the degradation of Sst2 over time, mid-log cell cultures were treated with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml in 0.1% ethanol, final concentrations) for up to 120 min before harvesting. Cells were washed and resuspended directly in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min, subjected to glass bead homogenization, and clarified by microcentrifugation. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was probed with antibodies to Ste2 at 1:2,000 (from James Konopka, State University of New York), Gpa1 at 1:1,000 (24Dohlman H.G.

Immunoreactive species were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Specificity of antibody detection was established using gene deletion mutants, diploid cells (which do not express the receptor, G protein, or RGS protein), or non-Myc-tagged SST2 as negative controls. Ubiquitinated Sst2 was enriched by immunoprecipitation prior to immunoblotting. Cells were grown to mid-log phase and either treated with 3 μm α-factor or with water for 1 h. Approximately 100 ml of cells at A600 nm = 1 were harvested and lysed at 4 °C in 600 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with the use of acid-washed glass beads and 30-s pulses of vortexing, repeated six times. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 6,500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was removed and diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with wash buffer (the same as lysis buffer except there is no glycerol). Lysates were incubated with 40 μl of 9E10 anti-Myc antibodies for 90 min on ice. After clarification with a 10-min high speed microcentrifugation at 4 °C, protein-antibody complexes were precipitated for1hat4 °C with 40 μlofa50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in wash buffer. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 30 s, and pellets were washed with wash buffer before final resuspension in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Deterministic Modeling of Regulation by Sst2—To help elucidate the mechanism by which Sst2 regulates the pheromone response pathway, we constructed a simple mathematical model of the system. The variables in the model are the time-dependent concentrations of Ste4/Ste18 ([Gβγ]) and Sst2 ([RGS]). We assumed that the total concentration of Gβγ,[Gβγ]T = [Gβγ] + [GGDPαβγ], is constant in time. We also assumed that the rate-limiting step in the reformation of GGDPαβγ after exposure to pheromone is the hydrolysis of GTP. Once hydrolysis occurs, GGDPα and Gβγ rapidly combine to produce GGDPαβγ. The dynamics of [Gβγ]is governed by the ordinary differential equation.d[Gβγ]dt=(k1+fk1')([Gβγ]T-[Gβγ])-k2[GGTPα]-k3[RGS][GGTPα](Eq. 1) The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 1 represents the rate at which free Gβγ is liberated from GGDPαβγ. The parameter k1 is the rate constant for the process in the absence of pheromone, and k1′ is the pheromone-induced rate constant. The fraction of ligated receptors at pheromone concentration [L] is given by f = [L]/(K + [L]), where K is the effective dissociation constant for ligand binding. The second term on the right-hand side of Equation 1 represents the loss of free Gβγ by RGS-independent formation of GGDPαβγ. The reason this term does not explicitly depend on [Gβγ] is because of our assumption that, after exposure to pheromone, GTP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step in the reformation of GGDPαβγ. The final term models the acceleration of this process by RGS (negative feedback). k2 are k3 are the corresponding rate constants for these two processes. By assuming that the total Gα concentration, [Gα]T = [GGDPαβγ] + [GGDPα] + [GGTPα], is constant in time and that [GGDPα] ≈ 0, [GGTPα] can be written in terms of [Gβγ] as follows: [GGTPα] = [Gα]T – [Gβγ]T + [Gβγ]. Making this substitution in Equation 1 produces the following equation.d[Gβγ]dt=(k1+fk1')([Gβγ]T-[Gβγ])-(k2+k3[RGS])([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T+[Gβγ])(Eq. 2) For the wild-type strain, we assumed that [Gβγ]T = [Gα]T, and for the strain in which Gβ is doubly expressed, we assumed [Gβγ]T is present at twice the wild-type level. We assumed that the RGS concentration evolves according to the following equation.d[RGS]dt=k4+k5[Gβγ]-δ[RGS](Eq. 3) where k4 is the constitutive rate of RGS production, k5 is the pheromone-induced rate of RGS production, and δ is the degradation rate of RGS. While Equations 2 and 3 lack many biological details, it is shown under “Results” that this simple model provides insight into the signaling pathway. Equations 2 and 3 were solved numerically using MatLab. The pheromone-dependent transcriptional induction curves shown in Figs. 2C and 3B were produced from the relation R = [Gβγ]ss/([Gβγ]ss + κ), where R is the response, [Gβγ]ss is the steady-state value of [Gβγ], and κ is the value of [Gβγ] at which the response is half its maximum value. Equation 2 can be used to write R in terms of [L] and the steady-state RGS concentration [RGS]ss. The result is given by Equation 10 where Rmin, Rmax, and C are defined as follows.Rmin=[Gβγ]Tk1-(k2+k3RGS)([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T)κ(k1+(k2+k3RGS))+[Gβγ]Tk1-(k2+k3RGS)([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T)(Eq. 4) Rmax=[Gβγ]T(k1+k1')-(k2+k3RGS)([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T)(κ+[Gβγ]T)(k1+k1')+(k2+k3RGS)(κ-([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T))(Eq. 5) C=κ(k1+(k2+k3RGS))+[Gβγ]Tk1-(k2+k3RGS)([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T)(κ+[Gβγ]T)(k1+k1')+(k2+k3RGS)(κ-([Gα]T-[Gβγ]T))(Eq. 6) The parameter values used to produce Figs. 2C, 3B, and 4 are k1 = 5.25 × 10–5 min–1, k1′ = 1.75 min–1, K = 2.0 × 10–3 mm, [L] = 3 × 10–3 mm, [Gβγ]T = 2 × 10–4 mm, k2 = 3.5 × 10–3 min–1, k3 = 3,500 min–1 mm–1, k4 = 2.5 × 10–6 mm min–1, k5 = 2.5 × 10–2 min–1, δ = 5 × 10–2 min–1, and κ = 2.0 mm.Fig. 3Double expression of Sst2 attenuates the response to pheromone.A, pheromone-dependent transcriptional induction was measured following transformation of wild-type cells with a single copy plasmid (pRS316) containing genomic SST2 (2xSST2), transformation of wild-type cells with the same plasmid containing no insert (WT), or transformation of an sst2Δ mutant with plasmid containing no insert (sst2Δ). The same cells were co-transformed with a pheromone-responsive FUS1 promoter-lacZ reporter. Cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of α-factor for 90 min, and the resulting β-galactosidase activity was measured spectrofluorometrically. Inset, to confirm expression of Sst2, the same cells were lysed and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Sst2 polyclonal antibodies. The data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate. B, predicted pheromone-dependent transcriptional induction for the three strains shown in A. The model captures the decrease in EC50 seen in the sst2Δ strain (dashed line) relative to the wild-type strain (solid line). However, it cannot fully account for the decrease in the maximal response seen in the 2xSST2 strain (dot-dashed line) without also producing an artificial increase in the maximal response of the sst2Δ strain. The response is scaled relative to the maximum response in wild-type cells (response = 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Pathway regulation by RGS and Gβγ proteins.A, upon binding of the ligand (L) α-factor (αF) to its receptor (R, Ste2), the G protein α subunit (Gpa1) releases GDP, binds to GTP, and liberates the G protein βγ subunits (Ste4/Ste18). Sustained signaling requires activation of multiple effectors (not shown) by the dissociated Gβγ components. These effectors activate a pathway (dotted line) leading to transcription of several genes including the RGS protein (Sst2). GTP hydrolysis is accelerated by the RGS protein, and this leads to subunit reassociation and pathway inactivation. The model assumes that GTP hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step of subunit reassembly. A potential positive feedback loop leading to Sst2 degradation is indicated by a darker line. B, in the computer simulation the concentration of free Gβγ (solid line) increases rapidly after addition of pheromone (at time = 0). The concentration of RGS (dashed line) responds slowly and eventually inactivates the pathway leading to a reduction in free Gβγ. The experimentally observed induction of Sst2 (from Fig. 1B) is also shown (solid circles). The details of the model and parameter values used in the computer simulation are presented under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To simplify the model further, we made the reasonable assumption that changes in free Gβγ occur on a much shorter time scale than changes in RGS expression. That is, we assumed that [Gβγ] is in equilibrium with respect to the current RGS expression level. Mathematically this means that the time derivative in Equation 2 is equal to zero. Solving the resulting equation for [Gβγ] and substituting the result into Equation 3 produces the following equation.d[RGS]dt=k4+k5[Gβγ]T(k1+fk1')fk1'+k1+k2+k3[RGS]-δ[RGS]=k4+SKnf+[RGS]-δ[RGS](Eq. 7) where S = k5[Gβγ]T(k1 + fk1′)/k3 and Knf = (fk1′ + k1 + k2)/k3, and we made the simplifying assumption that [Gβγ]T = [Gα]T. In the above equation, the negative effect of RGS is clear. The maximum response in the absence of RGS is S/Knf. As [RGS] increases, the production rate returns to k4. Stochastic Modeling of Sst2/RGS Inhibition—Whereas deterministic models describe the average behavior of a number of individual cells, stochastic models describe the diverse behavior of many individual cells as well as the random changes within a single cell. To illustrate that pheromone-induced Sst2 degradation through ubiquitination is sufficient to explain the experimental results obtained for the 2xSST2 strain, we modified Equation 7 in the following way.d[RGS]dt=k4+SKnf+[RGS]-δ[RGS](1+[L]g([RGS]))+Noise(Eq. 8) The function g models the effect of pheromone-induced ubiquitination and increases the degradation rate. We assumed that RGS inhibits its own degradation, which would be the case if free Gβγ initiated the pathway leading to RGS ubiquitination, and took g to have the following form.g([RGS])=gmax[RGS]KRGS+[RGS]4(Eq. 9) where gmax is the maximum value of g, and KRGS determines where g reaches half its maximum value. Finally we added a noise term in Equation 8 to model fluctuations in the concentration due to the stochastic nature of chemical reactions. In general, the strength of the noise depends on the biochemical reactions in the signaling pathway (26Kepler T.B. Elston T.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3116-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). However, for simplicity we modeled this term as Gaussian white noise of strength D. Equation 8 was solved numerically using an Euler method, and 10,000 realizations of the process were used to produce the results shown in Fig. 6, B and C. The parameter values used in these figures are k4 = 0.02, S = 0.36, Knf = 0.09, KRGS = 0.35, [L] gmax = 0.9, δ = 0.2, and D = 0.0001. Our goal in this work was to understand how external signals produce responses within the cell. Our focus was on G protein activation, desensitization, and eventual resensitization by receptors and RGS proteins. Since an accurate model of any biological system requires knowledge of the identity and quantity of its components, we began by determining the amount of the RGS (Sst2) and Gα (Gpa1) present in the cell. The Gβγ subunits Ste4 and Ste18 were presumed to be expressed at levels equal to Gpa1 since G protein subunits assemble in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry, and Ste4 and Ste18 do not bind to any other Gα in yeast. Receptor expression was determined by radioligand binding measurements to be ∼8,000/cell (27Jenness D.D. Burkholder A.C. Hartwell L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 318-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To measure expression of Sst2 and Gpa1, we performed quantitative immunoblotting of whole-cell extracts. Cells in mid-log phase were harvested, lysed directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and resolved by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Absolute expression levels were determined using standards in which known quantities of purified recombinant Sst2 or Gpa1 were mixed with lysates from sst2Δ or gpa1Δ mutants, respectively. These data reveal that each cell contained ∼8,000 copies of Gpa1, equal to the number of receptors, and ∼2,000 copies of Sst2 (Fig. 1A and Table I).Table IProtein expressionProteinNumber/cellSourceReceptor (Ste2)8,000Ref. 27Jenness D.D.

The relative expression of each protein was again determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). These data reveal that Sst2 was induced 2.5-fold after 1 h of treatment and then declined slightly during the remainder of the experiment. Gpa1 expression was increased by ∼50% and remained elevated even after 2 h. Ste4 expression was not altered, although it does undergo a mobility shift as a result of pheromone-dependent phosphorylation (28Cole G.M. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 64: 703-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results are summarized in Table I. We also examined whether perturbations in the expression of each signaling component would alter the pheromone response. Cells expressing normal amounts of Sst2, receptor, and all three G protein subunits were compared with cells engineered to express double (“2x”) the normal amount of each component (Figs. 2 and 3). For this purpose, genomic copies of STE2, GPA1, SST2, STE4, and STE18 were subcloned into a centromere-based shuttle vector and transformed into wild-type cells. An sst2Δ mutant was also tested since that would provide information about pathway activation in the absence of feedback inhibition and GTPase acceleration. Other deletions lead to permanent activation of the pathway (gpa1Δ) or a complete loss of responsiveness (ste2Δ, ste4Δ, and ste18Δ) and were not tested (6Dohlman H.G. Thorner J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 703-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Changes in protein expression were confirmed in each case by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies against Ste2, Gpa1, Ste4, and Sst2. Alterations in pheromone sensitivity were measured using a reporter transcription assay comprised of a pheromone-responsive promoter (from FUS1) fused to lacZ (β-galactosidase). This particular assay was chosen because it is sensitive, quantitative, and highly specific for Gpa1 signaling (22Hoffman G. Garrison T.R. Dohlman H.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We chose not to use fluorescence-based measures of G protein dissociation because they require modifications or fusions that might alter G protein stability, localization, or activity (29Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 2-fold overexpression of the receptor, G protein α-subunit, and Gγ subunit had no effect on pheromone sensitivity. In contrast, overexpression of Gβ produced a dramatic increase in activity over the entire range of pheromone concentrations. Basal activity (no pheromone added) was also elevated so that it was nearly equivalent to wild-type cells treated with a maximally effective dose of pheromone. Thus 2-fold overexpression of Gβ is sufficient to fully activate the pathway. This is consistent with the model that Gβγ is necessary and sufficient for pathway activation and that Gβ is the limiting component of the Gβγ heterodimer complex (30Whiteway M. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Two-fold overexpression of SST2 led to a reduction in the maximum response by 27% (Fig. 3A). Deletion of SST2 did not alter the maximum response but rather resulted in a 100-fold decrease in the concentration of α-factor necessary to achieve 50% of the maximum agonist response (EC50) (Fig. 3A). These data reveal that, while loss of SST2 affected potency (a decrease in EC50), overexpression of SST2 caused a decrease in efficacy or maximum response. Having established for each component the expression levels and functional consequences of altered expression (Figs. 2 and 3), we devised a simple mathematical model to describe pathway activation and inactivation with a set of two coupled ordinary differential equations. A detailed description of the modeling is provided under “Experimental Procedures” and is shown schematically in Fig. 4A. The model assumes that Gγ is produced in excess of Gβ (but Gβ is limiting so final expression levels are equal) and that receptor and Gα are present in equal amounts and are always associated so that individually changing the concentration level of Gγ, receptor, and Gα does not affect the model. These assumptions were consistent with data shown in Fig. 2 for the double expression of Ste18, Ste2, and Gpa1. Thus the model only considers Gβγ and the RGS protein. Free Gβγ activates the intracellular signal leading to new gene expression, and the RGS protein has a negative effect on the pathway by increasing the rate at which Gβγ recombines with GGDPα. The model produces several predictions that can be compared with the experimental results presented above. Typical time series generated by the model for release of free Ste4/Ste18 ([Gβγ]) and the expression of Sst2 ([RGS]) are shown in Fig. 4B. The model predicts a sharp initial increase of free Gβγ in respo"

Larval cloning may therefore be an ancient ability of echinoderms and possibly of deutero-stomes - the group that includes echinoderms, acorn worms, sea squirts and vertebrates."

Mammalian reoviruses are prototype members of the Reoviridae family of viruses. They are nonenveloped viruses that contain a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments (1Nibert M.L. Schiff L.A. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1679-1728Google Scholar). Reoviruses have been isolated from many mammalian species, including humans; however, severe disease is rare and usually restricted to the very young (2Tyler K.L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 1729-1945Google Scholar). Neonatal mice are exquisitely susceptible to reovirus infection and have been employed for studies of viral pathogenesis with particular emphasis on central nervous system tropism and corollary disease phenotypes. Following oral inoculation of newborn mice, serotype 1 (T1) reovirus strains spread hematogenously from the intestine to the central nervous system and demonstrate tropism for ependymal cells (3Weiner H.L.

In contrast, serotype 3 (T3) reoviruses spread via neural routes to the central nervous system, where they infect neurons (3Weiner H.L. Drayna D. Averill Jr., D.R. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As a result of these differences in cell tropism, T1 strains cause nonlethal hydrocephalus, whereas T3 strains cause lethal encephalitis. Reassortant genetics defined the viral S1 gene segment as the primary genetic correlate of these tropism and disease phenotypes (3Weiner H.L. Drayna D. Averill Jr., D.R. Fields B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The adenovirus attachment protein, fiber, exhibits similar morphology and virion insertion (14Stehle T. Dermody T.S. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A major portion of the σ1 tail, including residues important for carbohydrate binding (15Chappell J.D. Duong J.L. Wright B.W. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8472-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), folds into a triple β-spiral structural motif (13Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S. Stehle T.

This motif consists of repeating units of short β-strands that previously had only been seen in the “shaft” domain of adenovirus fiber (16Bewley M.C. Springer K. Zhang Y.B. Freimuth P. Flanagan J.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Similarities also exist between the “knob” domain of fiber and the σ1 head, which both form globular structures composed of unique eight-stranded β-barrels (13Chappell J.D. Prota A. Dermody T.S.

The strong association of the S1 gene segment with serotype-dependent differences in reovirus tropism and disease led to the hypothesis that reovirus serotypes usurp distinct cell surface molecules for attachment and infection.

JAM1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein consisting of two extracellular Ig-like domains, termed D1 and D2, a single transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail (18Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J.

The structure of hCAR in complex with the adenovirus fiber knob revealed that fiber engages the D1 domain of hCAR using residues involved in hCAR homodimer formation and that knob mimics the hCAR-hCAR interaction (16Bewley M.C.

Biophysical evidence suggests that fiber-hCAR interactions are thermodynamically favored over hCAR-hCAR interactions, providing support for a model in which residues in the hCAR dimer interface preferentially bind fiber over hCAR (28Lortat-Jacob H.

The structural similarities between the reovirus and adenovirus attachment proteins and between their cognate receptors, paired with the absolute conservation of residues in mJAM1 and hJAM1 that mediate homodimer formation, suggest that reovirus engages the D1 domain of hJAM1 and that residues involved in hJAM1 dimerization are important for reovirus attachment (23Prota A.E. Campbell J.A. Schelling P. Forrest J.C. Peters T.R. Watson M.J. Aurrand-Lions M. Imhof B. Dermody T.S. Stehle T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For these experiments, we generated chimeric receptor molecules consisting of reciprocal domain exchanges between hCAR and hJAM1 and single domain hJAM1 deletion mutants and tested the capacity of these constructs to support reovirus binding and infection. We performed complementary in vitro and cellular competition binding studies and hJAM1 dimer cross-linking experiments to assess the effects on reovirus attachment. Finally, we generated a series of hJAM1 point mutants to define specific residues important for reovirus-hJAM1 interactions. The results of these structure-guided approaches reveal that residues in the hJAM1 D1 domain within and proximal to the dimer interface are critical for reovirus-hJAM1 interactions. These findings more clearly define the molecular basis of reovirus binding to hJAM1 and highlight potential mechanisms of reovirus attachment. Moreover, they provide biological and biophysical evidence that reovirus and adenovirus use remarkably similar attachment strategies.

Chimera JCJ (hJAM1 residues 1-128, hCAR residues 138-227, hJAM1 residues 235-299) and full-length D1 point mutant receptors were generated by overlap extension PCR. All chimeric and mutant receptor PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases and ligated into plasmid pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The fidelity of cloning was confirmed by automated sequencing. The PCR primers used to generate chimeric and deletion mutant receptors are shown in Table I. The PCR primers used for point mutant coding changes are shown in Table II.Table IPCR primers for chimeric and deletion mutant receptors T7 and BGH primers were used as 5′ forward and 3′ reverse primers for all constructs.

Cells were incubated for 24 h to allow receptor expression and then infected with reovirus T1L at multiplicities of infection of 1 fluorescent focus unit/cell and 1 plaque-forming unit/cell for fluorescent focus and plaque assays, respectively. For fluorescent focus assays, infected cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (29Barton E.S. Connolly J.L. Forrest J.C. Chappell J.D. Dermody T.S. J. Biol.

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Receptor Expression and Virus Binding—CHO cells were transiently transfected and incubated for 24 h to allow receptor expression. Cells were detached from plates by incubation with 20 mm EDTA in PBS.

Nucleotide sequences corresponding to residues 27-233 of wild-type hJAM1 and hJAM1 point mutants were cloned by PCR, digested with restriction endonucleases, and ligated into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) for bacterial transformation. Bacteria were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C with shaking, and protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Amersham Biosciences). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Glutathione S-transferase-hJAM1 constructs were purified from bacterial lysates by glutathione affinity chromatography. Soluble wild-type and point mutant hJAM1 ectodomains were liberated from the glutathione resin by thrombin cleavage (20 units/ml) at room temperature overnight. In Vitro hJAM1 and Reovirus Binding Analysis—hJAM1 (500 μg/ml) and reovirus T1L (1.1 × 1013 particles/ml) in PBS were biotinylated by incubation in 200 μg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at room temperature for 60 min. Unincorporated biotin was removed by exhaustive dialysis against PBS. ELISA plates were coated with 20 nm solutions of soluble hJAM1, cross-linked hJAM1, point mutant hJAM1, or bovine serum albumin (2 μg/ml) in pH 9.6 carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Sigma). Plates were blocked by incubation with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100, PBS. For kinetic analyses, biotinylated hJAM1 (20, 40, 80, or 160 nm) in blocking buffer was incubated with hJAM1-coated plates for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300 min, and biotinylated reovirus (2.5 × 1010, 5.0 × 1010, 1.0 × 1011, or 2 × 1011 particles/ml or 0.042, 0.083. 0.16, or 0.33 nm, respectively) in blocking buffer was incubated with hJAM1-coated plates for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min at 37 °C.

Binding in the presence of 20 μg/ml hJAM1-specific mAb J10.4 was tested as a control for specificity. All plates were washed twice with 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS and once with PBS and incubated with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Plate-bound biotinylated hJAM1 or reovirus was detected following incubation with HRP substrate (ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), Sigma) and analysis by spectrophotometry at 405 nm. For all conditions tested, no binding to bovine serum albumin-coated plates was detected.

The uptake of HOCl-LDL by THP-1 macrophages was not saturable and led to cholesterol/cholesteryl ester accumulation. HOCl-LDL is not aggregated in culture medium, as measured by dynamic light scattering experiments, but internalization of HOCl-LDL could be inhibited in part by cytochalasin D, a microfilament disrupting agent. This indicates that HOCl-LDL is partially internalized by a pathway resembling phagocytosis-like internalization (in part by fluid-phase endocytosis) as measured with [14C]sucrose uptake. In contrast to uptake studies, binding of HOCl-LDL to THP-1 cells at 4 °C was specific and saturable, indicating that binding proteins and/or receptors are involved. Competition studies on THP-1 macrophages showed that HOCl-LDL does not compete for the uptake of acetylated LDL (a ligand to scavenger receptor class A) but strongly inhibits the uptake of copper-oxidized LDL (a ligand to CD36 and SR-BI). The binding specificity of HOCl-LDL to class B scavenger receptors could be demonstrated by Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing CD36 and SR-BI and specific blocking antibodies. The lipid moiety isolated from the HOCl-LDL particle did not compete for cell association of labeled HOCl-LDL to CD36 or SR-BI, suggesting that the protein moiety of HOCl-LDL is responsible for receptor recognition. Experiments with Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing scavenger receptor class A, type I, confirmed that LDL modified at physiologically relevant HOCl concentrations is not recognized by this receptor.

Recent findings revealed that monocyte-derived macrophages are likely candidates to mediate the in vivo oxidation of LDL. There are multiple potential pathways through which monocytes/macrophages may promote extracellular oxidation of LDL, but in principal non-enzymatic and enzymatic cellular mechanisms of LDL oxidation do exist. Although formation of the superoxide anion radical and/or its dismutation product, hydrogen peroxide, by monocyte-derived macrophages appears to be essential for LDL oxidation, a cell-derived factor that does participate in phagocyte-dependent oxidation of LDL is myeloperoxidase (MPO). low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein cholesteryl ester Chinese hamster ovary fetal calf serum human CD36 hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite myeloperoxidase, mSR-AI, murine scavenger receptor class A, type I murine scavenger receptor class B, type I Tris-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline.

A major function of MPO is to hold a central role in microbial killing, and recent findings revealed an association between MPO levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (5Zhang R. Brennan M.L. Fu X. Aviles R.J. Pearce G.L. Penn M.S. Topol E.J. Sprecher D.L. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). MPO is also present in tissue macrophages such as those in vascular lesions (6Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 7Malle E. Waeg G. Schreiber R. Gröne E. Sattler W. Gröne H.J. Eur. J.

Pathol. 2001; 58: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The MPO-hydrogen peroxide system plays a specific role in monocyte/macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL by three major pathways. First, MPO catalyzes oxidation of l-tyrosine, generating the tyrosyl radical that may initiate dityrosine cross-linking of proteins or initiate LDL lipid peroxidation (for review, see Ref. 9Heinecke J.W. Toxicology. 2002; 177: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Second, MPO may use nitrite, the major end product of nitric oxide radical metabolism, as a substrate to nitrate (lipo)protein tyrosine residues and to initiate lipid peroxidation (10Hazen S.L. Zhang R. Shen Z. Wu W. Podrez E.A. MacPherson J.C. Schmitt D. Mitra S.N. Mukhopadhyay C. Chen Y. Cohen P.A. Hoff H.F. Abu-Soud H.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). MPO may also generate a nitrating intermediate through secondary reaction of hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HOCl/OCl–) with nitrite, presumably forming nitryl chloride as a reactive intermediate (10Hazen S.L. Zhang R. Shen Z. Wu W. Podrez E.A. MacPherson J.C. Schmitt D. Mitra S.N. Mukhopadhyay C. Chen Y. Cohen P.A. Hoff H.F. Abu-Soud H.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Third, because of its high concentrations in biological matrices, chloride is the preferred substrate for MPO, and HOCl/OCl–, a potent chlorinating oxidant, is formed. Under acidic conditions chlorine gas is formed, leading to generation of chlorotyrosine (12Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Alternatively, MPO-generated HOCl oxidizes free α-amino acids to aldehydes (13Anderson M.M. Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), leading to advanced glycation products present in human lesion material (14Nagai R. Hayashi C.M. Xia L. Takkeya M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48905-48912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the most common reaction of HOCl is with free amino groups of (apolipo)proteins, leading to formation of chloramines. LDL modified by HOCl (HOCl-LDL) displays a number of pathophysiological effects on phagocytes and vascular cells, contributing to the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory process during the early phase of atherosclerotic lesion development. HOCl-LDL induces chemokine release of monocytes and chemotactic migration of neutrophils (15Woenckhaus C. Kaufmann A. Bussfeld D. Gemsa D. Sprenger H. Gröne H.J. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1998; 86: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), initiates the respiratory burst of macrophages (16Nguyen-Khoa T. Massy Z.A. Witko-Sarsat V. Canteloup S. Kebede M. Lacour B.

Redox Rep. 2001; 6: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HOCl-LDL further decreases nitric oxide-synthesis in endothelial cells (19Nuszkowski A. Gräbner R. Marsche G. Unbehaun A. Malle E. Heller R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14212-14221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), causes endothelial leakage and stimulates leukocyte adherence to, and migration into, the subendothelial space (20Liao L. Aw T.Y. Kvietys P.R. Granger D.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 2305-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Malle E. Sattler W. Dean W.L. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and most importantly, HOCl converts LDL into a high uptake form for mouse peritoneal macrophages (23Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), leading to the formation of cholesteryl ester (CE)-laden foam cells, which are the hallmark of fatty streaks and the earliest recognizable lesion of atherosclerosis.

Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg G. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) supported the view that the MPO/hydrogen peroxide/chloride system converts LDL into an atherogenic form under in vivo conditions. However, the cellular mechanisms leading to HOCl-LDL uptake/processing by macrophages has not yet been addressed. We, therefore, put major emphasis on the clarification of whether scavenger receptors on differentiated macrophages are responsible for HOCl-LDL uptake. A variety of scavenger receptors expressed on macrophages has been cloned; however, previous studies demonstrated that scavenger receptors class A, e.g. SR-AI/II, and class B (e.g. CD36) are the principal receptors responsible for binding and uptake of modified LDL (for review see Refs. 27de Winther M.P. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 28Febbraio M. Hajjar D.P. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Both type I and type II SR-A bind a diverse array of macromolecules, including bacterial surface lipids (endotoxin and lipoteichoic acid), β-amyloid fibrils, protein modified by advanced glycation (advanced glycation end products), and modified lipoproteins, e.g. acetylated LDL (ac-LDL) or copper-oxidized-LDL (Cu-ox-LDL), respectively. In vivo CD36 is involved in diverse processes as recognition of senescent or apoptotic cells, fatty acid transport, cell-matrix interaction, and antiangiogenic actions. CD36 mediates lipid accumulation and macrophage foam cell formation in vitro and in vivo. SR-BI, another class B (type I) scavenger receptor, has also a multiligand specificity for various forms of native and modified (lipo)proteins (for review, see Ref. 29Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although SR-BI in comparison to SR-A and CD36 is less abundant in atherosclerotic lesions, its mRNA expression pattern during differentiation of human macrophages is similar to SR-AI and CD36, and both Cu-ox-LDL and ac-LDL may up-regulate its expression (30Hirano K. Yamashita S. Nakagawa Y. Ohya T. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Okamoto Y. Matsuyama A. Matsumoto K. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the primary routes for entry of ligands by macrophages are coated pits or caveolin-dependent endocytosis and/or phagocytosis. However, ligands can also be internalized non-concentration-dependent via fluid-phase uptake. Larger pinosomes termed macropinosomes can also internalize fluid-phase macromolecules via macropinocytosis (31Seastone D.J. Harris E. Temesvari L.A. Bear J.E. Saxe C.L. Cardelli J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2673-2683PubMed Google Scholar). We here provide evidence that HOCl-LDL is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis via class B scavenger receptor CD36 and SR-BI and partly via a mechanism resembling phagocytotic ingestion. At physiologically relevant HOCl concentrations HOCl-LDL is not recognized by SR-AI. NaOCl, organic solvents, potassium bromide, and egg yolk lecithin were obtained from Sigma. Radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DMEM, RPMI, and Ham's-F-12K medium were from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum (FCS) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Plastic ware used for tissue culture was obtained from Costar (Vienna). All other chemicals were obtained from Merck except where indicated. LDL (d = 1.035–1.065 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation as described previously (32Malle E. Ibovnik A. Leis H.J. Kostner G.M. Verhallen P.F. Sattler W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Lipoprotein concentrations are expressed in mg or μg of protein/ml and were determined according to Lowry and coworkers (33Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard or calculated from total cholesterol, determined by the CHOD-PAP method (Roche Applied Science). Before modification, native LDL was desalted, and the preservatives were removed by dialysis or size exclusion chromatography on Econopac 10-DG columns (Bio-Rad). HOCl-LDL was prepared as described (34Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of LDL protein per ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was incubated with HOCl solution at 4 °C for up to 1 h at pH 7.4. For LDL incubated between 0.2 and 1.6 mm final HOCl concentration this resulted in an oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio in between 100:1 and 800:1. The modified LDL preparations were passed over a PD10 column to remove unreacted NaOCl and used immediately for cell culture experiments. Cu-ox-LDL (relative electrophoretic mobility = 2) and ac-LDL (relative electrophoretic mobility = 2.8) were prepared as described (32Malle E. Ibovnik A. Leis H.J. Kostner G.M. Verhallen P.F. Sattler W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Aliquots of native and NaOCl-modified LDL (450 μg of protein) were lyophilized in 5-ml ampoules and purged with nitrogen before hydrolysis in constant boiling 6 n HCl (24 h, 120 °C). Amino acid analysis was performed on a Biotronics analyzer as described (35Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from native or modified LDL as described (36Marsche G. Hammer A. Oskolkova O. Kozarsky K.F. Sattler W. Malle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32172-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, HCl was added to the LDL preparations to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the lipids were extracted using chloroform-methanol 2:1 (v/v). The chloroform phase was removed and evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipids were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 0.01 m Tris HCl, 0.001 m EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and sonicated (to obtain a microemulsion of small lipid droplets). LDL Labeling with 125INa—Iodination of LDL and HOCl-LDL was performed as described (37Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) using N-bromosuccinimide as the coupling agent. Routinely, 500 μCi of 125INa was used to label 2 mg of LDL/HOCl-LDL-protein. This procedure resulted in specific activities between 200 and 300 cpm/ng of protein with less than 3% lipid-associated activity. No cross-linking or fragmentation of apoB-100 due to the iodination procedure could be detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. LDL Labeling with [3H]CE—LDL and HOCl-LDL were labeled with [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]palmitate by cholesteryl ester transfer protein-catalyzed transfer from donor liposomes as described (37Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This labeling procedure resulted in specific activities of 5–9 cpm/ng of protein. Macrophages—The human monocytic THP-1 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS. To induce differentiation, THP-1 cells were cultured for 72 h in the presence of 160 nm phorbol myristate acetate. Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells—Stable transfectant CHO cells expressing murine SR-AI (CHO[mSR-AI]) were maintained in Ham's-F-12K medium supplemented with 3% lipoprotein-deficient serum, 250 μm mevalonate, 40 μm mevinolin, 3 μg/ml ac-LDL, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (38Ashkenas J. Penman M. Vasile E. Acton S. Freeman M. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 983-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments with CHO[mSR-AI] were performed on confluent cell monolayers in Ham's F-12 medium containing 3% lipoprotein-deficient FCS. Vector-transfected CHO cells cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% FCS, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin were used as controls. Stable transfectant CHO cells expressing murine SR-BI (ldlA[mSRBI]) were maintained in Ham's-F-12K medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (39Acton S.L.

LdlA cells (clone 7, an LDL receptor-deficient CHO cell line) used as controls were cultured in medium without G-418. Stable transfectant CHO cells expressing human CD36 (CHO[hCD36]) (41Ohgami N.

Cell Association and Degradation Studies—Association studies of LDL and HOCl-LDL to cells were performed at 4 and 37 °C with increasing amounts of 125I-labeled CE- and/or [3H]CE-labeled lipoproteins in the absence (total cell-association) or presence of 1 mg of protein/ml (nonspecific cell association) of unlabeled autologous lipoprotein particles or specific polyclonal anti-human CD36 antiserum (42Tandon N.N. Ockenhouse C.F. Greco N.J. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1991; 78: 2809-2813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in DMEM/RPMI medium without FCS. After this incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed 2 times with TBS (containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) followed by 2 washes with TBS only. Cells were lysed with 0.3 n NaOH. The radioactivity and protein content of the cell lysate were measured in the same aliquot. Specific cell association was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific cell association. Degradation of 125I-labeled lipoprotein particles by CHO cells was estimated by measuring the non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the medium as described (37Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 43Marsche G. Levak-Frank S. Quehenberger O. Heller R. Sattler W. Malle E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1095-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Specific degradation was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific degradation (presence of blocking antibodies or control cells). The specificity of HOCl-LDL binding sites was examined by competition experiments. The association of 10 μg of [3H]CE-labeled lipoprotein/ml was competed for by increasing concentrations (up to 200 μg of protein or protein eq/ml) of indicated unlabeled competitors. Determination of Cholesterol Content in THP-1 Macrophages—Lipids of THP-1 cells were extracted with hexane-isopropanol (3:2) and dried under argon. The free and total cholesterol content was measured with an enzymatic kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wako Chemicals GmbH). The CE content was determined by subtracting free cholesterol content from total cholesterol content. Measurement of Fluid-phase Endocytosis—Fluid-phase endocytosis was determined by incubating THP-1 macrophages with 1 μCi/ml [3H]sucrose in the presence of LDL or HOCl-LDL. After the incubations, the cells were rinsed 2 times with TBS (containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) followed by 2 washes with TBS only. Cells were lysed with 0.3 n NaOH. The radioactivity and protein content of the cell lysate was measured in the same aliquot. Cell-free wells were incubated with [3H]sucrose in parallel incubations and gave a background count less than 5% of the [3H]sucrose radioactivity detected in macrophages (44Kruth H.S. Huang W. Ishii I. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34573-34580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis of apoB-100 revealed that cysteine and methionine are the most susceptible amino acids to oxidation by HOCl (Table I). Tyrosine and histidine are consumed dose-dependently up to 20 and 10%, respectively, at the highest HOCl concentrations. Whereas the ϵ-amino group of arginine is not prone to be modified, the ϵ-amino group of lysine represents a preferential target for HOCl attack. The increase in the anionic charge of LDL, a result from modification of the ϵ-amino group of peptidyl lysine residues from apoB-100, is further reflected by an increased electrophoretic mobility of the modified LDL particle. In line with previous reports (23Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) no significant increase of lipid peroxidation products was detected as a function of increasing oxidant:LDL molar ratio ranging between 100:1 and 800:1 (data not shown).Table ICharacterization of native and HOCl-modified LDLLDLHOCl-LDL100:1200:1400:1800:1mol/molCys0.7NDNDNDNDMet3.1NDNDNDNDTyr17.416.515.41413.8Lys31.429.928.126.219.1His10.510.210.09.49.5Arg15.715.715.815.615.5REM11.151.351.752.1 Open table in a new tab Based on in vitro experiments HOCl concentrations at sites of acute inflammation were calculated to be in the range of 340 μm or above (45Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Roos D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 46Katrantzis M. Baker M.S. Handley C.J. Lowther D.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assuming LDL plasma concentrations of ≈2 μm (and it is conceivable that subendothelial concentrations could be lower) one would yield a minimal estimate HOCl:LDL molar ratio of ∼200:1. Therefore, an oxidant:LDL molar ratio of 100:1 up to 400:1 was considered suitable for further experiments. Previous reports suggest that exposure of LDL to reagent HOCl results in LDL aggregation due to the formation of chloramines from apoB-100 lysine amino groups (23Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 47Hazell L.J. van den Berg J.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because aggregation could be reversed by the addition of methionine or lysine (leading to reversion of apoB-100 chloramines), we studied whether HOCl-LDL aggregates are stable in culture medium (RPMI). Therefore, native and HOCl-LDL (1 mg of protein/ml of phosphate-buffered saline, oxidant:LDL molar ratio 400:1) were dialyzed against phenol red-free RPMI and analyzed by dynamic light scattering experiments as described (35Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Under these conditions no HOCl-LDL aggregates were detected to be present in RPMI. The hydrodynamic radius of HOCl-LDL only moderately increased from 12.7 ± 1.3 to 16.6 ± 2.8 nm, indicating that no aggregation occurs under the conditions applied. To investigate binding properties of HOCl-LDL to THP-1 cells at 4 °C, the protein moiety of the lipoprotein particle was labeled with 125INa. Non-linear regression analysis revealed a significant increase in binding affinity (Kd values) and saturable binding characteristics for HOCl-LDL when compared with native LDL (Fig. 1A, Table II). This indicates that HOCl-LDL is recognized by receptor(s) or binding protein(s). THP-1 macrophages were further incubated with HOCl-LDL for 24 h, and cellular cholesterol content was estimated. Incubation of cells led to a significant accumulation of free (Fig. 1B) and esterified cholesterol from HOCl-LDL (Fig. 1C). It is important to note that under the conditions described LDL only marginally increased cellular CE content (Fig. 1C). In contrast to binding experiments at 4 °C, cell association of HOCl-LDL at 37 °C is not saturable (Fig. 1D), indicating involvement of a pathway resembling phagocytic ingestion. Therefore, cell experiments were performed in the presence of cytochalasin D, a microfilament-disrupting agent (48Poussin C. Foti M. Carpentier J.L. Pugin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20285-20291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) known to block phagocytosis and macropinocytosis. About 35–46% of cell association of LDL and HOCl-LDL (at concentrations higher than 100 μg of protein/ml), respectively, could be inhibited by cytochalasin D (Fig. 1D). Association of vortex-aggregated LDL, which is internalized through a phagocytic mechanism (49Khoo J.C. Miller E. McLoughlin P. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 348-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was inhibited by >90% by cytochalasin D treatment of cells (data not shown). Previous findings revealed that modified LDL particles are internalized by macrophages in part via macropinocytosis, a phagocytic mechanism that leads to ingestion of fluid-filled macropinosomes (50Jones N.L.

The NF-κB family of transcription factors plays crucial roles in the immune, inflammatory and apoptotic responses (23Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3292) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation is induced by a variety of stimuli including TNF-α, interleukin-1 (IL-1), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), double-stranded RNA, Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), and LMP1 (24Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of dimers of p50, p52, RelA, RelB, or c-Rel that are endogenously complexed to inhibitor proteins called IκB and NF-κB precursor proteins p105 or p100, which sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm. In response to various stimuli, inhibitory proteins are phosphorylated at specific serine residues and are rapidly processed by the proteasome after polyubiquitination. This exposes the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, leading to its nuclear translocation. The phosphorylation step is usually controlled by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which contains two catalytic subunits, IKK1/α and IKK2/β, and the regulatory subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO/IKKγ/IKKAP), HSP90, and Cdc37 (25DiDonato J.A.

Thus, activation of the IKK complex constitutes a converging regulatory step in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Recent studies have revealed two distinct pathways of NF-κB activation. The canonical pathway is triggered by many inflammatory stimuli including TNF-α, IL-1, LPS, and double-stranded RNA; depends on IKK2 and NEMO; and induces specific phosphorylation of IκB proteins. The non-canonical pathway is triggered by a limited number of stimuli including lymphotoxin-β (LT-β), B cell-activating factor (BAFF), and CD40 ligand that function in the development, organization, and proper function of lymphoid tissue (39Matsushima A.

This pathway involves the phosphorylation-dependent processing of NFKB2 p100 to p52, which requires IKK1 and functional NIK, resulting in the nuclear translocation of p52-RelB dimers. A previous study on HTLV-I Tax uncovered a unique mechanism whereby this viral protein persistently activates NF-κB. Tax resides in the cytoplasm associated with the IKK complex and physically interacts with p100, thereby inducing its phosphorylation and processing through recruitment of the IKK complex to p100 (45Xiao G.

Our initial study on the LMP1 signaling identified a novel NEMO-independent NF-κB activation pathway that is mediated by CTAR1 and involves aberrant expression of p52 and nuclear translocation of RelB. We further provide genetic evidence of how NIK, IKK1, and IKK2 are involved in this process. Plasmids—Plasmids pSG5, pSG5-LMP1, pSG5-LMP1.Y384G, pSG5-LMP1.349Δ, pSG5-LMP1.AAA, and pSG5-LMP1.Δ187–351 were described previously (14Huen D.S. Henderson S.A. Croom-Carter D. Rowe M.

IKK2–/– and NEMO–/– fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Manolis Pasparakis (EMBL, Rome, Italy), IKK1–/–IKK2–/– fibroblasts were by Dr. Inder M. Verma (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA), IKK1–/– fibroblasts were by Drs. Michael Karin and Véronique Baud (University of California, San Diego, CA), and NIKaly/aly fibroblasts were by Dr. Mitsuru Matsumoto (Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan). To generate cells carrying a mutation that results in impaired NF-κB activation, we mutagenized Rat-1 cells stably expressing the HTLV-1 Tax protein to constitutively activate NF-κB and then subjected them to a lethal selection that employs the combination of NF-κB-dependent expression of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase and ganciclovir. Rat-1 cells were stably transfected with pIRES1neo-tax, pIgκ2bsrH, and pIgκ2tkH, and selected under G418, hygromycin, and blasticidin S. Isolated clones were tested for resistance to blasticidin S and susceptibility to ganciclovir. One clone, D2–19, was found to express Tax, exhibit constitutive NF-κB activity, be resistant to blasticidin S, and be killed completely in the presence of ganciclovir. D2–19 cells were subjected to four rounds of mutagenesis with 10 μg/ml frameshift mutagen ICR191, followed by lethal selection in the presence of 1 μg/ml ganciclovir. One cell clone, N1, did not significantly induce κB-DNA binding activity in response to TNF-α or LPS. This clone was found to have lost Tax expression and resistance to G418. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. PCR, Cloning of Rat nemo, and Southern Blotting—One microgram of total RNA was extracted from ∼1 × 105 Rat-1 cells and reverse-transcribed into minus-strand cDNA in a 50-μl reaction using Superscript II (Invitrogen) under the instructions from the manufacturer. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture containing 5 μl of the above synthesized cDNA. DNA sequence homology between murine and human NEMO at the amino and carboxyl termini enabled us to design primers N2 (5′-GTGCAGCCCAGTGGTGGCCCAG) and C1 (5′-CTACTCTATGCACTCCATGAC) and to amplify part of rat nemo cDNA by PCR. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was conducted using SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) under the instructions from the manufacturer. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated to p-GEM-T Easy (Promega) vector, and sequenced. Based on the sequencing results, primers N0 (5′-CCTAGGAGCTCCGATTCTGC) and C0 (5′-GGAGCTGTCTACCCTAATAGGGG) were used to amplify the entire coding sequence of rat NEMO. Five μl of the initial PCR reaction was subjected to nested PCR with primers Nemo5′ (5′-GGATCCAGCAGGCACCTCTGGAAGA) and Nemo3′ (5′-CTCGAGCTACTCTATGCACTCCATGACATGTATC). DNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3HA, and pcDNA3HA-NEMO-Rat-1 and pcDNA3HA-NEMO-N1 were generated and sequenced. For PCR-Southern analysis, PCR was performed using cDNA with primers N0 and C0, followed by nested PCR with primers Nemo5′ and Nemo3′. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by alkaline blotting. Hybridization was carried out in a standard protocol, using a probe prepared by PCR with primers Southern F0 (5′-CAGATGCTGAGGGAACGCT) and Southern R0 (5′-AGTTCCCCCAGCAATGATGT). The blot was exposed to an x-ray film (MXJB-1; Eastman Kodak Co.) at –80 °C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA was amplified with primers rat-gapdh-F (CGGTGTCAACGGATTTGG) and rat-gapdh-R (GTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACC). For semiquantitative PCRs, 5 μl of cDNA samples used above and serially diluted rat nemo plasmid DNA, ranging from 0.01 to 1011 copies/sample, were used as template. The first step PCR was done for 35 cycles with primers N0 and C0, followed by the second step PCR for 35 cycles with primers Nemo5′ and Nemo3′, using 5 μl of the first PCR products. Transient Transfection and Luciferase assay—Transfection was carried out in six-well plates by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or DEAE-dextran method. Total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was kept constant with pcDNA3HA or pSG5. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with 15 μg/ml LPS or 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 3 h before lysis. The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were repeated at least three times in duplicate. Retrovirus Infection—Supernatants of transfected Plat-E cells (53Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) were recovered and passed through a 0.45-μm filter every 12 h from 36 to 72 h after transfection, and either immediately used for infection of cells or frozen and stored at –80 °C. For infection, cells on 100-mm dishes were exposed to 4 ml of virus supernatant in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene for 3 h. Rat-1 and 5R cells were harvested at 30 h after infection. Wild type, IKK1–/–, IKK2–/–, NEMO–/–, and NIKaly/aly fibroblasts were harvested at 36 h after infection. N1 cell clones expressing LMP1 were isolated through limiting dilution. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Kinase Assay—Kinase assay was performed in parallel with immunoblot analysis following immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.15 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl) supplemented with 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.57 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate and left on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to 1%, and the cell suspension was incubated for 2 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, supernatants were used as cytoplasmic extracts and pellets were used for extraction of nuclear proteins. Gel filtration was performed with Superdex-200 as described previously (29Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

After the last washing, one half of the beads were used to perform kinase assays and the remaining beads were used for immunoblot analysis. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min in reaction mix (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 nm ATP, [γ-32P]dATP, and 1 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–72)).

Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed under a standard protocol. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (NEN Life Sciences). When necessary, membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C with constant agitation, washed, and reprobed with another antibody. The intensity of the p52 and p100 bands was determined by a computerized analysis (Image Gauge version 3.01, Fuji Film). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (29Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract proteins (5 μg determined by Bradford) were incubated in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)) and 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled κB probe (KBF1) (56Kieran M.

Samples were fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and visualized by autoradiography. In supershift assays, antiserum to p50 (1263), RelA (1226), RelB (1319), or p52 (06-413) was added to the binding reaction. LMP1 Activates NF-κB in NEMO-deficient Cells—We used the 5R cell line to examine whether LMP1 can activate NF-κB in a NEMO-independent manner. We demonstrated previously that 5R cells did not express any detectable NEMO protein by Western blot analysis (29Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), but its mRNA expression was not explored. For this purpose, the entire coding region of the nemo cDNA expressed in Rat-1 cells was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using primers corresponding to regions highly conserved between the human and murine nemo genes (Fig. 1A). Southern blot analysis of RT-PCR products failed to detect nemo mRNA in 5R cells (Fig. 1B). Semiquantitative PCR analysis revealed more than 1000 copies of nemo cDNA in the sample prepared from 100 Rat-1 cells, whereas none was detected in 100 5R cells (Fig. 1C). Aliquots of the PCR-amplified material were further analyzed for NEMO cDNA by nested PCR. Although 10 copies of nemo cDNA were amplified in the control samples, none was amplified from 5R cells (Fig. 1D). These results indicate 5R cells do not express nemo mRNA, and the assay sensitivity is 10 copies of NEMO cDNA in 100 cells. Fig. 1E shows that stimulation of 5R cells with TNF-α or LPS does not induce any NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation as previously reported (29Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), whereas LMP1 expression in 5R cells resulted in a significant activation that was, however, weaker than that observed in Rat-1 cells (see Fig. 5B). We also tested a previously characterized NEMO-deficient pre-B cell line 1.3E2 (29Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Transient expression of LMP1 in 1.3E2 and its parental cell line 70Z/3 caused strong NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation. These results indicate that LMP1 can activate NF-κB in a NEMO-independent manner.Fig. 5CTAR1 mediates NEMO-independent NF-κB activation.A, structure of wild type and mutant LMP1 proteins. CTAR1 is located between amino acid residues 194 and 232. CTAR2 is between 351 and 386. The hollow circles indicate amino acid substitutions.

https://openalex.org/W1989494896,"P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) affect many epithelial cell functions including transcellular ion transport, secretion, and cell death. Here we used parotid acinar and duct cells to reveal the unique cell-specific assembly and gating of the P2X7R channels. Immunolocalization indicated expression of P2X7Rs in the luminal membrane of both cell types. Stimulation with 5 mm ATP raised [Ca2+]i levels in a cell-specific manner and activated multiple currents. The current mediated by P2X7R was isolated by infusing the cells with high [EGTA]. The initial activation of acinar cell P2X7Rs by ATP was slow requiring ∼2.5 min. Subsequent removal and addition of ATP, however, resulted in rapid inhibition and activation (gating) of the P2X7Rs. By contrast, P2X7Rs in duct cells displayed only rapid gating by ATP. Activation of P2X7Rs in both cell types was verified by (a) low Km for ATP, (b) sensitivity to external divalent ions, (c) lack of desensitization/inactivation, (d) permeability to Na+, and (e) inhibition by Brilliant Blue G, Cu2+, and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid tetrasodium. The slow P2X7R activation in acinar cells was not affected by manipulation of exo-/endocytosis. Rather, disassembly or solidification of the actin cytoskeleton prior to incubation with ATP prevented channel assembly. Remarkably, after completion of the slow activation, manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton no longer affected gating by ATP. Accordingly, manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton had no effect on P2X7R gating by ATP in duct cells. We concluded that P2X7Rs are not active in resting acinar cells. On exposure to ATP, P2X7Rs are assembled into functional channels with the aid of the actin cytoskeleton. Once assembled, P2X7Rs are subject to rapid gating by ATP. Duct cell P2X7Rs are preassembled and therefore continually subject to rapid gating by ATP. This cell-specific behavior may reflect the specific function of P2X7Rs in the two cell types.

P2YRs are G protein-coupled receptors that act by activation of phospholipase Cβ to evoke Ca2+ signals of specific patterns (3Communi D. Janssens R. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To date, seven P2YR subtypes have been found (3Communi D. Janssens R. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Cell.

P2XRs are nonspecific cation channels that can admit Ca2+ and, as a result, regulate cell function by increasing Ca2+ influx (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Seven P2XRs have been identified (1North R.A. Physiol.

All P2Rs are expressed in the brain and show region-specific expression (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar, 2Leipziger J. Am. J.

Multiple P2YRs and P2XRs are also expressed in epithelial tissues, including the respiratory epithelia, intestine, salivary glands, and the pancreas (5Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 284: F419-F432Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar. The lack of specific agonists and antagonists for most P2Rs hampered early work attempting to identify and localize P2Rs. Recent reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis has revealed mRNA for P2Y1R, P2Y2R, P2Y4R, P2X4R, and P2X7R in pancreatic duct cells (5Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hede S.E. Amstrup J. Christoffersen B.C. Novak I. J. Biol.

Morphol. 1998; 36: 170-175PubMed Google Scholar) in salivary gland cells. Epithelial expression of P2Rs is unique in that it is membrane-specific, as indicated by functional studies suggesting expression of P2Y1R and P2Y2R at the basolateral membrane and of P2X7R at the luminal membrane of salivary and pancreatic ducts (5Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because of overlap of stimulation by various P2R agonists, however, functional localization of P2Rs is not conclusive. A more definitive localization became possible with the availability of P2R-specific antibodies. The antibodies should be particularly useful for localization of P2Rs when access to the luminal membrane for functional studies is limited, as in secretory acinar cells. Although the antibodies have been applied extensively to localize P2Rs in neuronal and muscle tissues (for example, see Refs. 11Xiang Z. Bo X. Burnstock G. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and 12Afework M. Burnstock G. Cells Tissues Organs. 2000; 167: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we found only one study in which antibodies were used to localize P2Y2R exclusively to the basolateral membrane and P2Y4R to the luminal membrane of strial marginal cells and vestibular dark cells (13Sage C.L. Marcus D.C. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present work, we used antibodies to localize the P2X7R to the luminal membrane of salivary gland acinar and duct cells. A particularly intriguing P2X receptor is the P2X7R, which functions as a nonselective Ca2+-permeable cation channel (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Although all P2XRs function as nonselective cation channels, only persistent activation of P2X7Rs induces a sustained rise in Ca2+ that ultimately leads to apoptosis (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in several cells (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar), including parotid acinar cells (14Gibbons S.J. Washburn K.B. Talamo B.R. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 2001; 21: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), P2X7Rs are associated with formation of large pores that admit molecules of Mr ∼ 1000. However, pore formation and generation of membrane blebs are not common to all cells (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism of pore formation, except that it requires the long cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of P2X7R (15Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Recent work indicates that P2X7Rs interact with several cytoskeletal proteins in cellular microdomains (16Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and that the C termini of P2X7Rs bind to the family of epithelial membrane proteins, which could mediate membrane blebbing (17Wilson H.L. Wilson S.A. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34017-34023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interaction with specific membrane and cytoskeletal proteins may thus cause the cell-specific behavior of P2X7R. Here, we show the differential behavior of P2X7R in parotid gland acinar and duct cells. Activation of P2X7R in acinar cells involved slow assembly of the receptors and their subsequent rapid gating by ATP. This behavior could be attributed to the role of the cytoskeleton in channel assembly. By contrast, P2X7Rs were preassembled in duct cells and displayed only rapid gating by ATP and were not influenced by modification of the cytoskeleton. Materials and Solutions—Anti-P2X7R antibodies were purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). All nucleotides and PPADS were from Sigma. Fura-2/AM was from Tef Laboratories (Austin, TX). The bath solution (Solution A) contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). This solution was supplemented with 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to form the solution that was used for gland digestion. The standard solution was the bath solution during the recording of whole cell current. The pipette solution contained (in mm) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with NaOH), 1 MgCl2, 1 ATP, and the indicated concentration of EGTA. Na+-free solution was prepared by replacing NaCl with NMDG-Cl and titrating the pH with Tris base; Cl–-free solution was prepared by replacing all Cl– salts with gluconate salts. Preparation of RNA and RT-PCR Analysis—To prepare RNA, small segments of the main parotid duct were microdissected and carefully cleaned from adherent cells and connective tissue. The segments were cut, inspected for absence of acinar cells, blood capillaries, and cell debris, and transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes. The ducts were washed twice with Solution A, packed, and treated with Trizol to extract RNA. To prepare RNA from acinar cells, the glands were digested as described below, and the diluted digest was placed in a Petri dish. Small acinar clusters consisting of 3–5 cells were collected with a Pasteur pipette under microscopic examination to ensure lack of contamination with other cell types. The RNA was processed as above. RT-PCR was performed as detailed previously (5Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 2 ng of RNA was used for each RT-PCR reaction. One set of primers was used to identify the P2XRs expressed in parotid cells, and two nonoverlapping primer sets were used for identification of the P2X7Rs. All primers and reaction conditions are available upon request. The identity of all amplified products was verified by sequencing. Immunocytochemistry—Isolated cell clusters were allowed to attach to glass coverslips and then fixed and permeabilized with 0.5 ml of cold methanol or acetone for 10 min at –20 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm glycine, and nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of anti-P2X7R antibodies or the same dilution of antibodies that were incubated with a blocking peptide (control). Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG tagged with fluorescein. Actin was detected with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin that was added together with the secondary antibodies. Images were collected with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad model MRC 1024). Preparation of Single Parotid Acinar and Duct Cells—Parotid acinar and duct cells were isolated by minor modifications of a standard digestion protocol (18Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamine I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton C. Muallem S. Thomas P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C442-C455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse parotid glands were minced and treated with 0.025% trypsin for 7 min at 37 °C. After stopping the reaction with 1.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, the tissue was further digested for 20 min with 70 units/ml collagenase CLSPA. The cells were washed, suspended in solution A containing 1.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and kept on ice until use. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells in Solution A were incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature, washed once with Solution A and kept on ice until use. Samples of cells were plated on glass coverslips that formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber. After 2–3 min of incubation to allow cell attachment, the cells were continuously perfused with warmed (37 °C) solution A at a rate of 5 ml/min (30 chamber volumes/min). When Ca2+-free conditions were necessary, Ca2+ was omitted from solution A, and 0.2 mm EGTA was added. ATP was delivered to the cells by a custom-made rapid perfusion system. Fura-2/AM fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm using a PTI image acquisition and analysis system as detailed previously (19Shin D.M. Luo X. Wilkie T.M. Miller L.J. Peck A.B. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44146-44156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recording Current—The current was recorded using the whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique at the conditions described previously (20Lee M.G. Xu X. Zeng W. Diaz J. Wojcikiewicz R.J. Kuo T.H. Wuytack F. Racymaekers L. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15765-15770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), except that, unless otherwise specified, EGTA concentration in the pipette solution was adjusted to 0.5 mm for recording from acinar cells and to 10 mm for recording from duct cells. Pipette resistance was 3–7 megohms and the access resistance was about 10 megohms. Tight seals of 5–8 gigohms were formed on the cell surface, and the whole cell configuration was obtained by gentle suction. The current was recorded using the Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier. Data was collected at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. During whole cell recording the membrane potential was held at –40 mV. Agonist Delivery System—ATP and other agents were delivered to the cells by a custom-made rapid solution-exchange system. All agents were dissolved daily in external solution and delivered by gravity flow from a row of capillaries that were connected to a series of independent reservoirs placed within 100 μm of the cell examined. The rapid solution-exchange system was controlled by shifting the capillary array horizontally. The system included a bundle of 12 silicon capillaries of 200-μm inner diameter each that was attached to a joystick-controlled micromanipulator (Eppendorf). The reservoir of each capillary was controlled by an on-off valve. Continuous bath perfusion provided a counterflow to the solution containing the agonist so that stimulation could be rapidly terminated by setting the valve to the “off” position. Stimulation was initiated by advancing the required capillary to the cell and setting the valve to the “on” position. The proximity of the capillaries to the cell allowed stimulation within 1–2 s. The capillaries were filled with bath solution that contained the desired agonist concentration and a food coloring dye to allow visualization of solution application. P2Rs in Parotid Gland Cells—To analyze the P2XRs expressed in parotid gland cells, small acinar clusters and duct fragments were used to prepare mRNA. This avoided duct and acinar cell cross-contamination and contamination with nerve terminals and blood vessels. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that parotid acinar and duct cells express P2X4 and P2X7 receptors. Positive controls were obtained for all receptors analyzed in Fig. 1 using mRNA prepared from brain tissue (not shown), and similar results were found in submandibular gland acinar and duct cells. The availability of anti-P2X7R antibodies allowed localization of the receptors at specific membrane domains (Fig. 1, C–J). This is particularly useful for acinar cells, in which the luminal membrane is not accessible for direct recording. P2X7Rs are expressed at only the luminal membrane of both cell types (arrowheads in Fig. 1, C–J). This finding is consistent with the effect of luminal, but not basolateral, BzATP on [Ca2+]i in salivary and pancreatic ducts (5Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). P2X7Rs interact with the cytoskeleton (16Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 17Wilson H.L. Wilson S.A. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34017-34023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and modification of the actin cytoskeleton affects P2X7R function in acinar cells (see below). Therefore, it was of interest to test the effect of actin disassembly and actin solidification on the localization of P2X7Rs in acinar cells. Fig. 1, E–J, shows that P2X7Rs are localized at close proximity to the actin at the terminal web. However, neither dissociation (Fig. 1, G and H) nor solidification (Fig. 1, I and J) of the actin cytoskeleton had a noticeable effect on P2X7R localization at the resolution of the confocal microscope. Salivary gland cells express P2Rs in the basolateral and luminal membrane (10Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression is membrane-specific with P2Y1R in the basolateral membrane 2X. Luo and S. Muallem, unpublished data. and P2X7R in the luminal membrane (Fig. 1). This can be an ideal paracrine regulatory system that senses and responds to the energetic state of the cell and communicates with the nervous system to control glandular activity. ATP could be released from purinergic nerve terminals to the basolateral membrane to stimulate the P2Y1Rs. At the same time, acinar cells could release ATP to the lumen to stimulate the P2X7Rs at the luminal membrane of acinar and duct cells. It has in fact been reported that cholinergic stimulation releases ATP stored in secretory granules to the lumen of pancreatic acinar cells (23Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Hence, the more exocytosis, the more energy consumed and the more ATP released to stimulate the P2Rs in both acinar and duct cells. P2Rs may thus serve to coordinate events at the basolateral and luminal membranes and tune the critical functions of these cells. Ca2+Signaling by P2Rs—All P2Rs increase [Ca2+]i (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar, 2Leipziger J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F419-F432Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 3Communi D. Janssens R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26799-26808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We are interested in the possible physiological role of P2X7Rs in salivary glands and, therefore, compared the [Ca2+]i response of parotid acinar and duct cells to stimulation by ATP, which activates all P2R types but at different apparent affinity (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Acinar and duct cells responded somewhat differently to ATP (Fig. 2). First, duct cells were more sensitive to ATP stimulation than acinar cells. Moreover, at 5 mm ATP, duct cells continued to display a peak plateau response, whereas [Ca2+]i in acinar cells continued to rise slowly after the initial peak. Because the slow rise in [Ca2+]i was observed only at 5 mm ATP, it likely reflects the activity of the P2X7Rs, which are activated at a higher ATP concentration than all other P2Rs. The differential response of duct and acinar cells provided the first clue that the P2X7Rs might behave differently in the two cell types. To examine this dissimilarity further, it was necessary to isolate activation of the P2X7Rs. To do so, we recorded the current in the P2X7Rs because these receptors function as nonselective cation channels (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). P2X7Rs in Acinar and Duct Cells—Previous work reported that P2X7Rs increase [Ca2+]i and induce pores that admit large molecules into parotid acinar cells (14Gibbons S.J. Washburn K.B. Talamo B.R. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 2001; 21: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), possibly leading to apoptosis. However, the mode of activation of current in acinar cells and the P2X7R current in duct cells have not been characterized. To address this, we had to isolate a cellular response generated by stimulation of the P2X7Rs in the two cell types. In the presence of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), P2X7Rs have lower apparent affinity for ATP, because the ligand for the receptors is ATP4– (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Therefore, to activate the P2X7Rs, the cells were stimulated with 5 mm ATP, which is sufficient to activate all P2Rs. Isolation of the current mediated by P2X7Rs was achieved by buffering the cytosol with EGTA. The effect of EGTA on whole cell current in response to stimulation with 5 mm ATP is illustrated in Fig. 3. When the pipette solution was lightly buffered with 50 μm EGTA, stimulation of cells with 5 mm ATP held at –40 mV resulted in a three-phase signal in both cell types: an initial inward current was followed by an outward current and then a sustained inward current (Fig. 3, A and C). Salivary gland cells have been shown to express several Ca2+-activated Cl– and K+ channels (27Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Textbook of Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar), which were probably responsible for part of the initial inward and outward currents that was activated by the [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 2). This was confirmed by increasing the EGTA concentration in the pipette solution. Interestingly, whereas increasing the pipette EGTA concentration to 0.2 mm blocked the initial changes in current within acinar cells (Fig. 3B), it was necessary to increase pipette (and therefore cytosolic) EGTA concentration to 10 mm to eliminate the initial inward current (Fig. 3E). 0.5 mm EGTA was sufficient to block the outward, but not the initial inward, current in duct cells. This may reflect either differential sensitivity of the initial inward current to [Ca2+]i in acinar and duct cells or variable access of EGTA to the channels at plasma membrane microdomains. Irrespectively, these experiments demonstrate that the inward current mediated by the P2X7Rs could be isolated by including a high concentration of EGTA in the pipette solution and stimulating the cells with 5 mm ATP. Therefore, unless indicated otherwise, in all subsequent experiments the pipette solution contained 0.5 or 10 mm EGTA during current recording in acinar and duct cells, respectively. Parotid cells express P2X4Rs and P2X7Rs. Activation of P2X4Rs saturates at 100 μm ATP irrespective of the concentration of divalent ions in the incubation medium (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). Importantly, under the conditions of Fig. 3, B and E, 0.2 mm ATP did not activate any current, providing the first evidence that most of the current under these conditions was mediated by the P2X7Rs. Because salivary gland and pancreatic cells do respond to ATPγS (a ligand for P2X4Rs but not P2X7Rs) by a transient [Ca2+]i increase (5Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zeng W. Lee M.G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

It is possible that the P2X4Rs mediate only a small current or that they were rapidly desensitized under the experimental conditions employed t"

This reaction is performed by molecular motors translocating nucleic acid against the concentration gradient at the expense of NTP hydrolysis. At present, the molecular mechanisms of packaging remain elusive due to the complex nature of packaging motors. In the case of the double-stranded RNA bacteriophage φ6 from the Cystoviridae family, packaging of single-stranded genomic precursors requires a hexameric NTPase, P4. In the present study, the purified P4 proteins from two other cystoviruses, φ8 and φ13, were characterized and compared with φ6 P4. All three proteins are hexameric, single-stranded RNA-stimulated NTPases with α/β folds. Using a direct motor assay, we found that φ8 and φ13 P4 hexamers translocate 5′ to 3′ along ssRNA, whereas the analogous activity of φ6 P4 requires association with the procapsid. This difference is explained by the intrinsically high affinity of φ8 and φ13 P4s for nucleic acids. The unidirectional translocation results in RNA helicase activity. Thus, P4 proteins of Cystoviridae exhibit extensive similarity to hexameric helicases and are simple models for studying viral packaging motor mechanisms.

In the case of the double-stranded RNA bacteriophage φ6 from the Cystoviridae family, packaging of single-stranded genomic precursors requires a hexameric NTPase, P4. In the present study, the purified P4 proteins from two other cystoviruses, φ8 and φ13, were characterized and compared with φ6 P4. All three proteins are hexameric, single-stranded RNA-stimulated NTPases with α/β folds. Using a direct motor assay, we found that φ8 and φ13 P4 hexamers translocate 5′ to 3′ along ssRNA, whereas the analogous activity of φ6 P4 requires association with the procapsid. This difference is explained by the intrinsically high affinity of φ8 and φ13 P4s for nucleic acids. The unidirectional translocation results in RNA helicase activity. Thus, P4 proteins of Cystoviridae exhibit extensive similarity to hexameric helicases and are simple models for studying viral packaging motor mechanisms. A number of biological systems rely on active transport of nucleic acids (NA) 1The abbreviations used are: NAnucleic acid(s)dsRNAdouble-stranded RNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAPCprocapsidssRNAsingle-stranded RNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNAntnucleotideCODcomplementary oligonucleotide displacementAMP-PCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateWTwild type. powered by the hydrolysis of NTPs. This is observed in prokaryotic organisms, for example, during cell division, conjugation, and sporulation (1Errington J. Bath J. Wu L.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). NTP-dependent translocation is also utilized by many DNA viruses for genome encapsidation, or “packaging,” into preformed capsids, examples including herpesviruses and adenoviruses, as well as tailed bacteriophages, such as φ29, λ, P22, and T4 (2Baumann R.G.

Genome packaging is best understood for the dsDNA bacteriophage φ29, whose portal complex serves as a packaging engine (8Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D. Adv. Virus Res. 2002; 58: 255-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complex contains three components: 1) the head-tail connector, a dodecamer of protein p10, attached to a unique 5-fold prohead vertex; 2) a multimeric ring of packaging RNAs; and 3) a homomultimeric ATPase composed of protein p16 (6Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O. He Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H. Morais M.C. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 8Grimes S. Jardine P.J. Anderson D. Adv. Virus Res. 2002; 58: 255-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The portal of φ29 can translocate DNA against loads up to 57 piconewtons and therefore is one of the most powerful molecular motors in nature (9Smith D.E. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Portal complexes of many other DNA bacteriophages are organized similarly to φ29, although the packaging RNA requirement is limited to φ29-related phages (10Meijer W.J. Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA translocation in these systems is often accompanied by the processing of genomic DNA concatemers (terminase activity) (3Catalano C.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 128-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 11Hendrix R.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because the φ29 p16 and terminases of others bacteriophages have been shown to catalyze NTP hydrolysis in vitro, these proteins are thought to generate the energy for the packaging reaction (12Ibarra B. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4264-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the energy is somehow transmitted from the transiently associated terminase to the packaging RNA ring and connector, which in turn effects unidirectional DNA translocation (6Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O. He Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H. Morais M.C. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 13Guo P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 415-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the complexity of the portal structures in DNA viruses has made it difficult to elucidate the packaging mechanism experimentally. In vitro packaging of dsRNA viruses has been accomplished only for bacteriophages φ6 and φ8 of the Cystoviridae family, which infect the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (14Mindich L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 149-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun Y. Qiao X. Qiao J. Onodera S. Mindich L. Virology. 2003; 308: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All cystoviruses contain a lipid envelope and a tripartite dsRNA genome composed of S, M, and L segments. Similarly to φ29, φ6 packaging can be assayed in vitro using recombinant empty particles, called procapsids (PCs) and (+) sense ssRNA genome precursors s+, m+, and l+, respectively (14Mindich L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 149-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Segment s+ is packaged first, followed by m+ and l+ (16Qiao X. Qiao J. Mindich L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4074-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The specificity of packaging is due to the pac sites located within the 5′-terminal ∼300-nt regions of all three RNA precursors (14Mindich L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 149-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pirttimaa M.J. Bamford D.H. RNA. 2000; 6: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The φ6 PC consists of four virus-encoded proteins, P1, P2, P4, and P7. P1 forms the structural framework of the PC (18Butcher S.J. Dokland T. Ojala P.M. Bamford D.H. Fuller S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4477-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). P2 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that replicates and transcribes the packaged RNA (19Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6275-6284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P7 is important for PC stability and proper functioning (21Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Poranen M.M. Paatero A.O. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Comparison between the wild-type and protein-deficient φ6 PC has shown that P4 is essential for RNA packaging (23Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Pirttimaa M.J. Paatero A.O. Frilander M.J. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). P4 sequence contains characteristic NTPase motifs, which are conserved among the Cystoviridae (Fig. 1), although there is no other detectable sequence identity. Indeed, the purified φ6 P4 is an unspecific NTPase, hydrolyzing ribo-, deoxyribo-, and dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (25Gottlieb P. Strassman J. Mindich L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6220-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Paatero A.O. Syvaoja J.E. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6729-6734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The φ6 P4 forms doughnut-shaped hexamers in the presence of divalent cations and ATP or ADP, and the NTPase activity is associated only with the multimeric form. The NTPase activity is weakly stimulated by ssRNA (27Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of φ6 PC has localized P4 hexamers to the particle 5-fold vertices, thus constituting a symmetry mismatch (28de Haas F. Paatero A.O. Mindich L. Bamford D.H. Fuller S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our recent micrographs of φ8 subviral particles show that the localization of P4 is likely to be similar for other cystoviruses (29Yang H. Makeyev E.V. Butcher S.J. Gaidelyte A. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The symmetry mismatch is also typical for packaging motors of tailed bacteriophages, and it has been proposed to facilitate rotation of the portal during nucleic acid translocation (11Hendrix R.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although P4 NTPase activity is essential for RNA packaging (24Pirttimaa M.J. Paatero A.O. Frilander M.J. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is still unknown whether P4 alone constitutes the packaging motor or if other PC proteins are also involved. In addition, the details of the mechanochemical coupling during RNA packaging in dsRNA viruses are poorly understood, a situation similar to the genome packaging in DNA viruses. The existing RNA packaging assays are based on precursor RNase protection, cosedimentation with the PC, and replication inside the PC (14Mindich L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 149-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Poranen M.M. Paatero A.O. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Pirttimaa M.J. Paatero A.O. Frilander M.J. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Obviously, these assays do not permit direct demonstration of ssRNA translocation, and new approaches are needed to monitor the motor action. To address these issues, we developed a novel packaging assay based on complementary oligonucleotide displacement (COD), which is conceptually similar to helicase assays (30Kadare G. Haenni A.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this approach, we showed that P4 proteins, isolated from bacteriophages φ8 and φ13 (31Hoogstraten D. Qiao X. Sun Y. Hu A. Onodera S. Mindich L. Virology. 2000; 272: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Qiao X. Qiao J. Onodera S. Mindich L. Virology. 2000; 275: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), specifically translocate ssRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction at the expense of NTP hydrolysis. Other types of nucleic acids are bound but not translocated. We also demonstrated that the packaging motors of the Cystoviridae share structural and biochemical characteristics with hexameric helicases. Because of their simplicity, these P4 proteins constitute an attractive model system for delineating the translocation mechanism and mechano-chemical coupling. P4 Expression and Purification—φ6 and φ8 P4s were purified as described (27Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Kainov D.E. Butcher S.J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To construct a φ13 P4 expression plasmid, pDK3, gene 4 was PCR-amplified from the φ13 L segment cDNA (plasmid pLM2200) (32Qiao X. Qiao J. Onodera S. Mindich L. Virology. 2000; 275: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using recombinant Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotides 5′-AGGGATGTCATATGACTGACGAAAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCGGAAGCTTCAACATAAACAGCTCCT-3′. The PCR fragment was inserted into the vector pT7–7 (34Tabor S. Asubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing & Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 8322-8328Google Scholar) at the NdeI-HindIII sites. Soluble φ13 P4 was produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pDK3 as described for φ8 P4 (33Kainov D.E. Butcher S.J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NTPase Assays—The NTPase activity of the purified P4 proteins was assayed in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 75 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm unlabeled NTP, and 0.5 μCi of the relevant [α-32P]NTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The final P4 concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and 1 μl of the reactions were analyzed on polyethyleneimine-cellulose F TLC plates (Merck). Chromatograms were developed as described (26Paatero A.O. Syvaoja J.E. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6729-6734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of radioactivity in the nucleotide spots was measured using a phosphor imager (Fuji BAS 1500). The steady-state rate of NTP hydrolysis was studied as the rate of phosphate release using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The concentration of Pi was proportional to the absorbance at 360 nm. The calibration was done using standard KH2PO4 solutions. Steady-state kinetics of phosphate release was measured using a Victor2 plate reader (Wallac-PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ATP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, ribohomopolymers (poly(G), poly(A), poly(U), and poly(G)) were from Sigma (concentrations reported in moles of nucleotide), and E. coli rRNA (16 and 23 S) was from Roche Applied Science. The rate of NTP hydrolysis (measured by phosphate release), v, was described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics as follows,ν[P]=kcat[S]Km+[S](Eq. 1) where Km represents the Michaelis constant and kcat is the enzyme turnover number. RNA Substrates—RNA oligonucleotides RNA2 (5′-GUUUUCACCCUAUCCUCCCC-3′) and RNA3 (5′-CGACUCAUGGACCUUGGGAG-3′) were labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (35Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 1017-1019Google Scholar) and purified through P-6 spin columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Synthetic ssRNAs were produced by run-off transcription in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (19Makeyev E.V. Bamford D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 124-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNAs sR5, s(Δ11–23)R5, s(Δ11–32)R5, and s(Δ11–43)R5 were transcribed from the EcoRV-cut plasmids pLM659, pLM1771, pLM1772, and pLM1773, respectively (16Qiao X. Qiao J. Mindich L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4074-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Gottlieb P. Strassman J. Qiao X. Frilander M. Frucht A. Mindich L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNAs (residues 72–136) was transcribed from a pLM659 PCR fragment amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAGGATAGGGT-3′ (T7 promoter sequence italicized) and 5′-CGACTCATGGACCTTGGGAG-3′ as up- and downstream primers, respectively. To produce the RNA1 probe, plasmid pEM21 was constructed by inserting the duplex of two complementary oligonucleotides, 5′-CTAGATCGGTAACCTCGGTCAGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CTGACCGAGGTTACCGAT-3′, at the XbaI-KpnI sites of the pGEM3Zf(+) vector (Promega). The resultant plasmid was linearized with HindIII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. All transcripts were precipitated with 3 m LiCl, reprecipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in sterile water. COD Assays—The COD activity of PCs was assayed under the conditions optimized for RNA packaging (37Frilander M. Bamford D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Complete and protein-deficient PCs were produced as described (24Pirttimaa M.J. Paatero A.O. Frilander M.J. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10122-10127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To prepare RNA duplex substrates, unlabeled RNAs were mixed with 32P-labeled RNA probes in hybridization buffer containing 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.75 mm EDTA. The solution was boiled for 2 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. If necessary, residual nonannealed probe was removed by passing the mixture through a Sephacryl S-300 spin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA. COD assay mixtures (25 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm NH4Ac, 6% polyethyleneglycol 4000, 1 mm ATP or its nonhydrolyzable analog AMP-PCP, 1 unit/μl rRNasin (Promega), ∼1.5 μg of PCs, and 0.2 μg of an RNA duplex. The reactions were usually incubated for 1–2 h at 30 °C and transferred to ice. The volume was then brought to 100 μl with 0.13 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma) in water, followed by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The samples were dissolved in Tris-EDTA and analyzed by native 7% PAGE (in standard Tris borate-EDTA buffer) at room temperature. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS 1500). For P4 proteins, the COD assay was performed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm nucleotide (NTP, NDP, or AMP-PNP), 0.1 μg of RNA duplex, and 0.05 μg of P4. The reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 1 h; stopped by adding 2 μl of 15% glycerol, 20 mm EDTA, 3% SDS; and analyzed by native PAGE as above. Gel Shift Assays—φ6, φ8, and φ13 P4s (at 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 mg/ml, respectively) were incubated for 15 min on ice with RNA or DNA substrates (0.1 mg/ml) in 7.5-μl mixtures containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl. Thereafter, 2.5 μl of 15% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 7.5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25% bromphenol blue was added, and the samples were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel (× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, 5 V/cm, 90 min). Dynamic Light Scattering—The hydrodynamic properties of individual proteins were studied using a batch dynamic light scattering instrument (Precision Detectors) equipped with deconvolution software for correlation function analysis (33Kainov D.E. Butcher S.J. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Raman Spectroscopy—Protein solutions were concentrated (to ∼20 mg/ml each), sealed in sterile capillaries (Kimax 34504), and thermostated at 5 °C. Raman spectra were recorded on a Spex 500M spectrograph equipped with a notch filter and charge-coupled device detector (SpectrumOne; Instruments S.A., Edison, NJ) using a spectral slit width of 4 cm–1. A solid state, diode-pumped, frequency-doubled Nd: YVO4 laser (model Verdi λem = 532 nm; Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) was used to obtain 150 milliwatts at the sample. Each spectrum represents the accumulation of 15 exposures of 2-min duration on each of two independently prepared protein solutions. Spectra were corrected for buffer and NTP contributions and normalized for difference computations as described previously (38Benevides J.M. Juuti J.T. Tuma R. Bamford D.H. Thomas Jr., G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11946-11953Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The positions of strong bands are reported with ±1-cm–1 accuracy, whereas those of weak and broad bands are reported with ±2-cm–1 accuracy. Small Angle Neutron Scattering—φ8 P4 was concentrated to 4 mg/ml and dialyzed against D2O buffer solution (20 mm Tris-DCl, 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2). The sample was filtered and centrifuged (Beckman Airfuge; rotor A-95, 90,000 rpm, 10 min), and supernatant was transferred into a thermostated quartz sample cell (2-mm path, 20 °C). The SANS data were collected on beam line D22 (Institute Laue Langevin; Grenoble, France) using a collimation distance of 4.4 m, neutron wave-length of 0.6 nm, and a 4-m sample-detector distance. The data were processed as described (39Ikonen T. Kainov D.K. Timmins P. Serimaa R. Tuma R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 525-529Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) to obtain an averaged and corrected scattering curve. The curve was modeled by scattering from a set of dummy atoms using the DAMMIN program (40Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) and imposing 6-fold symmetry. Cryoelectron Microscopy—For cryoelectron microscopy, samples of 0.1 mg/ml φ8 P4 and 0.25 mg/ml φ13 P4 in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2) were vitrified as described elsewhere (29Yang H. Makeyev E.V. Butcher S.J. Gaidelyte A. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The data were collected at –180 °C (Oxford CT3500 cryospecimen holder) in an FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun transmission electron microscope (Electron Microscopy Unit, University of Helsinki) operating at 200 kV. The images were recorded under low dose conditions on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 film at a magnification of ×50,000 (φ8) or ×62,000 (φ13). The micrographs were scanned on a Z/I imaging Photoscan TD flat bed scanner in 12-bit gray scale mode at a raster step of 7 μm, corresponding to 1.4 Å/pixel (φ8 P4) and 1.13 Å/pixel (φ13 P4) in the image. Individual particles were picked manually from the scans using EMAN (41Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the Spider program package (42Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Reference-free alignment was used for the averaging (43Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). No symmetry constraints were applied. P4 Proteins Are Ring-shaped Hexamers with an α/β Fold—φ6 P4 has been previously shown to assemble into donut-like hexamers in the presence of nucleotides and divalent metal ions (27Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28de Haas F. Paatero A.O. Mindich L. Bamford D.H. Fuller S.D. J. Mol.

The apparent molecular masses of φ6, φ8, and φ13 P4s deduced by gel filtration and light scattering were ∼212, ∼202, and ∼220 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2C), as expected for the hexameric forms (predicted masses of 210, 204.6, and 225.6 kDa, respectively).Table IProperties of purified P4 proteinsφ8 P4φ13 P4φ6 P4Subunit mass (kDa)aDeduced from the cDNA sequence assuming that the N-terminal Met is removed.34.137.635.0Multimeric statusbAccording to analytical gel filtration and calibrated light scattering (33).HexamerHexamerHexamer (unstable in the absence of nucleotides)cData from Refs. 22 and 27.Hydrodynamic radius (nm) and shapedDetermined by dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy.rh = 5.1; ringrh = 5.9; ringrh = 5.9; ringcData from Refs. 22 and 27.RNA stimulation of NTPase activityStrongWeakWeakNucleic acid bindingTightTightUndetectableCOD activityStrongModerateUndetectablea Deduced from the cDNA sequence assuming that the N-terminal Met is removed.b According to analytical gel filtration and calibrated light scattering (33Kainov D.E.

Open table in a new tab The oligomeric status and shape of each P4 was confirmed by electron microscopy. Examination of several thousand vitrified P4 molecules revealed primarily ring-shaped molecules, indicating a preferential orientation for the particles in a vitrified water layer. Reference-free alignment and averaging images revealed hexameric rings for both φ8 and φ13 P4 (Fig. 2D). The inner diameter of the φ8 P4 ring was ∼3.0 nm, and the outer diameter was ∼12.1 nm. Similarly, the φ13 P4 ring exhibits an inner diameter of ∼2.8 nm and outer diameter of ∼12.1 nm. These data agree well with those published earlier for the φ6 P4 (27Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28de Haas F. Paatero A.O. Mindich L. Bamford D.H. Fuller S.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The average image of φ8 P4 is in good agreement with a small angle solution scattering-based model, which revealed a funnel shaped hexamer with a two-dimensional projection similar to the electron microscopy average (Fig. 2E). We also examined the secondary structure of the three P4 proteins using Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra have been widely employed to compare the secondary structures of viral proteins (44Thomas Jr., G.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 45Thomas Jr., G.J. Biopolymers. 2002; 67: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In particular, Raman spectral intensities of the backbone amide I vibrations (range 1630–1700 cm–1) corresponding to pure classes of secondary structures (i.e. α-helices, β-sheet, and undefined structures) are well documented both experimentally and theoretically (46Bandekar J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The amide I signatures of P4 proteins from the three cystoviruses are compared in Fig. 2B. Each exhibits a broad amide I band with an apparent maximum between 1660 and 1670 cm–1 (β-strand) and shoulders at both higher (turns and extended structures) and lower (α-helix) wave number values. This spectral signature is typical of α/β proteins that bind and hydrolyze nucleotides (27Juuti J.T. Bamford D.H. Tuma R. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite the overall similarity of the subunit folds, significant differences are apparent. The P4 amide I band of φ8 is much sharper and displays a distinct peak position (1663 cm–1) reflecting lesser α-helical structure and greater β-strand structure than the P4s of φ6 and φ13. On the other hand, the broader amide I band of the φ13 P4 spectrum indicates a greater α-helical content. P4 Proteins Are RNA-stimulated NTPases—φ6 P4 is known to be an unspecific NTPase (26Paatero A.O. Syvaoja J.E. Bamford D.H. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6729-6734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assayed NTPase activities of P4s from the other two phages. The proteins were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of either purine (ATP) or pyrimidine (UTP) NTPs, and the reaction products were analyzed by TLC (Fig. 3A). It is obvious that isolated φ13 P4 also possesses a readily detectable NTPase activity, hydrolyzing both types of NTPs into NDP and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 5). In comparison, hexameric φ8 P4 appears to be a very poor NTPase (Fig. 3A). In order to establish nucleotide substrate specificity, we have determined the kcat and Km for the P4 proteins and"

Here we report the 2.5-Å crystal structure of the homodimeric Citrobacter freundii dihydroxyacetone kinase complex with an ATP analogue and dihydroxyacetone. The N-terminal domain consists of two α/β-folds with a molecule of dihydroxyacetone covalently bound in hemiaminal linkage to the Nϵ2 of His-220. The C-terminal domain consists of a regular eight-helix α-barrel. The eight helices form a deep pocket, which includes a tightly bound phospholipid. Only the lipid headgroup protrudes from the surface. The nucleotide is bound on the top of the barrel across from the entrance to the lipid pocket. The phosphate groups are coordinated by two Mg2+ ions to γ-carboxyl groups of aspartyl residues. The ATP binding site does not contain positively charged or aromatic groups. Paralogues of dihydroxyacetone kinase also occur in association with transcription regulators and proteins of unknown function pointing to biological roles beyond triose metabolism.

Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function of this enzyme and the metabolic origin of its substrate, Dha. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DhaP) can be formed by aldol cleavage of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, by isomerization from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and by oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate in the mitochondrial glycerol phosphate shuttle. DhaP is an obligatory precursor of glyceryl ether phospholipid biosynthesis (2Voet D. Voet J.G. Pratt C.W. Fundamentals of Biochemistry, 1st Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Free Dha plays a pivotal role in methanol assimilation by methylotrophic yeast and plants where it is produced in the transketolase reaction between xylulose-5-phosphate and formaldehyde catalyzed by dihydroxyacetone synthase (3Kimura T.

Bacteria produce free Dha by oxidation of glycerol under anaerobic conditions and aldol cleavage of fructose-6-phosphate (9Forage R.G. Lin E.C. J.

Dha is a carbon source for bacteria, and if added to the medium, it is also used as gluconeogenic precursor by mammalian tissues (14Azzout B. Chanez M. Bois-Joyeux B. Peret J. J. Nutr. 1984; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Cortez M.Y. Torgan C.E. Brozinick J.T. Miller R.H. Ivy J.L. Am. J. Clin.

Although the pathways utilizing free Dha appear few and limited in scope, genes for Dha kinases and Dha kinase homologues are widely distributed among plants and animals where their biological function is not obvious (for a survey see accession numbers PF02733 and PF02734 at www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/index.shtml). Dha like other triose sugars has an increased propensity to react with proteins in Maillard-type reactions (19Nguyen B.C. Kochevar I.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 655-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Tessier F.J. Monnier V.M. Sayre L.A. Kornfield J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 369: 705-719Crossref Google Scholar), because unlike hexoses and pentoses, it cannot be deactivated by formation of cyclic hemiacetals. The chemical reactivity of Dha might be the rationale for its use as a therapeutic tanning agent (21Asawanonda P. Oberlender S. Taylor C. Int. J. Dermatol. 1999; 38: 916-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Fesq H. Brockow K. Strom K. Mempel M. Ring J. Abeck D. Dermatology. 2001; 203: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Dha can be toxic to yeast cells and that detoxification is dependent on a functional Dha kinase (23Molin M. Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Scavenging of reactive Dha might be an additional function of Dha kinases and could explain its occurrence in organisms that do not normally metabolize Dha. Dha might be formed as a byproduct by phosphatases and aldolases of limited specificity or in paracatalytic reactions such as the accidental oxidation of Schiff-base intermediates (24Cogoli-Greuter M. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5708-5711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two representative examples of Dha kinases are the ATP-dependent Dha kinase of Citrobacter freundii (Swiss Protein Data Bank accession number P45510) (25Daniel R. Stuertz K. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4392-4401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Daniel R. Boenigk R. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2151-2156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the PTS-dependent kinase complex of Escherichia coli (1Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Beutler R. Kämpfer U. Schaller J. Erni B.

Saier M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2343-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Dha kinase of C. freundii consists of two domains, which we term K- and L-domains. The E. coli kinase consists of two catalytic subunits DhaK and DhaL (Swiss Protein Data Bank accession numbers P76015 and P76014) and a third phosphoryl donor subunit DhaM (P37349) as shown in Equations 1, 2, 3.Dhakinase(C.f.)ATP+Dha→DhaP+ADP(Eq. 1) Enzl,HPr(E.c.)PEP+DhaM(His)→DhaM(His∼P)+Prv(Eq. 2) DhaK::DhaL(E.c.)DhaM(His∼P)+Dha→DhaP+DhaM(His)(Eq. 3) dihydroxyacetone phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system adenylylimidodiphosphonate Dha-binding subunit of the E. coli Dha kinase small subunit of the E. coli Dha kinase multiwavelength anomalous dispersion helix 1. The K- and L-domains display 36 and 28% amino acid sequence identity with the DhaK and DhaL subunits, respectively. DhaM is a multiphosphoryl protein of the PTS with sequence similarity to the IIAMan domain of the mannose transporter (Protein Data Bank code entry 1PDO) (30Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol.

Delbaere L.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal domain of enzyme I (Protein Data Bank code entry 1ZYM) (32Liao D.I. Silverton E. Seok Y.J. Lee B.R. Peterkofsky A. Davies D.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the DhaK subunit of E. coli in complex with its substrate has recently been solved at 1.75 Å (33Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Dha is bound in hemiaminal linkage to the imidazole nitrogen of an invariant histidine. It has been proposed that Dha kinases exploit the chemical reactivity of the carbonyl group to discriminate between the potentially toxic Dha and the structurally similar compatible solute glycerol (33Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, glycerol kinases cannot discriminate between the two substrates (10Johnson E.A. Burke S.K. Forage R.G. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 55-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present the x-ray structure of the full-length Dha kinase of C. freundii in complex with Dha, an ATP analogue and a phospholipid. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The dhaK gene was PCR-amplified with C. freundii genomic DNA as template and primers encoding NsiI and BglII restriction sites. The PCR fragments were digested with NsiI and BglII and ligated with a plasmid vector obtained by digestion of pTSGH11 (35Lanz R. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with the same enzymes. The recombinant dhaK gene encodes a Dha kinase with a C-terminal His tag. The point mutations D380A, D385A, D387A, and T388H in DhaK of C. freundii and D30A, D35A, D37A, H38T, H38C, H38A in DhaL of E. coli were introduced using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) and primers encoding the mutation and a diagnostic restriction site. Successful mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. Standard procedures were used for plasmid purification, restriction analysis, ligation, and transformation. Protein Purification and Activity assay—The Dha kinase of C. freundii was overexpressed in E. coli K12 WA2127Δ HIC (Δ manXYZ Δ ptsHIcrr) (36Mao Q. Schunk T. Gerber B. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18295-18300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells (3 liters) were grown at 37 °C and induced with 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 = 0.8, and incubation continued for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the sediment was resuspended in buffer A (25 ml, 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm NaCl), broken by two passages in a French pressure cell, and fractionated by differential centrifugation into cell debris (10 min, 3000 × g), membrane fraction (60 min, 150,000 × g), and cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant), which was mixed with 10 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and allowed to adsorb for 30 min. The resin was transferred to a column washed with 100 ml buffer A containing 0 and 50 mm imidazole. The His-tagged protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole in the same buffer, concentrated, and purified by gel filtration over Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) with a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Seleno-Met-Dha kinase was prepared using the methionine pathway inhibition method (37Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar) and purified like the native protein. The presence of seleno-Met was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (results not shown). Dha kinase was concentrated to 30–50 mg ml-1 in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol. Kinase activity was measured in a coupled assay by reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate with glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as described previously (1Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with ATP instead of phosphoenolpyruvate plus PTS proteins as phosphoryl donor. The disappearance of NADH was monitored continuously in a Spectramax-250 plate reader at 30 °C. Crystallisation and Data Collection—(Seleno-Met)-Dha kinase was crystallized in buffer B (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm NaCl, 9% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000, and 25% (v/v) glycerol) using sitting dropvapor diffusion. Crystals belong to the space group C2221 with cell dimensions of a = 100.4 Å, b = 124.6 Å, and c = 236.4 Å and contain one dimer per asymmetric unit. For ANP and Dha complexed Dha kinase, native protein crystals were soaked with 5 mm ANP, 10 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2, and 2 mm Dha for 3 h at 20 °C in buffer B. The best crystals of the native protein diffracted to 2.5 Å after flash-freezing at 105 K in buffer B. Native diffraction data were collected at the Swiss Norwegian Beamline at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) employing a MAR345 image plate detector (Xrayresearch, Hamburg, Germany). The seleno-Met x-ray data sets were measured at beamline BW7A at the EMBL Hamburg Outstation at the DESY using a MAR CCD-165 detector. Because of the smaller area of the detector, which caused reflection overlap, and also because of the inferior quality of the selenomethionine crystals, data were only collected to a resolution of 3.5 Å. Three data sets were collected at peak (0.9743 Å), remote (0.9252 Å), and inflection point (0.9750 Å). The ANP/Dha-associated Dha kinase crystals were measured at the SLS beamline X06SA at the PSI Villigen using again a MAR CCD-165 detector. All of the datasets were collected employing a MAR CCD-165 detector (Xrayresearch, Hamburg, Germany) and were processed using the HKL program package (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—The Dha kinase structure was determined by MAD methods. Of the 28 methionines expected in the asymmetric unit, the positions of 20 were readily determined using Shake-and-Bake (39Sheldrick G.M. Gould P.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1995; 51: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Phases were computed using SOLVE (40Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and density modification, and phase extension to 2.5-Å resolution using the native data set was effected by the program RESOLVE (40Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The resulting map was of high quality and allowed the tracing of the whole polypeptide chain. An initial protein model was built into the electron density using the program O (42Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used to refine the model to a 2.5-Å resolution using the programs CNS (43Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P., R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Techniques in Lipidology, 2nd Ed. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1972Google Scholar). Sequence Analyses—To retrieve DhaL sequences from the non-redundant protein data base at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/), the combined DhaK and DhaL sequences of E. coli and C. freundii were used as queries (Swiss Protein Data Base accession numbers P45510, P76015, and P76014). The alignments were performed with MultAlin (47Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4317) Google Scholar) using the default parameters. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with Gene-Bee (48Iushmanov S.V. Chumakov K.M. Mol. Gen. Mikrobiol. Virusol. 1988; : 9-15PubMed Google Scholar) using the default parameters. Coordinates—Crystallographic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1UN8 (apo form); 1UN9 (Dha/ANP form)). Structure Determination and Overall Architecture—Dha kinase was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and size-exclusion chromatography from where it eluted as a symmetrical peak with the retention time expected of a 2 × 60-kDa homodimer. It was crystallized with polyethylene glycol 3000 as precipitant, and the structures of the apoprotein and the complex with Dha and ANP were solved. Phases were determined using selenomethionine-substituted protein and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion at 3.5-Å resolution. Refinement of the native protein structure against the 2.5-Å data resulted in an R-factor of 19.3% and a Rfree of 24.5% with reasonable stereochemistry (Table I). The asymmetric unit contains one dimer. The Dha kinase monomer is well ordered (residues 1–550) with the exception of the loop 518–528. The K-domain (residues 1–330) and the L-domain (residues 350–550) are separated by an extended linker (residues 331–349) and swapped such that the L-domain of one kinase subunit is bound to the K-domain of the other (Fig. 1). The linker is well ordered, and it contains a short β-strand, which is hydrogen-bonded to the edge strand of the N-terminal β-sheet of the K-domain. The K-domain of C. freundii has the same structure as the DhaK subunit of E. coli kinase (33Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It consists of two α/β-folds, each containing a six-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by six and three helices, respectively. The core structure of the first α/β-fold (colored blue in Fig. 1) has the same topology as the IIAMan domain of the PTS transporter for mannose (Protein Data Bank code 1PDO) (30Nunn R.S. Markovic-Housley Z. Génovésio-Taverne J.C. Flükiger K. Rizkallah P.J. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Erni B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the N-terminal domain of DhaM (1Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The inter-subunit interaction is mediated mainly by the surfaces buried between helices 1 and 8, which intersect at an angle of 70°. The L-domain displays a novel all-α-fold. It consists of eight antiparallel α-helices arranged in an up-and-down geometry and aligned on a circle. This results in the formation of a helix barrel enclosing a deep pocket. The helices are between 3.5 and 6 turns long with their axes tilted at an angle of ∼15° with respect to the barrel axis. The first and longest helix (amino acids 355–386) is kinked at an angle of 45° between Leu-372 and Glu-373. The helices are amphipathic with the hydrophobic side chains directed into the pocket of the barrel and with the polar residues surface exposed. All of the loops are well defined with the exception of the longest one (amino acids 513–533) between helix 7 and 8 where residues 518–527 are not visible in the electron density map. The four loops at the top of the barrel contain highly conserved residues (Fig. 2), whereas the loop sequences on the bottom side (defined by the N and C termini of the chain) are not conserved. Lipid-binding Pocket—Strong electron density remained in the native protein model that could not be explained by protein atoms and became the predominant feature in Fo - Fc maps after sequence fitting and initial model refinement (Fig. 3A). This density has the shape of a 2-myristic(C14)-3-palmitic(C16)-phospholipid. The two acyl chains extend ∼15 Å into the pocket where they are surrounded by apolar side chains. Residues in a distance of <4 Å to the acyl chains are invariant or conservatively exchanged in the L-domains and DhaL subunits of Dha kinases (Fig. 2, open circles). The lipid binding pocket has an ellipsoidal shape (5–11-Å wide) and a solvent-accessible surface area of 496 Å2. The lipid head group lies solvent-exposed at the entrance of the pocket (Fig. 3B). The lipid was identified as a 1:1 mixture of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 4A). Staining revealed two closely spaced spots of which the second disappeared after pretreatment of the sample with phospholipase D. Both spots were stained phosphate-positive, and the phospholipase-sensitive spot also was ninhydrin-positive (results not shown). The lipids can be removed by incubation with the detergent β-octylglucoside and gel-filtration in a detergent-free buffer. The lipid-free kinase (Fig. 4A) retains at least 80% of its original activity. It cannot be stimulated with E. coli liposomes, indicating that the lipid is not essential for kinase activity (results not shown). Given the hydrophobic lining of the pocket, the phospholipid is probably replaced by one or two detergent molecules.Fig. 4Phospholipid analysis and Dha kinase activity.A, sulfuric acid stained thin layer chromatogram of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidic acid (PA) bound to the L-domain before and after treatment with phospholipase D (PLD). No lipid can be detected after treatment of DhaK with β-octylglucoside (OG). B and C, titration of wild-type and mutant forms of C. freundii (DhaK (C.f.)) (B) and E. coli DhaL subunit (C). Wild-type (•), D380A and D30A (▪), D385A and D35A (▴), D387A and D37A (▾), and T388H and H38T (♦) are shown. H38C and H38A are also inactive (data not shown). Means ± S.D. are of seven (wild type) and three (mutants) independent experiments. In B, the concentrations of ATP and Dha were 1.1 and 1.0 mm, respectively. In C, the concentrations were as follows: 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm Dha, 0.15 μm EI, 2.0 μm HPr, 0.33 μm DhaM, and 0.33 μm DhaK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ATP- and Dha-binding Sites—Crystals were soaked in a solution containing ANP, MgCl2, and dihydroxyacetone, and a complete data set was collected to a 3.1-Å resolution from a single crystal (Table I). A difference Fourier map calculated with phases derived from the native model revealed strong extra positive electron density into which one molecule of ANP and one molecule of Dha per monomer could be fitted unambiguously. After rigid body and positional refinement using the model of the apoenzyme, two magnesium ions complexed to the ANP molecule were also identified (Fig. 3C, peaks at 8σ and 6σ in the Fo - Fc map). To further confirm their position, the crystals were soaked with ANP, Dha, and Mn2+ instead of Mg2+, and a dataset of a single crystal was collected to a 4.0-Å resolution (Table I). Isomorphous and anomalous difference Fourier maps showed clear peaks at the putative Mg2+ positions, confirming the original interpretation (Fig. 3B). The two magnesium atoms have a 3.99-Å center to center distance. ANP binds to the L-domain at the top of the α-barrel (Fig. 3, C and D). The bottom of the nucleotide-binding site is formed by Met-428, Met-436, Met-477, and Phe-392, which septum-like separate the ANP-binding depression from the lipid-binding pocket. The side walls are formed by the helix termini and the connecting loops. The adenine base is packed between the hydrophobic side chains of Leu-435 (H3-H4), Thr-476, and Met-477 (H5-H6). The ribose moiety is bound by residues Met-477 (H5-H6), Asp-533, and Pro-534, its hydroxyl groups are coordinated by Asp-533 (H7-H8), and the ring oxygen is within hydrogen bonding distance to Ser-432. The α-phosphate is coordinated by Ser-432, and the β- and γ-phosphates are hydrogenbonded to Ser-431 (H3-H4). The N terminus of helix H4 is directed toward the γ-phosphate and by its helix dipole might stabilize the phosphate. The phosphate groups are complexed by two Mg2+ ions. One Mg2+ coordinates the γ-phosphate with Asp-385 and Asp-387. The second Mg2+ connects the α- and β-phosphates with the γ-carboxyl groups of Asp-380, Asp-385, Asp-387, and the hydroxyl group of Thr-388 (H1-H2) (Fig. 3D). The coordination geometry of the magnesium atoms cannot be determined because water ligands that complement the coordination sphere are not visible at the resolution of the structure. The H1-H2 and H3-H4 loops contain invariant glycines, reminiscent of the mononucleotide-binding motives of ATP-binding proteins and protein kinases (49Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem.

To delineate the tissue/organ origin of the tumor and the mechanisms operating in the BM overproduction, a genome-wide expression profile of EHS tumor was analyzed using RIKEN cDNA microarrays containing ∼40,000 mouse cDNA clones. Expression profiles of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells that produce laminin-1 and other BM components upon differentiation into parietal endoderm-like cells (designated F9-PE) were also analyzed. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the gene expression profiles of EHS and F9-PE were the most similar among 49 mouse tissues/organs in the RIKEN Expression Array Database, suggesting that EHS tumor is parietal endoderm-derived. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that not only BM components but also the machineries required for efficient production of BM components, such as enzymes involved in post-translational modification and molecular chaperones, were highly expressed in both EHS and F9-PE. Pairs of similar transcription factor isoforms, such as Gata4/Gata6, Sox7/Sox17, and Cited1/Cited2, were also highly expressed in both EHS tumor and F9-PE. Time course analysis of F9 differentiation showed that up-regulation of the transcription factors was associated with those of BM components, suggesting their involvement in parietal endoderm specification and overproduction of the BM components.

Many growth factors (e.g. fibroblast growth factors, transforming growth factor-β, and hepatocyte growth factor) are also incorporated into the BMs through binding to various ECM molecules, further modifying the biological functions of BMs (1.Erickson A.C. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1291-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 2.Hagedorn H.G. Bachmeier B.E. Nerlich A.G. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 669-681PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their biological importance, biochemical and cell biological studies of BMs have been hampered by difficulties in preparing BM components on a large scale, since BMs are constantly maintained as very thin sheets in most tissues and organs. An exceptional source of BM components is the murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor, which produces extraordinary amounts of ECM that are readily extracted under nondenaturing conditions (3.Kleinman H.K.

A crude extract prepared from EHS tumor contains nearly 1% (w/v) laminins and reconstitutes BM-like gels in vitro, which have been widely used as two- or three-dimensional cell culture substrates that support the differentiated functions of various cell types (5.Lang S.H.

The molecular mechanisms operating in the overproduction of BM components in EHS tumor are poorly understood. Moreover, the tissue/organ origin of the tumor is obscure. EHS tumor spontaneously arose in an ST/Eh mouse strain and was initially designated as a chondrosarcoma based on its histological appearance (9.Swarm R.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1963; 31: 953-974PubMed Google Scholar). Later, biochemical analysis demonstrated that it did not produce cartilaginous proteins but secreted the major BM components (i.e. laminin-1, nidogen-1, collagen IV, and perlecan) (10.Orkin R.W. Gehron P. McGoodwin E.B. Martin G.R. Valentine T. Swarm R. J. Exp. Med. 1977; 145: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). EHS tumor is still often called a “sarcoma,” and it is also referred to as a yolk sac tumor (3.Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Liotta L.A. Robey P.G. Tryggvason K. Martin G.R.

The primary aims of the present study were to elucidate the origin of EHS tumor and the molecular basis of the BM overproduction. To this end, we utilized genome-wide gene expression profiling using RIKEN mouse 20K chip-1 and -2 containing ∼40,000 cDNA clones corresponding to 24,000 nonredundant genes and expressed sequence tags (14.Miki R. Kadota K. Bono H. Mizuno Y. Tomaru Y. Carninci P. Itoh M. Shibata K. Kawai J. Konno H. Watanabe S. Sato K. Tokusumi Y. Kikuchi N. Ishii Y. Hamaguchi Y. Nishizuka I.I. Goto H. Nitanda H. Satomi S.

To further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of BM production, we also analyzed the gene expression profiles of murine F9 embryocarcinoma cells that differentiate into parietal endoderm-like cells (designated F9-PE) and produce large amounts of BM components upon treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) (16.Strickland S.

Utilizing these approaches, we characterized EHS tumor as a parietal yolk sac-derived tumor. In both EHS tumor and F9-PE, not only secretory/ECM molecules, but also enzymes and chaperones involved in the post-translational modification of ECM molecules, were highly expressed, suggesting that parietal endoderm cells are an optimized “factory” producing the BM. Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm Tumor—EHS tumor was maintained by intramuscular implantation in the hind limbs of C57BL/6J mice in the animal experiment facility of Aichi Medical University under approval of the Animal Care Committee of Aichi Medical University. Solid tumors that developed 3-4 weeks after transplantation were excised and used for RNA preparation. Cell Culture—Murine F9 embryonic carcinoma cells were obtained from the Health Science Research Resource Bank (Osaka, Japan; available on the World Wide Web at www.jhsf.or.jp/English/index_e.html) and cultured on gelatin-coated culture dishes (Asahi Techno Glass Corp, Chiba, Japan) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. For induction of differentiation into parietal endoderm-like cells, F9 cells were treated with 1 μm RA and 1 mm Bt2cAMP for 96 h (16.Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction—Total RNAs were extracted from EHS tumor and F9 cells using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified using Oligotex dT-30 (TAKARA BIO Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan). RNAs from whole mouse embryos at 17.5 days of gestation (designated E17.5) were prepared as described (14.Miki R. Kadota K. Bono H. Mizuno Y. Tomaru Y. Carninci P. Itoh M. Shibata K. Kawai J.

Briefly, poly(A)+ RNAs were reverse-transcribed in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma). After purification of the first strand cDNA, incorporated amino-allyl substrates were coupled with a Cy-3 or Cy-5 monofunctional reactive dye (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) by incubating for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Residual free dyes were removed using MicroSpin S-200 HR columns (Amersham Biosciences). Probes labeled with Cy-3 or Cy-5 were combined in 30 μl of hybridization buffer per slide and competitively hybridized overnight. After hybridization, the slides were washed, dried, and subjected to fluorescence scanning. Hybridizations were performed in duplicate for each combination of samples and references. In duplicate experiments, probes were independently prepared from the same pool of poly(A)+ RNAs. Data Analysis—Following the hybridization, fluorescent images were scanned and analyzed using the GenePix 4000B microarray scanner and GenePixPro 3.0 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Spots with abnormal appearance or with signal intensities lower than the local background were “flagged” and invalidated in the analysis that followed. Expression ratios were calculated by dividing the Cy-5 intensity by the Cy-3 intensity and normalized as the median of all validated ratios set to 1.0 by using GeneSpring 4.0 (SiliconGenetics, Redwood City, CA). Spots that showed more than a 2-fold discrepancy in the Cy-3/Cy-5 ratios in duplicate experiments were also eliminated. Normalized ratios from duplicate experiments were averaged and used for scatter plots and gene extraction based on the expression ratios. For hierarchical clustering, the ratios were preprocessed by a filtering program, PRIM (18.Kadota K. Miki R. Bono H. Shimizu K. Okazaki Y. Hayashizaki Y. Physiol. Genom. 2001; 4: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and analyzed using the clustering software CLUSTER and TREEVIEW developed by Eisen et al. (19.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O.

Northern Blotting, Quantitative PCR, and Criteria for Second Round Selection of Genes Highly Expressed in Parietal Endoderm Cells—For quantitatively stricter estimations of the gene expression levels, aliquots of the RNA were subjected to Northern blotting analyses using a previously described method (23.Futaki S. Takagishi Y. Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Kanou Y. Inouye M. Oda S. Seo H. Iwaikawa Y. Murata Y. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Information on the probes is available on request. Alternatively, gene expression levels were estimated by quantitative PCR. Total RNAs were reverse-transcribed by SuperScriptII (Invitrogen) with random primers. The reverse transcripts were used as templates for analysis of the gene expression levels using SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In general, PCR primers were designed to amplify 200-300 base pairs of the target sequences. Sequences of the primers are available on request. The kinetics of amplification were monitored by SYBR Green fluorescence intensity, and the numbers of cycles required for the fluorescence level to reach the defined threshold level in the logarithmic increase phase (threshold cycle: Ct) were calculated as exponents of the relative amounts of target cDNA in the templates. The differences in the expression levels between F9-PE and undifferentiated F9 (F9-S) were expressed as ΔCt(F9). Similarly, the expression level in EHS relative to F9-S was expressed as ΔCt(EHS). Typically, a ΔCt of 4 corresponded to a 10-fold higher expression than F9-S. For second round extraction of genes highly expressed in both F9-PE and EHS tumor (Table I), a ΔCt of 2 was used as the cut-off point.Table ITranscripts expressed in F9-PE and EHS tumorGenBank™

combination of both reagents for 96 h in duplicates. Cells were harvested every 24 h, and total RNAs were extracted. The RNAs were also prepared from untreated cells. The expression levels of individual genes were quantified using standard curves drawn with serially diluted reverse transcripts obtained from F9-PE cells treated with RA/Bt2cAMP for 96 h. Relative expression levels from duplicate experiments were averaged and expressed as mean ± range. Western Blotting—F9 cells were differentiated by stimulation with RA/Bt2cAMP for up to 96 h. The medium was collected and replaced with fresh medium containing RA/Bt2cAMP every 24 h during the differentiation. 24-h conditioned medium of F9-S was used as 0-h conditioned medium (Undiff.). 5 μl of the conditioned medium were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions. Following the transfer onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), BM component proteins were detected using specific antibodies for mouse EHS-laminin (Sanbio BV, Uden, The Netherlands), mouse collagen IV (LSL, Tokyo, Japan), or mouse nidogen/entactin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Global Gene Expression Profiles of EHS Tumor and Differentiated F9 Cells—To confirm that the overproduction of BM components by EHS tumor is regulated at the level of gene expression, total RNA from tumor cells was subjected to Northern blotting analysis using cDNAs encoding mouse laminin-1 subunits (α1, β1, and γ1) as probes. Total RNAs from F9-S and F9-PE were also analyzed. Laminin α1 subunit (Lama1) transcripts were almost absent in F9-S but were highly expressed in F9-PE and EHS tumor (Fig. 1A). Transcripts for β1 (Lamb1) and γ1 (Lamc1) subunits were also highly expressed in F9-PE and EHS tumor but were barely expressed in F9-S, demonstrating that the overproduction of laminin-1 in EHS tumor is due to the coordinated high expression of mRNAs encoding the three laminin subunits, as was the case with F9-PE. To characterize the global gene expression profiles of EHS tumor and F9-PE, a Cy-3-labeled cDNA probe prepared from either EHS tumor or F9-PE cells was competitively hybridized to the 20K-1 or 20K-2 with a Cy-5-labeled reference probe prepared from E17.5. Gene expression ratios were calculated and normalized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The variances of the normalized expression ratios of the duplicate experiments were within 2-fold in more than 90% of the 39,166 cDNA spots. The averaged normalized expression ratios of the duplicate experiments were logarithm-transformed in base 10 and compared between EHS/E17.5 and F9-PE/E17.5 (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the results of the Northern blotting analysis, the expression levels of Lama1, Lamb1, and Lamc1 in both EHS tumor and F9-PE (Fig. 1B, red spots) were more than 10-fold higher than those in E17.5. Spots including cDNAs for the other laminin subunits such as α5, β2, γ2, and γ3 (cyan spots in Fig. 1B) showed much lower ratios than those of Lama1, Lamb1, and Lamc1 in both EHS tumor and F9-PE, indicating that laminin-1, composed of α1, β1, and γ1 subunits, is the major laminin isoform expressed in EHS tumor and F9-PE. To compare the global gene expression profiles of EHS tumor and F9-PE, a Pearson's correlation coefficient between the normalized expression ratios of EHS/E17.5 and F9-PE/E17.5 was calculated. The resulting coefficient was 0.72, indicating high similarity between EHS and F9-PE in terms of the gene expression profile. These expression profiles were further analyzed by hierarchical clustering together with the expression profiles of 49 mouse tissues in the READ (RIKEN Expression Array Database; available on the World Wide Web at read.gsc.riken.go.jp) (24.Bono H. Kasukawa T. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y.

https://openalex.org/W2110830902,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRS2 encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that is needed for DNA damage checkpoint responses and that modulates the efficiency of homologous recombination. Interestingly, strains simultaneously mutated for SRS2 and a variety of DNA repair genes show low viability that can be overcome by inactivating homologous recombination, thus implicating inappropriate recombination as the cause of growth impairment in these mutants. Here, we report on our biochemical characterization of the ATPase and DNA helicase activities of Srs2. ATP hydrolysis by Srs2 occurs efficiently only in the presence of DNA, with ssDNA being considerably more effective than dsDNA in this regard. Using homopolymeric substrates, the minimal DNA length for activating ATP hydrolysis is found to be 5 nucleotides, but a length of 10 nucleotides is needed for maximal activation. In its helicase action, Srs2 prefers substrates with a 3′ ss overhang, and ∼10 bases of 3′ overhanging DNA is needed for efficient targeting of Srs2 to the substrate. Even though a 3′ overhang serves to target Srs2, under optimized conditions blunt-end DNA substrates are also dissociated by this protein. The ability of Srs2 to unwind helicase substrates with a long duplex region is enhanced by the inclusion of the single-strand DNA-binding factor replication protein A.

DNA helicases are ubiquitous among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These enzymes utilize the free energy derived from the hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate to disrupt the hydrogen bonds that bind the complementary strands of duplex DNA. DNA helicases play an essential role in virtually every aspect of nucleic acid metabolism, including transcription, replication, recombination, and repair (reviewed in 1–3). We focus on the mechanism of homologous recombination in eukaryotes and are interested in the biology of DNA helicases that influence recombination events. One such helicase is encoded by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRS2 1The abbreviations used are: SRS2, suppressor of RAD six-screen mutant 2 gene; RPA, replication protein A; ss, single strand; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.

Chanet R. Zgaga Z. Cassier-Chauvat C. Heude M. Fabre F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7211-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A mutant form of SRS2 was initially identified as a suppressor of the radiation-sensitivity of rad6 and rad18 mutants that are defective in post-replicative DNA repair (4Aboussekhra A. Chanet R. Zgaga Z. Cassier-Chauvat C. Heude M. Fabre F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7211-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 5Lawrence C.W. Christensen R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 866-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that suppression of rad6 and rad18 mutations by the srs2 mutation is due to heightened recombination mediated by the RAD52 epistasis group of genes (6Schiestl R.H. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genetics. 1990; 124: 817-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, srs2 mutants show a hyper-recombination phenotype (7Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1988; 119: 779-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rong L. Palladino F. Aguilera A. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1991; 127: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these genetic observations indicate that SRS2 negatively regulates RAD52-mediated homologous recombination. It has been suggested that by antagonizing the recombination machinery, Srs2 ensures the channelling of DNA lesions that arise during DNA replication into the Rad6/Rad18-mediated repair reactions (4Aboussekhra A. Chanet R. Zgaga Z. Cassier-Chauvat C. Heude M. Fabre F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7211-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Hence, in rad6 and rad18 mutants, repair of the replication-associated DNA lesions by recombination is inefficient unless SRS2 is inactivated (4Aboussekhra A. Chanet R. Zgaga Z. Cassier-Chauvat C. Heude M. Fabre F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7211-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Multiple studies have shown that inactivating SRS2 in cells already mutated for one of a number of genes needed for DNA metabolism results in poor growth and sometimes inviability (6Schiestl R.H. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genetics. 1990; 124: 817-831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Palladino F. Klein H.L. Genetics. 1992; 132: 23-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Klein H.L. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Interestingly, simultaneous ablation of homologous recombination (i.e. by deleting RAD51, RAD52, RAD55, and RAD57, members of the RAD52 epistasis group) restores viability to the double mutants, implicating inappropriate recombination as the underlying cause of growth impediment in these mutants (11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 12Schild D. Genetics. 1995; 140: 115-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 557-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances (i.e. srs2Δ rad54Δ and srs2Δ rdh54Δ), cell inviability can also be overcome by deleting genes that function in DNA damage checkpoints, which suggests that growth impairment is caused by the formation of a recombination intermediate that is sensed by DNA damage checkpoints to result in prolonged cell cycle arrest and eventual cell death (13Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 557-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Srs2 protein has also been implicated in signaling events in the intra-S checkpoint in cells treated with a DNA damaging agent (13Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 557-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liberi G. Chiolo I. Pellicioli A. Lopes M. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Foiani M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5027-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). More recently, a role for Srs2 in mediating adaptation and recovery from DNA damage checkpoint-imposed G2/M arrest has been reported (15Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Deletion of RAD51 enables srs2-null cells to recover from DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest (15Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), implicating Rad51 in the prevention of recovery in the srs2 mutant. The involvement of the SRS2 gene in the modulation of recombination and DNA damage checkpoint responses, which have a direct bearing on the maintenance of genome integrity, underscores the importance for biochemical characterization of its encoded product. Previously, a recombinant form of Srs2 tagged with a C-terminal six-histidine sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli but was found to be insoluble. Nonetheless, the histidine-tagged Srs2 protein could be extracted from the inclusion bodies with 6 m guanidine and enriched by passing the solubilized fraction over a nickel-NTA column and eluting the bound proteins under denaturing conditions. Following gel filtration, a renaturation protocol was used to obtain a small amount of soluble Srs2 protein. The renatured Srs2 protein was shown to possess a modest ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity and also a DNA helicase activity that has a 3′ to 5′ polarity with respect to the ssDNA on which the protein translocates (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the biochemical properties of Srs2, we have achieved expression of soluble Srs2 in E. coli and have devised a procedure that entails conventional chromatographic fraction steps for its purification. Here we show that the non-tagged, soluble Srs2 has a robust ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity. We also carry out a more detailed characterization of the DNA helicase activity of Srs2 and study its functional interaction with the single-strand binding factor replication protein A (RPA) in DNA unwinding. Srs2 Expression and Purification—The plasmid pET11c::Srs2 containing the SRS2 gene under the control of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter (17Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures grown in Luria broth at 37 °C were diluted 500-fold into fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 1.2. At that time, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm, and the culture was incubated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Extract was prepared by using a French press from 150 g of cell paste (obtained from 70 liters of culture) in 450 ml of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm KCl, 10% sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and the following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, each at 5 μg/ml). The extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 90 min) and treated with ammonium sulfate (0.21 g/ml) to precipitate Srs2 and about 15% of the total protein. The precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation and then dissolved in 400 ml of T buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Igepal (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the aforementioned protease inhibitors) to yield a protein solution (fraction I) that had conductivity equivalent to 150 mm KCl. This protein solution was passed through a 90-ml column of Q-Sepharose, and the flow through fraction from the Q column (fraction II) was applied onto a 70-ml SP-Sepharose column, which was developed with a 900 ml gradient of 120 to 500 mm KCl in T buffer. As identified by immunoblotting and staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Blue, Srs2 eluted from the SP column at ∼350 mm KCl; the pool (fraction III, total = 100 ml) was fractionated in a 6-ml column of macro-hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) using a 90-ml gradient of 60–340 mm KH2PO4 in T buffer. Srs2 eluted from the hydroxyapatite column at ∼220 mm KH2PO4, and the peak fractions were pooled (fraction IV, total = 14 ml) and dialyzed against T buffer for 90 min to lower the conductivity to that of 60 mm KCl. The dialysate was fractionated in a 1-ml Mono Q column with a 30 ml, 50–200 mm KCl gradient in T buffer, with Srs2 eluting at ∼120 mm KCl. The pool of Srs2 from the Mono Q column (fraction V, total = 2 ml) was diluted with 3 ml of buffer T and then re-fractionated in Mono Q using the same gradient. The final Srs2 pool (fraction VI, total = 2 ml containing 300 μg of Srs2) was concentrated to 150 μl in a Centricon-30 device (Amicon) and stored in 2-μl portions at –80 °C. RPA—RPA was purified from a bacterial strain tailored to co-express the three subunits of this factor (18He Z. Wong J.M. Maniar H.S. Brill S.J. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28243-28249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using our published protocol (19Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). DNA Substrates, Helicase Substrates, and Oligonucleotides—The φX174 viral (+) strand was purchased from New England Biolabs. The φX174 replicative form I DNA (∼90% supercoiled form; Invitrogen) was linearized by digestion with ApaL I. The oligonucleotides used for this study were purchased from Invitrogen and are listed in Table I. H1, H5, and H6 were 5′-end-labeled with [γ32-P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The unincorporated isotope was removed by passing the substrates through a Spin30 column (Bio-Rad). Oligonucleotides H1 and H2 were annealed to create a 40-base pair blunt-end DNA duplex. This 40-base pair duplex region was retained in the other helicase substrates. Oligonucleotides H1 and H3 were hybridized to each other to obtain a partial duplex with a 40-nucleotide ssDNA overhang at the 3′ end. To obtain a partial duplex with a 40-nucleotide ssDNA overhang at the 5′ end, oligonucleotides H1 and H4 were annealed to each other. Oligonucleotides H5 with H6 were annealed to each other to give a substrate that possessed two 3′ overhangs of 20 nucleotides each, and oligonucleotide H7 was hybridized with H8 to yield a substrate that had two 5′ overhangs of 20 nucleotides each. The substrates with 3′-poly(dT) overhangs of 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 16 nucleotides were prepared by annealing oligonucleotide H1 to H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, and H14, respectively. Annealing reactions were carried out by heating equimolar amounts of the indicated oligonucleotides at 95 °C for 10 min in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl), followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The annealed DNA substrates were separated from the unhybridized oligonucleotides in 12% polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA), and the substrates were recovered from the gel as described (20Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). For the construction of the φX174-based helicase substrates, two fragments of 150 of 500 bp were amplified by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dATP using primer pairs P1/P2 and P1/P3 and φX174 RF DNA as template. The PCR-amplified 32P-labeled DNA fragments were purified and hybridized to φX174 (+) strand, and the resulting substrates were purified, as described (21Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The reactions were incubated at the indicated temperatures, and 2-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and mixed with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA. The released phosphate was separated from the unhydrolyzed ATP by thin layer chromatography, as described (20Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The levels of 32Pi and [γ-32P]ATP in the reactions were determined by phosphorimaging analysis of the thin layer chromatography plates in a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). To determine the reaction background, a reaction mixture without Srs2 was incubated as above, and the amount of 32Pi was determined and subtracted from the values obtained with Srs2 present. The buffers with pH 7.0–9.0 in Fig. 2C were based on 30 mm Tris-HCl. In the experiment presented in panel II of Fig. 4B, the indicated amounts of ATP, ADP, AMP-PCP, AMP-PNP, and ATPγS were mixed with 7 nm Srs2 in 10 μl of buffer A containing 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP and 125 mm KCl. The reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 3 min and then analyzed as above. DNA Helicase Assay—Unless stated otherwise, Srs2 was incubated at 30 °C with the helicase substrates (150 nm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer H (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 20 mm creatine phosphate and 20 μg/ml creatine kinase. Aliquots of the reactions were drawn at the indicated times and treated with SDS (0.2% final) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 min. The released 32P-labeled DNA fragment was separated from the unreacted substrate in 12 or 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm EDTA) at 4 °C, as described (20Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Gels were dried onto Whatman DE81 paper and then analyzed in the PhosphorImager. The φX174-based substrates were incubated with Srs2 as above. When present, RPA was added with Srs2 to the DNA substrates. After deproteinization treatment, the reactions were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The agarose gels were dried and analyzed as above. When comparing the φX174-based substrates with 150- and 500-bp duplex regions, the reaction mixtures were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The gel was dried and analyzed as above. Srs2 Protein Purification—We have recently described the expression of Srs2 that does not contain an affinity tag in E. coli (17Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Although cells grown at 37 °C yield predominantly insoluble Srs2, the solubility of this protein is greatly improved upon decreasing the growth temperature to 16 °C. The soluble Srs2 was purified to near homogeneity using a six-step procedure including ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic fractionation through Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, Macro-hydroxyapatite, and Mono Q columns, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The final protein pool from the Mono Q step was greater than 95% homogeneous (17Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). DNA-dependent ATPase Activity of Srs2—We examined the purified Srs2 protein for ATPase activity in the absence of DNA and with the viral (+) strand or the replicative form of φX174 phage. The amount of ATP hydrolysis was monitored by thin layer chromatography, as we had done before (20Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 1, while little ATPase was seen in the absence of DNA (inverted triangles), addition of either viral (+) strand (diamonds) or the replicative form DNA (triangles) led to efficient ATP hydrolysis, with the former being much more effective in ATPase activation. Interestingly, although the homopolymer poly(dT) (white squares) was as effective as the φX viral (+) in activating ATP hydrolysis, poly(dA) (black squares) was a poor cofactor. The optimal reaction temperature for ATP hydrolysis by Srs2 was found to be 37 °C. At 42 °C, the rate of ATP hydrolysis started declining after a few minutes of incubation, probably because of thermal denaturation of Srs2 protein (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the activity of Srs2 was stimulated by 50–250 mm of KCl, with significant inhibition occurring at 300 mm of the salt. The optimal pH range was determined to be 7.25–8.0 (Fig. 2C), and a dependence on Mg2+ was noted (Fig. 2D). Although Mn2+ was nearly as effective as Mg2+ in ATPase activation, little or no ATP hydrolysis was seen with Ca2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ (Fig. 2D). The ATPase activity Srs2 is rather robust. For instance, Srs2 exhibited a kcat for ATP hydrolysis ≥ 3000 min–1 at 37 °C, measured with φX viral (+) strand as cofactor (Fig. 2C). Rong and Klein (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that renatured Srs2 protein had a kcat for ATP hydrolysis of ∼191 min–1 with M13mp18 viral (+) strand as cofactor (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because we know that M13 viral (+) strand is just as effective as φX viral (+) strand in ATPase activation (data not shown), the Srs2 protein that we have prepared is significantly more active in ATP hydrolysis. Minimal Length of DNA Required for ATPase Activation— Next we investigated the minimal length of ssDNA needed for activating the Srs2 ATPase activity. For this purpose, homopolymeric dT oligomers that were 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20 nucleotides in length were used as cofactors in the ATPase reaction. A low level of ATP hydrolysis was seen with the 5-mer and 8-mer substrates (Fig. 3). Increasing the length of the DNA to 10 nucleotides resulted in a large increase in ATP hydrolysis, but the substrates with lengths of 16 and 20 nucleotides gave only incremental elevation in hydrolysis rate over the 10-mer substrate. These results indicate that the effective site size for the activation of the Srs2 ATPase function is ∼10 nucleotides. DNA Helicase Activity of Srs2—To characterize the DNA unwinding activity of Srs2, we used three different 32P-labeled DNA substrates (Fig. 4) that shared an identical 40-base pair duplex region but differed from one another in possessing a 40-base 3′ tail (3′ substrate), a 40-base 5′ tail (5′ substrate), or no ss tail (blunt substrate). Displacement of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was monitored by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gels. We used a reaction temperature of 30 °C for this experiment. As shown in Fig. 4A, after only 1 min of incubation, the majority (>60%) of the 3′ substrate had been unwound by Srs2 (Fig. 4A , panel I, lane 3). At this time, little of the 5′ substrate (Fig. 4A, panel II, lane 3) or blunt substrate (Fig. 4A , panel III, lane 3) had been unwound. However, significant unwinding of the 5′ substrate and blunt substrate was seen after 2.5 min of incubation, with >50% dissociation of these two substrates at 5 min (Fig. 4A , panels II and III, lane 5). Our data indicate that Srs2 prefers to act on the substrate with the 3′ ss overhang, which is consistent with the 3′ to 5′ polarity seen by Rong and Klein (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they additionally reveal that Srs2 can unwind substrates without such an overhang. As shown in Fig. 4B , panel I, no unwinding was seen upon the omission of ATP or substitution of ATP with AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, ATPγS, or ADP. To determine whether the failure of Srs2 to unwind DNA (Fig. 4B , panel I) was caused by an inability to bind the latter nucleotides, ATPase assays were performed with the addition of AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, ATPγS, or ADP as potential inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4B , panel II, the amount of 32P-labeled ATP hydrolyzed by Srs2 was reduced by all these nucleotides, with the most pronounced inhibition seen with the addition of ATPγS. Thus, these results provide supporting evidence that ATP hydrolysis by Srs2 is needed for DNA unwinding. In addition, DNA unwinding occurred in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, but little or no DNA unwinding activity was seen when Ca2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ was used (Fig. 4C). A 5′ Overhang Is Ineffective in Srs2 Recruitment—The results presented above indicate that in its DNA helicase action, Srs2 prefers the substrate with a 40-nucleotide 3′ ss tail but can also unwind the substrates with either a 40-nucleotide 5′ overhang or without any overhang. We wished to further examine whether a 5′ overhang confers an advantage in terms of Srs2 recruitment. To address this question, we constructed another set of substrates that had a 3′ tail at both ends, a 5′ tail at both ends, or without any ss tail (see Fig. 5). These substrates were incubated with a reduced Srs2:DNA ratio at the lower reaction temperature of 23 °C. Under these conditions, although the substrate with the 3′ ss overhangs (panel I) was unwound by Srs2, neither the substrate with the 5′ tails (panel II) nor the blunt-end substrate (panel III) was acted upon efficiently. Specifically, after 2.5 min, while ∼57% of the substrate containing 3′ overhangs had been dissociated (Fig. 5A , panel I, lane 4 and Fig. 5B), <2% of the substrates with either 5′ ss overhangs (Fig. 5A , panel II, lane 4 and Fig. 5B) or blunt ends (Fig. 5A , panel III, lane 4 and Fig. 5B) had been unwound. Thus, a 5′ ssDNA tail is ineffective at stimulating the helicase activity of Srs2. The results are entirely consistent with the observed 3′ to 5′ polarity of Srs2 movement on ssDNA (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Minimal Length of 3′ Overhang for Srs2 Recruitment—Next, we examined the minimal amount of 3′ overhang required to target the Srs2 helicase to the DNA substrate. For this purpose, we prepared substrates that shared a common 40-bp duplex region and contained a 3′ ss tail of 2, 5, 8, 10, 12, or 16 nucleotides. These substrates were incubated with Srs2 at 23 °C, and the level of substrate dissociation was determined in each case. The results from this series of experiments revealed that even a 2-nucleotide tail is capable of promoting DNA unwinding by Srs2 (Fig. 6A , panels I and II; Fig. 6B). Increasing the length of the 3′ ss overhang from 5 to 8 nucleotides resulted in a large increase in substrate unwinding (Fig. 6A , panels III and IV; Fig. 6B), with the near maximal level of unwinding being reached at 10 nucleotides (Fig. 6A , panel V; Fig. 6B). Thus, a 3′ ss overhang of about 10 nucleotides is needed for efficient targeting of Srs2 to the helicase substrate. Srs2 Helicase Activity Is Enhanced by RPA—To assess whether the Srs2 helicase function could unwind longer DNA duplexes, we used two substrates that contained either a 150- or 500-bp region. These substrates were constructed by hybridizing radiolabeled DNA fragments obtained in a PCR reaction to φX174 viral (+) strand. As shown in Fig. 7A , panel I, Srs2 (125 nm) can dissociate the substrate with the 150-bp region (10 μm nucleotides) at 30 °C, but little, if any, unwinding of the substrate with the 500-bp duplex region (10 μm nucleotides) was seen under these conditions (Fig. 7A , panels I and II; Fig. 7C). At a much higher Srs2 concentration (1 μm) and with 10-fold less substrate (1 μm nucleotides), Srs2 can also efficiently unwind the 500-bp substrate (Fig. 7A , panel III). One possible explanation for the above results (Fig. 7A) is that in unwinding long regions of duplex DNA, the once separated DNA strands reanneal. Such reannealing of DNA strands would effectively preclude the complete dissociation of long duplex regions, except when the helicase concentration is extremely high, such as in the experiment presented in Fig. 7A , panel III. Consistent with this postulate, the ability of a number of helicases to unwind longer substrates can be significantly enhanced by the inclusion in the DNA unwinding reaction of a single-strand binding protein, which sequesters ssDNA strands created as a result of unwinding to prevent their reannealing (22Harmon F.G.

Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar), was added with a low concentration of Srs2 (125 nm) to the 500-bp helicase substrate (10 μm nucleotides), the amount of displaced ssDNA product increased significantly (Fig. 7B). For instance, after only 5 min of incubation, ∼40% of the 500-bp partial duplex has been unwound (Fig. 7B and C), as opposed to ≤1% substrate dissociation in the absence of RPA (Fig. 7A , panel I; Fig. 7C). We have found that E. coli single-strand binding protein (SSB) is just as effective as RPA in promoting the unwinding of the 500-bp substrate (data not shown). In summary, we have shown that Srs2 protein has a highly robust ATPase activity that requires DNA, in particular ssDNA, for activation. In acting as a DNA helicase, Srs2 is specifically targeted to substrates that contain a 3′-ssDNA tail, and although we do not yet know the ssDNA binding site size for this protein, a minimum length of about 10 nucleotides is needed for its efficient targeting to helicase substrates. The fact that Srs2 prefers substrates with a 3′-ssDNA tail is congruent with a previous report by Rong and Klein (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who deduced from their data that Srs2 translocates on ssDNA in the 3′ to 5′ direction. Because a free oligo dT molecule of 10 nucleotides is efficiently bound, as seen in experiments that examined the ATPase activity of Srs2, the apparent lack of an effect of a 40-nucleotide 5′ overhang in the DNA unwinding experiments suggests that Srs2 may simply slide off the ss tail because of its 3′ to 5′ direction of translocation on ssDNA (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a 3′ tailed DNA substrate, upon binding to the ssDNA region, we would expect Srs2 to translocate into the duplex region and hence produce a higher level of unwound product. We have shown that Srs2 by itself is not particularly adept at dissociating long duplex regions. Importantly, the unwinding of longer duplex substrates is enhanced by the addition of yeast RPA. Because E. coli SSB is similarly effective at promoting the unwinding of long DNA substrates, the stimulation afforded by RPA is likely because of its ability to sequester single-stranded DNA created by helicase action rather than to a specific interaction with Srs2. By sequestering single-stranded DNA, RPA would prevent the reannealing of separated DNA strands and could also help target Srs2 to the junction between ssDNA and the duplex region in the helicase substrates. Our results also reveal for the first time that under optimized conditions, Srs2 can efficiently unwind blunt-end DNA substrates. Cells mutated for SRS2 exhibit enhanced spontaneous and also DNA damage-induced mitotic recombination. In addition, combining the srs2Δ mutation with a null mutation in SGS1, which encodes a DNA helicase of the RecQ family, renders cells inviable (11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Lee S.K. Johnson R.E. Yu S.L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1999; 286: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inviability of the srs2Δ sgs1Δ double mutant is fully rescued by deleting genes of the RAD52 epistasis group (e.g. RAD51, RAD52, RAD55, etc.) required for homologous recombination, thus identifying inappropriate recombination as the underlying basis of cell inviability in this mutant (11Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 13Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 557-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It seems possible that in the srs2Δ sgs1Δ mutant, lesions that are normally processed by non-recombination-based repair pathways are now bound by recombination proteins, leading to the formation of nucleoprotein intermediates that cannot be resolved properly, thereby resulting in cell viability. The studies of Klein (13Klein H.L. Genetics. 2001; 157: 557-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have further indicated that in combination with mutations in a variety of genes involved in DNA repair and replication, the srs2 mutation causes a prolonged DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest that can be overcome by crippling either the recombination machinery or the DNA damage checkpoint, further supporting the idea that Srs2 prevents the accumulation of aberrant DNA or nucleoprotein intermediates. From these genetic studies, it seems clear that Srs2 functions as an antagonist of homologous recombination under certain circumstances, and in this regard, can be viewed as an anti-recombinase. It has been suggested that the Srs2 helicase activity is needed for reversing or dissociating cytotoxic DNA intermediates generated by the recombination machinery and, hence, is indispensable for the anti-recombinase function (12Schild D. Genetics. 1995; 140: 115-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of Srs2 protein and the characterization of its ATPase and DNA helicase activities as presented here and elsewhere (16Rong L. Klein H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1252-1259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) should provide baseline information for the further pursuit of this hypothesis. In recombination reactions that are initiated by a DNA double-strand break, the ends of the breaks are processed by a nuclease activity to yield ssDNA tails. The polymerization of the RecA-like recombinase Rad51 on these ssDNA tails leads to the formation of a nucleoprotein filament, often called the presynaptic filament (27Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 28Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The presynaptic filament recruits other recombination factors, including Rad54 and Rdh54 (20Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 29Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and the higher order nucleoprotein complex that is assembled then mediates a search for a DNA homolog and the formation of DNA joints with the homolog. Interestingly, both we (17Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and Fabre and coworkers (31Veaute X. Jeusset J. Soustelle C. Kowalczykowski S.C. Le Cam E. Fabre F. Nature. 2003; 423: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) have recently found that Srs2 uses the free energy from ATP hydrolysis to dismantle the Rad51 presynaptic filament. Thus, the available results suggest that in its role as an anti-recombinase, Srs2 likely acts by means of turnover of Rad51 from bound ssDNA and by dissociating DNA intermediates made by the recombination machinery. Recently, Aylon et al. (32Aylon Y. Liefshitz B. Bitan-Banin G. Kupiec M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1403-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that srs2 mutants have a diminished ability to repair a site-specific double-strand break. The authors showed that Srs2 functions in an early stage of break repair and suggested that Srs2 may be involved in facilitating the process of homology recognition or strand transfer carried out by Rad51 and associated factors. Whether the involvement of Srs2 in mediating double-strand break repair is related to its ability to displace inhibitory proteins from DNA and to unwind DNA remains to be established. Vaze et al. (15Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) have found that srs2 mutant cells are unable to recover or adapt from the DNA damage checkpoint-imposed G2/M arrest. This abnormality of the srs2 mutant can be effectively overcome by deleting RAD51, thus providing evidence that the persistence of Rad51-DNA nucleoprotein complexes leads to prolonged activation of the damage checkpoint machinery, even after the repair of damaged DNA has been completed. It is likely that the ability of Srs2 to dislodge Rad51 protein from DNA and to dissociate recombination DNA intermediates is critical for abolishing the signal that activates DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest. In addition, it is possible that Srs2 evicts checkpoint-signaling complexes (i.e. the Mec1-Ddc2 and Rad17-Mec3-Ddc1 complexes) from DNA to attenuate the checkpoint responses (15Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 373-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in modulating recombination efficiency and promoting recovery from DNA damage checkpoint-imposed G2/M arrest, Srs2 has also been implicated as a signaling molecule in the intra-S DNA damage checkpoint. Specifically, Liberi et al. (14Liberi G. Chiolo I. Pellicioli A. Lopes M. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Foiani M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5027-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) reported that in cells deleted for SRS2, the activation of the Rad53 kinase in response to DNA damaging treatment during S phase becomes partially impaired. It has been suggested that Srs2 generates or maintains a DNA structure needed for the activation of the intra-S checkpoint (14Liberi G. Chiolo I. Pellicioli A. Lopes M. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Foiani M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5027-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It seems reasonable to propose that the DNA unwinding activity and the ability to evict bound proteins from DNA are germane for the checkpoint function of Srs2 as well."

Additionally five novel mammalian RAD51-like proteins have been identified in mammalian cells, but their roles in homologous recombination are much less well established. These RAD51-like proteins form two different complexes, but only the RAD51L2 (RAD51C) protein is a part of both complexes. By using site-directed mutagenesis of RAD51L2, we show that non-conservative mutation of the putative ATP-binding domain severely reduces its function, whereas a conservative mutation shows partial loss of function. We find that the protein is localized to the nucleus by tagging RAD51L2 with the green fluorescent protein and provisionally identify a C-terminal domain that acts as a nuclear localization signal. Further, a RAD51L2-deficient cell line was found to have significantly reduced homology-directed repair of a DNA double-strand break by gene conversion. This recombination defect could be partially restored by ectopic expression of the human RAD51L2 protein. Therefore we have identified protein domains that are important for the correct functioning of RAD51L2 and have shown that there is a specific requirement for RAD51L2 in gene conversion in mammalian cells.

Homologous recombination (HR) 1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; NLS, nuclear localization signal; MMC, mitomycin-C; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DSB, double-strand break. is an essential process in mammalian cells for the reassortment of genetic material and for the repair of DNA damage. RAD51 is the key eukaryotic protein for HR, mediating homologous pairing of DNA sequences and strand exchange (1West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Five novel RAD51-like proteins have recently been identified in mammalian cells; these proteins have limited homology to RAD51, and their functions are relatively unknown (2Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 3Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The RAD51-like protein RAD51L2 (RAD51C) was first identified from data base searches through partial homology to RAD51 and other members of this protein family (4Dosanjh M.K. Collins D.W. Fan W. Lennon G.G. Albala J.S. Shen Z. Schild D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, we (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and others (6Godthelp B.C. Wiegant W.W. van Duijn-Goedhart A. Scharer O.D. van Buul P.P. Kanaar R. Zdzienicka M.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have described DNA damage-sensitive cell lines that specifically lack RAD51L2 activity. It was shown that the RAD51L2 gene function was not redundant to other RAD51-like genes or RAD51 itself, because only RAD51L2 was able to restore DNA damage resistance to these cell lines. It was further suggested that RAD51L2 has a role in RAD51-dependent HR because RAD51L2-deficient cells show a reduction in sister-chromatid exchange and a decrease in damage-dependent RAD51 focus formation (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Godthelp B.C.

However, a direct role in homologous recombination processes has not been shown. Human RAD51L2 shares only 27% sequence identity with the human RAD51 protein, with the most well conserved residues being those with homology to the nucleotide-binding or “Walker motif” (2Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Walker motif (7Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar) consists of two separate sequences, A and B, which come together to form a nucleotide binding site. These residues are highly conserved in the RAD51 family and in its prokaryotic counterpart RecA. The Walker A motif, also known as the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop), is defined by the consensus sequence (G/AXXXXGKT/S), where X is any amino acid. In RecA, non-conservative mutation of any of the four residues that identify the P-loop results in a non-functional protein but restricted mutation at other positions is tolerated (8Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A well characterized mutation in this motif is the conservative lysine to arginine (K72R) substitution: this mutant protein is able to bind but not hydrolyze ATP and can promote limited strand exchange in vitro (10Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1292-1297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this mutant has been shown to lack RecA activity in vivo (9Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Data obtained from the RecA crystal structure suggests that Lys-72 interacts directly with the β- and γ-phosphates of the bound ATP molecule (11Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis has also been used to investigate the function of the A motif in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51p. Rad51p with a lysine to arginine (K191A) mutation in this motif is unable to complement the DNA-damage sensitivity and recombination defects of a RAD51-null strain (12Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Similarly, a K133A mutation in the Walker A motif of human RAD51 did not rescue the RAD51-deficient lethal phenotype of chick cells, whereas a K133R mutation gave a partially defective phenotype (13Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the presence of homology to the Walker motifs does not seem to be as functionally relevant in some of the RAD51-like proteins. In S. cerevisiae, mutation of the P-loop lysine results in increased γ-ray sensitivity and defective sporulation for Rad55p but not for Rad57p (14Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, P-loop mutations (K54R, K54A, and ΔG53/ΔK54) in the RAD51-like human protein XRCC2 have little effect on its function (15O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Searches for other potential functional motifs in the RAD51L2 protein yield few clues. Given its anticipated role in DNA-damage metabolism, RAD51L2 might be expected to be localized to the nucleus, and to carry a nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence, but this has not been identified. The NLS usually consists of one or two short sequences of positively charged lysines and arginines, which are bound by a family of importins or transportins for active transport into the nucleus through the nuclear pores (16Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We used site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analysis to look at the importance of putative functional domains in the RAD51L2 protein by testing for the ability of the mutant protein to restore DNA damage resistance to a RAD51L2-deficient hamster cell line (irs3). In addition we have for the first time made direct measurements of HR efficiency in the irs3 cell line and compared it with its wild-type parent line. Mammalian Cell and Bacterial Culture Methods—Wild-type V79 and RAD51L2-deficient irs3 cells (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. To assay the sensitivity of individual clones to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin-C (MMC), cells were respread into 24-well plates containing graded concentrations of MMC (0–100 nm), and survival was assessed visually as described previously (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To quantitate MMC resistance, three independent repeat experiments were made with cells from pooled clones (five to six clones mixed and grown together for 2 days prior to the experiment) respread into 3 × 10-cm dishes/MMC dose point. In cDNA transfections, 10 μg of DNA was electroporated into irs3 cells with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 400 V/500 μF in cytomix (18van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cells were selected for 14 days in 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Bacterial cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics; plasmids were propagated in strain DH5α. Plasmid DNA was prepared by using a Qiaprep kit (Qiagen); sequencing reactions were performed by using a BigDye kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Genomic DNA PCR and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—The presence of the appropriate cDNA in transfected cells was tested by PCR using cellular genomic DNA as a template. Total RNA was isolated from 107 mammalian cells using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) and treated with 1 unit of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) for 15 mins at 37 °C; the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. 5 μg of RNA was mixed with 500 ng of Oligo (dT)15 (Promega), and reverse transcription was carried out with Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase according to supplier's protocol (Invitrogen). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human RAD51L2 cDNA was cloned into pBluescript II SK(–) (Stratagene) as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenic PCR was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) in 50 μl reactions. PCRs with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, 2.5 units/reaction) were performed as follows: 95 °C for 30 s; 18 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 13 min; and then 68 °C for 10 min. Mutagenic primers were designed to create the following changes to the amino acid sequence of RAD51L2: K131A, 5′-GCACCAGGTGTTGGAGCAACACAATTATGTATGCAGTTG-3′; and K131R, 5′-GCACCAGGTGTTGGACGAACACAATTATGTA-TGCAGTTG-3′ (forward primers only are shown; reverse primers had the complementary sequence). The mutagenized RAD51L2 genes were verified by sequencing, and inserts carrying mutations were subcloned into the pIRESneo2 vector (Clontech) to select against integration events that disrupted the RAD51L2 gene. Plasmid DNA was transfected into irs3 cells and selected as above. Six separate clones for each construct were picked and tested for MMC resistance (see above). Expression of RAD51L2-GFP Protein in irs3 Cells—RAD51L2 was amplified by using Pfu:Taq (1:10) DNA polymerase mixture with primers to incorporate a 5′-EcoRI site (5′-GGGAAGGAATTCCGCTTTGAAATG-3′) and a 3′-BamHI site (5′-TTTCTGGGATCCAATTCTTCCTCTGGGTCTCG-3′). Similarly, the C-terminal deletion of RAD51L2 was created by using a different reverse primer (5′-CGTGGATCCGTGCTCAAGGAACCTTCTGTTT-3′) to eliminate the final 11 amino acids of the protein. The products were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) to create an in-frame fusion of the EGFP gene to the 3′ end of RAD51L2 and checked by sequencing. After transfection of RAD51L2-GFP into irs3 cells, G418-resistant clones were tested for MMC resistance using 24-well plates (as above) to demonstrate RAD51L2 function. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, and the fusion protein was visualized at 488 nm using a Bio-Rad MRC600 laser scanning confocal microscope. Homologous Recombination Repair Assay—The recombination reporter p59xDR-GFP6, carrying two mutant GFP genes positioned at either side of the pgk-puro selection cassette (19Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Maria Jasin (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). V79 and irs3 cells were stably transfected with XhoI-linearized reporter DNA, and clones were isolated in 5 μg/ml puromycin. Sub-confluent cells were transiently transfected by electroporation (conditions as above) with 50 μg of pCBASce (I-SceI expression vector) or transiently cotransfected with 50 μg of pCBASce and 20 μgof RAD51L2 expression vector. Transfected cells were put into non-selective medium for 45 h, after which they were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out on 2 × 105 cells, and data were recorded on a green (FL1) versus red (FL3) fluorescence plot. Southern blotting was used to determine copy number and integrity of the DR-GFP construct in stably transfected clones. Two different digestion and probing strategies were used: (i) digestion with HindIII and probing with a GFP gene fragment to assess reporter copy number; and (ii) digestion with XcmI and probing with pgk-puro to assess linkage of the two mutant GFP genes. The HindIII digest yields one detectable fragment of known size (806 bp) that corresponds to one GFP gene (iGFP) and a second fragment of variable size that corresponds to SceGFP. Because this HindIII fragment size will vary with different copies of the reporter, it reveals copy number. XcmI cuts once in both SceGFP and iGFP, giving a fragment of known length (3687 bp) when the two genes are linked. Sequence Analysis—Nuclear localization signals were searched for with PredictNLS and PSORT. Homologues of RAD51L2 were found by searching current EST and protein databases using BLAST (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and manipulated for alignment by using programs within the GCG suite (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). RAD51L2 Translation Initiation Site—The functional activity of wild-type and mutated RAD51L2 protein was studied by transfection of human RAD51L2 cDNA into hamster cells (either the RAD51L2-deficient irs3 mutant or its wild-type V79 parent line). This procedure allowed the presence and expression of the transfected cDNA to be distinguished from any endogenous (hamster) RAD51L2 cDNA copies present. We have shown previously that the human cDNA substantially complements the RAD51L2 defect in irs3 (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and found subsequently that the hamster RAD51L2 cDNA is no better at functional complementation than the human cDNA (data not shown). The human cDNA has been reported to have two potential start codons, 27 base pairs apart, neither of which is in an ideal sequence context compared with the Kozak consensus (21Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The identification of both mouse (22Leasure C.S. Chandler J. Gilbert D.J. Householder D.B. Stephens R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sharan S.K. Gene. 2001; 271: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and hamster (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) RAD51L2 cDNAs showed that the first potential start codon is not conserved in these rodent species. We cloned the full-length human cDNA (including both potential start sites) or a cDNA truncated at the 5′ end to delete the first ATG (Fig. 1) into a vector with an internal ribosome entry site (pIRESneo2) to optimize selection of clones expressing RAD51L2 along with the selectable neo gene. These constructs were separately transfected into the irs3 cell line; after selection for the linked marker gene, clones were checked for the presence of the human RAD51L2 sequence in genomic DNA and for gene expression by RT-PCR. Very few clones (∼15%) transfected with the full-length cDNA had successfully integrated and expressed RAD51L2. Conversely, irs3 transfected with the 5′-truncated cDNA showed larger numbers (∼60%) of clones with successful RAD51L2 integration and expression. Clones with either the full-length or the 5′-truncated construct in genomic DNA were able to complement the MMC sensitivity to a very similar level (data not shown). We interpret these data to indicate that the second ATG of the human gene is capable of yielding a functional product in hamster cells, and therefore we used constructs including only this site in all subsequent experiments (Fig. 1). Walker A Motif Is Important for RAD51L2 Function—The invariant lysine residue in the RAD51L2 Walker A motif was altered by site-directed mutagenesis to give either a non-conservative K131A mutation or a conservative K131R mutation (Fig. 1). Clones of irs3 cells transfected with the RAD51L2 K131A or K131R constructs were selected and checked for the presence of the mutant gene in genomic DNA and for gene expression by RT-PCR (data not shown). Growth tests of six individual clones expressing the RAD51L2 K131A construct in different MMC concentrations showed that each had no better ability to grow than untransfected irs3 cells. Full survival curves on pooled clones confirmed this finding (Fig. 2A). However, 5/5 clones expressing the RAD51L2 K131R construct were able to grow at higher MMC levels than irs3 in growth tests. Full survival curves of pooled clones carrying RAD51L2 K131R showed a level of MMC resistance between that of untransfected irs3 cells and cells transfected with wild-type RAD51L2 cDNA (Fig. 2A). These data strongly support the importance of the Lys-131 residue and, by inference, the Walker A motif in the function of the RAD51L2 protein. Localization of the RAD51L2 Protein and Effect of Loss of the C Terminus—RAD51L2 cDNA was fused with EGFP and the construct was transfected into irs3 cells. The proportion of selected clones expressing RAD51L2 was lower than for the experiments reported above, because the EGFP vector does not carry an internal ribosome entry site. However, those clones expressing the RAD51L2-EGFP fusion gene were as resistant to MMC as clones expressing wild-type RAD51L2 cDNA, indicating that the EGFP tag did not affect function (data not shown). Assessment of the localization of the fluorescent fusion protein by confocal microscopy showed it to be predominantly nuclear, apart from the nucleoli, although some cytoplasmic speckles were also visible (Fig. 3A). Clones transfected with the EGFP vector alone showed fluorescence throughout the cell (data not shown). Although search programs for an NLS motif in RAD51L2 did not identify any sequence at high probability, there is a short sequence of hydrophilic residues common to known NLS motifs (-RKRSR-) at the C terminus of the human protein (Fig. 1, amino acids 366–370, in bold). Compared with surrounding residues, we found that this sequence is highly conserved in RAD51L2 proteins from different mammals, and the conservation of the arginine and lysine residues extends to the predicted proteins of other newly identified RAD51L2 genes in lower vertebrates (Fig. 3C). To test the importance of this C-terminal region, a second EGFP fusion construct was generated with an 11 amino acid C-terminal deletion including the putative NLS (Fig. 1, amino acids 366–376). Several clones were selected after transfection of this construct, and those expressing the 3′ truncated RAD51L2 cDNA were tested for MMC resistance. Tests on individual clones showed that they had substantially reduced MMC resistance compared with wild-type RAD51L2 cDNA (data not shown), and full survival curves on pooled clones confirmed and quantified this result (Fig. 2B). Importantly, confocal imaging of the clones showed EGFP fluorescence distributed throughout the cell rather than localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3B). RAD51L2-deficient Cells Have a Reduced Frequency of Homologous Recombination—To measure HR, the irs3 cell line and its wild-type counterpart (V79 line) were transfected with a recombination reporter substrate consisting of tandem defective genes encoding the GFP (19Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). One of the GFP genes is inactivated by the incorporation of an I-SceI endonuclease site, allowing a double-strand break (DSB) to be generated within the gene, whereas the other is truncated at both ends. Recombination by gene conversion can generate an intact GFP gene, the expression of which can be detected by flow cytometry (23Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Ten clones of each cell line carrying the recombination reporter substrate were analyzed for GFP fluorescence after transfection of a plasmid expressing the I-SceI endonuclease (pCBASce) to show that they retained at least one intact copy of the substrate. Clones with the potential for GFP expression were then assessed for copy number and linkage of the two GFP genes in the substrate using two different digestion/probing strategies on Southern blots (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 4A and data not shown). In this way, three clones from each cell line carrying a single copy or two copies of the substrate were identified and used in recombination frequency measurements (Fig. 4B). Although there was some clone-to-clone variation, all irs3-derived clones showed a significantly lower percentage of GFP-positive cells than the V79-derived clones (Table I). Thus, irs3 cells showed on average an ∼7-fold decrease in the ability to repair an induced DSB by HR. To test directly whether the recombination deficiency in irs3 was caused by the lack of RAD51L2 protein, human RAD51L2 cDNA was co-transfected with pCBASce plasmid into both irs3-derived and V79-derived cells. Consistent with partial complementation shown in other tests (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the expression of RAD51L2 gave a 2- to 3-fold increase in the frequency of GFP-positive cells in the irs3-derived clones, compared with I-SceI expression alone, whereas no increase was seen in the V79-derived clones (Table I and Fig. 4B).Table IFrequency of recombination (GFP-positive cells) in wild-type and RAD51L2-deficient irs3 cells, as well as in cells transfected with wild-type RAD51L2 cDNACloneCopy numberaNumber of integrated copies of recombination substrate, determined by Southern analysis (see Fig. 4A; clone irs3-17 had one copy of smaller-than-expected size, so it may have only one functional copy).GFP-positive cellsbAveraged from 2-3 experiments per clone.S.E.Mean GFP-positive cells(I-SceI + L2)(I-SceI)cRelative increase in recombination frequency following transfection of RAD51L2 cDNA.%%irs3-520.290.053.3irs3-1720.130.060.241.8irs3-2410.260.022.2V79-712.760.251.1V79-1021.000.291.720.93V79-1511.410.330.93a Number of integrated copies of recombination substrate, determined by Southern analysis (see Fig. 4A; clone irs3-17 had one copy of smaller-than-expected size, so it may have only one functional copy).b Averaged from 2-3 experiments per clone.c Relative increase in recombination frequency following transfection of RAD51L2 cDNA. Open table in a new tab RAD51L2 is thought to play an important role in the repair of damage in genomic DNA by homologous recombination. Consistent with this role, the RAD51L2-EGFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus, probably utilizing a C-terminal nuclear localization signal. At present, our experiments have refined the region for nuclear localization to the final 11 amino acids, and more precise site-directed mutagenesis would be required to show that the RKRSR motif is directly involved. However, it should be noted that the remaining residues at the C terminus are not completely conserved (Fig. 3C), suggesting that they do not necessarily have an essential function, and that the sequence (R/KR/KR/K(small)R/K) is found among currently verified NLS motifs (where “small” indicates a small amino acid such as Ser or Pro) (24Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Additionally, NLS motifs are often bounded by negatively charged amino acids (Asp or Glu) (16Boulikas T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 32-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), as seen in the RAD51L2 sequences (Fig. 3C). RAD51L2 is part of two complexes formed by the RAD51-like proteins, a heterodimer of RAD51L2 (RAD51C) and XRCC3, and a heterotetramer of RAD51L1 (RAD51B), RAD51L2, RAD51L3 (RAD51D), and XRCC2 (25Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R. McIlwraith M.J. Benson F.E. West S.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3296-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 26Wiese C. Collins D.W. Albala J.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Some of the other RAD51-like proteins have properties similar to RAD51L2: for example, we have shown that XRCC2 localizes to the nucleus and, like RAD51L2, is important for the formation of RAD51 nuclear foci after DNA damage (15O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, sequence analysis suggests that XRCC2 does not have an NLS, so that the role of RAD51L2 may extend to facilitating the entry of XRCC2 (and perhaps other RAD51-like proteins) into the nucleus. Site-directed mutagenesis of the invariant lysine in the Walker A motif of human RAD51L2 indicates that this residue is important for protein function. Our data for the non-conservative (Lys → Ala) mutation relative to the conservative (Lys → Arg) mutation are analogous to data for the human RAD51 protein (see beginning of paper). The deleterious effect associated with these RAD51L2 mutations is likely caused by loss of ATPase activity, because purified RAD51L2 protein was recently demonstrated to have DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (29Lio Y.C. Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2469-2478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, complexes of the RAD51L1-RAD51L2 heterodimer and the RAD51L1-RAD51L2-RAD51L3-XRCC2 heterotetramer both exhibit ATPase activity (29Lio Y.C. Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2469-2478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Masson J.Y. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Benson F.E. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the functioning of at least one component of the heterotetramer, XRCC2, does not suffer from mutation of the Walker A motif (15O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), indicating that the other components including RAD51L2 are important in supplying the ATPase activity for the complex. Analysis of three RAD51L2-deficient (irs3) clones and three wild-type (V79) clones carrying a GFP recombination reporter substrate showed that repair of an induced DSB by gene conversion is reduced on average by ∼7-fold in the RAD51L2-deficient cell line. Although some variation in the frequency of GFP-positive cells was found between different clones, this did not relate to reporter gene copy number (Table I). This reduction in recombination frequency is quite modest compared with that reported for cell lines deficient in other RAD51-like genes; for example, using a similar GFP-based system, XRCC3-deficient hamster cells showed a 25-fold reduction in recombination frequency (23Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). However, the XRCC3-deficient cells had an ∼50-fold increased sensitivity to the killing effects of MMC (32Caldecott K. Jeggo P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas under the same conditions, the RAD51L2-deficient cells showed a 7-fold hypersensitivity to MMC (17Jones N.J. Cox R. Thacker J. Mutat Res. 1987; 183: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The modest effect on recombination frequency seen for irs3 is therefore consistent with the milder damage-sensitivity phenotype displayed by this cell line. The relatively lower sensitivity of irs3, when compared with other recombination-deficient cell lines, could relate to the nature of the mutation in the respective genes or to differing roles of the recombination proteins involved. Recombination in BRCA2 mutant cells is reduced by 6- to >100-fold, depending on the nature of the mutation (19Moynahan M.E. Pierce A.J. Jasin M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the reporter construct used in our analysis measured repair of a DSB by providing a homologous template from which genetic information could be copied. This RAD51-dependent process has been shown to involve mostly non-reciprocal events, termed gene conversion (33Johnson R.D. Jasin M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Recently another measure of recombination, gene targeting frequency, was used to suggest that a RAD51L2-deficient chick lymphoblastoid cell line had a reduced level of HR at two loci (by 6-fold and 13-fold, respectively) (34Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Tachiiri S. Fukushima T. Sonoda E. Schild D. Thompson L.H. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). However, it was not possible to demonstrate that this targeting defect was directly related to the RAD51L2 gene, because the defect could not be complemented by cDNA transfection (although other chick cell responses could be complemented in this way). Gene targeting may be achieved by mechanisms other than gene conversion, perhaps including non-homologous events (35Jasin M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 224-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 36Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, the human RAD51L2 gene was able to substantially complement the recombination deficiency of the irs3 line, similar to other responses we have shown here (Fig. 2A) and in previous work (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have demonstrated a specific effect of RAD51L2 on homologous recombination efficiency for the first time. As noted above, RAD51L2 has a unique role among the human RAD51-like proteins in forming part of both the heterodimeric (L2:X3) and heterotetrameric (L1:L2:L3:X2) complexes. The roles identified for RAD51L2 in this study, its requirement for the ATP-binding domain, for nuclear localization, and for gene conversion, give a sound basis for further functional analysis of this protein. Although the biochemical steps of RAD51-dependent HR are known in outline, especially from studies with yeast (36Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the importance of the RAD51-like proteins in the different HR stages is still the subject of intense research effort. There is evidence for their involvement in early HR stages by helping RAD51 polymerize onto DNA, in helping to displace single-stranded DNA binding protein (31Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S. Bussen W. Schild D. Albala J.S. Sung P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3308-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 37Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), as well as in the strand invasion step (38Sugawara N. Ivanov E.L. Fishman-Lobell J. Ray B.L. Wu X. Haber J.E. Nature. 1995; 373: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, some recent data point to a potential role of these proteins in later stages of HR (5French C.A. Masson J.Y. Griffin C.S. O'Regan P. West S.C. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19322-19330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Lio Y.C. Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Chen D.J. J. Biol.

The challenge now is to integrate these various data into a coherent picture of the functioning of RAD51L2 and its partners in HR and related processes.

If unrepaired, further replication of A·8-oxoG mispairs results in C:G to A:T transversions, a form of genomic instability. We reported previously that repair of A·8-oxoG mispairs was defective and that 8-oxoG levels were elevated in several microsatellite stable human colorectal cancer cell lines lacking MutY mutations (human MutY homolog gene, hmyh, MYH MutY homolog protein). In this report, we provide biochemical evidence that the defective repair of A·8-oxoG may be due, at least in part, to defective phosphorylation of the MutY protein in these cell lines. In MutY-defective cell extracts, but not extracts with functional MutY, A·8-oxoG repair was increased by incubation with protein kinases A and C (PKA and PKC) and caesin kinase II. Treatment of these defective cells, but not cells with functional MutY, with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate also increased the cellular A·8-oxoG repair activity and decreased the elevated 8-oxoG levels. We show that MutY is serine-phosphorylated in vitro by the action of PKC and in the MutY-defective cells by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate but that MutY is already phosphorylated at baseline in proficient cell lines. Finally, using antibody-isolated MutY protein, we show that MutY can be directly phosphorylated by PKC that directly increases the level of MutY catalyzed A·8-oxoG repair.

Repair of DNA damage is an essential process required for maintaining genomic stability and cellular function. One form of DNA damage, oxidation, can be caused by exposure to reactive oxygen species, routinely generated as byproducts of the respiratory chain, during inflammation, by the exposure to ionizing radiation, or other oxidative stress conditions. Oxidation of DNA causes a wide variety of damage including strand breaks, abasic (Apurinic/Apyrimidinic) sites and oxidized bases that have been implicated in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and aging, among others (1Olinski R.

If unrepaired during subsequent replication, adenine may be incorporated opposite the 8-oxoG, thereby producing an A·8-oxoG mispair. If the A·8-oxoG mispair is unrepaired, during the next round of replication, the adenine can pair properly with thymidine, thereby producing an C:G to A:T transversion. To combat the deleterious, biological effects of this lesion, cells have developed specific mechanisms to repair 8-oxoG using the base excision repair pathway (BER) (for a review, see Ref. 4Krokan H.E.

In Escherichia coli and human cells, three proteins known as the “GO system” are known to be involved in defending cellular DNA against the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG. The first level of defense is the human MutT homolog (MTH1 (5Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Tsuzuki T. Kakuma T. Kawabata S. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23524-23530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) that has nucleoside triphosphatase activity, hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP, thereby eliminating it from the nucleotide pool. The second level of defense is direct repair, whereby human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase protein (8-hydroxyguanine glycosylase (OGG1) (6Rosenquist T.A. Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Finally, the human MutY protein removes adenines from A·8-oxoG mismatches with its adenine glycosylase activity (8Parker A.R. . Eshelamn J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Given its essential role, MutY-defective E. coli display a mutator phenotype with an approximate 30-fold increase in their mutation rate and a spectrum dominant in C:G to A:T base transversions (9Nghiem Y. Cabrera M. Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2709-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These elevated mutation rates can be genetically complemented by transformation with human mutY cDNA. In the human system, biallelic germline mutY mutations have been found in familial colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with multiple adenomas and carcinomas (10Al-Tassan N. Chmiel N.H. Maynard J.

We previously identified five microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC cell lines that are defective in human MutY A·8-oxoG repair activity and MutY protein expression (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar). In the same five cell lines, the genomic 8-oxoG levels are elevated more than 10-fold above control MSS CRC cell lines that possess normal levels and activities of human MutY. In contrast to the above patients with biallelic mutY mutations, however, these five functionally defective CRC cell lines do not possess mutations in the human mutY gene. Detailed evidence of control of MutY activity is at present limited. Gu and Lu (13Gu Y. Lu A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have suggested previously that human MutY might be phosphorylated in HeLa cell extracts by demonstrating a smaller molecular mass of MutY in SDS-PAGE after treatment with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. These data suggest that MutY may be phosphorylated, at least under certain conditions. In another line of investigation, a number of studies have reported decreased protein kinase C (PKC) activity levels in human and rodent colonic tumors (14Wali R.K. Baum C.L. Bolt M.J. Dudeja P.K. Sitrin M.D. Brasitus T.A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1991; 1092: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that defective phosphorylation might, at least in part, be responsible for the defective MutY activity in our MSS CRC cell lines. We show here that repair of an A·8-oxoG mispaired oligonucleotide can be increased in these defective cell lines by the action of protein kinases on cell extracts and by PMA treatment, known to induce PKC activity, of intact cells. There were no significant increases in A·8-oxoG repair in MutY-proficient cell lines. In addition, the PMA-induced increase in activity was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with a PKC inhibitor. We show that the PMA-induced increase in repair activity correlates with decreased levels of elevated genomic 8-oxoG in the MutY-defective cell lines and not MutY-proficient cell lines that contain background 8-oxoG levels. We show that MutY, in the MutY-defective cell lines, is phosphorylated in vitro by the action of PKC and in the cell by PMA, but that it is already phosphorylated in MutY-proficient cell lines. Finally, using antibody-isolated MutY protein, we show that MutY can be directly phosphorylated by PKC that directly increases the level of MutY catalyzed A·8-oxoG repair. Cell Lines and Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts—The five human MSS CRC cell lines, VACO411, VACO425, VACO429, VACO489, and VACO9M, used in this study were isolated and generously provided by Dr. James Willson (Ireland Cancer Center and Case Western Reserve University), and SW837 and SW480 were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Center (ATCC). All cell lines were grown as described (15Eshleman J.R. Lang E.Z. Bowerfind G.K. Parsons R. Vogelstein B. Willson J.K. Veigl M.L. Sedwick W.D. Markowitz S.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 33-37PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of SW480/vector and SW480/AS-mutY (SW480 transfected with vector alone or antisense mutY cDNA) will be described elsewhere. 2A. R. Parker, F. Sahin, G. H. Su, and J. R. Eshleman, submitted for publication. Both transfected cell lines were maintained as described above in regular growth medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested as reported previously (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar). A·8-oxoG Glycosylase Assay—A·8-oxoG glycosylase activity was measured as described previously (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar), except that 50 μg of cell extracts were used. Equal lane loading was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The amount of cleavage was similar to that reported previously (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation and A·8-oxoG Repair—To examine the potential effects of in vitro phosphorylation on A·8-oxoG repair, 50 μg of whole cell extracts were incubated with protein kinase A (PKA) (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA), PKC (Promega, Madison, WI), or caesin kinase II (CKII) (New England Biolabs) in TGED buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 500 μm ATP, and 2 units of the appropriate kinase. The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C and stored on ice. Aliquots were then taken and assayed for changes in glycosylase activity. Induction of Cellular PKC with PMA and Inhibition with Bisindolylmaleimide IX—The cell lines were seeded in 150-cm3 media flasks at ∼50% confluency (∼1 × 107 cells) in MEM2+ media (16Willson J.K. Bittner G.N. Oberley T.D. Meisner L.F. Weese J.L. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2704-2713PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 days. Cells were incubated with 1.0 μm PMA (Sigma) in serum-free MEM2+ media for 6 h and harvested by centrifugation. In some experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h with 5 μm bisindolylmaleimide IX (RO-31–8220, Sigma) before and during PMA treatment. PKC Activity—The PKC activity in cell extracts (20 μg) was tested using the PepTag® PKC assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. The PepTag® C1 fluorescent peptide (RLSRTLSVAAK, 500 ng) was phosphorylated by the cell line extracts (treated with or without PMA) or purified PKC in PKC reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP) with 250 μm phosphatidyl serine. Phosphorylation changes the net charge of the peptide substrate from +1 to –1. The phosphorylated and unphosphorylated versions of the substrate were then separated on a 1% agarose gel. The negatively charged bands from the cell lines were excised from the gels and heated to 95 °C. For controls, regions of the gels were excised that contained no peptides. The mixture was diluted with gel solubilization solution (Promega) and glacial acetic acid, and the absorbance was recorded at 570 nm. Liquid Chromatography and Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS) Measurement of 8-Hydroxyguanosine—LC/MS/MS was performed as described (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar) with the following exceptions: the mobile phase consisted of 1% acetic acid as eluent A and an Atlantis C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3 μm, Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was used. The flow rate with this solvent and column was increased to 400 μl/min with a desolvation temperature of 550 °C. In addition, 5-N15–8-oxoG from N15 algal genomic DNA (Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD) was used as an internal standard. This was accomplished by using the standard hydrolysis procedure on the DNA, isolating 5-N15–2dG and reacting it with methylene blue to create 5-N15–8-oxoG. The N15–2dG and N15–8-oxoG were then separated on a Luna C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Fractions were collected and pooled, and then lyophilized and brought to an appropriate volume such that 10 μl added to a sample vial contained ∼50 fmol of N15–8-oxoG. With these improvements, the detection limit for 8-oxoG was increased to 5 fmol on the column with less standard deviation due to co-elution with the N15–8-oxoG internal standard. The N15–8oxoG is monitored at the parent-daughter ion transition of 289–173 (5 mass units greater than the N14–8-oxoG pair of 284–168). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots—VACO411, SW837, SW480/vector, or SW480/AS-mutY whole cell extracts (0.5 mg), untreated or after treatment with PMA or PKC (2 units), was diluted 2-fold to 1 ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin, and then precleared by adding 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Invitrogen), gently rocking for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-human MutY (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose (20 μl) was added and incubated for 4–12 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, the supernatant was stored, and the pellet was washed three times with 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. A control was run concurrently without the anti-human MutY antibody. The pellets were reconstituted in 1× SDS loading buffer (New England Biolabs) and then resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that the initial blocking step was increased to 24 h when using the human MutY antibody (Alpha Diagnostics). The anti-phosphoserine (Sigma) and anti-phosphothreonine (Sigma) antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500, and the anti-phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling, Beverley, MA) antibody, used at a dilution of 1:2000, was kindly provided by Dr. Anirban Maitra (The Johns Hopkins University). MutY Immunodepletion of Extracts Using Anti-MutY Antibody—Cell extracts (2 mg) treated with PKC or from PMA-treated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation of MutY, as described above, using the anti-MutY antibody. Supernatants were collected and analyzed by both Western blot and glycosylase activity for MutY protein and function. A·8-oxoG Repair Is Up-regulated by in Vitro Phosphorylation of Cell Extracts—Because of the possibility that MutY might be regulated by phosphorylation, we investigated the potential involvement of hypo-phosphorylation in defective A·8-oxoG repair. We treated cell extracts from four defective MSS CRC cell lines, VACO411, VACO 425, VACO429, and VACO489, and two MutY-proficient cell lines, VACO9 M and SW837 (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar), with three protein kinases and monitored the effect they had on the cleavage of a 20-bp A·8-oxoG oligonucleotide duplex. All three kinases, PKA, PKC, and CKII, are serine/threonine kinases and have been shown to regulate the activities of several DNA repair proteins such as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), cockayne syndrome B protein), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), and replication protein A (RPA) by phosphorylation (17Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Kaina B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yacoub A. Kelley M.R. Deutsch W.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5457-5459PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20Christiansen M. Stevnsner T. Modin C. Martensen P.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of the extracts from all four defective cell lines with these kinases increased the cleavage of the A·8-oxoG oligonucleotide considerably, with the most significant increase observed with PKC treatment (Fig. 1A). The repair activity was not significantly increased in the MutY-proficient cell lines after phosphorylation. MutY immunodepletion of the PKC-treated cell extracts using an anti-MutY antibody showed marked decreases in cleavage activity relative to the PKC-treated extracts, suggesting that the increase in cleavage activity stimulated by PKC was mainly attributable to the specific increase in the activity of defective human MutY. Equal loading of each lane was monitored by resolving the same samples in separate SDS-PAGE gels and detecting with Coomassie Blue staining (an example is shown in Fig. 1B). Human MutY Serines Are Phosphorylated in Vitro—Since MutY is the major protein involved in repair of A·8-oxoG mispairs, we asked whether phosphorylation of MutY correlated with the increase in A·8-oxoG repair observed after treatment of the MutY-defective cell extracts with protein kinases. Evaluation of a MutY antibody, using the MutY-proficient cell line SW480/vector, shows that immunoprecipitation with the human MutY antibody and Western blot analysis produced only one protein band of ∼59 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In the absence of anti-MutY antibody, essentially no MutY protein was detected in the precipitates (lane 2). Furthermore, when the immunoprecipitation was carried out using a MutY-defective cell line, stably transfected with mutY antisense cDNA, the 59-kDa protein band was also not detected, regardless of whether the MutY antibody was used or not (lanes 3 and 4). These data lead us to conclude that the MutY antibody specifically reacts with and directly immunoprecipitates MutY protein and therefore is suitable for immunoprecipitation studies. Since PKC treatment of the MutY-defective cell extracts provided the largest increase in cleavage activity and VACO411 possessed the largest increase in cleavage activity in response to PKC treatment (Fig. 1A), we used this cell line and the MutY-proficient cell line SW837 to investigate whether human MutY is phosphorylated, as suggested previously (13Gu Y. Lu A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As expected, there was no apparent difference in the levels of MutY immunoprecipitated in the extracts treated with and without PKC (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 with lanes 2). Using these immunoprecipitates, we tested whether human MutY was phosphorylated in vitro, by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues. After treatment with PKC, phosphoserine protein bands the same size as human MutY were detected in both cell lines, but although a phosphoserine band was observed in SW837 in the absence of PKC treatment, no band was observed in VACO411 without PKC treatment. This suggested that serine residues were not phosphorylated in the MutY-defective cell line VACO411 but could be phosphorylated in vitro with PKC (lanes 3 and 4). Phosphothreonine protein bands were detected with and without PKC treatment in both cell lines (lanes 7 and 8), and no bands were evident either before or after treatment when probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (lanes 5 and 6). The use of cell extracts does not definitely prove that MutY is phosphorylated. For a more direct analysis of MutY phosphorylation, we used the antibody-purified MutY from untreated cell lines to test whether it could be directly phosphorylated in vitro and could therefore be directly responsible for the increase in A·8-oxoG repair. Immunoprecipitation of MutY was performed from the MutY-defective cell line VACO411 and treated with or without PKC (Fig. 3A). Treatment of antibody-purified MutY with PKC increased the levels of A·8-oxoG repair ∼3-fold. Using the MutY-defective SW480/AS-mutY cell line and the MutY-proficient SW480/vector cell line as controls, we also show that no increases in A·8-oxoG repair were evident in either cell line after incubation with PKC, suggesting that the increased A·8-oxoG activity levels in VACO411 after PKC treatment were relatively specific for MutY phosphorylation. Since the results from Fig. 2B suggest that MutY is hypophosphorylated at serine residues in MutY-defective cell lines and that treatment of antibody-isolated MutY with PKC increases A·8-oxoG repair (Fig. 3A), we tested whether PKC treatment would directly phosphorylate MutY serine residues. Fig. 3B shows that PKC treatment of MutY from VACO411 increases the phosphorylation of serine residues (compare lanes 1 with lanes 2) but does not alter the phosphorylation status of tyrosine or threonine residues. As expected, there were no bands detected in the MutY-defective antisense cell line (compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 5 and 6), and in the MutY-proficient cell line SW480/vector, there is no change in the phosphorylation status of serines, tyrosines, or threonines as observed in cell-free extracts. When one considers the increase in functional activity after phosphorylation by PKC (Fig. 1) and the demonstration of MutY phosphorylation in cell extracts (Fig. 2B) and when antibody-purified (Fig. 3B), we conclude that the MutY is most likely directly phosphorylated at one or more serine residues and that this process may be defective in the VACO411 CRC cell line. A·8-oxoG Repair Is Up-regulated by PMA Treatment of MutY-defective Cells—The in vitro data suggested that MutY activity could be regulated by its phosphorylation state, so we hypothesized that MutY may be regulated by phosphorylation in the cell. Since PKC produced the largest increase in activity in vitro (Fig. 1), phosphorylated MutY in cell extracts (Fig. 2), and antibody-purified MutY (Fig. 3B) in vitro and since some colon cancers are known to have a decrease in PKC, we tested whether treatment of the MutY-defective cells with the tumor-promoting agent phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) would increase A·8-oxoG repair since it is known to induce PKC activity (21Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar). The four MSS CRC cell lines and two MutY-proficient cell lines were exposed to PMA for 6 h, and the extracts were examined for changes in PKC activity. As shown in Fig. 4A, PMA exposure resulted in an increase in PKC activity, which in the cell line VACO411 could be inhibited by the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (Fig. 4B). The increase in PKC activity was substantially less in the MutY-proficient cell lines. The increase in PKC activity was accompanied by an approximate 2-fold increase in A·8-oxoG cleavage activities in the four MutY-defective cell lines (Fig. 4C), which similar to the increase in PKC activity, decreased significantly upon preincubation of VACO411 with bisindolylmaleimide (Fig. 4D). Similar to the lack of increase in PKC activity, there was little if any elevation in the A·8-oxoG cleavage activity in the two MutY-proficient cell lines. MutY immunodepletion of the extracts from PMA-treated cell lines (Fig. 4C) decreased the activity to less than 10% of the activity observed after PMA treatment, and thus, it appears that the PMA-stimulated increase in cleavage activity in the MutY-defective cell lines probably involves PKC and is likely attributable to effects on human MutY. Human MutY Is Phosphorylated in the Cell—Since the data suggest that MutY is directly phosphorylated by the action of PKC (Fig. 3, A and B), we investigated whether human MutY is directly phosphorylated after treatment with PMA. Fig. 5, A and B, shows, by Western blotting, that after PMA treatment of VACO411, SW837, and SW480/vector, the level of MutY protein was up-regulated ∼2–3-fold. There was no expression of MutY in the MutY-defective cell line SW480/AS-mutY, either with or without PMA treatment. After PMA treatment of VACO411 and immunoprecipitation with the MutY antibody, a novel phosphoserine protein band appeared when probed with the anti-phosphoserine antibody, whereas the same antibody did not detect a band in the untreated VACO411 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that serine phosphorylation of MutY in VACO411 may be defective (Fig. 6, compare lanes 1 with lanes 2, first panel). Using the anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies, protein bands were detected in SW837 and SW480/vector MutY immunoprecipitates both before and after PMA treatment (Fig. 6, compare lanes 1 with lanes 2 and compare lanes 5 with lanes 6, second and third panels). It is interesting to note that MutY threonine residues in VACO411 were phosphorylated in the untreated cells, similar to the results observed in the in vitro study. Since the increase in MutY protein, after PMA treatment, appears to have no effect on the phosphorylation status of MutY in the MutY-proficient cell lines, after PMA treatment, it is conceivable that threonine may also be phosphorylated in response to PMA (although clearly at lower levels than the phosphorylation of serine). No bands were evident either before or after treatment of any of the cell lines when probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (lanes 3 and 4), and as expected, in the control cell line SW480/AS-mutY, no bands were detected in these immunoprecipitated samples with or without PMA, suggesting that the phospho-protein bands detected were specifically MutY protein (fourth panel). When one considers the direct increase in functional activity of antibody-purified MutY and the demonstration of direct MutY phosphorylation by PKC and after PMA treatment, we conclude that the MutY protein is likely regulated by phosphorylation in the cell. Increased Cleavage of A·8-oxoG Correlates with Decreased Levels of Elevated 8-oxoG in PMA-treated Cell Lines—Background levels of oxidative DNA damage detected in normal tissue arise through the production of endogenous reactive oxygen species, a byproduct of normal cell metabolism. Given that oxidative DNA damage can be produced endogenously, defense mechanisms such as MutY are required. The absence of these mechanisms should result in a steady increase in oxidative DNA damage since the production of the damage is unaltered but the repair mechanism is absent. In this sense, the 8-oxoG levels attributed to MutY may be thought of as a separate component, where equilibrium between production and removal (MutY) determines the baseline level. Thus, when MutY is defective, the basal level would be expected to rise. We reported previously that these four MutY-defective cell lines possess elevated levels of 8-oxoG in their genomic DNA and hypothesized that this was a consequence of defective A·8-oxoG repair. Since A·8-oxoG cleavage is increased in cell extracts after PMA treatment, we hypothesized that PMA treatment may also correct the elevated 8-oxoG levels found in these CRC cell lines. Fig. 7 shows that isolated genomic DNA from the same four MutY-defective cell lines contained ∼2–3-fold lower levels of 8-oxoG after PMA treatment, correlating well with the ∼2-fold increase in repair activity (Fig. 4D). In the two MutY-proficient cell lines, no changes in the baseline levels of 8-oxoG were observed with or without PMA treatment. Identification of Putative Phosphorylation Sites on MutY— Analysis of the amino acid sequence of human MutY using PROSITE and PHOSPHOBASE, version 2.0, identified six serine residues as potential sites of PKC phosphorylation (Fig. 8A). Fig. 8B shows that, with the exception of serine 9 and serine 85, the serine residues are highly conserved among human, rat and mouse MutY homologous proteins. Serines 9 and 504 are present in or around the potential binding sites for RPA and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and phosphorylation may therefore influence binding of the these proteins, as is seen with the interactions of RPA with xeroderma pigmentosum A and DNA protein kinase (8Parker A.R. . Eshelamn J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues, however, in other conditions and by other kinases, cannot be explicitly excluded. Examination of which of the potential serine sites identified in Fig. 8 are actually phosphorylated (Figs. 2B, 3B, and 6) is at present being investigated. This work was designed to identify the non-genetic mechanisms responsible for regulating repair of the mutagenic A·8-oxoG mispair in several MSS CRC cell lines that we have reported to possess defective A·8-oxoG repair, defective human MutY protein, and elevated genomic 8-oxoG levels (12Parker A.R. O'Meally R.N. Oliver D.H. Hua L. Nelson W.G. DeWeese T.L. Eshleman J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7230-7233PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that A·8-oxoG cleavage is increased in vitro by protein kinase treatment, and this correlated with a direct increase in A·8-oxoG cleavage activity of antibody-purified MutY protein and direct phosphorylation of MutY serine residues and of MutY phosphorylation in cell extracts. No increase in A·8-oxoG cleavage or MutY phosphorylation was observed in MutY-proficient cell lines or in a MutY-defective antisense cell line that contains no detectable MutY protein, when treated with PKC, suggesting the that the effects were a direct effect of MutY phosphorylation. A·8-oxoG cleavage is also increased by PMA treatment in the MutY-defective cell lines, but not in the MutY-proficient cell lines, and this can be inhibited by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide. Furthermore, these changes correlate with phosphorylated MutY protein at serine residues in the same MutY-defective cells. In PMA-treated MutY-defective cells, this also correlates with a decrease in the elevated genomic 8-oxoG levels, whereas in the MutY-proficient cells, the baseline levels of 8-oxoG remain unchanged. Finally, upregulation of MutY was shown to occur at the protein level. The exact physiological role of MutY phosphorylation still has to be fully explained. As well as directly increasing the MutY repair activity, it is possible that phosphorylation regulates the interaction of MutY with its binding partners APE1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, RPA, and MSH6 (22Parker A.

Lu A.L. J. Biol.

Villa A. Negri C. Scovassi I. Ciarrocchi G. Biamonti G. Montecucco A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5745-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of MutY may also control organelle translocation as observed for the MutSα (Mut S homologs 2 and 6) protein (17Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Kaina B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1959-1966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) since the increased levels of A·8-oxoG repair could reduce the pool of free MutY in either the nucleus or the mitochondria and could provide the signal for increased organelle transport. Furthermore, it is known that oxidants and oxidative stress can stimulate PKC activity by reacting with its regulatory domain (25Klein I.K. Ritland S.R. Burgart L.J. Ziesmer S.C. Roche P.C. Gendler S.J. Karnes Jr., W.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2077-2080PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that human MutY could be phosphorylated in response to DNA damage. The results from this study suggest that defective repair of A·8-oxoG may be the result of defective phosphorylation. Several laboratories have documented changes in PKC activity and PKC isozyme expression in intestinal neoplasms (14Wali R.K. Baum C.L. Bolt M.J. Dudeja P.K. Sitrin M.D. Brasitus T.A. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1991; 1092: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, decreased levels of PKC activity have also been observed in preneoplastic colonic mucosa and in colonic adenomas (26Kahl-Rainer P. Karner-Hanusch J. Weiss W. Marian B. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Baum C.L. Wali R.K. Sitrin M.D. Bolt M.J. Brasitus T.A.

Of the 10 or so PKC isoforms, decreased levels of PKC isoforms α, βI, ϵ, η, δ, and ζ in human and rodent colonic tumors have been reported, with the loss of α, βI, and ζ reported to be an early event during intestinal carcinogenesis (25Klein I.K.

In this report, we have demonstrated that MutY can be phosphorylated and that when it is, this enhances its adenine cleavage activity and decreases elevated 8-oxoG levels in MutY-defective cells. Uncovering the biochemical controls of MutY regulation will be an important step toward a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in cellular defense against oxidative DNA damage.

Genes coding for putative homologs of Cdc6 have been also identified in the genomic sequence of Archaea, but the properties of the corresponding proteins have been poorly investigated so far. Herein, we report the biochemical characterization of one of the three putative Cdc6-like factors from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoCdc6-1). SsoCdc6-1 was overproduced in Escherichia coli as a His-tagged protein and purified to homogeneity. Gel filtration and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that this protein behaves as a monomer in solution (molecular mass of about 45 kDa). We demonstrated that SsoCdc6-1 binds single- and double-stranded DNA molecules by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. SsoCdc6-1 undergoes autophosphorylation in vitro and possesses a weak ATPase activity, whereas the protein with a mutation in the Walker A motif (Lys-59 → Ala) is completely unable to hydrolyze ATP and does not autophosphorylate. We found that SsoCdc6-1 strongly inhibits the ATPase and DNA helicase activity of the S. solfataricus MCM protein. These findings provide the first in vitro biochemical evidence of a functional interaction between a MCM complex and a Cdc6 factor and have important implications for the understanding of the Cdc6 biological function.

The initiation of chromosomal DNA replication is of fundamental importance for the inheritance of genetic material and cell cycle regulation. In all organisms it requires the sequential assembly of macromolecular complexes at the replication origins. Genetic and biochemical studies highlight general properties of DNA replication initiation in a variety of model systems. In particular, bacterial and viral models greatly contribute to our understanding of the mechanistic details of this process (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 471-510Google Scholar). Several factors involved in the early steps of DNA replication are AAA+ proteins, a large superfamily of ATPases that are associated with various cellular activities (2Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors contain a nucleotide-binding domain of the Rossmann fold family and can bind (and, in some instances, hydrolyze) ATP. Several AAA+ proteins involved in DNA replication are able to adopt two conformational states (ATP- or ADP-bound form) with different functions, and the switching from one conformation to the other is promoted by ATP hydrolysis (3Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Davey M.J. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 1-10Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli the first step of DNA replication is the binding of the initiator protein, DnaA, to the origin of chromosomal replication, oriC (5Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). DnaA is a member of the AAA+ family and utilizes ATP hydrolysis to promote DNA unwinding at the origin (6Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 7Gille H. Messer W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The melting activity of DnaA is tightly regulated by its nucleotide-bound state: DnaA-ATP is able to perform this function, whereas DnaA-ADP does not (6Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 52: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). After DnaA has bound oriC and unwound an A+T-rich region, the replicative helicase, DnaB, is loaded onto the ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAMCMmini-chromosome maintenanceBSAbovine serum albuminTBETris-Borate-EDTAORFopen reading framePaeP. aerophilumAaeA. aeolicusSsoS. solfataricusMthM. thermoautotrophicumEstA. acidocaldarius esterase. bubble in an ATP-dependent process that requires an additional AAA+ protein, DnaC (6Bramhill D.

This latter behaves as a monomer in solution and forms hexamers upon association with the hexameric DnaB (9Wickner S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, in the eukaryotic organisms AAA+ proteins play critical roles in DNA replication initiation (12Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). These include three (Orc1, Orc4, and Orc5) out of the six subunits of the origin recognition complex (13Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), the Cdc6 factor (Cdc18 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (14Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B.

Cell. 1993; 74: 371-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar)), and the hetero-hexameric MCM complex (16Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 17Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). On the basis of genetic studies carried out mainly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it was postulated that at the onset of mitosis Cdc6 recruits and loads MCM onto DNA at the replication origins in an ATP-dependent process (19Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L. Diffley J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdc6 might function as a DNA helicase-loader, likewise the E. coli DnaC factor. Nevertheless, the biochemical properties of the eukaryotic Cdc6 are largely unknown, and there is no direct biochemical evidence of its physical and/or functional interaction with the MCM DNA helicase. The replication systems of Archaea are thought to function analogously to those of eukaryotes (20Tye B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2399-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sequenced archaeal genomes contain ORFs coding for putative homologs of several eukaryotic replication proteins, including the initiation factors Cdc6 and MCM, but no homologs of the origin recognition complex subunits are evident. However, archaeal Cdc6 proteins share some sequence similarity with certain regions of the eukaryotic Orc1 subunit (21Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Giraldo R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 26: 533-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystallographic structure of the Cdc6 protein from the crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum (PaeCdc6) revealed that it is composed of an N-terminal AAA+ nucleotide-binding module linked to a C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain that is believed to be responsible for DNA-binding activity (23Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A similar modular organization was also observed in the three-dimensional structure of the DnaA protein from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (AaeDnaA (24Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)). Based on these structural similarities, it was hypothesized that the archaeal Cdc6 factors may have a dual function as the replication initiator (by specifically binding the chromosomal replication origin) and as the DNA helicase-loader (by recruiting the MCM complex at the origin (25Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). However, despite this knowledge, the biochemical properties of the archaeal Cdc6 factors have been poorly investigated so far. Therefore, we have undertaken the biochemical analysis of three putative Cdc6-like factors from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (26She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B.A. De Moors A. Erauso G. Fletcher C. Gordon P.M. Heikamp-de Jong I. Jeffries A.C. Kozera C.J. Medina N. Peng X. Thi-Ngoc H.P. Redder P. Schenk M.E. Theriault C. Tolstrup N. Charlebois R.L. Doolittle W.F. Duguet M. Gaasterland T. Garrett R.A. Ragan M.A. Sensen C.W. Van der Oost J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Herein we report the biochemical characterization of one of these proteins, named by us SsoCdc6-1. The recombinant SsoCdc6-1 is a monomer in solution, is able to autophosphorylate in vitro, has a weak ATPase activity, and binds either ssDNA or dsDNA. We found that SsoCdc6-1 strongly inhibits the ATPase and DNA helicase activity of the S. solfataricus MCM-like protein (SsoMCM (27Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). Materials—All chemicals were of reagent grade. Restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo (Paris, France). The homogeneous thermostable esterase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius (Est (28Manco G. Mandrich L. Rossi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37482-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) was a gift of Dr. G. Manco. Cloning of SsoCdc6-1—The SsoCdc6-1 gene was amplified from S. solfataricus genomic DNA by PCR using the High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with oligonucleotide Cdc6-1-for (5′-TTGGGAATTCTCATCTGTATTGATAATTAAACATAAGGAC-3′) as the 5′ primer (the engineered EcoRI site is underlined) and oligonucleotide Cdc6-1-rev (5′-TTGGCTGCAGTTAAGCTCTCGATTTTAACCTCACCATTAT-3′) as the 3′ primer (the engineered PstI site is underlined). The PCR product was cloned into EcoRI/PstI-linearized E. coli expression vector pProEX-Hta (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The SsoCdc6-1 gene was mutated at lysine 59 to alanine by PCR-based mutagenesis (29Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using the following synthetic oligonucleotides: Cdc6-1-for, Cdc6-1Xba-rev (5′-TATTTCTTCTATCTAGATATTCATGGATCATTT-3′; the XbaI site is underlined), Cdc6-1KA-for (5′-GGTAGGACAGGTACTGGGGCAACAGCTACTGTTAGATTGTTTGGT-3′) and Cdc6-1KA-rev (5′-ACCAAACAATCTAACAGTAGCTGTTGCCCCAGTACCTGTCCTACC-3′). The final PCR product was subcloned back into the plasmid pProEX-Hta-SsoCdc6-1 at the unique EcoRI and XbaI sites. The presence of the desired mutation was checked by sequencing the amplified DNA fragment. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Novagen) transformed with the plasmid pProEX-Hta-SsoCdc6-1 were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.7 optical density, protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.2 mm. The bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Then cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at –20 °C until use. The pellet was thawed and resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol, 2 mm imidazole) supplemented with some protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were broken by two consecutive passages through a French pressure cell apparatus (Aminco Co., Silver Spring, MD) at 1500 p.s.i. The resulting lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm (Sorvall rotor 50.2 Ti) at 10 °C. The supernatant was subjected to heat treatment at 70 °C for 5 min, then incubated in ice for 10 min. The thermoprecipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 rpm (Sorvall rotor 70.2 Ti) at 10 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) and loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow-agarose column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After a washing step with buffer A, the elution was carried out with 60 ml of an imidazole step gradient (50–500 mm) in buffer A. 1.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect the SsoCdc6-1 polypeptide. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and centrifuged for 10 min at 30,000 rpm (Sorvall rotor 70.2 Ti) to remove some precipitated material that appeared shortly after elution from the column. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against buffer A. The dialyzed sample was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. The final yield of the recombinant protein after this purification procedure was of about 20 mg. The KA mutant SsoCdc6-1 was purified using the above protocol. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Samples of the purified wild type and KA mutant SsoCdc6-1 (50 μgin100 μl) were subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). The chromatographic run was carried out at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at room temperature. The column was calibrated by running a set of gel filtration markers that included: tyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), BSA (69 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Samples of the purified wild type and KA mutant SsoCdc6-1 (35 μg in 100 μl) were applied to a 4.6-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP. After centrifugation at 43,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW 55 Ti rotor at 10 °C, fractions (185 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The proteins distribution was detected after SDS-10% PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). A mixture of protein markers (tyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; BSA, 69 kDa) was applied to a parallel gradient. Quantitative Western Blot Analysis—S. solfataricus (strain P2) cells were grown aerobically at 80 °C, pH 3.5, in 100 ml of Brock's basal salt medium (30Brock T.D. Brock K.M. Belly R.T. Weiss R.L. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1972; 84: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) supplemented with glucose (2 g/liter). Growth was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm, and, when the absorbance reached a value of O.7 OD, 10-ml aliquots of the culture were withdrawn and centrifuged. Each pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% SDS, 0.01% Blue Bromphenol). Aliquots of the extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE together with samples of the purified SsoCdc6-1. Then the gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blot analyses were carried out with rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against the SsoCdc6-1, as previously described (27Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody interactions were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL+ kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was analyzed using a Chemi Doc 2000 System with the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For calculating the number of SsoCdc6-1 molecules, it was assumed that 1.1 × 109 cells/ml were present in a culture of Sulfolobus when the absorbance was 600 nm at 1 optical density. DNA Band-shift Assays—A 51-mer oligonucleotide (51nt-4U; 5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCGAGGCGCGCGAAGACCG-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified using Quantum Prep PCR Kleen Spin columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and used in ssDNA band-shift assays. To prepare dsDNA molecules a 51-mer oligonucleotide complementary to 51nt-4U (51nt-4Urev; 5′-CGGTCTTCGCGCGCCTCGCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTGGG-3′) was mixed with equal molar amounts of 51nt-4U; the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then slowly cooled at room temperature. These molecules were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, purified as above described, and then used in dsDNA band-shift assays. For the ssDNA and dsDNA band-shift assays, 10-μl mixtures were prepared that contained 200 fmol of 32P-labeled ssDNA or dsDNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the indicated amounts of SsoCdc6-1 (or the thermostable esterase used in the control reactions). These samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide/bis (29:1) gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at a constant voltage of 100 V. The gel was then dried, and the radioactive bands were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). ATPase Assay—The standard ATPase assay reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.5–1 μCi). Incubations were performed for 30 min at 60 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped in ice. A 1-μl aliquot of each mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Merck) and run in 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The amounts of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolyzed to [32P]orthophosphate were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined in the linear range of reaction time and protein concentration dependence. The amount of spontaneously hydrolyzed ATP was determined using blank reactions without enzyme and subtracted from the reaction rate values calculated as above. In Vitro Autophosphorylation of SsoCdc6-1—Samples of the purified wild type and KA mutant SsoCdc6-1 (1 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 70 °C in a reaction mixture (volume: 20 μl) containing 1.66 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg of M13 ssDNA or dsDNA (Amersham Biotech). The proteins were then separated on SDS-10% PAGE, and 32P-labeled bands were detected using a PhosphorImager. DNA Helicase Activity Assay—A 85-mer oligonucleotide was used for the preparation of the DNA helicase substrate. This oligonucleotide (5′-TTGAACCACCCCCTTGTTAAATCACTTCTACTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG) was complementary to the M13mp18(+) strand except for a 30-nt 5′-tail (the tail is underlined). The oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified as previously described for the 51nt-4U oligonucleotide. To prepare partial duplexes, mixtures containing equal molar amounts of the labeled oligonucleotide and M13mp18(+) strand were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then slowly cooled at room temperature. Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 fmol of 32P-labeled substrate (about 1 × 103 cpm/fmol) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 70 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped by addition of 5 μlof5× stop solution (0.5% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), then run on a 8% polyacrylamide gel in TBE containing 0.1% SDS at a constant voltage of 150 V. After the electrophoresis the gel was soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by means of a PhosphorImager. The reaction products were quantitated, and any free oligonucleotide in the absence of enzyme was subtracted. Gel Filtration Analysis of SsoCdc6-1/SsoMCM Interaction—The physical interaction of SsoCdc6-1 with SsoMCM was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. A mixture of SsoCdc6-1 (45 μg) and SsoMCM (90 μg) was gel-filtered on a Superose 6 column equilibrated with buffer B (see above). 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and the presence of each protein was examined by Western blot analysis of 20-μl aliquots of the indicated fractions, as previously described (27Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Identification and Purification of SsoCdc6-1—The analysis of the S. solfataricus genomic sequence revealed the presence of three ORFs coding for putative homologs of the eukaryotic Cdc6 proteins (26She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B.A. De Moors A. Erauso G. Fletcher C. Gordon P.M. Heikamp-de Jong I. Jeffries A.C. Kozera C.J. Medina N. Peng X. Thi-Ngoc H.P. Redder P. Schenk M.E. Theriault C. Tolstrup N. Charlebois R.L. Doolittle W.F. Duguet M. Gaasterland T. Garrett R.A. Ragan M.A. Sensen C.W. Van der Oost J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). They were named by us SsoCdc6-1 (ORF #SSO0771), SsoCdc6-2 (ORF #SSO2184), and SsoCdc6-3 (ORF #SSO0257). In pairwise global sequence alignments the SsoCdc6 proteins were found to share about 35% similarity with the S. cerevisiae Cdc6 factor and to be similar to the eukaryotic Orc1 subunit showing about 20% similarity with the S. cerevisiae Orc1. 2M. De Felice, M. Rossi, and F. M. Pisani, unpublished observations. In Fig. 1 an alignment of the SsoCdc6-1 and the PaeCdc6 protein is reported. The motifs typically found in the AAA+ proteins are present in the Sulfolobus Cdc6-1 sequence, including the Walker A and B and Sensor 1 and 2 boxes (2Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V.

It should be noted that SsoCdc6-1 (and other archaeal Cdc6-like factors) lack the N-terminal extension of about 50 amino acid residues that is found in the eukaryotic counterparts. It was demonstrated that in the S. cerevisiae Cdc6 this portion of the polypeptide chain is responsible for binding to dsDNA (31Feng L. Wang B. Driscoll B. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1673-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). SsoCdc6-1 was overproduced in E. coli as a soluble hexahistidine-tagged protein and was purified using a procedure that included a thermal treatment of the cell extracts and a chromatographic step on a Ni+-chelate column, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Fig. 2A). N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified SsoCdc6-1 confirmed the identity of the recombinant polypeptide. 2M. De Felice, M. Rossi, and F. M. Pisani, unpublished observations. To assess the oligomeric state of SsoCdc6-1, we carried out gel filtration experiments using three columns: Superose 6 (Fig. 2, B and C, see “Experimental Procedures”), Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) and Protein Pak 300 SW Glass (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 2M. De Felice, M. Rossi, and F. M. Pisani, unpublished observations. A molecular mass of 45 kDa was calculated for the purified recombinant protein using all these different chromatographic supports. Samples of homogeneous SsoCdc6-1 were also subjected to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the results obtained were consistent with the gel filtration data. Therefore, we concluded that SsoCdc6-1 is a monomer in solution. We also found that the oligomeric state of SsoCdc6-1 was not affected by addition of ATP (at 100 μm) in the buffered solutions used to prepare the glycerol gradients for the ultracentrifugation experiments. 2M. De Felice, M. Rossi, and F. M. Pisani, unpublished observations. Level of Expression of SsoCdc6-1 in S. solfataricus Cells— The presence of multiple ORFs encoding putative homologs of the initiation factor Cdc6 in the S. solfataricus genome raised the question of whether all these genes are truly expressed and the corresponding proteins play a physiological role in vivo. Our Western blot experiments indicate that the SsoCdc6-1 protein is indeed present in the Sulfolobus cells (see Fig. 3). We estimated that about 2000–4000 molecules/cell of SsoCdc6-1 are present when the total cell extracts were prepared from S. solfataricus cultures taken at A600 nm = 0.7. Binding of SsoCdc6-1 to ssDNA or dsDNA—To determine whether the purified SsoCdc6-1 could bind ssDNA and/or dsDNA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out using as the probe a γ-32P-labeled 51-mer synthetic oligonucleotide in single- and double-stranded form, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4, SsoCdc6-1 was able to bind either ssDNA or dsDNA. The DNA-binding capability is a specific property of SsoCdc6-1, because we did not observe DNA band-shift activity by a thermostable nonspecific recombinant protein (the esterase 2 from A. acidocaldarius (28Manco G. Mandrich L. Rossi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37482-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)) in the same experimental conditions (see Fig. 4C). ATPase Activity of SsoCdc6-1—As shown in Fig. 1, the SsoCdc6-1 primary structure contains the Walker A and Walker B motifs that are typically found in proteins endowed with ATPase activity (2Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the wild type and KA mutant SsoCdc6-1, in which the lysine residue 59 of the Walker A motif was replaced by alanine. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 60 °C and not at the optimal growth temperature for S. solfataricus (87 °C) to limit the thermally induced auto hydrolysis of ATP. Release of [γ-32P]orthophosphate was measured by thin layer chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5, SsoCdc6-1 displays a low level of ATPase activity: am amount, 80 pmol of purified recombinant protein (in a 20-μl reaction volume), was able to hydrolyze about 160 pmol of ATP in 30 min at 60 °C. On the other hand, the KA mutant was found to be completely devoid of ATPase activity. Furthermore, no significant stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by SsoCdc6-1 was observed upon addition of various kinds of ssDNA or dsDNA molecules to the assay reaction mixtures.2 Autophosphorylation of SsoCdc6-1—It was reported that the two Cdc6 proteins from the euryarchaeon Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Mth) are able to autophosphorylate in vitro. Because the MthCdc6 factors did not show any appreciable ATPase activity, this finding was taken as an indication that these proteins are able to bind ATP (32Gabrowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the autophosphorylation reaction of the MthCdc6 proteins was shown to be completely inhibited in the presence of ssDNA or dsDNA. We found that even SsoCdc6-1 is able to autophosphorylate when incubated with [γ-32P]ATP at 70 °C (Fig. 6). This ability requires an integral Walker A motif, because the KA mutant SsoCdc6-1 did not undergo autophosphorylation (see Fig. 6). However, in contrast with what was reported for the MthCdc6 factors (32Gabrowski B. Kelman Z. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5459-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), SsoCdc6-1 a"

R., and Lee, Y. C. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 23221–23229). We now report that Galα1–4Gal-bearing glycoproteins are also present in pigeon serum, lymphocytes, and liver, as probed by Western blot with Griffonia simplicifolia-I lectin (specific for terminal α-Gal) and anti-P1 (specific for Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–) monoclonal antibody. One of the major glycoproteins from pigeon plasma was identified as IgG (also known as IgY), which has Galα1–4Gal in its heavy chains. High pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometric (MS), and MS/MS analyses revealed that N-glycans of pigeon serum IgG included (i) high mannose-type (33.3%), (ii) disialylated biantennary complex-type (19.2%), and (iii) α-galactosylated complex-type N-glycans (47.5%). Bi- and tri-antennary oligosaccharides with bisecting GlcNAc and α1–6 Fuc on the Asn-linked GlcNAc were abundant among N-glycans possessing terminal Galα1–4Gal sequences. Moreover, MS/MS analysis identified Galα1–4Galβ1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAc branch terminals, which are not found in pigeon egg white glycoproteins. An additional interesting aspect is that about two-thirds of high mannose-type N-glycans from pigeon IgG were monoglucosylated. Comparison of the N-glycan structures with chicken and quail IgG indicated that the presence of high mannose-type oligosaccharides may be a characteristic of these avian IgG.

All four major PEW glycoproteins, ovotransferrin, two ovalbumins, and ovomucoid, contain Galα1–4Gal (1Suzuki N. Khoo K.H. Chen H.C. Johnson J.R. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (references therein): 23221-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and all of their constituent N-glycans were found to possess Galα1–4Gal at the non-reducing termini of tri-, tetra-, and penta-antennary structures (2Takahashi N.

No sialylation is found on the branch that contains the Galα1–4Gal sequence. Because biosynthesis and glycosyl modification of major egg white glycoproteins of chicken are carried out in tubular gland cells of oviduct (3Burley R.W. Vadehra D.V. The Avian Egg: Chemistry and Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1989: 129-145Google Scholar), the most likely site of fabricating Galα1–4Gal linkages on the PEW glycoproteins would be in the corresponding cells of pigeon oviduct. pigeon egg white bovine serum albumin Coomassie Brilliant Blue collision-induced dissociation glycoamidase F galactosyltransferase glucose unit hexose N-acetylhexosamine N-acetyllactosamine matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization monoclonal antibody mass spectrometry nanoelectrospray octadecylsilica 2-aminopyridine pigeon fanciers' lung time-of-flight polyvinylidene difluoride high pressure liquid chromatography. pigeon egg white bovine serum albumin Coomassie Brilliant Blue collision-induced dissociation glycoamidase F galactosyltransferase glucose unit hexose N-acetylhexosamine N-acetyllactosamine matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization monoclonal antibody mass spectrometry nanoelectrospray octadecylsilica 2-aminopyridine pigeon fanciers' lung time-of-flight polyvinylidene difluoride high pressure liquid chromatography.

An exception in mammals is the case of glycoproteins with Galα1–4Gal in hydatid cyst fluid and membrane infected by tapeworm Echnococcus granulosus (9Khoo K.H. Nieto A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Mol.

The presence of Galα1–4Gal or substances similar to P1 antigen on glycoproteins is limited even among other birds that have been studied. For example, P1 antigenic activities is absent in the blood of chicken, gander, turkey, quail, duck, and pheasant (16Brocteur J. François-Gérard C. André A. Radermecker M. Bruwier M. Salmon J.

Salivary gland mucin glycoproteins of Chinese swiftlets (genus Collocalia) contain O-linked glycans with Galα1–4Gal sequence (25Wieruszeski J.M. Michalski J.C. Montreuil J. Strecker G.

The biological significance of Galα1–4Gal in pigeon and some other avian glycoproteins is still unknown. Whether Galα1–4Gal is located specifically on PEW glycoproteins or glycoproteins of other pigeon organs is still unsettled. François-Gérard and co-workers (16Brocteur J. François-Gérard C. André A. Radermecker M. Bruwier M. Salmon J. Haematologia. 1975; 9: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar, 17François-Gérard C. Brocteur J. André A. Vox Sang. 1980; 39: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of P1 antigenic activity in pigeon blood. However, they did not indicate whether the antigenicity was located on glycolipids or glycoproteins and whether the P1 antigens were produced by pigeon themselves or derived from foreign bodies. To understand further the characteristics of species-specific oligosaccharides, we investigated the presence of glycoproteins with Galα1–4Gal in pigeon serum, lymphocyte, and liver. Here we report that one of the major glycoproteins containing Galα1–4Gal in serum is pigeon IgG, which possesses complex-type N-glycans containing Galα1–4Gal as well as high mannose-type oligosaccharides. The high mannose-type N-glycans are exclusively found on the CH3 domain, and the site specificity is probably a characteristic in avian IgGs. Unlike IgGs in other animals, the complex-type glycans were mainly tri- as well as bi-antennary structures. Moreover, N-glycans containing both Galα1–4Galβ1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galα1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAc branches were detected by MS/MS analysis, which were not found in PEW glycoproteins. Materials—Adult (female) pigeons were from a local racing pigeon breeder in Virginia. Pigeon livers were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI). Human serum, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, tributylphosphine, and 4-vinylpyridine were purchased from Sigma. Glycoamidase F 2Also known as PNGase F, glycopeptide N-glycosidase F, or N-glycanase. One unit of GAF activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the release of N-linked oligosaccharides from 1 nmol of denatured ribonuclease B in 1 min at 37 °C, pH 7.5.

Ficoll-Paque™ Plus was from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (10×) was purchased from Invitrogen. Chicken IgG and sera from chicken and bovine were from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). BCA™ Protein Assay reagents were from Pierce. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes for blotting, ultrafiltration membrane (YM-10), and Centricon YM-10 were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Superdex 200 columns for gel filtration (HR 10/30, 1.0 × 30 cm and HiLoad 26/60, 2.6 × 60 cm) and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (HiTrap, 1 ml) were from Amersham Biosciences.

Carbograph tubes (25 mg) were from Alltech Associates. Buffers and Standard Procedures—Tris-buffered saline contains 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl. TBST contains 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Guanidine·HCl (8 m) was made in 0.2 m Tris·HCl (pH 8.0). Procedures for SDS-PAGE, Griffonia simplicifolia-I lectin blotting, and N-terminal sequence analyses have been described previously (1Suzuki N. Khoo K.H. Chen H.C. Johnson J.R. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (references therein): 23221-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sequence identity search was performed using NCBI data bases. Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA assay (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Preparation of Extracts from Pigeon Tissues and Cells—Blood (∼5 ml/pigeon) drawn from six pigeons were collected in blood collection tubes (13 × 75 mm) containing 0.057 ml of 15% K3EDTA solution (BD Biosciences). The lymphocytes were isolated with Ficoll-Paque™ Plus and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline twice. Pellets of lymphocytes and recovered plasma were stored at–20 °C until use. The lymphocytes and a portion of pigeon liver were homogenized in 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The supernatants separated by centrifugation were used as extracts. Isolation of Major Glycoproteins from Pigeon Plasma—Diluted pigeon plasma (∼6.2 mg of protein/ml) was centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. Supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and injected onto a Superdex 200 column (maximum 0.2 ml for an HR 10/30 column, and 1 ml for a HiLoad 26/60 column) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. The flow rates were 0.25 ml/min for the HR 10/30 column and 2 ml/min for the HiLoad 26/60 column. Proteins in the eluate were monitored by A280nm, and individual peaks were collected manually. GS-I-positive fractions were concentrated with ultrafiltration (YM-10 membrane) and desalted by washing with 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) for further purification by ion exchange chromatography. A column of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (HiTrap, 1 ml) was washed with 1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and equilibrated with 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0). After the sample injection, the column was washed with 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) for 30 min (flow rate, 1 ml/min), and then the concentration of NaCl in the elution was linearly increased up to 0.4 m within 80 min (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min). The major peak was collected and concentrated with a Centricon YM-10. GAF Treatment of Glycoproteins—Glycoprotein samples (10 μg each) in 20 μl of 0.4% SDS and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), were heat-denatured at 90 °C for 3 min. After the solutions were cooled to room temperature, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 unit of GAF were added to the solution of glycoproteins. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h to complete de-N-glycosylation and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min to inactivate GAF. Preparation of Glycopeptides for Peptide Sequencing—To reduce the existing disulfide bonds and to block random reformations of intramolecular disulfide bonds, 16 μmol of tributylphosphine and 0.16 mmol of 4-vinylpyridine were added to 1 mg of pigeon IgG in 0.1 m Tris·HCl (pH 8.5) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against water and lyophilized. One-third of the reduced and alkylated pigeon IgG was suspended with 40 μlof50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.4) and incubated with 12.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade) at 37 °C, overnight. A portion of the supernatant was further treated with GAF (0.5 units/10 μl) at 37 °C, overnight. The peptide mixtures, before and after the GAF treatment, were analyzed with reversed phase-HPLC on a Shim-pack CLC-ODS column. The mobile phases were solute A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and solute B, 90% CH3CN in the 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution (1 ml/min) was conducted by a linear gradient of 0–50% of solute B in solute A developed over 100 min. Each peak monitored by A210nm was collected and kept at 4 °C. A portion of the isolated glycopeptides was treated with GAF, and the released oligosaccharides and the deglycosylated peptide were separated with HPLC. Preparation of Oligosaccharides for Structural Analyses—Pigeon IgG (1 mg) was reduced with 180 μl of 60 mm dithiothreitol in 8 m guanidine·HCl at room temperature for 1 h. For alkylation of thiols, 240 μl of 0.18 m iodoacetamide in 8 m guanidine·HCl was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against water and lyophilized. The alkylated pigeon IgG was suspended with 200 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.4), digested with 10 μg of trypsin at 37 °C for 4 h, and followed by addition of 10 μg of chymotrypsin (37 °C overnight). After inactivating the enzymes at 100 °C for 10 min, the digest was lyophilized. Oligosaccharides were released with GAF treatment in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) at 37 °C overnight. After inactivating GAF at 100 °C for 5 min, the digest was lyophilized. To remove inorganic cations and peptides, the mixture was loaded onto 1 ml of Dowex 50W × 2 (H+ form, 50–100 mesh, Sigma) packed in a 1-ml syringe. The column was washed with 5 ml of water, and the collected effluent was lyophilized. The sample was dissolved with 200 μl of water, loaded onto a Carbograph tube (25 mg, Alltech), washed with 1 ml of water, and then eluted with 500 μl of 25% CH3CN containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Exo-glycosidase Digestion—The released N-glycan mixtures were digested sequentially with 50 milliunits of neuraminidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens (Roche Applied Science) in 25 μlof50mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.5 units of α-galactosidase (from green coffee bean, Calbiochem) in 100 μl of 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), followed by 5 milliunits of β1–4 galactosidase (from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Calbiochem) in 50 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0). All digestions were carried out at 37 °C for 24 h. Each enzyme digestion was desalted by passing through a mixed bed ion-exchange column packed with a mixture of 1 ml each of Dowex 50W-X8 (50–100 mesh, H+ form) and AG 3-X4 (100–200 mesh, free base form, Bio-Rad) resins, prior to taking an aliquot for permethylation and MS analysis. PA-glycans were desalted instead by passing through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), washed with water, and then eluted with 50% methanol in water. Chemical Derivatization and GC-MS Linkage Analysis—N-Glycan and PA-derivatized N-glycan samples were permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described by Dell et al. (27Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For GC-MS linkage analysis, partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated derivatives by hydrolysis (2 m trifluoroacetic acid, 121 °C, 2 h), reduction (10 mg/ml NaBH4, 25 °C, 2 h), and acetylation (acetic anhydride, 100 °C, 1 h). GC-MS was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph 6890 connected to a Hewlett-Packard 5973 Mass Selective Detector. Sample was dissolved in hexane prior to splitless injection into a HP-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter). The column head pressure was maintained at around 8.2 pounds/square inch to give a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min using helium as carrier gas. Initial oven temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min and increased to 90 °C in 1 min and then to 290 °C in 25 min. MS Analysis for Glycans and Glycomics—For MALDI-TOF MS glycan profiling, the permethylated derivatives in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile), spotted on the target plate, air-dried, and recrystallized on-plate with ethanol whenever necessary. Data acquisition was performed manually on a benchtop MALDI LR system (Micromass) operated in the reflectron mode. For 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix, the coarse laser energy control was set at high and finely adjusted using the % slider according to sample amount and spectra quality. Laser shots (5 Hz, 10 shots/spectrum) were accumulated until a satisfactory signal to noise ratio was achieved when combined and smoothed. Glycan mass profiling was also performed on a dedicated Q-TOF Ultima MALDI instrument (Micromass) in which case the permethylated samples in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 99:1, v/v) for spotting onto the target plate. The nitrogen UV laser (337 nm wavelength) was operated at a repetition rate of 10 Hz under full power (300 μJ/pulse). MS survey data were manually acquired, and the decision to switch over to CID MS/MS acquisition mode for a particular parent ion was made on-the-fly upon examination of the summed spectra. Argon was used as the collision gas with a collision energy manually adjusted (between 50 and 200 V) to achieve optimum degree of fragmentation for the parent ions under investigation. Off-line nanoelectrospray (nano-ESI) using the borosilicate metal-coated glass capillary option was performed on a Q-TOF Ultima API instrument (Micromass) equipped with a nanoflow source, mainly for CID MS/MS analysis of permethylated glycans samples. The capillary voltage was set at about 1.0–1.2 kV. Either protonated and/or sodiated doubly or triply charged parent ions may be selected for MS/MS. A collision energy setting of 20–40 eV was usually sufficient for doubly protonated species, but 60–80 eV was needed for singly and doubly sodiated parent ions. Permethylated samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.2% formic acid solvent and a 2-μl aliquot was typically loaded into the capillary for nano-ESI analysis. Preparation and Isolation of PA-derivatized Oligosaccharides—Lyophilized free oligosaccharide fractions (from 2 mg of pigeon IgG) were dissolved in 40 μl of 2-aminopyridine solution (1 g of 2-aminopyridine in 580 μl of concentrated HCl (pH 6.8)) and heated at 90 °C for 15 min with heating block. Freshly prepared NaCNBH3 solution (7 mg/4 μl water) was added into the reaction mixture and then heated at 90 °C for 1 h. PA-oligosaccharides were fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column (1.0 × 40 cm, in 10 mm NH4HCO3), monitored by a fluorescence (excitation, 300 nm; emission, 360 nm), and lyophilized. The mixture of PA-oligosaccharides was first separated by HPLC with a TSK gel DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm) as described previously (28Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the separated neutral, mono-sialyl, and di-sialyl fractions (monitored by fluorescence, Ex, 320 nm; Em, 400 nm) were collected separately and lyophilized. These fractions were individually dissolved in water and separated on a Shim-Pack CLC-ODS column (6.0 × 150 mm) as described previously (1Suzuki N. Khoo K.H. Chen H.C. Johnson J.R. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (references therein): 23221-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 55 °C using eluent A (0.005% trifluoroacetic acid) and eluent B (0.5% 1-butanol in eluent A). The column was equilibrated with a mixture of eluents A/B = 90:10 (v/v), and after injection of a sample, the composition of the eluents was changed linearly to A/B = 30:70 in 120 min. Each peak was collected, lyophilized, and analyzed with MALDI-TOF-MS. For determination of N-glycan structures by two-dimensional mapping with HPLC, the isolated PA-oligosaccharides were analyzed using CLC-ODS and TSK gel amide-80 columns (4.6 × 250 mm) as described previously (29Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Elution position of each of PA-oligosaccharides on CLC-ODS and amide-80 columns was expressed as glucose units (GU), based on the elution position of isomalto-oligosaccharide series. Reference PA-oligosaccharides from asialo-human IgG, bovine RNase B, and chicken serum IgG were prepared by the same method. Structures of the reference compounds are shown in Fig. 9. PA-derivatized N-glycans B-1, C-1, and D (Fig. 9) were obtained from α-fucosidase and N-acetyl-β-d-hexosaminidase-digested PA-oligosaccharides from human IgG. N-Glycans B-2 and C-2 were prepared from B-1 and C-1, respectively, with β-galactosidase digestion. Approximately equal amounts of proteins from pigeon serum, liver, lymphocytes, and egg white were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (Fig. 1A, CBB staining) or probed by blotting with GS-I lectin to detect terminal α-Gal residues. As shown in Fig. 1A (GS-I staining), some proteins from pigeon serum, liver, and lymphocytes were visualized by this staining as were glycoproteins of PEW. Intensities of the GS-I staining did not coincide with those of the CBB staining, suggesting that proteins carry α-Gal residues with varied density. Immunoblotting with anti-P1 mAb (specific for P1 blood type) (Fig. 1A) gave similar staining patterns as shown by the GS-I lectin blotting. Extract from pigeon heart also stained with GS-I and anti-P1 mAb (data not shown). These data indicate that many kinds of glycoproteins in pigeon organs most likely contain terminal Galα1–4Gal as found in PEW (1Suzuki N. Khoo K.H. Chen H.C. Johnson J.R. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (references therein): 23221-23229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The presence of α-Gal residues on proteins was probed in pigeon, chicken, bovine, and human sera. Although approximately the same amounts of respective proteins in these sera were stained with CBB, only pigeon serum proteins stained strongly by GS-I (Fig. 1B). Because twice as much proteins was used in this experiment (Fig. 1B) as the previous experiment (Fig. 1A), more bands were clearly visualized by the GS-I staining. Bovine is known to produce Galα1–3Gal (30Dorland L. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 31Galili U.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3959-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but its serum was stained with GS-I only faintly. Serum proteins of chicken and human, not known to produce Galα1–3Gal or other α-Gal epitopes, was not stained by GS-I, confirming that these serum proteins have no terminal α-galactosyl residues. Pigeon plasma proteins (600 μg total) were separated by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30, as shown in Fig. 2A. As molecular size markers, chicken IgG (170 kDa) and BSA (67 kDa) were eluted in separate runs, and their positions were marked. Each of the peaks obtained from the Superdex 200 was collected, and 50 μl of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and GS-I lectin blotting under the reducing conditions (Fig. 2, B and C). Proteins in fractions 2–8 were positively stained by GS-I, whereas other fractions (fractions 1 and 9–16) were negative to GS-I. The fraction 13 was the largest peak detected by A280nm, but no protein/peptide bands were visualized with CBB or GS-I staining. One of the glycoproteins in the fraction 6, which was eluted at the same elution position as chicken IgG, showed the strongest intensity by the GS-I staining. In contrast, major proteins in fraction 8, where BSA is expected to elute, were stained with CBB strongly but not at all with GS-I. The similar elution profile was detected when 6 mg of pigeon plasma proteins was separated using a semi-preparative Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 60 cm) (data n"

This results in changes in the expression of a subset of nuclear genes leading to major reconfigurations of metabolism that enable cells to adapt to the respiratory deficient state. Previous studies have focused on the role of three positive regulatory factors in the retrograde pathway, Rtg1p, Rtg2p, and Rtg3p, which are essential for both basal and elevated expressions of some, but not all, retrograde responsive genes. Here we characterize the retrograde regulation of one of those genes, ATO3, whose elevated expression in ρo petites is largely independent of RTG gene function. ATO3 encodes a member of the YaaH family of proteins that is a putative outward ammonium transporter. We show that Ato3p-green fluorescent protein is preferentially localized to the plasma membrane of mother cells. ρo petites express more Ato3p-green fluorescent protein in their plasma membrane than do ρ+ cells, consistent with the elevated level of ATO3 transcripts in ρo cells. We find that ATO3 expression has two levels of control, both of which are connected to amino acid sensing and regulation. The first involves GCN4, which is required for the bulk of ATO3 expression. The second involves the Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 amino acid sensor system, which is preferentially required for elevated ATO3 expression in ρo cells. We propose that ATO3 is induced in ρo cells to eliminate the excess ammonia that arises because of a potential defect in ammonia assimilation in those cells.

We propose that ATO3 is induced in ρo cells to eliminate the excess ammonia that arises because of a potential defect in ammonia assimilation in those cells. Cells reconfigure their pattern of gene expression to adjust to changes in nutrient availability or in response to stress. In cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, dramatic changes in gene expression occur during the diauxic shift (1DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar), which is the switch from the utilization of glucose as carbon source to the utilization of ethanol, produced from glycolysis. Yeast cells also modulate the expression of genes in response to mitochondrial dysfunctions (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 3Parikh V.S. Morgan M.M. Scott R. Clements L.S. Butow R.A.

This inter-organelle signaling pathway, called retrograde regulation, can be thought of as a stress response whose function is to accommodate various cellular activities to the changes in the mitochondrial state. The expression of genes such as CIT2, DLD3, and PDH1 is dramatically up-regulated in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 4Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 5Chelstowska A. Liu Z. Jia Y. Amberg D. Butow R.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1377-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), for instance, in ρo petites, which are respiratory deficient cells that lack mitochondrial DNA. Regulation of both basal and elevated expression of these genes in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria is largely dependent on the RTG genes, RTG1-3. RTG1 and RTG3 encode basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/Zip) transcription factors, Rtg1p and Rtg3p, that bind as a heterodimer to R box sites (GTCAC) in the promoter of genes such as CIT2 (6Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Rtg2p, a novel cytoplasmic protein with an N-terminal ATP binding domain, transduces mitochondrial signals to regulate the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of Rtg1p and Rtg3p in response to the functional state of mitochondria (7Sekito T. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2103-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). That nuclear translocation step is blocked by Mks1p, a negative regulator of RTG-dependent gene expression (8Sekito T. Liu Z. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Dilova I. Chen C.-Y. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rtg2p acts to positively regulate the RTG pathway by sequestering Mks1p in an inactive form (11Liu Z. Sekito T. Spirek M. Thornton J. Butow R.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In cells with compromised or dysfunctional mitochondria, the expression of CIT1, ACO1, IDH, and IDH2, which encode enzymes catalyzing the first three steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that produce α-ketoglutarate, the precursor to glutamate, is also under the control of the RTG genes (12Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, in rtg mutant cells with compromised or dysfunctional mitochondria, not only is there a loss in expression of genes such as CIT2, but those cells are also glutamate auxotrophs (4Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 12Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, glutamate is a potent repressor of RTG-dependent gene expression (12Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), underscoring the important role that the RTG pathway plays in glutamate homeostasis. The RTG regulatory circuit has also been shown to be activated in cells in which the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway is inhibited by treating cells with the immunosuppressant rapamycin (13Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), a finding that suggests that the retrograde pathway integrates carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. In a previous study (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) aimed at identifying genes whose expression is altered as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction, we identified >40 genes in the yeast transcriptome whose expression was consistently elevated by at least 2-fold in ρo versus ρ+ isochromosomal cultures grown on the fermentable but non-repressing carbon source, raffinose. In that study, we also determined the effects of inactivation of the RTG genes. These experiments revealed a subset of genes whose elevated expression in ρo petites appeared to be independent of the RTG genes, suggesting the existence of other retrograde signaling pathways activated by mitochondrial dysfunctions. Here we characterize a retrograde responsive gene, ATO3 (YDR384c), whose elevated expression in ρo petite cells is largely independent of the RTG genes. ATO3 encodes a member of the YaaH family of proteins with six transmembrane domains that has been proposed to be an outward ammonium transporter (14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). ATO3 expression is dependent on Gcn4p, a transcriptional activator of the general amino acid control pathway (15Hinnebusch A.G. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar), and its retrograde response is largely dependent on the Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 (SPS) 1The abbreviations used are: SPS, Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: SPS, Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5; GFP, green fluorescent protein. amino acid sensing pathway. We propose that respiratory deficient cells have a stoichiometric imbalance between α-ketoglutarate and ammonium, so that the elevated expression of ATO3 in those cells is intended to overcome the potential toxic effects of excess ammonium. Strains and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were derivatives of PSY142 (MATα leu2 lys2 ura3), S288c (MATa ura3-52), and PLY126 (MATa ura3-52 lys2Δ201). ρo strains were obtained by growth of ρ+ cells on rich dextrose medium containing 25 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Each ρo derivative was stained with 4′-6′-diamino-2-phenylindole to verify that no mitochondrial DNA were present. Deletion of GCN4 was performed by PCR amplification of the KanMX4 deletion module from the commercially available Research Genetics strain (Invitrogen). The genomic DNA used for PCR amplification was isolated from kanamycin-resistant spores obtained after sporulation of gcn4::KanMX4/GCN4 cells. The PCR product was then used to replace the GCN4 wild-type gene in ρ+ and ρo isolates of strain PSY142, and the replacement was confirmed by PCR analysis. Cells were grown at 30 °C on the following media as indicated in the text under “Results” and in all of the figure legends: rich YP medium (1% yeast extract and 2% Bacto-peptone) containing 2% raffinose (YPR); YNB medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) containing 1% casamino acids and 2% raffinose (YNBRcas); or YNB medium with supplemented amino acids as required and 2% raffinose (YNBR) or 2% dextrose (YNBD). Plasmid Constructs—Standard techniques were used for the construction, amplification, and manipulation of plasmids. An ATO3-lacZ reporter gene was constructed by PCR amplification of a selected ATO3 promoter region, using as forward primer 5′-GTCA TCTAGA CCT GAA GAG AAC AAA CCA TA-3′ (-981 bp from the ATG) and, as a reverse primer, 5′-GTCA AAGCTT G AGA CGA TGT CAT TTT AAC CAG-3′ (12 bp). The primers contained, respectively, XbaI and HindIII restriction sites for cloning, which are indicated by the underlined sequences. After digestion, the promoter region was cloned into the centromeric plasmid, pWEJ, derived from pKM270 (5Chelstowska A. Liu Z. Jia Y. Amberg D. Butow R.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1377-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The fragments used for the promoter dissection were obtained by PCR amplification of the following DNA regions of the ATO3 promoter: fragment I (from -999 to -593 bp); fragment II (from -611 to -285 bp); and fragment III (from -353 to -36 bp). The three fragments were cloned into pWCJ100 containing the CYC1-TATA transcriptional start site (12Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The primers used to amplify each fragment were as follows: 5′-GTCA AAGCTT GCC TAC TGC ATT GTA ATA CC-3′ and 5′-GTCA CTCGAG CAT GCA AGA ATG CTA CTG-3′ for fragment I; 5′-GTCA AAGCTT CAG TAG CAT TCT TGC ATG-3′ and 5′-GTCA CTCGAG CGC TAT TGT AGT GCA GGT-3′ for fragment II; and 5′-GTCA AAGCTT CCA TAC GGA AGA GTC TCA-3′ and 5′-GTCA CTCGAG CT TTC TGG GAA TGT ATT CAG-3′ for fragment III. All the forward primers contained a HindIII restriction site, and all the reverse primers contained an XhoI restriction site for cloning into the vector CYC1-TATA pWCJ100. The fragment II was further subdivided into three smaller fragments of ∼100 bp each as follows: fragment A (from -611 to -476 bp); fragment B (from -496 to -381 bp); and fragment C (from -401 to -285 bp). These three fragments were amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GTCA AAGCTT CAG TAG CAT TCT TGC ATG-3′ and 5′-GTCA CTCGAG GGAG TTA TGT TTG TAG CCGG-3′ for fragment A; 5′-GTCA AAGCTT CCG GCT ACA AAC ATA ACT CC-3′ and 5′-GTCA CTCGAG CAGTT CCG GTT TTT TTC GGC-3′ for fragment B; and 5′-GTCA AAGCTT GCC GAA AAA AAC CGG AAC TG-3′ and 5′-GTCA CTCGAG CGC TAT TGT AGT GCA GGT-3′ for fragment C. All fragments were cloned into CYC1-TATA pWCJ100. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged fusion of ATO3 was constructed using the primers 5′-GTA TTT CTCAGA ACG CTT ACG TTC CAGG-3′ and 5′-CAT TTC ATA CTCGAG AAG GAG CAT TTGG-3′. A 1660-bp fragment containing the ATO3 promoter and coding sequence, with the stop codon mutated, was amplified from genomic DNA and digested with EcoRI and XhoI. After digestion, the insert was cloned into a PRS416-GFP plasmid (16Bateman J.M. Iacovino M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47946-47953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to produce pRS416-ATO3-GFP. Yeast Transformation and β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast cells were transformed as described by Chen et al. (17Chen D.-C. Yang B.-C. Kuo T.-T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Transformants carrying the desired plasmids or plasmid pairs were selected on a selective medium. Liquid pre-cultures were inoculated with a pool of several independent transformants and grown on a selective medium. The cultures were inoculated at a low density (OD600 = 0.01), grown overnight at 30 °C, and collected at OD600 = 0.6. Cell extracts and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described by Rose et al. (18Rose M.D. Winston F. Heiter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). For each plasmid-strain combination, assays were conducted in triplicate, and independent experiments were carried out 2-3 times. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total yeast RNA was isolated as described (19Chelstowska A. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18141-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) from 50 or 250 ml of mid-log phase liquid cultures (OD600 = 0.8-1). Samples (10-15 μg) were fractionated on 1.2% formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran Plus filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized at 65 °C with probes specific for transcripts of DIP5, ATO3, CIT2, and ACT1. The DIP5 and ATO3 probes were amplified by PCR from selected coding regions of the reported genes using genomic DNA as template. The PCR products were gel-purified using a Qiagen kit. The CIT2 and ACT1 probes were prepared as described by Jia et al. (6Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). RNA loads were normalized to the level of ACT1 transcripts. Hybridization signals were quantified with a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. Fluorescence Microscopy—Mid-log phase cells were observed using a Leica microscope (model DMRXE) equipped with an HBO 100 watt/2 mercury arc lamp and a 100× Plan-Apochromat objective lens. Differential interference contrast and green fluorescent protein were visualized using filter sets as described in Bateman et al. (16Bateman J.M. Iacovino M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47946-47953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Elevated Expression of ATO3 and DIP5 in ρ o Petites Is Independent of the RTG Genes—To verify that some retrograde responsive genes are RTG-independent (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we examined the expression of two candidate genes, DIP5 and ATO3, by Northern blot analysis in wild-type ρ+ and ρo cells of strain PSY142 and in ρo rtg2Δ and rtg1Δ rtg3Δ double mutant derivatives. For comparison, we also examined the expression of CIT2, which is a prototypical retrograde responsive gene whose expression is strictly dependent on the RTG genes (4Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 6Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the characteristic increase of CIT2 transcripts in ρo cells and the complete dependence of CIT2 expression on RTG1-3. Like CIT2, the expression of both DIP5 and ATO3 was significantly elevated in ρo cells, indicating that they are also retrograde responsive genes. However, in striking contrast to CIT2, inactivation of RTG2 had no effect on the level of DIP5 and ATO3 transcripts in ρo cells, and there was only a modest (∼50%) reduction in the level of those transcripts in rtg1Δ rtg3Δ ρo cells. By contrast, CIT2 expression is inhibited >99% in rtg1Δrtg3Δ cells. In the subsequent experiments described here, we have focused on the analysis of ATO3 expression as an example of a retrograde responsive gene whose expression is largely independent of the RTG genes. To verify that the changes we observed in ATO3 mRNA levels were transcriptionally controlled, we fused the 5′ flanking region of ATO3 plus the first four amino acids (from positions -981 to 12) in-frame with the Escherichia coli lacZ gene. These constructs on centromeric plasmids were transformed into ρ+ or ρo wild-type cells and rtg2Δ or rtg1Δ rtg3Δ ρo derivatives of PSY142, and β-galactosidase activities were determined in extracts of pooled transformants. These reporter gene assays recapitulated the results of the Northern blot analysis; activity was elevated in ρo cells, unaffected by the inactivation of RTG2, and inhibited by roughly 50% in the rtg1Δ rtg3Δ double mutant (Fig. 1B). Ato3p Is Localized to the Plasma Membrane—When the current studies were initiated, there was little information on the function of Ato3p or its intracellular localization. The primary sequence of the predicted protein indicated that it contains six potential transmembrane domains, suggesting that it would be membrane-localized. To determine its intracellular localization, we constructed a C-terminal GFP-tagged derivative of Ato3p and expressed it from a CEN plasmid in PSY142 ρ+ and ρo cells. Transformants were grown to mid-log phase on YNBRcas medium and examined by epifluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). These experiments show first that Ato3p-GFP has a well defined plasma membrane location consistent with its predicted six transmembrane domains and with a recent suggestion that Ato3p is an outward ammonium transporter (14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Also consistent with the expression data shown in Fig. 1A that indicate that ATO3 is a retrograde responsive gene, Ato3p-GFP appears to be more strongly expressed in the plasma membrane of ρo cells. Finally, compared with newly emerging daughter buds, Ato3p-GFP is preferentially localized on the plasma membrane of mother cells. Altogether, our data are consistent with the suggestion that Ato3p is a plasma membrane transporter (14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Dissection of ATO3 Promoter and Identification of a Gcn4p Binding Site—To identify the cis and trans regulatory elements that control the expression of ATO3, we first sought to identify regions of the 5′ flanking sequences of ATO3 that would support reporter gene activity and show a retrograde response. To these ends, we divided the 5′ flanking regions of ATO3 into three fragments (Fig. 3A), namely I (from -999 to -593), II (from -611 to -285), and III (from -353 to -36), and inserted these in front of the CYC1 transcriptional start site fused to the lacZ gene (Fig. 3A). These constructs on CEN plasmids were used to transform PSY142 ρ+ and ρo cells, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in cell-free extracts obtained from pools of transformants grown on YNBRcas medium. The promoter dissection revealed clearly that the region contained within fragment II from -611 to -285 was sufficient to activate reporter gene expression and support its elevated expression in ρo cells (Fig. 3B). Indeed, these activities are comparable with what was observed for the full-length ATO3 5′ flanking region (see Fig. 1B), as were the activities in the rtg2Δ and rtg1Δ rtg3Δ ρo derivatives (data not shown). To identify specific cis-acting sites in the ATO3 promoter, region II was further subdivided into ∼100-bp fragments (segments marked A, B, and C in Fig. 4A), which were placed in front of the CYC1-lacZ reporter gene in CEN plasmids. These constructs were transformed into PSY142 ρ+ and ρo cells, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in extracts as before. Each of the regions, A, B and C, showed activity, with region B having ∼35% of the activity in both ρ+ and ρo cells of all the activity observed in those cell types for the full-length region II (Fig. 4B). A search of known transcriptional cis elements in region B revealed a single Gcn4p binding site, which differs from the canonical site by one base pair (TAACTC instead of TGACTC). Gcn4p is a general transcriptional activator that functions in the general amino acid control pathway (15Hinnebusch A.G. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar). Epstein et al. (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) found that some Gcn4p-responsive genes were elevated in ρo petite cells. Therefore, to test the functionality of the Gcn4p binding site in fragment B, PSY142 ρ+ and ρo cells transformed with the CEN plasmid containing fragment B were grown in minimal YNBR medium (supplemented only with leucine and lysine to meet the nutritional requirements of this strain) so as to induce the general amino acid control pathway. Under these growth conditions, fragment B clearly had the highest activity in both ρ+ and ρo cells. The activities in ρ+ cells were comparable for fragment B and the full-length fragment II, and, in ρo cells, the activity was roughly 70% of that of the full-length fragment II (Fig. 4C). Gcn4p Is Required for Full ATO3 Expression but Not for Its Retrograde Response—To show directly that Gcn4p plays a role in ATO3 expression, we inactivated the GCN4 gene and tested the effects on ATO3 transcript levels in PSY142 ρ+ and ρo cells. Fig. 5 shows that the level of ATO3 transcripts was reduced by 2.4- and 3.7-fold, respectively, in ρ+ and ρo gcn4Δ cells relative to the wild-type control, indicating that Gcn4p is a regulator of ATO3 expression. However, in gcn4Δ cells, the fold inhibition of ATO3 expression was comparable for ρ+ and ρo cells, indicated in Fig. 5 as the ρo/ρ+ expression ratio, showing that the retrograde response of ATO3 was relatively unaffected by the gcn4Δ mutation. Thus, although Gcn4p contributes to ATO3 expression, it is not required for the retrograde responsiveness of this gene. ATO3 Expression Is Modulated by SSY1—ATO3 was reported to be one of a number of genes whose expression is dependent on the SPS sensing system for extracellular amino acids (20Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with the finding that ammonia production is decreased in cells that are defective in the SPS system (22Zikanova B. Kuthan M. Ricicova M. Forstova J. Palkova Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Forsberg et al. (21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) also found that the expression of a significant number of SPS-dependent genes in prototrophic cells was either derepressed or repressed by the addition of leucine to the medium. We were therefore interested in examining the effects of inactivation of the upstream component of the SPS system, SSY1, on both the expression and the retrograde response of ATO3. Although Forsberg et al. (21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) did not find that ATO3 expression was responsive to leucine, we nevertheless tested the effects of leucine on ATO3-lacZ expression in PLY126 ρ+ and ρo wild-type and ssy1Δ cells. Both wild-type and ssy1Δ ρ+ and ρo derivatives of PLY126 were grown in YNBD medium in the presence or absence of 0.05% leucine, and ATO3 reporter gene activity was assayed in cell extracts. As shown in Fig. 6, deletion of SSY1 has no effect on ATO3-lacZ reporter gene activity in ρ+ cells grown in medium lacking leucine. By contrast, the elevated level of reporter gene activity in ρo cells grown in the same medium was inhibited by ∼60% as a result of inactivation of SSY1, indicating that the SPS sensor system plays a significant role in the retrograde response of ATO3 expression. The addition of leucine to the medium resulted in a ∼2-fold stimulation of reporter gene expression in ρ+ cells, and this induction was completely blocked by the ssy1Δ mutation. By contrast to these results, we did not observe any stimulation of ATO3 reporter gene activity in otherwise wild-type or ssy1Δ ρo cells when the medium contained leucine. The failure of leucine to stimulate ATO3 expression in ρo cells suggests that ATO3 expression is maximally induced in those cells and thus is no longer responsive to leucine induction. Regulation of the retrograde response pathway in yeast has been best characterized by the activity of three positive regulatory factors, Rtg1p, Rtg2p, and Rtg3p. For CIT2, a prototypical retrograde responsive gene, both its basal and elevated expression in cells with compromised or dysfunctional mitochondria is dependent on Rtg1p, Rtg2p, and Rtg3p (6Jia Y. Rothermel B. Thornton J. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have described a retrograde responsive gene, ATO3, whose expression, like that of CIT2, is dramatically increased in respiratory deficient ρo petite cells but is largely independent of Rtg1p, Rtg2p, and Rtg3p. We showed that expression of ATO3 is regulated in part by the transcriptional activator Gcn4p and the SPS amino acid-sensing pathway. Ato3p has been suggested to be an outward ammonia transporter that contributes to the periodic production of ammonia as a means of signaling among yeast colonies (14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ato3p is predicted to have six transmembrane domains and, thus, as a putative outward ammonia transporter, should be localized to the plasma membrane. This was confirmed by a microscopic analysis of cells expressing a GFP-tagged derivative of Ato3p. We observed a higher level of plasma membrane-localized Ato3p-GFP in ρo cells compared with their ρ+ counterparts, consistent with the increased level of ATO3 transcripts in ρo cells. Ato3p-GFP also appeared to be preferentially localized to the plasma membrane of mother cells, as immature daughter buds contained significantly less signal. The functional significance and mechanism of the preferential accumulation of Ato3p to the plasma membrane of mother cells in log phase cultures remains to be established. We have described two levels of control of ATO3 expression, both of which are connected to amino acid sensing and regulation. First, we found that ATO3 expression is regulated by Gcn4p, the transcriptional activator of the general amino acid control response pathway (15Hinnebusch A.G. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 319-414Google Scholar). Inactivation of GCN4 led to a severe reduction in the overall level of ATO3 expression in both ρ+ and ρo cells, consistent with the presence of a potential Gcn4p binding site in the 5′ flanking region of the gene. Despite its lowered expression in gcn4Δ cells, the fold induction of ATO3 transcripts in ρo versus ρ+ gcn4Δ cells was comparable with that detected in wild-type cells. Second, we observed that ATO3 expression is also controlled by the SPS sensor system consisting of a plasma membrane protein, Ssy1p, and the peripheral membrane proteins Ptr3p and Ssy5p. The latter two proteins are believed to interact with a cytoplasmic N-terminal extension of Ssy1p and, together, function as a signal transduction cascade for the sensing of external amino acids (20Forsberg H. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 814-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Klasson H. Fink G.R. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5405-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Liu Z. Sekito T. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 2002; 20: 7209-7219Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). That the SPS amino acid sensor system plays a role in the regulation of ATO3 expression was suggested previously from a genome-wide transcriptional survey of the effects of the inactivation of SSY1 (21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In our current study we find that the inactivation of SSY1 had no effect on the expression of ATO3 reporter gene expression in ρ+ cells, but it resulted in a ∼60% reduction of expression in ρo petites. In other words, in contrast to the results of inactivation of GCN4, inactivation of the SPS sensing system resulted in a significant reduction of the ATO3 retrograde response but not its basal level of expression in ρ+ cells. Forsberg et al. (21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) also categorized two classes of genes whose expression was SPS-dependent based on whether expression was stimulated by the addition of leucine to the medium. That study indicated that ATO3 was among the class of genes whose expression was unaffected by leucine. In our experiments, however, we detected an SPS-dependent leucine stimulation of ATO3 expression that was dependent on the integrity of the SPS sensor system. But that stimulation was only observed in ρ+ cells, possibly because, in the absence of leucine in the medium, the SPS-dependent expression of ATO3 in ρo cells was already at a maximal level. Further work will be required to resolve the differences between our results and those of Forsberg et al. (21Forsberg H. Gilstring C.F. Zargari A. Martinez P. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) on the regulation of ATO3 expression. Finally, the possibility that amino acid sensing through the SPS system is a physiologically important aspect of regulation of ATO3 was suggested from the finding that, in cells defective in SPS sensing, ammonia production was decreased (22Zikanova B. Kuthan M. Ricicova M. Forstova J. Palkova Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). What is the relationship between the elevated expression of ATO3 (and other putative ammonia exporters, YCR010c and YNR002c; see Epstein et al., Ref. 2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) in respiratory deficient ρo petite cells and ammonia production in respiratory competent cells in colonies that are in late stages of growth? There are a number of striking parallels between the overall physiological state of respiratory deficient cells and otherwise respiratory competent cells that are producing ammonia. In both cases, anaplerotic pathways such as the glyoxylate cycle and peroxisomal functions are induced so as to provide key metabolic intermediates such as acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These anaplerotic pathways are induced in respiratory deficient cells to ensure that sufficient amounts of α-ketoglutarate and, in turn, glutamate and glutamine are available for biosynthetic reactions. Indeed, inactivation of the RTG genes in respiratory deficient cells or in cells with reduced mitochondrial function results in glutamate auxotrophy (4Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 12Liu Z. Butow R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6720-6728Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the late stages of cell growth associated with ammonia production, Palková et al. (14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) noted that the expression of a number of genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory function was down-regulated. Thus, metabolism in those cells appears to be reconfigured in much the same way as in respiratory deficient ρo cells, presumably to accommodate those cells to reduced respiratory activity. The data presented here underscore the notion that the retrograde response pathway links carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism. Because of the limitation in α-ketoglutarate synthesis in respiratory deficient cells, there would likely be a stoichiometric imbalance between α-ketoglutarate and ammonia unless excess ammonia, which would be toxic to cells, was excreted. Moreover, genome-wide transcription analysis indicates that the expression of GDH1, which catalyzes the major route for glutamate synthesis from α-ketoglutarate and ammonia, is somewhat down-regulated in ρo cells (2Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale IV W. Davé V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This would suggest that even less ammonia would be assimilated by respiratory deficient cells at the level of glutamate synthesis. The induction of ATO3 expression as shown here as well as the induction of other putative ammonium transporters in respiratory competent cells (14Palkova Z. Devaux F. Icicova M. Minarikova L. Le Crom S. Jacq C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3901-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) could thus alleviate this potentially toxic ammonium imbalance by increased excretion of the excess ammonium. In respiratory competent cells, GDH1 expression is regulated by a number of factors, including Hap4p, Leu3p, Gcn4p, and Gln3p (25Riego L. Avendano A. DeLuna A. Rodriguez E. Gonzalez A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which reflect the role of glutamic dehydrogenase in coordinating carbohydrate and nitrogen utilization. There are a number of parallels between the studies reported here and those of Moye-Rowley and co-workers (26Devaux F. Carvajal E. Moye-Rowley S. Jacq C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Hallstrom T.C. Moye-Rowley S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34347-37356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). They have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction, such as the loss of mitochondrial DNA or mutations in the inner mitochondrial membrane protein, Oxa1p, which is required for the assembly of cytochrome oxidase and the ATP synthase complex (28Altamura N. Capitanio N. Bonnefoy N. Papa S. Dujardin G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 29Kermorgant M. Bonnefoy N. Dujardin G. Curr. Genet. 1997; 31: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), results in up-regulation of PDR5 encoding a plasma membrane ABC transporter; when overproduced, the increased levels of Pdr5p results in pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR). Indeed, a genome-wide transcriptional analysis show that a large number of genes involved in pleiotropic drug resistance are upregulated in ρo petites (30Traven A. Wong J.M. Xu D. Sopta M. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4020-4027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The elevated expression of PDR5 is due to increased expression of Pdr3p, a Cys6-Zn(II) transcription factor required for PDR5 expression. Like ATO3, this retrograde system shows only a modest (50-60%) dependence on the RTG genes. Also, in oxa1 cells the retrograde response appeared to be completely independent of the RTG genes. Although the signals that couple mitochondrial dysfunction to increased expression of PDR genes remains to be clarified, these and the current studies establish that the retrograde pathway is likely to involve multiple and not necessarily overlapping signals that trigger changes in nuclear gene expression in response to mitochondrial dysfunction.

The activation of MHC-II by IFN-γ requires activation of a trimeric DNA binding transcriptional complex, RFX5 complex, containing RFXB (also called RFXANK or Tvl-1), RFXAP, as well as RFX5 protein. Previously, we demonstrated that RFX5 binds to the collagen transcription start site and represses collagen gene expression (Sengupta, P. K., Fargo, J., Smith, B. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 24926–24937). In this report, we have examined the role of RFXB and RFXAP proteins within the RFX5 complex to regulate collagen gene expression. The data show that all three RFX5 complex proteins are required for maximum repression. Expression of proteins with mutations known to be important for RFX5 complex formation does not repress collagen promoter activity. Two mutated forms of RFX5 act as dominant negative proteins activating collagen expression and reversing IFN-γ down-regulation of collagen expression in human lung fibroblasts. IFN-γ increases expression and nuclear translocation of RFX5. RFXB has a naturally occurring splice variant isoform (RFX SV). Interferon increases expression of the long form of RFXB and decreases expression of RFX SV with the same kinetics as collagen gene expression. Overexpression of the splice variant form reverses the IFN-γ induced collagen repression in human lung fibroblasts. Finally, all three RFX5 complex proteins increase at the collagen transcription start site with IFN-γ treatment using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis.

Cells respond to infection and inflammation by producing IFN-γ in T-cells (Th1) and NK cells. As an antifibrotic agent, IFN-γ suppresses collagen protein production in a time- and dose-dependent manner primarily at the transcriptional level (1.Rosenbloom J. Feldman G. Freundlich B. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 2.Jimenez S.A. Freundlich B. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Both type I collagen chains are regulated coordinately by IFN-γ. In vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that IFN-γ inhibits collagen synthesis associated with the fibrotic response to an implanted foreign body, bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and the healing response to cutaneous thermal burns (3.Granstein R.D. Flotte T.J. Amento E.P. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 75S-80SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Clinical trials have had some success in ameliorating certain fibrotic conditions such as interstitial lung fibrosis and systemic sclerosis (4.Antoniou K.M. Ferdoutsis E. Bouros D. Chest. 2003; 123: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IFN-γ activates many genes through the Jak-Stat pathway (5.Darnell Jr., J.E. Recent Prog. Horm.

IFN-γ is a key cytokine that also induces the expression of major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) complex proteins on the cell surface. MHC-II plays a central role by presenting antigens to CD4+ T cells, which serves as a crucial control of peripheral T-cell activation and thymic selection (12.McDevitt H. Immunol.

Failure to express MHC-II in patients with bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is caused by mutations belonging to four complementary groups. The expression of MHC-II depends on the transcription factors encoded by the genes defined in these complementary groups. Complementation group A is caused by mutations in Class II transcriptional activator (CIITA). This protein is considered a master regulator of MHC-II transcription and its mRNA levels are greatly stimulated by IFN-γ in many cells, including fibroblasts (14.Piskurich J.F. Wang Y. Linhoff M.W. White L.C. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 233-240PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Chin K.C. Mao C. Skinner C. Riley J.L. Wright K.L. Moreno C.S. Stark G.R. Boss J.M. Ting J.P.

Med. 1994; 180: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). CIITA is a histone acetyltransferase capable of acetylating histones and activating transcription through its interactions with the general transcription factors (TBP, TAFII30, TAFII70, TFIIB) (17.Fontes J.D.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8489-8498Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that CIITA could repress collagen through interaction with p300/CBP (23.Zhu X.S. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7078-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The other three complementation groups are caused by mutations in three proteins, RFX5, RFXB (also called RFXANK or Tvl-1) and RFXAP that interact with each other forming a DNA binding complex, the RFX5 complex. The RFX5 complex binds to the X-box located in the MHC-II promoter (24.Steimle V. Durand B. Barras E. Zufferey M. Hadam M.R. Mach B. Reith W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25.Moreno C.S. Rogers E.M. Brown J.A. Boss J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5841-5848PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding is primarily mediated by RFX5 (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) although RFXAP and RFXB may also contact DNA (27.Westerheide S.D. Boss J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). RFX5 is the main protein that interacts with CIITA. RFXAP binds both RFX5 and RFXB through its C-terminal domain serving as a bridge between these two proteins (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). RFXB contains several ankyrin repeats that mediate protein-protein interactions. The RFXB gene gives rise to two differentially spliced mRNAs (28.Nagarajan U.M. Louis-Plence P. DeSandro A. Nilsen R. Bushey A. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The spliced variant (RFXB SV) has a substitution of amino acid 90 from aspartic acid to cysteine and is missing amino acids 91–112, exon 5, thereby eliminating its ability to induce expression of MHC-II genes (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IFN-γ induces RFXB but down-regulates the splice variant isoform (29.Das S. Lin J.H. Papamatheakis J. Sykulev Y. Tsichlis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45172-45180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All four proteins, RFX5, RFXB, RFXAP, and CIITA are required for the MHC-II transcription activation but act in cooperation with other DNA binding factors such as CAAT binding factor/nuclear factor Y (CBF/NF-Y). Previously we have demonstrated that the RFX family of transcription factors can bind to the α2(I) collagen gene (COL1A2) at the transcription start site (29.Das S. Lin J.H. Papamatheakis J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, RFX5 and CIITA repress collagen gene expression in fibroblasts (31.Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This work continues these investigations by demonstrating that the other components of the RFX5 complex contribute to repression of collagen gene expression. Mutations of the expressed proteins indicate that the RFX5 complex is important for repression. Two mutant forms of RFX5 can activate collagen expression and reverse repression by IFN-γ. In the presence of IFN-γ, the RFXB isoform represses collagen promoter activity whereas the RFXB SV isoform activates collagen promoter activity. All three proteins occupy the collagen transcription start site, and IFN-γ increased the occupation at that site, as judged by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP). Finally, the levels of histone acetylation surrounding the collagen transcription start site decreased with time after IFN-γ treatment correlating with transcriptional repression. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) (Coriell, NJ) and rat fibroblasts (FR) (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone). Prior to transfection, cells were plated in 6-well culture plates at density of 3 × 105 (for human lung fibroblasts) or 6 × 105 cells (for rat fibroblasts cells) per well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. Transfections were performed in serum-free DMEM using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Three hours after transfection, cells were switched to DMEM with 10% FBS and harvested 24 h later. Cells were then lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activities were assayed using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). In several studies human lung fibroblasts were treated with IFN-γ. Human lung fibroblasts were plated in p35 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 105 cells/dish for mRNA studies or in p150 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 106 cells/dish for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for 16–24 h. Cells were pretreated in DMEM with 0.4% FBS for 16 h prior to IFN-γ treatment (100 units/ml in 0.4% DMEM for 0, 8, 16, or 24 h). Plasmids—The COL1A2-luciferase construct (pH20) (32.Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A. Lozano G. Maity S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Full-length Flag-RFX5 and Flag-RFXB/ANK constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Jenny Ting (33.Zhu X.S. Linhoff M.W. Li G. Chin K.C. Maity S.N. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6051-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). His-RFX5Δ1 (201–616), His-RFX5Δ5 (1–170), His-RFX5Δ6 (1–409), His-RFXAPΔ3 (1–245), and RFXB SV constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Jeremy Boss (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). His-RFXAPΔ1 (89–272) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection and was initially cloned in pT3T3D-Pac vector. It was re-cloned into pcDNA3-HisC expression vector. Full-length His-RFXAP was constructed by RT-PCR using forward primer: 5′-AAGTAACTGCTTCATTACC-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-TCACATTGATGTTCCTGG-3′, followed by cloning into pcDNA4-HisMax vector Western Blots—For detection of expressed proteins, fibroblasts were extracted using RIPA buffer (1xPBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, with freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml RIPA), aprotinin (5–10 TIU/ml RIPA). For certain experiments to examine the effects of IFN-γ treatment on RFX5 localization, nuclear and cytoplasmic protein was separated (35.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. S W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in extracts were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with prestained markers (Bio-Rad) used for estimating molecular weight and efficiency of transfer to blots. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder at room temperature for 3 h and hybridized for 1 h to several antibodies (polyclonal antibody against RFX5 (194) (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), FLAG (Sigma), His (Invitrogen). After washing with buffer three times, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, either anti-goat IgG (Sigma) or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), for another 1 h at room temperature. Then protein blots were visualized using ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on a Kodak image station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). RNA Isolation and Real-time PCR—Cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using a RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using a SuperScript First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR reactions were performed on a ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol.

Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescence—Human lung fibroblasts were plated at 200,000 cells per 35 mm glass bottom culture dish and allowed to grow for 24 h in 0.4% serum and treated with IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 6, 16, or 24 h before fixation. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were made permeable using 0.25% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) (0.25% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). After four more washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were incubated in blocking buffer with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. The primary antibody, RFX5 (1:500) (194) (Rockland), was incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST. After washing four times, the slides were incubated with an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:200) (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories). Fluorescence was observed by an Olympus 1X7O inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a Kodak professional EOS.DCS digital camera. The intensity of fluorescence was analyzed using ImagePro Plus software. Three digitized images from three different experiments were analyzed by picking pixels that covered the nucleus. The program computed the mean intensity in the nuclei and calculated the standard deviation. Statistical test of significance of the mean intensity difference between time points was calculated using ANOVA (analysis of variance) employing Scheffe's post-hoc procedure. ChIP—After IFN-γ treatment, cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature, sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline, Solution I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.75% Triton X-100), and Solution II (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) and DNA was fragmented into ∼500-bp pieces using a Branson 250 sonicator. Aliquots of lysates containing 200 μg of protein were used for each immunprecipitation reaction with anti-RFX5 (194, Rockland), anti-RFXB (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-RFXAP (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-acetylated histone H3 and anti-acetylated histone H4 (ChIP grade, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) antibodies followed by adsorption to Protein A/G plus-agarose. Precipitated DNA-protein complexes were washed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), LiCl buffer (50 mm Tris, pH8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), respectively. The DNA-protein cross-link was reversed by heating the samples to 65 °C overnight. Proteins were digested with Proteinase K (Sigma) and DNA was phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated by 100% ethanol. Dried DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of deionized distilled water, and 10 μl was used for each real-time PCR reaction.

Open table in a new tab RFXB, RFXAP, and RFX5 Repress Collagen Transcription in Rat Fibroblasts—Previously, we demonstrated that co-transfection of RFX5 represses COL1A2 promoter-reporter plasmids (31.Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since the RFX5 complex contains three proteins, we continued these experiments by examining the role of the two additional subunits of the RFX5 complex, RFXB, and RFXAP, on collagen gene transcription. Rat fibroblasts were used for these experiments because these fibroblasts do not exhibit an RFX5 binding activity or demonstrable RFX5 protein by Western analysis (30.Sengupta P.K. Erhlich M. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36649-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A small COL1A2 promoter (–221 to+54) driving luciferase reporter (pH20) was co-transfected with different amounts of full-length cDNAs expressing RFXB and RFXAP (Fig. 1, A and B). Reporter gene activity decreased in a dose-responsive manner. The RFXB dose response curve (Fig. 1A) was similar to the previously published dose response using RFX5 expression constructs (31.Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein extracted from cells transfected with full-length cDNA constructs of RFXB and RFXAP were compared with protein extracted from cells transfected with pcDNA3 empty vector. Since the expressed RFXB and RFXAP contain an epitope tag (FLAG and His, respectively), Western analysis using commercially available antibodies were used to indicate that the constructs are expressed in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, left panels). Next, each subunit was co-transfected alone at a two doses (0.25 μg, 0.75 μg) or in combinations of two or three constructs. Empty pcDNA3.1 vector was added to keep the total amount of DNA transfected constant. There was a significant repression when all subunits were transfected together (Fig. 1C). This repression by all three subunits was more than any individual subunit at the same dose (0.75 μg). Expression of Truncated Forms of RFX5 Identifies Two Domains That Are Necessary for Collagen Repression—Next, RFX5 deletion mutant constructs (Fig. 2A) (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Jeremy Boss) were expressed (Fig. 2B) and tested for collagen gene repression activity in combination with other members of the RFX5 complex (Fig. 2C). RFX5 is the only protein in the complex that has a clearly defined DNA binding domain. The RFX5 mutant, named RFX5Δ1, does not have this DNA binding domain, but it does contain a proline-rich region that interacts with CIITA and a region that interacts with the other subunits (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig 2A). As expected, when this mutant was co-transfected with RFXB and RFXAP, the collagen promoter expression equaled that in cells transfected only with RFXB and RFXAP. The RFX5Δ5 mutant does not have the CIITA interaction domain, but it can interact with RFXAP and RFXB (26.DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The RFX5Δ5 mutant also did not repress collagen transcription. However, the mutant RFX5Δ6 with domains that interact with CIITA and DNA retained most of the collagen repression activity. To determine if these mutants could compete for wild-type RFX5 and act as dominant negative mutants, each mutant was co-transfected at different doses with the complete complex containing wild-type RFX5 in addition to RFXB and RFXAP. As indicated in Fig. 2D, RFX5Δ1 and RFX5Δ5, but not RFX5Δ6 reversed the repression of the RFX5 complex in a dose-dependent manner reaching the level of the control transfected with RFXB and RFXAP only. Thus, two mutant constructs act as dominant negative constructs. This suggests that both the DNA binding domain and the proline-rich region may be necessary for collagen repression. Specific Domains of RFXB and RFXPAP Are Necessary for the Repression Activity of RFX5 Complex on Collagen Transcription—RFXB has a natural splice variant form, RFXB SV, with a deleted exon 5 that alters amino acid 90 (D to C) followed by a deletion of amino acids from 91 to 113 (26.DeSandro A.M.

Although RPKs show high variability in their receptor domain, they share highly conserved cytoplasmic kinase domains, and they are assumed to function by a relatively well conserved general mechanism. After ligand binding and receptor oligomerization, the intracellular kinase domain becomes activated. This results in intermolecular auto-phosphorylation and conformational changes that allow the receptor to bind downstream signaling proteins (see Refs. 1Pawson T. Nash P.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 231: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These atypical RPKs have substitutions within the kinase-conserved motifs, especially in the aspartic acid in subdomain VIb and in the DFG activation loop motif of subdomain VII. Among them, ErbB3 and H-Ryk are probably the best known examples. It has been shown that mice knockouts for ErbB-3 or Ryk present severe mutant phenotypes suggesting that both proteins are essential for signaling (10Riethmacher D. Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E.

Farlie P.G. Newgreen D.F. Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 414-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ErbB3 forms heterodimers with other members of the family of epidermal growth family receptors and is phosphorylated by these kinase-active RPKs (12Kim H.H. Vijapurkar U. Hellyer N.J. Bravo D. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, ErbB3 serves as docking sites for multiple downstream signaling proteins. H-Ryk also forms heterodimers with other kinase-active RPKs, although in this case the interaction does not result in phosphorylation (13Trivier E. Ganesan T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23037-23043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A chimeric receptor approach has shown that the ligand stimulation of H-Ryk results in activation of the MAPK pathway (6Katso R.M. Russell R.B. Ganesan T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6427-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that activated H-Ryk can interact with and activate other downstream signaling proteins. Indeed, it has been proposed that signaling through atypical RPKs could involve regulated protein-protein interactions through their intracellular domains, which would explain the high conservation of the kinase-like structure of these domains through evolution (14Stein R.A. Staros J.V. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the signal transduction mechanism for most atypical RPKs is still unknown. receptor protein kinases plant receptor kinases mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase MAP kinase kinase days after pollination rapid amplification of cDNA ends glutathione S-transferase hemagglutinin myelin basic protein intracellular domain germinal center kinase. MAP kinases play a key role on signal transduction in eukaryotes. MAP kinase modules are usually connected to the membrane-located receptors through G proteins, such as Ras or heterotrimeric complexes, or kinases that phosphorylate MAPKKK and are denoted as MAPKKKK (15Kyriakis J.M.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of two maize genes coding for an atypical plant receptor kinase (PRK) and for a kinase of the GCK subfamily of MAPKKKK, which have been named MARK and MIK, respectively. We show that MARK and MIK interact in yeast, in vitro, and in mammalian cells. Moreover, phosphorylation experiments show that this interaction results in the induction of the kinase activity of MIK, suggesting a new mechanism for signaling through atypical receptor kinases. Plant Material—Zea mays cv. W64A plants were grown at 26 °C on a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Cloning of MARK and MIK cDNAs—A partial MARK cDNA was obtained from a differential screening of a 12-day after pollination (DAP) maize embryo cDNA library using 12-DAP embryo cDNA and leaf cDNA as probes, as described elsewhere (18Roca R. Stiefel V. Puigdomenech P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This clone was used to screen maize cDNA and genomic libraries (18Roca R. Stiefel V. Puigdomenech P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to obtain the full-length cDNA and genomic sequence. The full-length MIK sequence was obtained by RACE PCR on 15-DAP maize embryo cDNA with the primers MIKRACE1 (5′-CATCCATGCCTTTTGC-3′) and MIKRACE2 (5′-GATGCTTGAGAAGCTCCTTGG-3′) designed from the partial cDNA obtained from a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library (see below), using a RACE PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Northern Analysis—Total RNA from immature seeds and adult leaves was obtained as described (18Roca R. Stiefel V. Puigdomenech P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 10 μg of the different RNAs was subjected to denaturing electrophoresis, blotted to nylon membranes (Nytran; Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized with radiolabeled MARK or MIK cDNA probes following standard procedures as reported previously (18Roca R. Stiefel V. Puigdomenech P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins and Production of Antibodies—A partial cDNA corresponding to the last 325 amino acids of MARK protein, which coincide with its putative intracellular domain (ID-MARK), and the partial MIK cDNA corresponding to the last 143 amino acids of MIK (C-MIK) obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening (see below) were cloned into a pET28 vector, and the recombinant His6-tagged ID-MARK and His6-tagged MIK were obtained as described (19Espinas M.L. Canudas S. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Casanova J. Azorin F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ID-MARK cDNA and C-MIK cDNA were also cloned into a pGEX-KG expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) in order to obtain the GST-ID-MARK and GST-C-MIK as described (19Espinas M.L. Canudas S. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Casanova J. Azorin F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Antibodies against ID-MARK and C-MIK were obtained in rabbits inoculated with the His6-tagged ID-MARK and His6-tagged C-MIK recombinant proteins. ID-MARK and MIK full-length cDNAs were cloned into pFLAG-CMV (Sigma) and pCMV5-HA vector (Clontech) in order to express both tagged proteins in mammalian COS-7 cells. Immunofluorescence Assays—For immunolocalization assays, 15-DAP immature maize embryos were fixed in an ethanol/formaldehyde/glacial acetic acid (80:3.5:5) fixative solution for 1 h at room temperature and for 7 days at 4 °C. Embryos were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. 8-μm sections were deparaffinized with xylol, dehydrated, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated with the corresponding antibodies (1:200) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, for 1 h at room temperature plus 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing sections were incubated with an anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (1:400) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After extensive washing, sections were mounted with Mowiol and stored at 4 °C. Fluorescence was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP). Two-hybrid Analysis and GST Pull-down Assays—To construct the pAS2-1 bait plasmid, a partial cDNA corresponding to the last 325 amino acids of MARK was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain in plasmid pAS2-1 to generate pAS2-MARK (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This plasmid was used to screen a maize embryo (7 DAP) cDNA library cloned in the pACT2 plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Werr (Köln University). The screening was performed in strain Y190 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1UAS-HIS3TATA-HIS, MEL1 URA::GAL1UAS-GAL1UAS-lacZ), and transformants were grown on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 15 mm 3-amino-1′,2′,4′-triazole to select positive growing clones. The activity of the lacZ reporter gene was monitored visually by using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) filter assay. To test the specificity of MARK-MIK interaction, yeast cells were co-transformed with the pACT2-MIK1 clone obtained from the screening and either pAS2-MARK or the full-length cDNAs of lamin C, CDK2, and SNF1 cloned into the pAS2-1 plasmid that was used as control. The analysis of the possible interactions was performed as described (19Espinas M.L. Canudas S. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Casanova J. Azorin F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). GST pull-down experiments were performed as described (19Espinas M.L. Canudas S. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Casanova J. Azorin F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using the His6-tagged ID-MARK as an input on different MIK GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Phylogenetic Analysis—Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW multiple alignment program (version 1.5) (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). DNAdist, Neighbor, Seqboot, and Consense programs in Felsestein's PHYLIP package (21Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) were used to generate a distance matrix based on the Jukes-Cantor algorithm and the corresponding neighbor-joining tree, respectively. Bootstrap analyses were performed using the Seqboot and Consense programs from Felsestein's PHYLIP package (21Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—15 DAP maize embryos were ground in liquid nitrogen, and proteins were extracted with extraction buffer (10 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 40 mm octyl glucoside). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 3000 rpm, and the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min before loading onto a precalibrated Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). Gel filtration was carried out in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton buffer at 0.4 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and 15 μl of each was analyzed. Cell Culture, Transfection, Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, Immune Complex Kinase Assay, and Western Blotting—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Transfected cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml E-64, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. 100 μl of supernatant was pre-cleared with 12 μl of a 25% slurry of protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow (Sigma) and incubated with anti-HA antibody (Sigma) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of a 25% slurry of protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow (Sigma) was added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed twice in immunoprecipitation buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE before electrophoretic transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins were detected with the respective antibodies. Kinase Assays—ID-MARK was cloned into pGEX-KG expression vector and the GST_ID-MARK fusion was purified as mentioned before. MARK auto-phosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation on myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) was performed as described (22Shah K. Vervoort J. de Vries S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41263-41269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), using GST as negative control and GST-SERK (22Shah K. Vervoort J. de Vries S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41263-41269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) as a positive control. After phosphorylation, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to verify equal loading and then dried. The radioactivity was quantified with a PhosphorImager using the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). Kinase reactions on immunoprecipitated proteins were performed in 20 μl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2) containing 2 μg of MBP, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP 3000 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences). The protein kinase reactions were performed at 30 °C for 15 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 2× loading buffer. To verify equal loading of HA-MIK, samples were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-MIK. MARK, a Maize Atypical PRK with a Kinase-dead Domain—As part of a project aimed to identify genes involved in maize embryogenesis control, we performed a differential screening of an embryo cDNA library with embryo and adult leaf cDNA probes. One of the putative embryo-specific cDNA clones showed high sequence similarity with genes coding for Ser/Thr kinases. This clone was chosen for further study and used as a probe to screen embryo cDNA and genomic maize libraries. The complete cDNA and genomic sequences predicted an open reading frame of 694 amino acids with high sequence similarities with PRKs (Fig. 1). We named this protein MARK (from maize atypical receptor kinase). As deduced from the predicted protein sequence, MARK presents a signal peptide, an extracellular domain with 6 imperfect leucine-rich repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain displaying high sequence similarity with Ser/Thr kinases. Although the intracellular domain of MARK (ID-MARK) contains the 11 conserved subdomains of Ser/Thr kinases, some of the invariant and highly conserved amino acids within these subdomains are substituted (Fig. 2A). In particular, the aspartic acid present in the subdomain VIb, which is assumed to part of the kinase-active site (23Knighton D.R. Cadena D.L. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5001-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), by an asparagine (residue 519), and the aspartic acid and phenylalanine within the DFG activation loop are replaced by a glutamic acid and an asparagine (residues 537 and 538) (see Fig. 2A). Mutation of the aspartic acid residue to glutamic acid, despite being relatively conservative, is sufficient to yield inactive the v-Fps kinase (24Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Sadowski I. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 665-672PubMed Google Scholar), and the critical role of the phenylalanine residue of the DFG triplet has been demonstrated in the case of H-Ryk (6Katso R.M. Russell R.B. Ganesan T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6427-6440Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that the intracellular domain of MARK could be an atypical PRK with a kinase-dead domain. We thus expressed ID-MARK in Escherichia coli as a translational fusion with GST, and we checked the ability of the recombinant protein to auto- or trans-phosphorylate MBP in vitro. The results presented in Fig. 2B show that ID-MARK did not phosphorylate MBP nor was it auto-phosphorylated in the conditions in which the intracellular domain of SERK, an Arabidopsis PRK with a typical intracellular kinase domain (22Shah K. Vervoort J. de Vries S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41263-41269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), used here as a positive control, efficiently auto-phosphorylates and trans-phosphorylates MBP. Cloning MIK, a New GCK-like Kinase—Atypical PRKs are understood to participate in signal transduction by means of regulated protein-protein interactions (3Kroiher M. Miller M.A. Steele R.E. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We thus searched for proteins that could interact with the intracellular domain of MARK using a yeast two-hybrid approach. The screening of 100,000 clones of a yeast two-hybrid immature embryo cDNA library using ID-MARK as bait gave a number of positive clones. Two of them contained overlapping sequences coding for a polypeptide with high sequence similarity with the C-terminal domain of two highly related MAP4K from Brassica napus (25Leprince A.S. Jouannic S. Hamal A. Kreis M. Henry Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We named the corresponding gene MIK, from MARK interacting kinase. The analysis of MARK-MIK interaction by a yeast two-hybrid assay is shown in Fig. 3A. Confluent growth was obtained when the culture transformed with the MIK partial cDNA, corresponding to the most C-terminal 143 amino acids of the protein. ID-MARK in the corresponding pACT2 and pAS2.1 plasmids was plated on selective medium at the highest density, and significant growth was observed when the culture was plated at a 102-fold dilution. On the contrary, cultures co-transformed with the MIK partial cDNA and different unrelated control proteins, such as lamin, CDK2, or SNF1 do not show significant growth even when plated at the highest density. The interaction between the C-terminal part of MIK and ID-MARK was confirmed using GST pull-down experiments. ID-MARK bound an immobilized GST-MIK polypeptide containing the most C-terminal 143 amino acids of the MIK protein, whereas it did not bind to an immobilized GST (Fig. 3B). The partial MIK cDNA clones obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screen were used to screen maize embryo cDNA and genomic DNA libraries. The analysis of corresponding complete cDNA and genomic clones allowed us to deduce the complete MIK sequence (Fig. 4A). MIK contains an N-terminal kinase domain with high sequence similarity to Ser/Thr kinases of the GCK subfamily of Ste20 family of MAPK. Moreover, this domain contains the sequence VGTPFWMAPEV, which matches the signature motif of Ste20-like kinases, (v/i)GTPyWMAPEv (lowercase letters indicate a lower degree of conservation) (17Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows a Neighbor-joining tree comparing the kinase domain of MIK (MIK-KD) with those of previously described GCK proteins. MIK-KD plots in a separate branch includes the Arabidopsis and Brassica GCK-like proteins described to date (25Leprince A.S. Jouannic S. Hamal A. Kreis M. Henry Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This group of proteins resemble the GCK-III group of proteins, which include the human MASK, MST3, and SOK-1, as well as the Dictyostelium SEVERIN proteins. The C-terminal domain of GCKs is highly variable in sequence and is assumed to act as a regulatory domain. The C-terminal domain of MIK does not show significant sequence similarity with other GCK proteins except Arabidopsis and B. napus MAP4K (25Leprince A.S. Jouannic S. Hamal A. Kreis M. Henry Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To explore the possible biological significance of MARK-MIK interaction, we analyzed the expression of both genes. Northern blot hybridization analysis show that both MARK and MIK are expressed during early and mid-embryogenesis, from 2 until 30–40 DAP (days after pollination), with a peak at 15 DAP, in embryo and endosperm, whereas they are not expressed in adult leaves (Fig. 5). Preliminary analysis also showed that both genes are excluded from most adult tissues except the meristem (not shown), which are the structures that allow plants to continuously generate organs all along their life. Antibodies raised against the intracellular domain of MARK, α-MARK, and against the regulator domain of MIK, α-MIK, were used to perform immunolocalization studies. Fig. 6 shows that both MARK and MIK accumulate in 15-DAP immature embryos. MARK strongly accumulates in the provascular tissues of the coleoptile and in the pericycle of the radicle, which are the tissues that are most active in differentiation and proliferation in 15-DAP immature embryos. MARK also accumulates in the scutellum cells as a gradient from outside to inside, coinciding with the proliferation and differentiation activity of this organ at this stage of development. Although the differences in MIK accumulation are less pronounced, it also accumulates in the already mentioned proliferating and differentiating tissues of the immature embryos. Within the cell, MARK displays a membrane-associated pattern of accumulation, whereas most MIK seems to accumulate in the cytoplasm of the cells. MARK and MIK are thus expressed with a coincident pattern of expression during embryogenesis and are probably restricted to developing tissues.Fig. 6Immunolocalization of MARK and MIK. Transversal sections of 15-DAP immature embryos at the level of the radicle (top panels) or the coleoptile (middle and bottom panels) incubated with α-MARK (left), α-MIK (middle), or preimmune (right) sera. The scutellum (sc), pericycle (p), and provascular (vs) tissues are shown by white arrows. Bottom panels show the coleoptile sections (middle panel) at higher magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MARK Interacts with MIK in Vivo and Induces Its Kinase Activity—To determine whether MARK and MIK interact in vivo and are components of high molecular weight complexes, we fractionated total protein extracts from 15-DAP maize immature embryos by gel filtration. MARK and MIK co-fractionate on a Superose 6 gel filtration column with identical peaks at ∼600 kDa (fraction 18) suggesting that they form stable complexes in vivo (Fig. 7). We could not co-immunoprecipitate both proteins from peak fractions probably because the antibodies used were raised against the interacting domains of both proteins and were competing with the proteins for interaction. We thus tested whether MARK and MIK interact in vivo in COS-7 cells transfected with an HA-ID-MARK construct and a FLAG-MIK construct. An antibody against HA efficiently immunoprecipitated ID-MARK, and MIK was also detected in co-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with this antibody (Fig. 8A), showing that MIK interacts with ID-MARK in vivo.Fig. 8Activation of MIK activity by interaction MARK-MIK in vivo.A, MARK and MIK interact in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with clones corresponding to the indicated proteins. 1/3 of the anti-HA immunoprecipitates, 1/10 of the extracts, and 1/10 of the not bound fraction were subjected to immunoblot with antibodies against MARK (upper panel) and MIK (lower panel). B, activation of MIK phosphorylation activity. COS-7 cells were transfected with clones corresponding to the indicated proteins. Anti-HA (2nd to 4th tracks) or anti-FLAG (1st track) immunoprecipitates (IP) were assayed for phosphorylation activity on MBP. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (lower panel). The amount of MIK and MARK proteins in the immunocomplexes was determined by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-MARK (middle panel) and anti-MIK (upper panel) antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have also used the COS-7 cell expression system to analyze MIK phosphorylation activity. Constructs containing MIK- and MARK-tagged proteins were transfected into COS-7 cells alone or in combination, and MIK-tagged or MARK-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and used for phosphorylation assays. FLAG-ID-MARK does not auto-phosphorylate or trans-phosphorylate MBP (Fig. 8B), confirming that ID-MARK is a kinase-dead domain. HA-MIK weakly phosphorylated MBP in the conditions tested (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, the co-expression of FLAG-ID-MARK induced a 7-fold increase of HA-MIK phosphorylation activity, whereas the co-expression of a control GFP construct had no effect (Fig. 8B). We report the cloning and characterization of two new plant genes coding for an atypical PRK and a GCK-like MAP kinase that could participate in signal transduction in maize. MARK is an atypical PRK with amino acid substitutions in its kinase-like domain that are sufficient to render inactive other kinases. Our results show that, indeed, the intracellular domain of MARK does not phosphorylate in vitro. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to replace the atypical residues present in subdomains III, VIb, and VII of MARK by the consensus residues, but the modified MARK protein did not auto- or trans-phosphorylate (not shown). This suggests that other modifications of amino acids important for kinase activity have occurred during MARK evolution. This is also the case of the mammalian ErbB3 atypical RPK, which does not phosphorylate even after the recognizable atypical residues have been modified (26Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Our results thus indicate that MARK is a kinase-dead PRK that signals by kinase-independent mechanisms. Although only one plant protein with the sequence characteristics of an atypical PRK has been described to date, Arabidopsis TMKL1 protein (27Valon C. Smalle J. Goodman H.M. Giraudat J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the data bases contain a large number of Arabidopsis and rice sequences with these characteristics (see Fig. 3B), thus suggesting that phosphorylation-independent mechanisms, mediated by atypical PRKs, are important in signal transduction in plants, as they have been shown to be in animal systems. In the last few years an increasing number of PRKs have been described in plants. Although they are assumed to transduce signals by mechanisms similar to their animal counterparts (28Tichtinsky G. Vanoosthuyse V. Cock J.M. Gaude T. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 231-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), only a handful of putative downstream signaling proteins interacting with them have been described (29Stone J.M.

In other cases, like flagellin receptor FLS2, for which a complete MAP kinase cascade acting downstream the receptor has been characterized (37Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chium W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar), it is still unknown whether the receptor interacts directly with the MAP kinase cassette or whether an unknown protein connects the two signaling modules. MAPK cascades are usually connected to membrane receptors through G proteins such as Raf, heterotrimeric complexes, or MAP4K (15Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 17Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Only one small G protein has been shown to interact with a membrane receptor in plants (32Trotochaud A.E. Hao T. Wu G. Yang Z. Clark S.E. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) although its capacity to activate MAP signaling cascades has not been demonstrated. On the other hand, although more than 10 genes in Arabidopsis probably code for MAPKKKK (38Jonak C. Okresz L. Bogre L. Hirt H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), and they are thus assumed to be relatively abundant in plants, nothing is known of their possible participation in signaling. For this reason, the interaction shown here between MARK and MIK, an atypical PRK and an MAP4K, resulting in the activation of the latter, is particularly relevant. It is interesting to note that MARK and MIK are expressed in developing tissues, and different components of the MAP kinase cassettes are expressed in proliferating tissues in plants (38Jonak C. Okresz L. Bogre L. Hirt H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In particular, NPK1, a tobacco MAP3K, accumulates in growing tissues, cotyledons, vascular systems, and the meristems of the plant (39Nakashima M. Hirano K. Nakashima S. Banno H. Nishihama R. Machida Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) where MARK and MIK are also expressed. Recently, it has been demonstrated that NPK1 controls the expansion of the cell plate during cytokinesis in tobacco (40Nishihama R. Ishikawa M. Araki S. Soyano T. Asada T. Machida Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), activating a complete set of MAP kinases (reviewed in Ref. 38Jonak C. Okresz L. Bogre L. Hirt H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We are at present searching for proteins that could interact with MIK in order to identify its possible downstream signaling partners. MAP kinases, and in particular GCK-related kinases, usually contain a regulatory domain that inhibits their kinase activity (41Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 42Eichinger L. Bahler M. Dietz M. Eckerskorn C. Schleicher M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28185-28189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Full activation of GCKs requires the release of this auto-inhibition, which can be accomplished by different mechanisms including the cleavage of the regulatory domain by caspases (44Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Gotoh Y. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14909-14915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 45Glantschnig H. Rodan G.A. Reszka A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42987-42996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), or by conformational changes induced by protein-protein interactions through the regulatory domain (43Guertin D.A. McCollum D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28185-28189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our results show that MIK has a low kinase activity when expressed in COS-7 cells and that the co-expression of ID-MARK greatly increases this activity. As ID-MARK specifically interacts with the C-terminal regulatory domain of MIK, we propose that MARK-MIK interaction results in the release of a possible autoinhibition of MIK kinase activity by this regulatory domain. In summary, our results suggest a new mechanism by which atypical RPKs can transduce signals and could constitute the first step of a still unknown signaling cascade associated with developmental processes in plants.

https://openalex.org/W2068936080,"RNase A oligomerizes via the three-dimensional domain-swapping mechanism to form a variety of oligomers, including two dimers. One, called the N-dimer, forms by swapping of the N termini of the protein; the other, called the C-dimer, forms by swapping of the C termini. RNase B is identical in protein sequence and conformation to RNase A, but its Asn34 bears an oligosaccharide chain that might affect oligomerization. The ability of RNase B to oligomerize under two sets of conditions has been examined. The amount of oligomers formed via lyophilization was somewhat lower for RNase B than RNase A, and RNase B oligomerized more rapidly in 40% ethanol solution at high temperature than RNase A. The ratio of the N-dimer to C-dimer formed increased with the size of the carbohydrate chain under both sets of conditions. These results suggest that the oligosaccharide chain either favors productive collisions or stabilizes the oligomers, especially the N-dimer. Endoglycosidase H treatment of RNase B partially restored RNase A-like oligomerization. Derivatives of RNase A conjugated at the amine groups to polyethylene glycol chains showed a greatly reduced capacity for oligomerization, suggesting that oligomerization can be impeded sterically. Commercial preparations of RNase B eluted as two main peaks by cation exchange chromatography. Using chromatography, mass spectroscopy, and two-dimensional NMR, the major peak was identified as RNase B selectively deamidated at Asn67. This deamidated protein showed a >4 °C drop in thermal stability, disruption of the native structure of residues 67–69, and a decreased ability to oligomerize compared with unmodified RNase B.

In their classic work, Crestfield et al. (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; : 217-222PubMed Google Scholar) discovered and characterized the ability of bovine ribonuclease A to dimerize by exchanging segments of secondary structure when lyophilized from 50% acetic acid. Since then, many proteins have been found to form oligomers by the same mechanism, known as three-dimensional domain swapping (Ref. 2Bennet M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1444-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar; see Ref. 3Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar for an excellent recent review). This process of oligomerization is being studied as a mechanism for the formation of oligomeric proteins by evolution. Moreover, it has been proposed that three-dimensional domain swapping might lead to inappropriate formation of large aggregates of cross-β-structure, known as amyloid, which have been linked to >23 diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion-induced diseases (4Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by recent findings that the amyloidogenic protein cystatin C (5Janowski R. Kozak M. Jankowska E. Grzonka Z. Grubb A. Abrahamson A. Jaskolski M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and the human prion protein (6Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) dimerize via three-dimensional domain swapping between monomers.Modern studies on the oligomerization of bovine RNase A show that this normally monomeric protein can form a variety of dimers, trimers, and larger oligomers (7Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) via three-dimensional domain swapping of the N-terminal α-helix, the C-terminal β-strand, or both (8Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct.

Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The dimers, trimers, and tetramers each form at least two conformational isomers, which can be separated by cation exchange chromatography as a less basic and a more basic oligomer (7Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The less basic dimer, formed by swapping of the N termini of the protein, and the more basic dimer, formed by swapping of the C termini, were named N-dimer and C-dimer, respectively (12Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of RNase A also occurs in solution at high substrate concentrations (13Marzotto A. Galzigna L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or at high temperature (14Park C. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and variation of solution and environmental conditions, including temperature, affects the size and amount of oligomer formed (12Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease is also produced in vivo in a glycosylated version, ribonuclease B, which bears a single oligosaccharide chain linked to Asn34. The sugar chain cloaks charged residues on the surface of RNase B, causing it to elute before RNase A on cation exchange columns (15Plummer T.H.J. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1396-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide chain of RNase B consists of a common trunk of two GlcNAc residues and five to nine mannose residues, whose branch pattern has been determined (16Fu D. Chen L. O'Neill R.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 261: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 17Kawasaki N. Ohta M. Hyuga S. Hashimoto O. Hayakawa T. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Species with different sized oligosaccharide chains can be separated by affinity chromatography (18González L. Bruix M. Díaz-Mauriño T. Feizi T. Rico M. Solís D. Jiménez-Barbero J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Bovine RNases A and B share identical amino acid compositions (15Plummer T.H.J. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1396-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sequences, including a single Asn67-Gly68 residue pair that was shown to undergo selective deamidation in RNase A (19Di Donato A. Ciardiello M.A. de Nigris M. Piccoli R. Mazzarella L. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4745-4751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein moieties of RNases A and B have essentially identical structures as revealed by crystallography (20Williams R.L. Green S.M. McPherson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16020-16031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by NMR, both for shorter (21Joao H.C. Scragg I.G. Dwek R.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and longer (22Solís D. Bruix M. González L. Díaz-Mauriño T. Rico M. Jiménez-Barbero J. Feizi T. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) glycoforms. The global conformational stability of RNase B, as measured by thermal denaturation, is slightly higher than that of RNase A (23Arnold U. Ulbrich-Hofmann R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2166-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hydrogen exchange measurements reveal that NH groups forming main chain hydrogen bonds show an increased protection of 1.1–2-fold in RNase B versus RNase A (24Joao J. Dwek R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 21: 239-244Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), consistent with a slight increase in conformational stability. NMR evidence (nuclear Overhauser effect) and molecular dynamics calculations also reveal that the carbohydrate chain is flexible and that its conformation is not restricted by the protein moiety, with the exception of the somewhat rigid GlcNAc residue attached directly to Asn34 (18González L. Bruix M. Díaz-Mauriño T. Feizi T. Rico M. Solís D. Jiménez-Barbero J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Because the presence of carbohydrate moieties reduces or prevents aggregation or precipitation for several glycoproteins (25Wang C. Eufemi M. Turano C. Giartosio A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7299-7307Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 26Narhi L.O. Arakawa T. Aoki K. Wen J. Elliott S. Boone T. Cheetham J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and because Asn34 and its carbohydrate chain in RNase B are close to the N-terminal α-helix participating in the three-dimensional domain-swapping oligomerization of RNase A, it is possible that the sugar chain attached to this residue sterically hinders the swapping of this helix and reduces oligomerization. However, a single sugar residue in a human prion protein domain has been found not only to inhibit amyloidogenesis, but also to accelerate it, depending on its position (27Chen P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12633-12638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). One key objective of this work is to test the ability of RNase B to form domain-swapped oligomers. Both the lyophilization (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; : 217-222PubMed Google Scholar) and aqueous ethanol solution (12Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) protocols were tested using the conditions that produce the highest yields of RNase A oligomers. In the case of the ethanol solution protocol, two different temperatures, 60 and 70 °C, were studied to test whether the different thermal stabilities of RNases A and B affect their oligomerization. Two different fractions of RNase B containing small or large carbohydrate chains were examined. At the start of this work, commercial RNase B was discovered to elute as two main peaks by cation exchange chromatography. Identifying the cause of these two peaks and the characterization of its effect on oligomerization are other key objectives of this work.Matousek et al. (28Matousek J. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Skvor J. J. Controlled Release. 2002; 82: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have recently shown that RNase A becomes a potent cytotoxin when coupled at amine groups to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1The abbreviations used are: PEGpolyethylene glycolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopyFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: PEGpolyethylene glycolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopyFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. 5000. This cytotoxicity might be due to the PEG chains acting to impede the approach of the cytoplasmic ribonuclease inhibitor. We hypothesize that such steric hindrance might also block the oligomerization of RNase molecules. To check this possibility, multiple PEG (Mr = 5000) groups were coupled to RNase A lysine residues, and the ability of this material to oligomerize was measured. Finally, as a positive control, we quantified the ability of RNase B to aggregate after most of its carbohydrate chain had been cleaved off with endoglycosidase H.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Deionized, double-distilled water was used for all experiments. All reagents and salts were the highest grade of purity commercially available. RNase B (catalog no. R-7884, lot 060K7650) and RNase A (type XIIA, catalog no. R-5500, lot 104H7110) were obtained from Sigma. Some experiments were repeated using other RNase B samples from Sigma (catalog no. R-5875, lot 115H7041) or highly (catalog no. 8005E, lot 101084) or moderately (catalog no. 104907, lot 63148) active preparations from ICN. Sample purity was checked by cation exchange chromatography. Endoglycosidase H (recombinant from Streptomyces plicatus) was from Sigma (catalog no. A-0810, lot 122K1157). RNase B was either used without further treatment or separated into fractions with short (two GlcNAc + five to six mannose residues) or long (two GlcNAc + seven to nine mannose residues) oligosaccharide chains by affinity chromatography using concanavalin A-Sepharose resin (Sigma) and eluted using α-d-methoxyglucose (Sigma) as previously described (18González L. Bruix M. Díaz-Mauriño T. Feizi T. Rico M. Solís D. Jiménez-Barbero J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The purified protein was then dialyzed and lyophilized. The number of mannose groups in these fractions was measured using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay (29Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39918) Google Scholar) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy performed in the Instituto de Química-Física Mass Spectroscopy Facility. Amino acid analysis was carried out in triplicate following acid hydrolysis of the amide bonds on an EZCHROM amino acid analyzer at the Protein Chemistry Facility of the Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (Madrid, Spain).Assays for Enzymatic Activity—Samples of RNase B fractions separated by affinity or ion exchange chromatography were assayed for ribonuclease activity on single-stranded bakers' yeast RNA using the protocol of Kunitz (30Kunitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on double-stranded poly(A)·poly(U) following the procedure of Libonati and Sorrentino (31Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All assays were conducted at 25 °C.Thermal Denaturation—Thermal unfolding transitions were monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy at 219 nm in a 0.1-cm cell using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. The temperature range followed was 20–80 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The slit width was 1.0 nm. The protein concentration was 0.7–1.2 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm KCl. Each experiment was repeated once. Data analyses were carried out applying the two-state approximation as described (32Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton, T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1989: 311-330Google Scholar).Deamidation Test—The susceptibility of RNases A and B to deamidation was tested by incubating samples (1–2 mg/ml) at 37 °C in 1% ammonium bicarbonate buffer at pH 8.2 as described (19Di Donato A. Ciardiello M.A. de Nigris M. Piccoli R. Mazzarella L. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4745-4751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at pH 9.2. Aliquots were taken over the course of 3 weeks and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography. The observed deamidation rates were determined by fitting to a first-order kinetic model using a least-squares algorithm.NMR Spectroscopy—Two-dimensional 1H NOESY spectra (33Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) were recorded at 298 K and pH 4.0 in 90% H2O and 10% D2O using a mixing time of 100 ms on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe for enhanced sensitivity. Sample concentration was ∼350 μm. The spectra were transformed, processed, and analyzed using UXIN-NMR software from Bruker.Preparation of Deglycosylated RNase B—RNase B was deglycosylated by incubation with endoglycosidase H at 37 °C and pH 5.5 in 150 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate. Two reactions were carried out following the protocol of Kawasaki et al. (17Kawasaki N. Ohta M. Hyuga S. Hashimoto O. Hayakawa T. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), except that higher ratios of endoglycosidase H to RNase B substrate (40 milliunits of endoglycosidase H/3 mg of RNase B and 80 milliunits of endoglycosidase H/8 mg of RNase B) and longer reaction times (46 and 144 h) were used here. Reactions were stopped by adding 800 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) and cooling on ice.PEG-conjugated RNase A—RNase A was conjugated at its amine groups by reaction with succinimidyl propionate-PEG 5000 (catalog no. 2M4M0H01, lot P5-10C-02, Nektar Corp.). This reactive reagent attaches chains of PEG (Mr = 5000) to Lys amine groups and the terminal amine group. The reaction was carried out in 0.10 m sodium phosphate buffer under N2 for 40 min on ice, after which the remaining reactants were removed by ultrafiltration using a Millipore Centriprep YM-10 filter. The products were then purified by gel filtration and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. By varying the pH and ratio of the reagent/protein amine groups, it was possible to prepare RNase A carrying one or two (1:1 ratio, pH 7.5) or several (5:1 ratio, pH 9.0) PEG chains.Preparation and Analysis of Aggregates—Ribonuclease samples were subjected to conditions that promote efficient oligomerization, viz. lyophilization from 40% acetic acid (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; : 217-222PubMed Google Scholar) or incubation in 40% ethanol at 60 or 70 °C (12Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The amount and identity of the aggregates formed were measured in Verona with an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column equilibrated with 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) or by ion exchange chromatography using a Source 15S HR10/10 column eluted with a 90–200 or 40–200 mm sodium phosphate gradient at pH 6.7 (RNase A) or 6.4 (RNase B), respectively. These experiments were repeated independently in Madrid using equivalent columns and procedures with an Amersham Biosciences ÄKTA FPLC system.RESULTSCommercial RNase B Elutes as Two Major Peaks by Cation Exchange Chromatography—At the start of this investigation, commercial RNase B (Sigma lot 060K7650) was observed to elute as two major peaks when subjected to cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 1). These two peaks (called Peaks X and Y) eluted at ∼102 and 120 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), respectively. These same two peaks also appeared in a different sample of Sigma RNase B (lot 115H7041), although their relative amounts were inverted relative to those in lot 060K7650. For RNase B from ICN (catalog no. 8005E), Peak X was found to be only slightly larger than Peak Y (data not shown). We hypothesized that the difference that causes RNase B to elute as two separate peaks might involve the amino acid composition, the oligosaccharide composition or conformation, a chemical alteration, or some combination of these factors. To investigate the nature of these two peaks, they were first separated by cation exchange chromatography and subjected to amino acid analysis. As shown in Table I, Peaks X and Y have very similar if not identical amino acid compositions, although acid hydrolysis of the polypeptide chain also converted Asn and Gln to Asp and Glu, respectively. Some residues such as cystine and Ile were found to be in slightly lower amounts compared with the amino acid composition expected from the sequence. This is likely due to destruction of cystine and the resistance of Ile peptide bonds to hydrolysis, as observed previously for RNase B (15Plummer T.H.J. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Screening of surface charges by the oligosaccharide chain of RNase B causes it to elute off cation exchange columns before RNase A (15Plummer T.H.J. Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1396-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the small peak eluting at ∼142 mm sodium phosphate in Fig. 1 corresponds to RNase A. Because the number of mannose residues present in the oligosaccharide chain of RNase B ranges from five to nine, it is reasonable that the molecules with longer sugar chains might have more surface charges covered and elute before molecules with shorter sugar chains, thus explaining the appearance of Peaks X and Y. However, no significant difference in the ratio of moles of mannose residues to moles of protein for Peaks X and Y was found using the phenol-sulfuric acid assay (data not shown). Moreover, Peaks X and Y, fractionated and desalted, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy, and both showed several peaks (Fig. 2, A and B); their masses correspond, within the experimental uncertainty of ±5 Da, to those expected for RNase B molecules with five, six, seven, eight, and nine mannose residues (Table II). Interestingly, the fractions from both the right limbs (X3 and Y3) (Fig. 1) of Peaks X and Y were depleted in the amount of long chain RNase B molecules present. This suggests that RNase B molecules carrying oligosaccharide chains with seven, eight, or nine mannose residues bound slightly less well to the cation exchange resin and eluted just before the short chain RNase B molecules in both Peaks X and Y. The right limbs of Peaks X and Y (X3 and Y3) show a distinct gel filtration elution profile, viz. the Peak X shoulder consistently eluted 0.3 ml before the Peak Y shoulder. This behavior may be due to a conformational difference in the surface loop containing residues 67–69 (see below) or, less probably, to the very small amount of RNase A present in this shoulder as detected by mass spectroscopy.Fig. 2MALDI-TOF mass spectra of RNase B Peak X (A) and Peak Y (B) separated by cation exchange chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIMALDI-TOF mass spectra of RNase B Peaks X and YRNase ARNase BFive mannosesSix mannosesSeven mannosesEight mannosesNine mannosesTheoryaTheory was calculated based on the masses of RNase A, mannose (180.1 Da), and N-acetylglucose (221.1 Da), subtracting the mass of the water (18.02 Da) released upon forming the glycoside bond and adding 1 Da to account for the H+ ion acquired by protein molecules in the MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy method.13,68114,89815,06015,22215,38415,546Pre-XbPre-X is a small peak eluting before Peak X.

Open table in a new tab Affinity Chromatography—RNase B molecules with different sized sugar chains can be fractionated by affinity chromatography. Three peaks (peaks I–III) were separated as shown in a typical chromatogram (Fig. 3), with peak I eluting without binding to the column. Similar peaks were previously observed and identified as RNase A (peak I); RNase B with five or six mannose residues (peak II); and RNase B with seven, eight, or nine mannose residues (peak III) (18González L.

Quantification of the amount of sugar residues by the phenol-sulfuric acid assay revealed that peak II contains 5.6 ± 1.1 mol of mannose/mol of protein and that peak III contains 8.7 ± 1.0 mol of mannose/mol of protein. Analysis of the composition of these fractions by mass spectroscopy revealed that five and six mannose-containing oligosaccharide chains are predominant in peak II, whereas peak III contains mostly oligosaccharide chains with eight mannoses, with some chains of seven or nine mannoses also being present (Fig. 4, A and B; and Table III). Mass spectroscopy also showed that the oligosaccharide compositions of the left and right halves of peak II appear to be similar to each other and that both halves of peak III have a similar content of sugars. It is noteworthy that, when subjected to cation exchange chromatography, peak II eluted as two peaks (Peaks X and Y), as did peak III (data not shown).Fig. 3Separation of RNase B glycoforms by affinity chromatography.Left y axis and ––, A280 nm; right y axis and – – –, concentration of α-d-methoxyglucose (α-D Glu-OMe).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4MALDI-TOF mass spectra of RNase B fractions II (A) and III (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIIMALDI-TOF mass spectra of RNase B fractionated by affinity chromatographyRNase ARNase BFive mannoseSix mannoseSeven mannoseEight mannoseNine mannoseTheoryaCalculated based on the masses of RNase A, mannose (180.1 Da), and N-acetylglucosamine (221.1 Da) subtracting the mass of the water (18.02 Da) released upon forming the glycoside bond and adding 1 Da to account for the H+ ion acquired by protein molecules in the MALDI-TOF method.13,68114,89815,06015,22215,38415,546IIabIIa, the left half of peak II; IIb, the right half of peak II; IIIa, the left half of peak III; IIIb, the right half of peak III (as shown in Fig. 4).NO14,899 (100)15,061 (76)15,220 (12)NONOIIbNO14,898 (100)15,061 (69)15,223 (16)NONOIIIaNO14,900 (2)15,062 (5)15,225 (27)15,387 (100)15,550 (40)IIIbNO14,902 (6)15,064 (8)15,227 (44)15,390 (100)15,552 (68)a Calculated based on the masses of RNase A, mannose (180.1 Da), and N-acetylglucosamine (221.1 Da) subtracting the mass of the water (18.02 Da) released upon forming the glycoside bond and adding 1 Da to account for the H+ ion acquired by protein m"

The sequence surrounding Leu394 is similar in all known carboxylases, suggesting that the region is functionally important. To test this hypothesis we made the following mutant enzymes: W390A, Y395A, S398A, W399A, and H404A. We purified the enzymes and corrected the activity measurements for active enzyme concentration. Carboxylases W390A, S398A, and H404A had activities similar to that of wild type; however, Y395A and W399A had lower activities than did wild type. In the following descriptions we include our previously reported results for L394R. Kinetic studies with the substrate FLEEL, revealed Km values of 0.5 (wild type), 6.5 (L394R), 15 (Y395A), and 24 (W399A) mm. The kcat values relative to wild type were 51% (L394R), 1% (Y395A), and 2% (W399A). The kcat/Km values were 24-fold (L394R) and >2000-fold lower for Y395A and W399A than for wild-type carboxylase. Inhibition of FLEEL carboxylation by the competitive inhibitor, Boc-mEEV, gave Ki values of 0.013 (wild type), 1.4 (L394R), 2.1 (Y395A), and >5 (W399A) mm. The Y395A propeptide affinity was similar to that of wild type, but those of L394R and W399A were 16–22-fold less than that of wild type. Results of kinetic studies with a propeptide-containing substrate were consistent with results of propeptide binding and FLEEL kinetics. Although propeptide and vitamin K binding in some mutants were affected, our data provide compelling evidence that glutamate recognition is the primary function of the conserved region around Leu394.

In addition to the glutamate substrate, γ-carboxylation requires carbon dioxide, oxygen, and KH2, the reduced form of vitamin K as co-substrates (6Esmon C.T. Sadowski J.A. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4744-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Precursors of the physiological substrates of carboxylase contain a propeptide sequence, which anchors the substrate to the enzyme while multiple Glu residues are carboxylated. The conversion of glutamic acid to Gla is coupled with the oxygenation of KH2 to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide and has been referred to as vitamin K epoxidase activity (7Wallin R. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem.

Individuals with either mutation have bleeding disorders, due to reduced activities of all clotting factors, which are presumably only partially carboxylated, since they have impaired calcium binding properties (11Brenner B.

In a subsequent characterization of recombinant L394R carboxylase we showed that the presumed undercarboxylation is primarily due to a defect in glutamate-substrate binding (12Mutucumarana V.P.

In this study, we have expressed and examined the properties of mutants of some residues in this highly conserved region of carboxylase. Our results show that the primary defect in Y395A, W399A, and L394R is impaired binding of the glutamate substrate. In addition, residues Leu394 and Trp399 appear to be involved in linkage between the glutamate binding active site and the propeptide binding site of carboxylase.

Determination of Active Enzyme Concentrations of Wild-type and Mutant Carboxylases—Active enzyme concentrations of the wild-type and mutant carboxylases were determined as described before by titrating the protein sample with fluorescent-labeled consensus propeptide (23Presnell S.R. Tripathy A. Lentz B.R. Jin D.Y. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11723-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). FLEEL Carboxylation Studies—Carboxylase activities of the wild-type, W390A, L394R, Y395A, S398A, W399A, and H404A enzymes were initially determined by measuring 14CO2 incorporation into the peptide substrate FLEEL as described before (17Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 20 °C in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm FLEEL, 4–8 μm ProFIX18, 0.16% phosphatidylcholine, 0.16% CHAPS, 222 μm KH2 and 1.4 mm NaH14CO3 (10 μCi). Subsequent kinetic studies of FLEEL carboxylation were performed with the wild type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A enzymes by measuring 14CO2 incorporation at varying concentrations of FLEEL. KH2 was used at 222 μm except in W399A reactions, which contained 28 μm KH2 for reasons described below. In FLEEL carboxylation reactions, the free factor IX propeptide was also included: 5 μm in wild type and L394R reactions, and 11 μm and 28 μm in Y395A and W399A reactions, respectively. Reactions were performed for 30 min with the wild-type and L394R enzymes. Due to their low activities, the reaction times were extended to 1 h with the Y395A and W399A enzymes. Inhibition of FLEEL Carboxylation by Boc-mEEV—The tripeptide Boc-mEEV, a substrate analog in which the amino-terminal glutamic acid is modified to (2S,4S)-4-methylglutamic acid, is a strong competitive inhibitor of wild-type carboxylase for FLEEL carboxylation (18Soute B.A. Acher F.

We examined the effect of Boc-mEEV on the inhibition of FLEEL carboxylation, for the wild-type and L394R, Y395A, and W399A mutant enzymes. FLEEL concentrations of 0.8, 10, 12, and 16 mm were used in the wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A reactions, respectively. These studies were performed in the presence of the factor IX propeptide. Data were analyzed using a competitive inhibition model. Kinetic Studies of FIXproGla Carboxylations—Reactions were performed at 20 °C in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.16% phosphatidylcholine, 0.16% CHAPS, 1.4 mm NaH14CO3 (10 μCi), and varying concentrations of FIXproGla. KH2 was used at 222 μm in wild-type, L394R, and Y395A reactions, while 28 μm KH2 was used in W399A carboxylations. The reactions were performed for 1 h. Effect of Free ProFIX19 Concentration on FLEEL Carboxylation Activity—In these studies, the effect of varying concentrations of ProFIX19 on carboxylation of FLEEL was measured. The reactions were carried out as described above for FLEEL carboxylation, except that the FLEEL concentration was kept constant and the propeptide concentration was varied. FLEEL concentrations of 1, 12, 24, and 32 mm were used in wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A reactions, respectively. Inhibition of FIXproGla Carboxylation by Free Propeptide—The free propeptide of vitamin K-dependent proteins is a competitive inhibitor for carboxylation of propeptide-linked substrates (22Stanley T.B.

We examined the effect of ProFIX19 on the carboxylation of FIXproGla for wild-type, L394R, and Y395A enzymes. We could not do this experiment with W399A because of its low activity and high Km for FIXproGla. We used 0.5 μm FIXproGla in wild-type and Y395A reactions and 4 μm in L394R reactions. Data were analyzed using a competitive inhibition model. Concentration Dependence of Vitamin K Hydroquinone on Carboxylation—The effect of varying concentrations of KH2 on FIXproGla carboxylation for wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A was examined. The reactions were performed at fixed FIXproGla concentrations of 1.2 μm in wild-type and Y395A reactions, and at 10 and 20 μm in L394R and W399A reactions, respectively. The reactions were performed for 30 min with wild type and L394R and for 1 h with Y395A and W399A mutants, because of their low activities. Vitamin K Epoxidase Activity Assay—Vitamin K epoxide formation by wild-type, L394R, and Y395A enzymes during their FLEEL carboxylation reactions was measured. FLEEL carboxylations in the presence of free propeptide were performed as described above, except that unlabeled NaHCO3 was used. FLEEL concentrations of 1, 12, and 28 mm were used in the wild-type, L394R, and Y395A reactions, respectively. Vitamin K epoxide formation was quantified as described (26Thijssen H.H. Janssen C.A. Drittij-Reijnders M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Carboxylation of FLEEL—We created 6 mutations within the highly conserved region of the carboxylase molecule. Of these, three had activity similar to that of wild type: the activities were 774 ± 39 pmol of 14CO2/h/pmol enzyme for WT, 590 ± 14 for W390A, 699 ± 15 for S398A and 822 ± 21 for H404A. In contrast, the activities of L394R, Y395A, and W399A were dramatically reduced and were too low to be measured except in the presence of propeptide; therefore, we did all further characterizations at saturating propeptide concentrations. The Km values of L394R, Y395A, and W399A for FLEEL were significantly higher, 12-, 27-, and 45-fold than wild type (Table I). Furthermore, their kcat values were reduced (Table I). The kcat values of Y395A and W399A, were only 1–2% of wild type. The catalytic efficiencies, kcat/Km, were 24-fold lower for L394R and >2000-fold lower for Y395A and W399A than WT (Table I). Substrate inhibition with FLEEL has been widely observed and occurs at about 9 mm with the wild-type enzyme. We observed substrate inhibition at >18 mm for L394R (12Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W.

However, consistent with their lower affinity for FLEEL, neither Y395A nor W399A exhibited substrate inhibition up to FLEEL concentrations of 30 and 50 mm, respectively.Table IComparison of the kinetic parameters of wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A carboxylases for FLEELEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmmmh-1h-1 mm-1WT0.54 ± 0.10763 ± 1391413L394R6.49 ± 0.72392 ± 2660Y395A14.8 ± 3.66.8 ± 0.40.46W399A24.3 ± 0.811.7 ± 0.20.48 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of FLEEL Carboxylation by Boc-mEEV—The tripeptide Boc-mEEV was previously shown to be an active site-specific, competitive inhibitor of FLEEL carboxylation (18Soute B.A. Acher F.

The Ki of Boc-mEEV for wild-type carboxylase was 0.013 ± 0.002 mm, in the range reported in previous studies. However, Boc-mEEV is a significantly weaker inhibitor for FLEEL carboxylation for L394R, Y395A, and W399A (Fig. 2); Ki values of 1.4 ± 0.2 mm and 2.1 ± 0.3 mm were determined for L394R and Y395A, respectively, while we could not determine the Ki for W399A, but it was >5 mm. Carboxylation of FIXproGla—The Km of substrates with a propeptide is 1000-fold less than substrates lacking the propeptide (17Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol.

FIXproGla, a peptide substrate based on the Gla domain of human factor IX covalently-linked to its propeptide, appears to mimic a physiological substrate of vitamin K-dependent carboxylase (17Wu S.M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While the kcat of Y395A for FIXproGla is less than 10% of that of wild-type, its Km is similar to that of the wild type (Table II). On the other hand, L394R and W399A both have higher Km values for FIXproGla than does wild type; 9-fold and 24-fold respectively. The kcat values for FIXproGla carboxylation by Y395A and W399A were only 7 and 11%, respectively, of that of wild type. In contrast, the kcat for L394R is 2.7-fold higher than that for wild type, which we discussed before (12Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Solera J. Brenner B. Azerad R. Wu S.M.

Compared with wild type, the kcat/Km values for FIXproGla carboxylation are lower in the mutants, the most prominent effect observed in W399A (Table II).Table IIComparison of the kinetic parameters of wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A carboxylases for FIXproGlaEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmμmh-1h-1 mm-1WT0.23 ± 0.0381 ± 4352,174L394R2.08 ± 0.23220 ± 45105,769Y395A0.20 ± 0.046.0 ± 1.230,000W399A5.53 ± 0.578.8 ± 1.41,591 Open table in a new tab Affinity of Wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A Carboxylases for ProFIX19 —The free propeptides of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins enhance the rate of carboxylation of small glutamate peptide substrates (29Knobloch J.E.

In the presence of saturating propeptide, the rate of carboxylation by wild-type enzyme increases 5–6-fold. Because of their low activity in the absence of propeptide, it was difficult to estimate the fold increase with propeptide for Y395A, W399A, and L394R, but the increases were about 8-, 11-, and >100-fold, respectively. From the dependence of FLEEL carboxylation activity on propeptide concentration (Fig. 3, A and B), the apparent affinities (Kd) of wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A carboxylases for ProFIX19 were determined by assuming that the increase in activity is proportional to the occupancy of the propeptide binding site. The apparent Kd values of L394R, Y395A, and W399A were 17-, 2-, and 23-fold higher than that of wild type respectively (Table III).Table IIIRelative affinities of the factor IX propeptide for wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A carboxylasesEnzymeKdaDetermined from ProFIX19 stimulation of FLEEL carboxylation.KibDetermined from ProFIX19 inhibition of FIXproGla carboxylation.nmnmWT24 ± 263 ± 13L394R412 ± 33459 ± 28Y395A50 ± 646 ± 1W399A562 ± 25NDcND, not determined.a Determined from ProFIX19 stimulation of FLEEL carboxylation.b Determined from ProFIX19 inhibition of FIXproGla carboxylation.c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of FIXproGla Carboxylation by Free Propeptide—In a further comparison of the relative affinities of wild-type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A, we measured the Ki values of the factor IX propeptide as it competitively inhibits carboxylation of FIXproGla (22Stanley T.B.

Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 and Table III). The affinity of Y395A was similar to that of wild type. On the other hand, the L394R affinity was about 7-fold lower than that of wild type, and that of W399A could not be determined, due to its high Km for FIXproGla and its low activity for FIXproGla carboxylation. The relative affinities of wild type, L394R, and Y395A for the propeptide determined by this approach and the method examining the effect of propeptide on stimulation of FLEEL carboxylation discussed above were comparable (Table III). Effect of Vitamin K Hydroquinone on Carboxylation—We measured the dependence of FIXproGla carboxylation on KH2 concentration for wild type, L394R, Y395A, and W399A. Since L394R and W399A have higher Km values for FIXproGla than wild-type and Y395A (Table II), we used a higher FIXproGla concentration in L394R and W399A reactions. The Km values for KH2 were: 7.0 ± 1.2 μm, 32.8 ± 5.4 μm, and 38.5 ± 9.6 μm for WT, L394R, and Y395A enzymes, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). The Km of W399A for KH2 could not be determined accurately since higher KH2 concentrations inhibited its activity (Fig. 5B); the Km was estimated to be about 10 μm from the initial phase of the kinetic curve. Therefore, all kinetic studies of the W399A mutant were performed at 28 μm KH2. The reason for onset of inhibition at a lower KH2 concentration for W399A is not clear, but similar phenomena have been reported in some other carboxylase mutants (31Sugiura I. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rate of carboxylation measured at 28 μm KH2 for W399A is about 70% of the Vmax predicted from extrapolating the initial non-inhibitory phase of the kinetic curve. Vitamin K Epoxide Formation—Rates of vitamin K epoxide (KO) formation were measured as 48.8 ± 1.5, 27.6 ± 0.4, and 9.8 ± 0.1 pmol of KO/min/pmol of enzyme for wild type, L394R, and Y395A. The amount of KO formed in W399A reactions was too low to be quantitated precisely, due to the low KH2 concentration (28 μm) used in W399A reactions (see above). As was observed with their reduced rates of carboxylation, L394R and Y395A show reduced rates of epoxide formation relative to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that these mutant carboxylase and epoxidase activities remain coupled (8Morris D.P. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8735-8742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wood G.M. Suttie J.W. J. Biol.

This mutation was found in the carboxylase from an individual with combined deficiencies of vitamin K-dependent proteins (9Brenner B. Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S.M. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J.

We established c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1)-null mouse embryonic stem cell lines by homologous recombination. The JSAP1-null embryonic stem cells were viable, however, exhibited hyperplasia of the ectoderm during embryoid body formation, and spontaneously differentiated into neurons more efficiently than did wild type. The expression of components of c-Jun N-terminal kinase cascades and a subset of marker mRNAs during early embryogenesis was altered in the JSAP1-null mutants. Retinoic acid dramatically increased the expression of JSAP1 and JNK3, which were co-precipitated with anti-JNK3 in the neuroectoderm of wild type but not JSAP1-null embryoid bodies. In the neurons differentiated from the wild type embryoid bodies, JSAP1 was localized in the soma, neurites, and growth cone-like structure of the neurites, and neurite outgrowth from the JSAP1-null embryoid bodies was apparently less efficient than from wild type. JSAP1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 were coexpressed in the embryonic ectoderm of E7.5 mouse embryo, whereas Wnt1 and Pax2 were coexpressed with JSAP1 at the midbrain-hindbrain junction in E12.5 mouse embryo, thus suggesting that JSAP1 is required for early embryonic neurogenesis."

The left E-box is a low affinity binding site for the MRFs, and mutating it decreases skeletal myocyte expression 2–5-fold (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Mutation of the left E-box has a similar effect (2–6-fold) in cultured neonatal myocardiocytes, but in these cells, mutation of the right E-box has variable effects, including a 6-fold decrease, no effect, and even a 3-fold increase in expression depending on the associated enhancer and promoter regions (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because MRFs are primarily restricted to skeletal muscle, the cell culture and nuclear factor binding results were consistent with high affinity MRF binding sites being important for high expression in skeletal muscle. It was thus surprising to discover that mutation of the high affinity right E-box site did not decrease reporter gene expression in the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice (18Donoviel D.B. Shield M.A. Buskin J.N. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We speculated that other E-boxes might compensate for the loss of the right E-box, and therefore tested a construct containing mutations of both enhancer E-boxes plus a conserved promoter E-box (18Donoviel D.B. Shield M.A. Buskin J.N. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Shield M.A. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The triply mutated construct exhibited expression similar to the wild-type construct in several fast-type muscles. However, expression in the distal tongue and heart was reduced approximately 100-fold, and the ratio of expression in slow muscle to fast muscle was reduced approximately 10-fold. We have now extended the transgenic analysis by examining three new mutant-E-box constructs in a variety of muscle types, and by comparing the expression of the wild-type and triple E-box mutant constructs during development. DNA Sequence Analysis—Sequence comparisons were performed using the Wisconsin Package version 10.0 (Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST programs (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). MCK-CAT Constructs—Test plasmid constructs include wild-type or mutated MCK promoter sequences from –1256 to +7 with respect to the transcription start site (GenBank™ accession no. AF188002) fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) structural gene, and the SV40 small t-intron and polyadenylation regions (21Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) in the pUC118 vector (22Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The three mutations used singly or in combination were created by standard oligomer-mediated mutagenesis, and the DNA regions with the mutations were sequenced before being excised and inserted into the appropriate plasmids. The MEF1 (right E-box) and left E-box mutations are those referred to as “mut 1” at these sites by Amacher et al. (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); the promoter E-box is the proximal mutation reported in the 1256[3E mut]MCKCAT construct, which also contains the MEF1 (right E-box) and left E-box mutations (19Shield M.A. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These mutated sequences are shown in Fig. 1above the corresponding locations. Cell Culture—Ventricular myocardiocytes were isolated from 2–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described by Iwaki et al. (23Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications as previously described (24Nguyen Q.-G.V. Buskin J.N. Himeda C.L. Fabre-Suver C. Hauschka S.D. Transgenic Res. 2003; 12: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These cultures contained >90% myocardiocytes as assessed by immunohistochemistry with the myosin-specific antibody MF-20. Mouse MM14 skeletal myoblasts were grown and induced to differentiate by fibroblast growth factor withdrawal as described (25Clegg C.H. Linkhart T.A. Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Transfections—Primary myocardiocytes or MM14 skeletal myoblasts were transfected with 8 μg of test plasmid and 2 μg of a reference plasmid (pUCSV2PAP), included to normalize for transfection efficiency, using a standard calcium phosphate technique (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Four hours later, cells were glycerol-shocked. Myocardiocytes were switched after glycerol shock to serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/M199 (4:1) supplemented with 6 μg/ml insulin and Fungizone). Cells were harvested 48 h after glycerol shock and analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and placental alkaline phosphatase (PAP) activities (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). MM14 cultures were switched to differentiation medium at the time of addition of DNA, and harvested 34 h later. CAT and PAP were assayed as described (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For each test construct, at least two plasmid preparations were used. Transgenic Mouse Analysis—Production of mice with the triple E-box mutation has previously been described (18Donoviel D.B. Shield M.A. Buskin J.N. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1649-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For additional constructs, MCK-reporter gene fragments for microinjection were produced by restriction enzyme excision, agarose gel electrophoresis separation, electroelution, and purification using a DEAE Elutip column (Schleicher & Schuell). Transgenic mice were produced by the University of Washington Transgenic Resource Program using eggs from C57BL/6J × C3H crosses. Founders or their offspring from matings with C57BL/6J strain mice were analyzed as indicated. Protein extracts were prepared (19Shield M.A. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and analyzed for protein by the Bradford assay (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard, and for CAT using [14C]acetyl-CoA as previously described (20Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). CAT standards were run to ensure that all sample values used were in the linear range of the assay, and CAT values were not used unless [14C]acetylchloramphenicol counts/min (cpm) were at least twice the background level. Cpm were converted to CAT activity, where 1 unit is defined as the amount that acetylates 1 μmol of chloramphenicol/min at 37 °C (27Shaw W.V. Brodsky R.F. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 28-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); CAT values are expressed as microunits/mg of protein. Values were used from both founder transgenic mice and their offspring with details indicated in figure legends. Developmental Analysis—Pregnant mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Embryos were staged according to Ref. 28Kaufman M. The Atlas of Mouse Development. Academic Press, Orlando1992Google Scholar, and tissues were dissected. To reduce contamination by other cell types, atria were removed from cardiac tissue, and skin, bone, and cartilage were removed from embryonic and fetal hindlimbs. Tongue muscle was obtained from the distal half of the tongue. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. For early embryos, two or three samples of the same type were pooled together for protein extraction. Newborn and adult mouse dissection, protein extraction, and CAT and protein assays were as described (19Shield M.A. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Comparisons of transfection or transgenic mouse data sets were performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.02 for Windows 95 or GraphPad Prism trial version 3.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA; www.graphpad.com) using the tests indicated under “Results.” No transgenic founder mouse or line was eliminated from the data analysis based on its value(s). A few individual mice were omitted from calculation of the mean values of particular transgenic mouse lines if they had one or more values differing by more than a factor of 10 from several other values for mice in the same line and muscle type. In the 18 lines for which we report new data (see Table I for details), 110 individual mice were analyzed, and data from 4 mice were not used because of one or more aberrant expression values.Table IExpression of wild-type and mutant 1256MCKCAT transgenes in mouse musclesaExpression as assessed by CAT enzymatic activity (micro units/mg protein) measured in quadriceps (quads.), ventricle (vent.), distal tongue (dis. tong.), diaphragm (diaphr.), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In our developmental studies, we had no a priori expectation of how expression might vary with time. We tried linear, polynomial, and exponential fits of expression as a function of age, seeking the simplest function that would fit all four sets of data for a given tissue. For each type of line or curve, we employed “runs tests” (using GraphPad Prism; www.graphpad.com/curvefit/systematic_deviation.htm) as a measure of the suitability of the curve type. If the data conform to a particular mathematical function, the individual points will randomly scatter on both sides of the curve, giving many “runs” on one side or another. If the data do not conform well to the model, there will be fewer runs than expected, indicating that the model is a poor choice. Mammalian MCK Enhancer-Promoter Regions Contain Three Conserved E-boxes—One possible indicator for E-box importance, in addition to functional assays such as in vitro binding or transfections, is interspecies conservation. We examined four MCK sequences: rat (accession no. M27092; Ref. 29Horlick R.A. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2396-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), mouse (AF188002; Ref. 30Hauser M.A. Robinson A. Hartigan-O'Connor D. Williams-Gregory D. Buskin J.N. Apone S. Kirk C.J. Hardy S. Hauschka S.D. Chamberlain J.S. Molecular Therapy. 2000; 2: 16-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), human (M21487; Ref. 31Trask R.V. Strauss A.W. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17142-17149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rabbit (X55146; Ref. 32Yi J.-M. Walsh K. Schimmel P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3027-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Within the mouse sequence from –1256 to +7, three E-boxes have counterparts in the other three species (Fig. 1). We refer to these, from 5′ to 3′, as the left, MEF1 or right, and promoter E-boxes. In addition, the mouse, rat, human and rabbit have four, six, three, and three other E-boxes, respectively, which are not conserved (Fig. 1). We compared the sequences surrounding the seven E-box core sequences in the 1263-base pair mouse MCK promoter (Fig. 1) to the (c/g)n(a/g)(a/g)CA(c/g)(c/g)TG(c/t)(c/t)n(c/g) E-box consensus we had previously proposed for muscle-specific regulatory regions (20Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Requiring the core CAnnTG and weighing other positions equally, the three best matches to the consensus were the E-box sites conserved between species (Fig. 1). These three sites are also good matches, with no or one mismatch, to the consensus sequences proposed for MyoD/E12 heterodimer binding by Blackwell et al. and by Kophengnavong et al. (33Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 34Kophengnavong T. Michnowicz J.E. Blackwell T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) based on in vitro binding assays. Other sequences within the mouse –1256 promoter that are good matches to a proposed MyoD/E12 binding consensus sequence, (a/c/g)CA(c/g)(c/g)TGT(c/t) (34Kophengnavong T. Michnowicz J.E. Blackwell T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), do not have counterparts in the human and rabbit sequences and occur in the –1050 to –359 region, which can be deleted without consequence in transgenic mice (19Shield M.A. Haugen H.S. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or cultured mouse skeletal myocytes (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The rat, human, and rabbit MCK promoters all contain an E-box at the position equivalent to –222 in the mouse sequence, whereas the mouse contains a CACTTA sequence at this position. This suggested a sequencing mistake or a mutation in the cloned DNA. However, the identical sequence, without an E-box, is found in an independently derived mouse clone, from strain C57BL/6J (accession no. NW_000293), as well as our clone from mouse strain Balb/c (35Jaynes J.B. Chamberlain J.S. Buskin J.N. Johnson J.E. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 36Miller J. Bothwell A. Storb U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.-Biol. Sci. 1981; 78: 3829-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), confirming the lack of an E-box at that position. In addition, the E-box in our Balb/c clones at –98, with counterparts in rat and human but not rabbit promoters, is not found in the C57BL/6J genomic clone, suggesting that this E-box site is polymorphic in mice. Studies reported below focus on the three E-boxes conserved in all four species. E-box-specific Mutation Effects on 1256MCKCAT Expression in Cultured Skeletal Myocytes—We previously tested the effect of mutating the left and right (MEF1) E-boxes in a variety of configurations in cultured MM14 skeletal myocytes and in rat neonatal myocardiocytes (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H.

These mutant sequences plus a mutant variant of the conserved promoter E-box are shown above the aligned sequences in Fig. 1. We have now extended our transfection studies in skeletal myocytes by testing these three mutations in all combinations. E-box mutations were explored in the context of the 1256MCKCAT construct, containing MCK sequences from –1256 to +7 driving a linked reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2a, mutation of the left E-box causes a 2-fold decrease in expression in MM14 skeletal myocytes (note the logarithmic y axis in this graph), whereas mutation of the right E-box has nearly 10 times the effect, with expression decreased to 6% of wild-type. These results concur with previous studies (6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In contrast to the left and right E-box mutations, activity of the 1256MCKCAT construct with the mutant promoter E-box is approximately the same as the wild-type construct. Constructs with two E-box mutations gave results much as predicted by assuming that each mutation abolishes the same proportion of expression as when it is the only mutation in 1256MCKCAT. For example, the single left E-box mutant construct expression level multiplied by the single right E-box mutant construct expression level (0.48 of wild-type × 0.063 of wild-type) predicts 3.0% of wild-type expression for the double mutant versus the observed 2.5%. Deletion of the entire MCK enhancer in the 1020MCKCAT construct, which removes both left and right E-boxes plus four other positive control elements (5Fabre-Suver C. Hauschka S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4646-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Amacher S.L. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2753-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), results in a low expression not significantly different from the 1256MCKCAT construct with left and right E-boxes mutated (p > 0.05). E-box-specific Mutation Effects on 1256MCKCAT Expression in Cultured Myocardiocytes—The effect of mutating E-boxes on myocardiocyte expression is strikingly different from that in skeletal myocytes (Fig. 2b). The right E-box mutant values are not statistically different from the wild-type. In contrast, the left E-box mutant construct displays significantly lower expression, only one-third that of the wild-type construct (p < 0.01, 2-tailed unpaired t test with Welch correction for unequal variation).

https://openalex.org/W2160018623,"SV40 large T antigen (Ag) binds to all members of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor family including pRb, p107, and p130. Although the LXCXE motif of T Ag binds directly to the RB proteins, it is not sufficient to fully inactivate their function. The N-terminal DNA J domain of T Ag cooperates with the LXCXE motif to override RB-mediated repression of E2F-dependent transcription. In addition, T Ag can reduce the overall phosphorylation state of p107 and p130 that is dependent on an intact J domain and LXCXE motif. However, the mechanism of this activity has not been described. Here we describe the use of a cell-free system to characterize the effect of T Ag on p130 phosphorylation. When incubated in extracts prepared from S phase cells, p130 undergoes specific phosphorylation. Addition of T Ag to S phase extracts leads to a reduction of p130 phosphorylation in vitro. The ability of T Ag to reduce the phosphorylation of p130 in vitro is dependent on an intact DNA J domain and can be inhibited by okadaic acid and PP2A-specific inhibitors. These results suggest that T Ag recruits a phosphatase activity in a DNA J domain-dependent manner to reduce the phosphorylation of p130."
https://openalex.org/W2003145280,"Origin recognition complex (ORC), a candidate initiator of chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotes, binds specifically to ATP through two of its subunits (Orc1p and Orc5p). In this study, we investigated the kinetics of ATP binding to ORC by a filter binding assay. The Kd values for the ATP of wild-type ORC and ORC-1A (mutant ORC containing Orc1p with a defective Walker A motif) were less than 10 nm, suggesting that the affinity of Orc5p for ATP is very high. On the other hand, the Kd values for the ATP of ORC-5A (mutant ORC containing Orc5p with a defective Walker A motif) was much higher (about 1.5 μm), suggesting that the affinity of Orc1p for ATP is relatively low in the absence of origin DNA. ATP dissociated more rapidly from its complex with ORC-5A than from its complex with ORC-1A, suggesting that the ATP-Orc5p complex is more stable than ATP-Orc1p complex. Origin DNA fragments decreased the Kd value of ORC-5A for ATP and stabilized the complex of ATP with ORC-5A. Wild-type ORC, ORC-1A, and ORC-5A required different concentrations of ATP for specific binding to origin DNA. All of these results imply that ATP binding to Orc5p, ATP binding to Orc1p, and origin DNA binding to ORC are co-operatively regulated, which may be important for the initiation of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2117348363,"Recent crystallographic studies reveal loops in human AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) that interact with the major and minor grooves of DNA containing apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. These loops are postulated to stabilize the DNA helix and the flipped out AP residue. The loop α8 interacts with the major groove on the 3′ side of the AP site. To determine the essentiality of the amino acids that constitute the α8 loop, we created a mutant library containing random nucleotides at codons 222–229 that, in wild-type APE1, specify the sequence NPKGNKKN. Upon expression of the library (2 × 106 different clones) in Escherichia coli and multiple rounds of selection with the alkylating agent methyl-methane sulfonate (MMS), we obtained ∼2 × 105 active mutants that complemented the MMS sensitivity of AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli. DNA sequencing showed that active mutants tolerated amino acid substitutions at all eight randomized positions. Basic and uncharged polar amino acids together comprised the majority of substitutions, reflecting the positively charged, polar character of the wild-type loop.

Substitutions at residues 226–229, located nearer to the AP site, that reduced basicity or hydrogen bonding potential, increased Km 2- to 6-fold and decreased AP site binding; substitutions at residues 222–225 exhibited lesser effects.

Barsky D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The C-terminal segment encodes an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease activity that plays a pivotal role in base excision repair (BER), and the N-terminal segment is responsible for the redox activity. Structural analysis of APE1 bound to abasic DNA has revealed loop domains that interact with the helical grooves in DNA (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). APE1 is postulated to stabilize the flipped out abasic residue by a double-loop mechanism involving interactions with both the minor and the major grooves at the AP site (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Other loop domains also interact with DNA on either the 5′ or the 3′ side of the AP residue to facilitate the formation of a stable APE1·DNA complex (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). These loop domain interactions may therefore play an important role in governing AP endonuclease activity, particularly with respect to the DNA substrate specificity. AP endonuclease 1 apurinic/apyrimidinic base excision repair Luria-Bertani methylmethane sulfonate phosphate-buffered saline exonuclease III dithiothreitol nucleotide(s). In addition to AP endonuclease activity that cleaves DNA 5′ of the AP site, human APE1 encodes a 3′-exonuclease activity that removes nucleotides from the 3′ terminus at nicks, gaps, and 3′-recessed breaks in DNA (3Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recently, this activity has been shown to preferentially remove 3′ mismatches in vitro and thus may serve as a proofreading exonuclease for polymerase β in BER (4Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). APE1 also possesses phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities that remove, respectively, 3′-phosphate and 3′-blocking groups, such as phosphoglycolates (5Suh D. Wilson III, D.M. Povirk L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), β-l-dioxolane-cytidine (6Chou K.M. Kukhanova M. Cheng Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31009-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), azidothymidine (4Chou K.M. Cheng Y.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and 3′-terminal residues resulting from glycosylase/lyase reactions (7Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These activities that excise altered nucleotides at DNA breaks might thus facilitate critical repair processes in cells, such as ligation and repair synthesis (8Ramana C.V. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 17Izumi T. Hazra T.K. Boldogh I. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. Ikeda S. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, these 3′-end-processing activities encoded by human APE1 are mediated at the same active site as the robust AP endonuclease activity. Although these 3′-processing activities are detectable in vitro, they are much weaker (>100-fold) than the AP endonuclease activity. In contrast, in the case of Escherichia coli exonuclease III (ExoIII, the bacterial counterpart of APE1), the AP endonuclease and 3′-processing activities are comparable (9Demple B. Johnson A. Fung D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7731-7735Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting that human APE1 might have evolved to be more stringent in selection of DNA substrates. The DNA-interacting loops of E. coli ExoIII and human APE1 occupy similar locations in crystal structures, and most are superimposable (10Mol C.D. Hosfield D.J. Tainer J.A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Of the loop domains in ExoIII, loop αM, which corresponds structurally to loop α8 in human APE1, is of particular interest (11Cal S. Tan K.L. McGregor A. Connolly B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7128-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Insertion of this loop domain into calf DNase I endows this enzyme with AP endonuclease activity, suggesting a critical role for loop αM in AP site recognition and binding. In APE1·DNA complexes, loop α8 (amino acids 222–229: NPKGNKKN) is in close contact with the major groove 3′ of the abasic residue (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). A chain of three asparagine residues (Asn-222, Asn-226, and Asn-229) lines up along the major groove and contacts two 3′ AP·DNA phosphates. These interactions are believed to stabilize the distorted DNA structure that bears an extra-helical baseless residue and may also facilitate AP site recognition and binding. To assess the essentiality of amino acid residues in the α8 loop, and to gain insight into their function in DNA binding and catalysis, we constructed a mutant library containing random nucleotides in place of the eight wild-type codons specifying the α8 loop. We used functional complementation of AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli to select for active APE1 mutants that conferred resistance to the alkylating agent MMS. Despite evolutionary conservation of the α8 loop, we observed that all eight amino acids are substitutable. Together, basic and uncharged polar amino acids constituted the majority of replacements, in keeping with the positively charged, polar nature of the loop. The substitutions can alter binding of an AP-site-containing oligonucleotide and AP endonuclease activity, suggesting a critical role for the α8 loop in modulation of AP·DNA binding and catalytic activities. Our analysis of 187 active mutants constitutes an extensive examination of the effects of mutation in the α8 loop on the function of APE1 in vivo and in vitro. Construction of Human APE1 Random Mutant Library—The APE1 gene was isolated from a Quick-clone human HeLa cDNA library (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) by PCR amplification using the flanking oligonucleotides 5′-ATGCCGAAGCGTGGGAAAAAGGGA-3′ and 5′-CAGTGCTAGGTATAGGGTGATAGG-3′ (Qiagen, Alameda, CA) as primers. The PCR-amplified DNA fragment was gel-purified and cloned into the TOPO TA-cloning vector pTrcHis2-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); the resulting plasmid was designated pTrcHis2-APE1. The orientation and nucleotide sequence of the cloned human APE1 gene were confirmed by using an ABI Prism DNA sequencer. The APE1 library containing random nucleotides in place of the eight wild-type codons specifying the α8 loop was constructed by a two-step PCR amplification methodology. First, two DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the APE1 cDNA with a 39-nucleotide overlapping sequence were PCR-amplified separately. The N-terminal fragment was amplified by using primers 5′-ATGCCGAAGCGTGGGAAAAAGGGA-3′ and 5′-GCGAAGGTCAATTTCTTCATGTGCCACATTGAGGTCTCC-3′ (Qiagen). For the C-terminal fragment with random mutations, the forward primer 5′-GGAGACCTCAATGTGGCACATGAAGAAATTGACCTTCGCAACCCCAAGGGGAACAAAAAGAATGCTGGCTTCACGCCACAAGAGCGCC-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) and the reverse primer 5′-CAGTGCTAGGTATAGGGTGATAGG-3′ (Qiagen) were used for PCR amplification. The underlined letters indicate the loop α8 region that was synthesized using a mixture containing 70% of the canonic nucleotides and 10% of each of the other three nucleotides at each position. The two fragments were gel-purified, then were used in the second step of PCR amplification. Because of a 39-nucleotide terminal sequence overlap, PCR amplification with these fragments can produce a single DNA fragment that integrates both sequences. Using a reaction mixture containing both fragments and a primer set of the forward primer used for the N-terminal fragment 5′-ATGCCGAAGCGTGGGAAAAAGGGA-3′ and the reverse primer used for the C-terminal fragment 5′-CAGTGCTAGGTATAGGGTGATAGG-3′ in the PCR, we obtained a DNA product that spans both fragments and contains random mutations in the loop α8 sequence. The composite DNA fragment was gel-purified and then digested with restriction enzymes SacI, which cleaves near the 5′ terminus, and PstI, which cleaves near the 3′ terminus. The digested SacI-PstI fragment was gel-purified and ligated into a SacI-PstI pTrcHis2-APE1 vector. The vector was produced by digestion of a “dummy” pTrcHis2-APE1 plasmid with both restriction enzymes. The dummy APE1 plasmid contains an altered amino acid sequence in the loop α8 (IPIRAKNN in contrast to the wild-type NPKGNKKN) and has been demonstrated to confer little or no resistance to MMS in AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli BW542 (see Fig. 4, B and C). The use of a dummy plasmid instead of the wild-type APE1 plasmid in the cloning process mitigates against selection of any contaminating wild-type APE1 in the library. After ligation, plasmids containing the random library were used to transform E. coli Top10 cells, and the number of transformants was determined on LB/agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to obtain the library size. After transformation, solutions were incubated with Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (1:30) in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight, and plasmids were then isolated by using a Qiagen maxiprep kit. Genetic Selection for Active APE1 Mutants—E. coli BW542 (xth-9, nfo::kan), a generous gift from Dr. Bernard Weiss, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, was transformed with plasmids containing the APE1 random library (diversity: 2 × 106), and the transformed cultures (1.8 × 107 cells in 11 ml) were grown overnight at 37 °C in 300 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. This mutant APE1/BW542 library was then subjected to sequential rounds of MMS exposure and selection. First, the cell culture in stationary phase was inoculated at a 1/10 ratio in LB broth containing necessary antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C in a shaker at 225 rpm for 90 min. The proliferated cell culture was precipitated by centrifugation, and cell pellets were re-suspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen). Next, a 30-min starvation was carried out by incubation of the cells in 1× PBS at 37 °C in a shaker at 225 rpm. After starvation, MMS (0.5 μl/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the culture in 1× PBS, and the culture was incubated in a 225-rpm shaker at 37 °C for 15 min. Following MMS treatment, cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were re-suspended and washed with 1× PBS. After 1× PBS wash, cells were centrifuged again and pellets were re-suspended in LB broth. Finally, the re-suspended cells in LB broth were inoculated 1/10 in LB broth containing antibiotics, and cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in a 225-rpm shaker to obtain cultures for the next round of MMS selection. In parallel, we also determined the survival ratio of the mutant library comparing to the wild-type APE1/BW542 and the parental strain BW35 after each round of MMS treatment by counting surviving colonies on LB-agar plates containing necessary antibiotics. This allowed us to monitor the progress of selection and to record the size of the resistant library after each round of MMS treatment. In this study, the random library underwent eight rounds of selection with slightly increasing concentrations of MMS (round 1 at 0.5 μl/ml, round 2 at 1.0 μl/ml, and rounds 3–8 at 2.0 μl/ml). To avoid accumulation of mutations in the host cells from MMS exposure, we isolated the plasmids after round 5 and re-transformed BW542 for the subsequent rounds of selection. MMS Gradient Plates—LB-agar plates containing linear concentration gradient of MMS were prepared following the method by Cunningham et al. (12Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitzer S.G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 ml of molten LB-agar (50 °C) containing a designated concentration of MMS was poured in a 9-cm square polystyrene Petri dish, which was tilted with an angle allowing zero thickness of the LB-agar at the lifted edge. After the agar solidified, the plate was leveled and 25 ml of molten LB-agar without MMS was poured in the plate to overlay the MMS-containing agar. A linear MMS concentration gradient thereby forms in the agar plate from zero to the designated concentration of MMS along the tilted direction. Notably, 25 μl of 10% Antifoam B Emulsion (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each 25-ml LB-agar molten solution to prevent meniscus formation in the Petri dish. Bacterial cultures to be tested on the gradient plates were grown to the stationary phase, and 20 μl of the culture was mixed with 2 ml of molten soft agar (7.5%; 45 °C). While applying bacteria on the gradient plate, a microscope slide (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was employed by using its 7.5-cm edge to dip in the bacteria-soft agar solution and then lightly touch the surface of the plate parallel to the MMS gradient. Plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight (18–20 h), and cell growth could then be visualized. For photography, 1.5 ml of an acridine orange solution (0.2 mg/ml in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the surface of the plate, and photographs were taken under UV irradiation. Expression and Purification of Human APE1 Protein—The pTrcHis2-TOPO cloning vector used to clone the open reading frame of the human APE1 gene is also an E. coli expression vector. Expression of the wild-type as well as various mutant APE1 proteins is driven and regulated by a cassette of trc promoter/lacO operator and a plasmid encoded lac suppressor gene, lacIq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The encoded gene in this vector will fuse with an myc epitope and a sixhistidine tag at the C terminus rendering the expressed protein convenient for purification. We expressed wild-type and several mutant APE1 proteins in E. coli Top10 cells by growing 1% inoculation cultures (in LB broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) at 37 °C for about 3 h to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5–0.6). Thereafter, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures for induction of gene overexpression, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were re-suspended at ∼1010 cells/ml in 1× binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) (His-Bind Kits, Novagen, Madison, WI) containing 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To obtain cell extracts, cell suspensions were first frozen at -80 °C and then thawed on ice for 2 h. Soluble extracts were obtained by centrifugation and applied to the His-Bind Ni2+-affinity column, and proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). Fractions containing eluted protein solutions were dialyzed and stored in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm DTT. Purified proteins were visualized on a Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)-stained gel after 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The concentration of the purified proteins was determined by using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit based on the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). AP Endonuclease Assay—Synthetic oligonucleotide containing a tetrahydrofuran (F) that mimics an abasic site (5′-CTGGGTTTCTCCAATAACFGAATCCAACTGGGCCGGTAAC-3′) and its complementary oligonucleotide (5′-GTTACCGGCCCAGTTGGATTCCGTTATTGGAGAAACCCAG-3′) were purchased from Invitrogen. The abasic oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and then hybridized with the complementary strand to form a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an AP site. This AP·DNA would serve as a substrate for cleavage by APE1 proteins in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 10 min unless otherwise stated. The reaction product was resolved by electrophoresis in a 14% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The cleavage product by AP endonuclease (32P-18-nt oligonucleotide) could be separated from the AP oligonucleotide (40 nt) in the denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography. We used PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain digital images and computer program ImageQuaNT to obtain quantitative data. Kinetic parameters were determined by Michaelis-Menten plots based on the PhosphorImager data. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—APE1 proteins and 5′-32PAP·DNA were first incubated in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm DTT) at room temperature (23 °C) for 20 min, followed by another 10-min incubation at 4 °C. The reaction products were analyzed on a 6% polyacryl-amide gel (16 cm × 16 cm × 1.5 mm) by electrophoresis (150 V, constant voltage) with 1× TBE buffer at 4 °C. The gel was vacuum-dried, and the mobility shift by APE1·DNA complex was visualized by autoradiography. Creation and Genetic Selection of a Human APE1 Mutant Library—We created a human APE1 mutant library harboring random nucleotide substitutions at eight contiguous codons corresponding to the α8 loop, a DNA-binding region that interacts with the major groove on the 3′ side of the abasic site. A model illustrating interactions of the loop with abasic-site containing DNA is shown in Fig. 1A. The α8 loop mutant library was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pTrc-His2 that provides a histidine tag at the C terminus to facilitate purification of expressed proteins. Active mutants were obtained by transforming the library into AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli BW542 (xth-nfo-) that lack ExoIII and endonuclease IV, and selecting for resistance to MMS. BW542 is highly sensitive to MMS (12Cunningham R.P. Saporito S.M. Spitzer S.G. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we found that survival after MMS treatment can be up to five orders of magnitude lower than survival of the parental strain BW35 (see Fig. 4A). Transformation with wild-type APE1 enhanced survival of BW542 up to 1000-fold at a high MMS concentration (5 μl/ml, 59 mm), although survival was ∼100-fold lower than that exhibited by the parental strain (Fig. 4A). We exploited the ability of APE1 to complement the MMS sensitivity of BW542 to select for active mutants. Starting with a random library of two million clones, we carried out eight rounds of selection in the presence of increasing amounts of MMS. A gradual increase of MMS concentration in multiple rounds of selection allowed progressive enrichment for active mutants. Analysis of Active Loop α8 Mutants—The final library of active mutants consisted of ∼2 × 105 members, each of which rendered E. coli resistant to 2 μl/ml MMS (23.6 mm) in a 15-min treatment in the eighth round of selection. We randomly picked 187 clones from these active mutants for DNA sequence analysis. For comparison, we carried out DNA sequencing on 60 clones randomly picked from the original, unselected library. As shown in Fig. 2A, the average number of amino acid changes per APE1 DNA was reduced from 4.9 in mutants from the unselected library to 2.9 in the active mutants. This result indicates that only a limited number of amino acid substitutions was tolerated under the selection conditions. Among the 187 active clones, mutants with triple amino acid substitutions were most prevalent (34%), followed by double substitutions (23%), quadruple substitutions (20%), and single substitutions (13%). Among the 60 unselected mutants, substitutions in the eight targeted amino acids included acidic, basic, uncharged polar, and hydrophobic residues. 2This analysis is based on RasMol's classification of amino acids in the molecular visualization tool RasTop 2.0 (www.inrp.fr/Acces/biotic/rastop/help/default.htm). Conservative substitutions are those involving amino acids in the same class. No wild-type sequences were observed and ten mutants encoded a stop codon (Fig. 2B). Substitutions were distributed relatively evenly among the eight randomized positions. Among the active clones, in contrast, no mutants containing a stop codon were observed, attesting to the efficacy of selection. Acidic substitutions were not observed in the single and double mutants, and only six of the triple mutants harbored a lone acidic residue, indicating that the basic character of the loop is important for function. The spectra of single, double, and triple substitutions in the 187 active mutants are presented in Fig. 3, A, B, and C, respectively. Only one wild-type clone was observed, presumably representing a false-positive, in which Asn-226 was encoded by AAT rather than the wild-type triplet AAC. The spectrum of replacements in the 25 single mutants indicates that the α8 loop tolerates amino acid changes at every residue. The replacements in the single and double mutants, within each group and in combination, are about one-quarter basic and one-half uncharged polar amino acids. 2This analysis is based on RasMol's classification of amino acids in the molecular visualization tool RasTop 2.0 (www.inrp.fr/Acces/biotic/rastop/help/default.htm). Conservative substitutions are those involving amino acids in the same class. This pattern of substitution reflects the fundamentally basic and polar nature of the wild-type loop. Considering only the single and double mutants, Asn-226, Asn-222, and Asn-229, exhibited the lowest proportion of total substitutions (5.5%, 5.5%, and 7%, respectively). The remaining wild-type residues displayed higher proportions, varying from 13% to 20%. Asn-222, Asn-226, and Asn-229 also tolerated the narrowest spectrum of replacements (five, four, and five different substitutions, respectively), the other residues exhibiting from six to ten different replacements. These data indicate that Asn-222, Asn-226, and Asn-229 are the least mutable residues in the loop; each is postulated to participate in hydrogen bonding with the DNA backbone downstream of the flipped out AP site, stabilizing the APE1·DNA complex for catalysis (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Of the three asparagines, the proportion of conservative substitutions was highest for Asn-226. Moreover, among all 187 active mutants, Asn-226 was replaced in fewer of the mutants (16%) than any other wild-type residue. We infer that Asn-226 may have particular functional significance, perhaps related to its postulated role in H-bonding. Interestingly, the amino acid sequence of loop α8 is identical in mammals, including human, bovine, and mouse, and is highly conserved with respect to the Drosophila homolog Rrp1, the only differences being substitution of Asn and Thr at positions corresponding to Gly-225 and Lys-227 in APE1, respectively. In contrast to this evolutionary conservation, multiple mutations in the α8 loop are permitted under our selection scheme. It is important to note in this regard that mutants possessing as little as 10% of the wild-type incision activity were selectable (data not shown), even though all active mutants survived multiple rounds of exposure to MMS. This observation suggests that AP endonuclease activity is present in cells in excess, in accord with increased demand during periods of oxidative stress. Effects of Single Amino Acid Substitutions on APE1 Activity in Vivo—Analysis of our active mutant library after eight rounds of MMS selection indicates that the α8 loop is mutable and tolerates multiple substitutions. To gain insight into the role of the loop in AP site binding and AP endonuclease activity, we analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions within the loop structure. It is difficult to infer changes in the structure of mutants that contain multiple substitutions. Therefore, we chose a group of eight single mutants for analysis that includes a replacement at each of the targeted residues; most of the replacements result in loss of putative hydrogen bonds (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Berman H.M. Westbrook J Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27551) Google Scholar) or a reduction in net charge. We measured the capability of the mutants to complement the MMS sensitivity of AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli BW542. Bacteria harboring mutant APE1 were grown to stationary phase and applied in a straight line on the surface of plates containing a linear MMS gradient. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, complementation was visualized by the extent of growth along the line of increasing MMS concentration, as illustrated in Fig. 4A. In comparison with the parental strain BW35, the repair-deficient strain BW542 (xth-nfo-) was highly sensitive to MMS. This sensitivity was not reduced by transformation with a dummy vector (i.e. a vector with an inactive insert that encodes IPIRAKNN rather than the wild-type NPKGNKKN). In contrast, wild-type APE1 partially complemented the host repair deficiency. All mutants tested complemented BW542, which is not surprising, because they were selected in eight rounds of MMS treatment. However, none complemented as well as wild-type APE1 (Fig. 4, B and C). The extent of MMS resistance was similar among the mutants, with the exception of N222L, which exhibited much weaker complementation. These data show that even though loop α8 is highly mutable, a single amino acid substitution can compromise APE1 function in vivo. Effect of Amino Acid Replacements on Incision and Binding of AP·DNA—To analyze the effects of amino acid substitutions in the α8 loop on cleavage and binding of AP site-containing DNA, we expressed and purified the eight mutant proteins described above. The mutant proteins as well as wild-type APE1 were isolated from E. coli extracts by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and the purity of the final preparations was examined by SDS-PAGE. Each preparation showed a single band and was estimated to be at least 95% homogeneous; the APE1 proteins, fused with a myc epitope and a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus, migrated with mobility corresponding to ∼45 kDa (Fig. 5). We measured AP endonuclease activity in a gelbased assay that employs a32P-labeled, synthetic oligonucleotide containing a tetrahydrofuran residue at the center of the duplex to mimic an AP site. After cleavage by AP endonuclease activity to generate a nick 5′ of the AP site, the reaction mixtures containing the DNA duplexes (40 bp) were run on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the cleavage product (18-nt single-stranded DNA) was visualized and quantified based on the 5′-32P-end label. As shown in Fig. 6A, wild-type APE1 and all eight mutants incise AP·DNA in a concentration-dependent manner. Steady-state kinetic parameters, determined in the gel-based assay, are summarized in Table I. All mutants other than G225T exhibited changes in the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, and/or the catalytic rate constant, kcat. Mutation in the four C-terminal amino acids was associated, overall, with greater increases in Km than mutation in the N-terminal residues, perhaps reflecting closer proximity to the AP site and greater importance in binding of AP·DNA.Fig. 6Effect of loop α8 single mutations on AP endonuclease and AP·DNA binding activities of APE1.A, the AP endonuclease activity of purified wild-type (WT) and mutant APE1 was assayed in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 nm32P-AP·DNA (40 bp) and 0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 nm APE1. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and reaction products were resolved in a 14% denaturing gel. The 18-nt fragment resulting from incision and the uncut 40-nt AP oligonucleotide were visualized by autoradiography. S, substrate alone. B, the AP·DNA-binding activity of APE1 proteins was determined by electrophoresis mobility shift assays. APE1 protein (100 nm) was incubated with AP·DNA (10 nm) in a 10-μl reaction in the absence of MgCl2 at room temperature for 20 min, followed by a 10-min incubation at 4 °C. The APE1·DNA complex was separated from AP·DNA by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic analysis of the APendonuclease activity of APE1 mutantsWTAPE1 mutantsN222LP223SK224TG225TN226TK227LK228TN229Ikcat (S-1)1.10.390.521.11.21.12.14.82.0Km (nm)9.41027131155254031kcat/Km (S-1 nm-1)0.120.0380.0190.0840.110.0190.0830.120.065 Open table in a new tab The binding of wild-type and mutant APE1 to AP·DNA was assessed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and bound APE1·DNA complexes were visualized on gels by autoradiography. Overall, the C-terminal mutations exhibited greatly reduced binding relative to the N-terminal mutations (Fig. 6B). However, there was no fixed relationship between Km, measured in activity assays, and binding in the gel shift assay. For example, K224T exhibited only a minor increase in Km but did not display detectable binding. In contrast, P223S, with a higher Km than K224T, visibly bound AP·DNA, albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type. These results could be due to divalent cations that are present in the enzymatic assay but not in the binding assay. We have created a human APE1 mutant library harboring amino acid substitutions in the eight-residue α8 loop that interacts with the DNA major groove on the 3′-side of the AP site. Fig. 1A shows a model of the loop illustrating interaction with the abasic site-containing DNA strand. Although the amino acid composition of the loop is highly conserved from flies to mammals (18Evans A.R. Limp-Foster M. Kelley M.R. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 83-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), our results indicate that every residue is replaceable and that active mutants can be selected that confer MMS resistance to AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli. Of the eight residues, the three asparagines (Asn-222, Asn-226, and Asn-229) that are postulated to form hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Berman H.M. Westbrook J Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27551) Google Scholar), exhibited least mutability, Asn-226 being lowest. The amino acid replacements in active mutants have predominantly basic or uncharged polar side chains, in accord with the characteristics of the wild-type loop and the interaction of the loop with AP·DNA observed in crystal structures. Multiple substitutions within this motif are tolerated, although all mutants retained a net positive charge (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In addition to altering electrostatic charge or hydrogen-bonding potential, the substitutions we observed may cause conformational changes that affect the function of the loop. Despite plasticity of the α8 loop with respect to amino acid replacements, we found that substitution at every position can compromise complementation of MMS sensitivity in E. coli (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that the α8 loop may be important for binding and/or incision of AP site containing DNA. We purified APE1 from eight active mutants that contain a single substitution at each of the α8 loop positions and characterized their AP site incision activity and binding to an AP site containing oligomer. Steady-state kinetic analysis showed that a single replacement can change the parameters of AP site cleavage. In general, the C-terminal half of the loop (Asn-226, Lys-227, Lys-228, and Asn-229), which is positioned closer to the AP site and harbors two of the three asparagines that contact the DNA backbone (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), showed the largest effects on Km. For example, substitution of Asn-226 with Thr resulted in a 6-fold increase of Km relative to wild-type APE1 (Table I). A model of Asn-226 in APE1 bound to a 15-bp oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B) shows predicted hydrogen bonding of Asn-226 and Asn-222 to the DNA downstream of the abasic site. In a second complex of APE1 with a different, 11-bp oligonucleotide, Asn-226 and Asn-229 form predicted hydrogen bonds with the DNA backbone (2Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 19Berman H.M. Westbrook J Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27551) Google Scholar). Substitution of threonine in the N226T mutant (Fig. 1C) results in loss of predicted hydrogen bonding that may account, at least in part, for our observations. Substitution at Lys-227, Lys-228, and Asn-229 also increased Km 3–4-fold. As shown in Fig. 6B, these elevated Km values were reflected in reduction of AP·DNA binding affinity determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In general, substitutions in the C-terminal residues closer to the AP site (Asn-226, Lys-227, Lys-228, and Asn-229) had greater effect on binding (Fig. 6B). It should be noted that changes in Km do not necessarily parallel changes in binding. Thus, K224T showed a less than 2-fold increase in Km but exhibited no detectable binding. In contrast, P223S had a 3-fold increase in Km but still bound to AP·DNA, although binding was weaker than that observed for wild-type APE1. The varying relationship may reflect the fact that the binding assay was carried out in the absence of Mg2+ ions, and this could be important in APE1/AP·DNA association and dissociation (14Masuda Y.

Our random mutagenesis study targeting a dynamic DNA-interacting loop provides insight into how alterations in a regional peptide sequence can affect substrate binding as well as catalytic activity. Our work describing the in vivo and in vitro effects of mutation in the α8 loop supports and extends the conclusion of x-ray analysis that the loop is important for binding of AP·DNA and AP site incision.

Although it is well-established that Pgp exhibits drug-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent drug transport functions, the mechanism by which these two reactions are coupled remains unclear. We have shown recently that proteolytic cleavage of the linker region, which joins the NH2 and COOH halves of the Pgp molecule, results in a Pgp form that exhibits drug-independent and -dependent ATPase activities (Nuti et al., (2000) Biochemistry 39, 3424–3432; Nuti, S. L., and Rao, U. S. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 29417–29423). To understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we used the procedure of vanadate-mediated trapping of the Pgp transport cycle intermediates to determine the steps in the catalytic cycle that are being regulated by the linker region. We show that vanadate stably traps Pgp under two different conditions, one in the presence of ATP alone and the other in the presence of ATP and drug, suggesting the existence of two Pgp conformations. These two conformations, one mediating basal and the other drug-stimulated ATPase reactions, represent different transport cycle intermediates of Pgp, because arresting Pgp in either conformation prevents the catalytic cycle from proceeding to completion. The results also show that these two conformations are uncoupled and appear simultaneously in Pgp that was cleaved in the linker region. These results together suggest that Pgp assumes at least two distinct conformational states, which catalyze two ATP hydrolysis events in the drug transport cycle, and the linker region mediates the transition between these two states of Pgp.

However, the mechanism of coupling is unclear. P-glycoprotein sodium orthovanadate Spodoptera frugiperda [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate inorganic phosphate. To understand the mechanism of coupling, it is first necessary to identify various intermediate structures of Pgp that are presumably formed during the catalytic cycle. Toward this end, we have initiated studies to detect conformational differences in Pgp that was bound to ATP and transport substrate by using limited proteolysis combined with immunoblotting analyses. Although these studies did not provide any striking differences in the pattern of proteolysis of Pgp that was bound to different ligands, it was noticed that the proteolyzed Pgp exhibits ATPase activity both in the presence of drugs (drug-stimulated ATPase function) and absence of drugs (basal ATPase function). We have characterized this phenomenon using trypsin, chymotrypsin, and proteinase K (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the tryptic and chymotryptic peptides originating from the COOH-half of Pgp has identified, respectively, residues 680 and 682 as the sites cleaved by these proteases (22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These identified residues are interestingly located in the linker region, which led to the suggestion that the linker region is the only region in the entire molecule that is predominantly accessible for protease action, and cleavage of this region leads to the formation of a Pgp form that exhibits the basal ATPase activity. To investigate the mechanism by which linker-region cleavage leads to the appearance of basal ATPase function, we used the procedures of sodium orthovanadate (Vi)-mediated trapping of nucleotide in the active site of Pgp, originally developed by Senior for investigating the Pgp catalytic cycle (23Urbatsch I.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The results presented in this report show that Pgp exists at least in two different conformational states, which differ in the accessibility of the drug-binding site. These Pgp forms are intermediates of the catalytic cycle, one conformation that binds drug appears to mediate the drug-stimulated ATPase function, and the second conformation, which does not bind drug, appears to mediate the basal ATPase function. The results presented here also indicate that these two conformational states are detectable in the linker region-cleaved Pgp, suggesting that the linker region is a key player in coupling these two states. Preparation of Pgp-containing Membranes—The Sf9 insect cells were infected with a recombinant baculovirus carrying the human wild-type Pgp cDNA, and the total membrane fraction was prepared as described previously (17Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Membranes prepared from Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus carrying the α-subunit cDNA of the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (25Rao U.S. Steimle R.E. Balachandran P. J.

Pgp ATPase Activity Measurements—The basal and the verapamilstimulated Pgp ATPase activities were measured by determining colorimetrically the inorganic phosphate released from ATP as described previously (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Pgp membrane preparations used in this study exhibited ∼66 nmol/min/mg of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity, and the linker region-cleaved Pgp exhibited the basal and verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities of ∼22 and ∼40 nmol/min/mg, respectively. These activities were considered 100%, and all the ATPase activities reported here are expressed as a percentage of these values. Vi-induced Trapping of the Pgp ATPase—The Vi-induced trapping of the Pgp ATPase reactions were carried out as described previously (26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Pgp membranes (∼200 μg of membrane protein) were incubated either at 22 °Corat37 °C for 5 min in 0.4 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm Vi, 50 μm verapamil, 10 mm Mg-salt of ATP, AMP-PCP or ADP, and 10 mm Pi (Na2HPO4), as indicated in each experiment. The preincubation mixtures were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellets were washed once in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4. The pelleted membrane fraction was resuspended in Tris-glycerol buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, and 30% glycerol) and used in the ATPase activity measurements as described (21Nuti S.L.

Briefly, the membranes (30–50 μg) containing full-length or trypsin-cleaved Pgp (membrane protein:trypsin at a ratio of 1000:1 w/w for 30 min at room temperature) were incubated with 8.3 μm [125I]IAAP, 0.1 mm Vi, and 10 mm MgATP, MgADP and Pi or, the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PCP, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 5 min at either 22 °C or 37 °C. The samples were then illuminated with 365 nm of ultraviolet light using a hand-held ultraviolet lamp assembly (UVP Products, Upland, CA) for 5 min. The proteins in these reaction mixtures were precipitated with 6% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to phosphor-screen at – 80 °C for 14 h. Radioactivity incorporated into Pgp was detected by the STORM 840 PhosphorImager, and the intensity of the bands in the fluorograms was quantified by using Image-Quant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Other Methods—Preparation of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-cleaved Pgps, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and protein estimation were carried out as described previously (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A.

Pgp membranes were incubated with Vi and other ligands at 22 °C for 5 min, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity in the membranes thus obtained was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 1A. When Pgp was incubated with Vi alone, or Vi and MgATP, no loss of the verapamil-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity was observed. In the presence of Vi, MgATP and verapamil, nearly 70% of the verapamil-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity was inhibited. Interestingly, when MgATP in this preincubation reaction was replaced with MgADP and Pi, or MgAMP-PCP, no significant loss of the verapamil-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity was noticed. To further establish that the inhibition is dependent on the presence of verapamil, the above analysis was carried out by including a range of verapamil concentrations in the preincubation mixture containing fixed amounts of Pgp, Vi, and MgATP, and the verapamil-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity was measured. The results show (Fig. 1B) that the Pgp ATPase inhibition is verapamil concentration-dependent. Similar results were obtained upon replacing verapamil in the preincubation mixtures with vinblastine or cyclosporin A (not shown). Because all of these incubations were carried out at identical temperature, i.e. 22 °C, and Vi-induced inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity selectively occurs in the presence of MgATP and drug, these results suggest that it is the participating ligands, i.e. the drug and the ATP, that determine the inhibition of Pgp. Stable Inhibition of Pgp ATPase at 37 °C Occurs in the Presence of ATP and Does Not Require Drug—In contrast to the above and to the previous reports (26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 28Szabo K.

Although the experimental details in these reports appeared comparable, one striking difference is the preincubation temperature, which was either 22 °C or 37 °C. To determine whether temperature influences the Vi-induced inhibition, Pgp membranes were preincubated with Vi and other ligands as described above except that the preincubation mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The membranes were collected by centrifugation, and the verapamil-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity in these membranes was measured; the results are shown in Fig. 2A. The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity was unaffected when Pgp was incubated with Vi (Fig. 2A, open column) or with MgATP in the absence of Vi (not shown). Interestingly, nearly 85% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity was inhibited when Pgp was incubated with Vi and MgATP. Inhibition to similar extent was observed when Pgp was incubated with Vi, MgATP and verapamil. On the other hand, a slight decrease in the activity was observed when Pgp was incubated with Vi and MgAMP-PCP or with Vi, MgADP, and Pi. To further establish that Pgp ATPase inhibition occurs in the presence of MgATP without the need for a drug, a range of MgATP concentration was included in the preincubation mixture containing fixed amounts of Pgp and Vi, and the verapamil-stimulated Pgp ATPase activity in the resulting membranes was measured. Fig. 2B shows that the inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity is linear and dependent on the concentration of MgATP. These results suggested that Vi induces stable inhibition of Pgp ATPase at 37 °C in the presence of MgATP, and such inhibition does not require drug. Because all of the incubations of Fig. 2A were carried out at identical temperature, i.e. 37 °C, and the Vi-induced inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity occurs with a minimal requirement of MgATP, these results suggest, as pointed above, that it is the participating ligand, the hydrolysable ATP, that determines the inhibition of Pgp ATPase. Conditions for Stable Inhibition of Basal and Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity of the Linker Region-cleaved Pgp by Trypsin—As reported previously, Pgp cleaved in the linker region by either trypsin, chymotrypsin, or proteinase K exhibits both the basal and the drug-stimulated ATPase activities (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which these two activities are elicited, Pgp-containing membranes were treated with trypsin at a ratio of 1000:1 (w/w) for 1 h, under which conditions Pgp was cleaved in the linker region and exhibited both basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activities, as reported previously (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pgp in which its linker region was cleaved by trypsin was preincubated at 22 °C with Vi in the presence of various ligands, and the basal and the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities were measured. Fig. 3A shows that nearly 90% of the basal ATPase activity of the linker region-cleaved Pgp was inhibited upon preincubation at 22 °C with Vi and MgATP (Fig. 3A, hatched column). Under these experimental conditions, nearly 50% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity remained unaffected (Fig. 3B, hatched column). To further determine whether the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity can be completely inhibited in the presence of MgATP and Vi, the linker region-cleaved Pgp was incubated with increasing concentrations of MgATP in the presence of Vi. Measurements of ATPase activities in the resulting membranes, shown in Fig. 3C, indicate that the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity can only be inhibited partially, amounting to ∼60% under these experimental conditions (Fig. 3C, open circles). However, under the same conditions, complete inhibition of the basal ATPase activity is observed (Fig. 3C, filled circles). We next determined whether inclusion of drug in the preincubation mixture containing MgATP and Vi can result in a complete inhibition of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of the linker region-cleaved Pgp. The results show that although complete inhibition of the basal ATPase activity is maintained (Fig. 3A, solid column), only ∼60% of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity is inhibited (Fig. 3B, solid column). Because the Vi-induced inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity is known to be reversible (23Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the absence of complete inhibition of the verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity in the preincubation mixture containing Vi, MgATP, and drug is probably attributable to decreased stability of the complex as a result of trypsin-mediated cleavage of the linker region. Conditions for Stable Inhibition of Basal and Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity of the Linker Region-cleaved Pgp by Chymotrypsin—We have shown recently that chymotrypsin also cleaves Pgp predominantly in the linker region, and such cleavage leads to the formation of a Pgp form that exhibits both the basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activities, similar to the effects of trypsin on Pgp (22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of sites that is cleaved by chymotrypsin is residue 682, which is only 2 amino acids farther from a site that was cleaved by trypsin (22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, to further establish the observations presented in Fig. 3, Pgp in the membranes was proteolyzed with chymotrypsin at a ratio of 1000:1 (w/w) for 30 min, which resulted in the cleavage of Pgp in the linker region that exhibited both the basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activity, as reported previously (22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Pgp thus cleaved in the linker region by chymotrypsin was preincubated with Vi in the presence of MgATP, and MgATP and verapamil, for 5 min at room temperature. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, and the basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activities were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 4 shows that incubation of Pgp with Vi alone does not affect either the basal or the drug-stimulated ATPase activity. However, in the presence of MgATP, Vi stably inhibited nearly 80% of the basal ATPase activity (Fig. 4A, hatched column). Under this experimental condition, ∼90% of the drug-stimulated ATPase activity remained unaffected. On the other hand, both the basal and the drug-stimulated ATPase activities of chymotrypsin-cleaved Pgp were inhibited in the presence of drug, MgATP and Vi (Fig. 4, A and B, filled column). Thus, the observations that Pgp does not exhibit basal ATPase activity (14Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Nuti S.L.

Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the basal ATPase activity can selectively be inhibited without affecting the drug-stimulated ATPase activity, together, suggest that these two ATPase activities are coupled in the intact molecule, which are uncoupled upon cleavage of the linker region. Drug Binding to Full-length Pgp—Results presented above suggested that Vi-induced stable inhibition of full-length Pgp at 22 °C requires the presence of drug, whereas similar inhibition occurs in the absence of drug at 37 °C. To obtain direct evidence for these differences, full-length Pgp was incubated at 22 °C or 37 °C with various ligands and [125I]IAAP, a photoaffinity analog of prazosin that binds to the drug-binding site of Pgp (27Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 35Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These preincubation mixtures were exposed to 365 nm of light, and the [125I]IAAP cross-linked Pgp was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Fig. 5A shows that at 22 °C, Pgp binds [125I]IAAP in the presence of MgATP, MgADP and Pi, or MgAMP-PCP. Quantitation of the data from four individual experiments suggested that the amount of [125I]IAAP bound to Pgp is nearly identical in all of the above experimental conditions. These results suggest that, at 22 °C, the drug binding site in Pgp is accessible to drug in the presence or absence of nucleotide in the ATP-binding site. Pgp was also photoaffinity labeled with [125I]IAAP at 37 °C in the presence of various ligands, and the results are shown in Fig. 5B. [125I]IAAP was bound to Pgp in the presence of Vi or MgATP, suggesting that the drug-binding site is accessible under these conditions. Interestingly, when both Vi and MgATP were included in the preincubation mixture, the labeling was reduced to ∼20%. On the other hand, no significant decrease in the amount of [125I]IAAP bound to Pgp was observed when MgATP was replaced with MgADP and Pi, or MgAMP-PCP. These results suggest that, at 37 °C, although the drug binding site is accessible, conformational changes associated with ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis in the active site result in occlusion of the drug-binding site. Thus, the difference in the accessibility of the drug-binding site suggests that Pgp assumes two distinct conformational states. Drug Binding to the Linker Region-cleaved Pgp—The trypsin-cleaved Pgp is a mixture of both the NH2-half (80 kDa) and the COOH-half (60 kDa) of the molecule (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To understand how cleavage of the linker region affects drug binding, the trypsin-cleaved Pgp was labeled with [125I]IAAP in the presence of Vi and MgATP. Fig. 6 shows that although [125I]IAAP binds to both halves of Pgp in the absence or presence of Vi, the amount of label associated with the COOH-half is higher, corroborating the observations of Ambudkar and his co-workers (27Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the presence of Vi and MgATP, the [125I]IAAP binding to the COOH-half was decreased by ∼50%, without significantly affecting the [125I]IAAP binding to the ∼80 kDa NH2-half. Also as noticed by others (27Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), an endogenous ∼65 kDa Sf9 insect cell membrane protein is observed as an [125I]IAAP binding protein, which is not reactive with any anti-Pgp antibodies as judged by Western blotting analyses (not shown). Because equal aliquots of the Pgp tryptic digest were used in these incubations, the amount of a given Pgp peptide in each of these reactions is identical. Thus, the decreased [125I]IAAP labeling is likely attributable to the binding of MgATP to ATP binding site resulting in a conformational change that occludes drug binding to a site located in the COOH-half. This occlusion of drug binding is interestingly similar to the drug-binding site occlusion seen in full-length Pgp at 37 °C. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the linker region mediates conformational change in Pgp. Once the linker region is cleaved, the resulting Pgp conformation at 22 °C is similar to the conformation of full-length Pgp observed at 37 °C. A logical approach to understanding the mechanism of active drug transport by Pgp is to first identify its catalytic cycle intermediates. Senior and his colleagues have first, and subsequently others, demonstrated that Vi induces stable inhibition of Pgp ATPase function in the presence of ATP or ADP (23Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Importantly, Pgp thus inhibited is relatively a stable complex, which allowed the identification of ligands bound to the Pgp molecule. These studies have identified ADP as the trapped nucleotide in the active site of Pgp (23Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The resulting Pgp complex with ADP and Vi, (Pgp.ADP.Vi), was thought to represent a transition state configuration of Pgp in the catalytic cycle (24Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Because the transport substrate is an important participant in the transport cycle, without which Pgp does not exhibit ATPase activity (14Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we and others have investigated the role of transport substrates in the Vi-induced inhibition of Pgp ATPase process. These studies have interestingly indicated that transport substrate is an essential requirement in the stable inhibition of the Pgp ATPase activity (26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Shepard R.L. Winter M.A. Hsaio S.C. Pearce H.L. Beck W.T. Dantzig A.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and further pointed out that, ATP, the hydrolysable nucleotide substrate of Pgp, is the participating nucleotide in this process (26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). On the basis of these requirements in the Vi-induced stable inhibition, we suggested previously that the inhibited Pgp is a complex of ATP, drug, and Vi, (Pgp.ATP.drug.Vi) (26Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14981-14988Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how Pgp.ADP.Vi and Pgp.ATP.drug.Vi are formed and whether these represent different intermediates of the catalytic cycle. Results presented here show the conditions under which the above-mentioned stably inhibited Pgp complexes, Pgp.ATP.Vi and Pgp.ATP.drug.Vi, can be obtained and demonstrate that these represent the intermediates of the catalytic cycle. When Pgp was preincubated with various ligands in the presence of Vi at 22 °C, the drug-stimulated ATPase activity of Pgp could be stably inhibited only in the presence of ATP and drug (Fig. 1). Absence of ATP, or replacement of ATP in the preincubation mixtures with AMP-PCP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, or with ADP and Pi, the hydrolytic products of ATP, did not result in the inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity, suggesting that the inhibition process is not random but highly specific for the drug and ATP. Senior and his co-workers (23Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) have shown previously that the nucleotide bound to the stably inhibited Pgp form is ADP, suggesting that the bound ATP likely undergoes hydrolysis. Together these observations suggest that ATP is the only nucleotide to bind to the ATP binding site and undergo hydrolysis, generating the hydrolytic products in the active site itself for a stable inhibition to occur. Fig. 1 also indicates that Vi-induced stable inhibition of Pgp ATPase activity requires the presence of drug, suggesting that occupancy of the drug-binding site in the Pgp molecule is another essential requirement. To provide direct evidence that the drug-binding site is occupied by the drug, we used [125I]IAAP, a photoaffinity analog of prazosin, because it was firmly shown by others that it binds Pgp with high affinity (27Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 35Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and such binding can be inhibited competitively by verapamil and cyclosporin A (not shown) (27Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 5A show that Pgp binds [125I]IAAP, irrespective of whether or not the combination of ligands in the incubations leads to the stable inhibition of the Pgp ATPase activity in the presence of Vi. These data suggest that, at 22 °C, the drug-binding site in Pgp is available for occupancy and should be occupied for the Vi-induced stable inhibition to occur. These results indicate that, at 22 °C, binding of ATP to the ATP-binding site, and drug to the drug-binding site, are the requisites for the formation of stably inhibited Pgp complex by Vi, and the resulting inhibited species is a complex of Pgp.ATP.drug.Vi. On the other hand, the only requirement for the Vi-induced stable inhibition of Pgp ATPase at 37 °C is ATP (Fig. 2). Because AMP-PCP or ADP and Pi cannot replace the function of ATP in the stable inhibition process, it is likely, as discussed above, that the binding of ATP to the ATP-binding site, and its subsequent hydrolysis in the active site, are the requisites in the formation of Vi-induced stably inhibited Pgp complex. The [125I]IAAP binding characteristics of Pgp at this temperature show that the drug-binding site is in fact available and occupied by drug, irrespective of the presence of Vi or ATP (Fig. 5B). However, when both of these ligands, i.e. Vi and ATP, are simultaneously bound to Pgp, the drug binding was greatly reduced. This reduction in the drug binding occurs specifically in the presence of ATP, because inclusion of ADP and Pi or AMP-PCP in the preincubation mixtures did not significantly alter the amount of radioactivity bound to Pgp. Thus, although the drug-binding site in Pgp is available for occupancy at 37 °C, it is likely that hydrolysis of ATP in the ATP-binding site results in a conformational change in the drug-binding site, leading to its occlusion, or reduction in the affinity for drug binding. It is equally possible that hydrolysis of ATP in the active site results in the de-binding (efflux) of drug from the drug-binding site. Temperature is well known to induce phase transition of lipids in the biomembranes (37Mantsch H.H. McElhaney R.N. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 57: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although the observations made here appear to indicate that temperature is an important parameter influencing the Pgp inhibition process, a closer examination of the data indicates that phase transition of lipids in the biomembranes or any other changes induced by temperature, per se, do not appear to alter the characteristics of Pgp to bind ligands. First, as shown in Fig. 1, Pgp at 22 °C is stably inhibited only in the presence of ATP and drug, and such inhibition at this temperature does not occur when any of these ligands are absent or modified. Second, as shown in Fig. 2, Pgp inhibition takes place in preincubation mixtures that contained ATP and Vi but not in the mixtures containing ADP, ADP and Pi, or AMP-PCP, although all of these preincubations were maintained at 37 °C. Third, the drug-binding site in the Pgp molecule at 37 °C is accessible and is thus occupied by drug in the presence of AMP-PCP or ADP and Pi (Fig. 5B) and appears to be occluded only in the presence of ATP, arguing against the role of temperature in the changes in the drug-binding characteristics. This reasoning also rules out the possibility that an endogenous component in the membrane is made available at 37 °C because of changes in the membrane fluidity at higher temperature that could bind and compete with [125I]IAAP. Importantly, occlusion of drug binding site in the linker region-cleaved Pgp at 22 °C (Fig. 6), which is analogous to the behavior of the full-length Pgp at 37 °C (Fig. 5B), suggests that temperature is not the determining factor in the formation of the two Pgp forms that differ in drug-binding characteristics. Thus, it is likely that Pgp in the Vi-induced stably inhibited complexes obtained at 22 °C and at 37 °C is conformationally different. Although the above commentary suggests that Pgp exists in at least two different conformations, the use of the linker region-cleaved Pgp in these studies further defines the functional characteristics of these states. As shown previously (21Nuti S.L. Mehdi A. Rao U.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3424-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Nuti S.L. Rao U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), cleavage of the linker region results in the exhibition of both basal and drug-stimulated ATPase activities. The basal ATPase activity thus generated can be stably inhibited by Vi in the presence of ATP, suggesting that Pgp complex thus formed is analogous to a conformation assumed by the full-length Pgp in the presence of these ligands (ATP and Vi) at 37 °C. Therefore, this conformational state of Pgp mediates the basal ATPase reaction in the catalytic cycle. As shown in Fig. 4, stable inhibition of basal ATPase activity left the drug-stimulated ATPase activity nearly unaffected, suggesting that the drug-stimulated ATPase activity observed subsequent to the inhibition of the basal ATPase activity is attributable to another conformational state of Pgp. This conformational state of Pgp is analogous to the conformational state (observed at 22 °C), requiring binding of drug, ATP, and Vi for the stable inhibition. Because full-length Pgp that was stably inhibited in either of the above two conformational states failed to exhibit any ATPase activity corresponding to the remaining uninhibited conformational state, it can be inferred that the two Pgp conformations are coupled in the catalytic cycle. Detection of the basal and the drug-stimulated ATPase activities in the linker region-cleaved Pgp suggests that these two conformations of Pgp are uncoupled. Therefore, it is likely that the linker region couples these two conformational states in the catalytic cycle. In conclusion, these studies show two distinct conformations of Pgp in the catalytic cycle, one mediating the drug-stimulated ATPase activity and the other mediating the basal ATPase activity. These two conformations of Pgp are coupled by the linker region, which conjoins the NH2- and COOH-halves of the Pgp molecule. Interestingly, Sauna and Ambudkar (30Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have recently reported the existence of two ATP hydrolytic events in a single Pgp catalytic cycle. Our interpretation that Pgp assumes at least two distinct conformations that exhibit two different ATP hydrolytic events further defines the catalytic cycle."
