However, when skin cells are exposed to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), CTGF is induced in fibroblasts but not in epithelial cells. We have begun to investigate the requirements for the fibroblast-selective induction of CTGF by TGF-β. Previously we found that this response was Smad-dependent. Now we show that protein kinase C and Ras/MEK/ERK are necessary for the TGF-β induction of the CTGF promoter but not of a generic Smad-responsive promoter (SBE-lux). Induction of the CTGF promoter is antagonized by c-Jun or by MEKK1, suggesting that a proper balance between the Ras/MEK/ERK and JNK MAPK cascades is necessary for TGF-β induction of CTGF. We identify the minimal CTGF promoter element necessary and sufficient to confer TGF-β responsiveness to a heterologous promoter and show that a tandem repeat of a consensus transcription enhancer factor binding element, 5′-GAGGAATGG-3′, is necessary for this induction. This element has not been previously shown to play a role in TGF-β induction of gene expression in fibroblasts. Gel shift analysis shows that this sequence binds nuclear factors that are greatly enriched in fibroblasts relative to epithelial cells. Thus Smads, Ras/MEK/ERK, protein kinase C, and fibroblast-enriched factors that bind GAGGAATGG act together to drive the TGF-β-mediated induction of CTGF in fibroblasts.

Indeed in acute drug- or surgery-induced animal models of fibrosis, neutralizing TGF-β action reduces the deposition of collagen (for a review, see Ref. 1Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. New Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Much interest has been devoted to developing anti-TGF-β strategies, such as neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibodies or soluble TGF-β receptor fragments, to combat fibrosis; however, as TGF-β possesses multiple roles in human physiology (4McCartney-Francis N.L. Frazier-Jessen M. Wahl S.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 553-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 5Bottinger E.P Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1355-1360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), generally blocking its effects might be expected to have deleterious effects clinically. Thus, identifying downstream mediators of the profibrotic effects of TGF-β might be useful in developing more clinically appropriate antifibrotic strategies. Accordingly much interest has been recently devoted to the TGF-β target gene CTGF. CTGF, a secreted protein (6Chen Y. Segarini P. Raoufi F. Bradham D. Leask A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) initially identified in the conditioned medium of cultured endothelial cells (7Bradham D.M. Igarishi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), is a member of the CCN (CTGF, Cyr61, andNov) family of proteins that promote angiogenesis, cell migration, and cell adhesion (8Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Recently CTGF knockout mice have been generated; mice homozygous for a deletion of the CTGF gene die soon after birth due to a defect in skeletal development characterized, in part, by reduced expression of bone-specific matrix genes (9Ivkovic S. Gerth N. Segarini P.R. Lyons K.M. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 53: 118Google Scholar). Pathologically CTGF seems to contribute to fibrotic disorders by mediating at least some of the profibrotic effects of TGF-β (10Leask A. Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2002; 4: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A CTGF response element exists in the type I collagen promoter (11Shiwen X. Pennington D. Holmes A. Leask A. Bradham D. Beauchamp J.R. Fonseca C. DuBois R.M. Martin G.R. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mice, subcutaneous injection of TGF-β results only in a transient fibrotic response; however, co-injection of CTGF and TGF-β results in sustained, persistent fibrosis (12Mori T. Kawara S. Shinozaki M. Hayashi N. Kakinuma T. Igarashi A. Takigawa M. Nakanishi T. Takehara K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Thus, CTGF and TGF-β seem to synergize to promote chronic fibrosis. This phenomenon may result from the inherent stickiness of CTGF, which may enhance the activity or stability of TGF-β at low TGF-β concentrations (13Abreu J.G. Ketpura N.I. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Recently we found that a small molecule inhibitor, Iloprost, reduces CTGF expression in vitro and in vivo and alleviates symptoms of fibrosis in vivo (14Stratton R. Shiwen X. Martini G. Holmes A.

Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus understanding how to control CTGF expression would seem to be important in developing novel antifibrotic therapies (16Blom I. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In skin, CTGF is not normally expressed; however, in dermal fibroblasts exposed to TGF-β, CTGF mRNA and protein expression are induced (17Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 19Abraham D.J. Shiwen X.

Pathol. 2001; 54: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The induction of CTGF by TGF-β is cell-type specific, for example, occurring in connective tissue cells but not in epithelial cells (17Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 19Abraham D.J. Shiwen X.

Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of CTGF expression by TGF-β appears to be controlled primarily at the level of gene transcription (16Blom I. Goldschmeding R. Leask A. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 17Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar, 18Grotendorst G.R.

Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of CTGF mRNA by TGF-β is rapid, occurring within 30 min of ligand addition, and does not require de novo protein synthesis as this induction occurs even in the presence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis (17Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β induction of gene expression has been extensively studied and generally involves the action of members of the Smad family of proteins (23Kretzchmar M. Massague M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Activation of TGF-β-mediated gene expression is generally mediated through Smad 2, 3, and 4. Smad 2 and 3 are normally present in the cytosol. Once activated by TGF-β, Smad 2 and 3 become phosphorylated by type I TGF-β receptor kinase and then, after forming a complex with Smad 4, translocate to the nucleus and activate expression of target genes. The inhibitory Smads, Smad 6 and 7, negatively regulate this process. Recent studies have identified a Smad-responsive promoter element, GTCTAGAC, that binds Smad 3 and 4 (23Kretzchmar M. Massague M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Recently we identified a functional consensus Smad binding site in the CTGF promoter that is essential for the TGF-β induction of CTGF in fibroblasts (20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 21Leask A. Sa S. Holmes A. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of Smad 3 and 4 enhanced CTGF expression significantly (20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). TGF-β induction of CTGF did not occur in embryonic fibroblasts cultured from Smad 3 knockout mice (20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), suggesting that TGF-β induction of CTGF occurs in a Smad 2-independent fashion. Intriguingly the Smad binding site of CTGF is insufficient to confer TGF-β responsiveness to a heterologous promoter (21Leask A. Sa S. Holmes A. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional as yet unidentified factors must be required for the TGF-β-mediated induction of CTGF gene expression in fibroblasts. In this report, we elucidate requirements necessary for the TGF-β induction of CTGF in fibroblasts but not in epithelial cells. We identify cis-acting promoter sequences and signaling pathways involved with this induction. To our knowledge this is the first investigation of the regulation of a fibroblast-selective TGF-β-responsive promoter. Our results give new insights into fibroblast-selective TGF-β signaling and suggest methods of developing new antifibrotic therapeutic strategies. Human dermal and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (19Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). MvLu epithelial cells were purchased (ATCC) and cultured in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Cellgro). Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen) or FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by their manufacturers. Compounds used (Go 6850, Go 6976, Go 6983, U0126, SB203580, and SP600125 (all from Calbiochem)) were added at the concentrations indicated 45 min before adding TGF-β2 (Celtrix) for 24 h. Expression vectors (1 or 0.5 μg as indicated) encoding dominant negative Ras (N17, Upstate Biotechnology), active MEKK1 (Stratagene), c-Jun (R. Tjian, University of California-Berkeley), dominant negative c-Jun (TAM67, M. J. Birrer, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), dominant negative MKK4 (R. Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA), YAP65 (Research Genetics, GenBankTM accession number AW215560), or empty expression vector were transfected into each well of a six-well plate along with a full-length CTGF promoter/SEAP reporter expression vector (containing a promoter fragment between −805 and +17 of the CTGF promoter, 0.5 μg; Ref. 14Stratton R. Shiwen X. Martini G. Holmes A. Leask A. Haberberger T. Martin G.R. Black C.M. Abraham D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and CMV-β-galactosidase (0.25 μg, Clontech) as an internal transfection control. An additional reporter construct containing multiple copies of the consensus Smad recognition sequence subcloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (SBE-lux) was from P. Ten Dijke (Ludwig Institute, Uppsala, Sweden). Promoter assays were performed and standardized to β-galactosidase as described (Tropix). Values shown are the average (±S.D.) of at least three replicates and at least two independent trials. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test (p< 0.05). A DNA construct containing nucleotides −805 to −23 of the CTGF promoter subcloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and SEAP reporter gene was as described previously (21Leask A. Sa S. Holmes A. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Additional promoter deletion constructs were generated using Pfu polymerase (New England Biolabs) and appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Sigma Genosys). The resultant DNA fragments were subcloned into TK-SEAP (Clontech). Linker scanning and TEF binding motif mutations were performed using oligonucleotides containing appropriate mutations (Sigma Genosys) and a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were fully sequenced before use. For Western blot analysis, a rabbit polyclonal anti-CTGF antibody was used as described previously (19Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and a mouse anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was utilized. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a kit (Pierce), and protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad). A double-stranded annealed oligomer spanning nucleotides −126 to −77 of the CTGF promoter (Sigma Genosys) was labeled with [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and used as probe (60,000 cpm/reaction). As competitor oligomers, a 100-fold excess of wild-type probe or oligomers otherwise identical to the wild-type probe but bearing mutations in either TEF recognition element were used. To verify previously published data showing that the TGF-β induction of CTGF protein occurred in fibroblasts but not in epithelial cells (17Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar), we cultured human foreskin fibroblasts or MvLu epithelial cells until confluence. Cells were then serum-starved for 18 h and treated with or without 25 ng/ml TGF-β2 for an additional 24 h. Cells were then harvested, and the resultant protein extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis with a rabbit anti-CTGF antibody (Fig.1A, cell layer). Equal amounts of media were also subjected to Western analysis (Fig.1A, media). As anticipated, in the absence of exogenously added TGF-β, neither cell type expressed CTGF. However, TGF-β2 induced CTGF protein expression in fibroblasts but not in MvLu epithelial cells. To assess whether TGF-β induction of CTGF was conferred by elements in the CTGF promoter, we transfected into cells a DNA construct containing a CTGF promoter fragment spanning nucleotides −805 and +17 that was subcloned in front of the SEAP reporter gene (19Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Sa S. Xu Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). After an 18-h serum starvation step, cells were exposed for 24 h to 25 ng/ml TGF-β2. Media were then assayed for SEAP expression. We found that TGF-β potently induced CTGF promoter activity in fibroblasts but not in MvLu cells (Fig. 1B). These results were consistent with previously published observations using a slightly larger CTGF promoter fragment (17Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar). MvLu cells were capable of inducing a Smad-dependent transcriptional response to TGF-β as TGF-β was able to induce expression of a transiently transfected construct expressing a luciferase reporter gene under the control of multimers of a consensus Smad recognition sequence (SBE-luciferase; Fig. 1B). Thus, a CTGF promoter fragment between −805 and +17 responds to TGF-β in a fibroblast-selective fashion. We decided to examine known signaling pathways for their ability to modify the TGF-β induction of CTGF in fibroblasts. For this analysis, we transfected our full-length CTGF promoter/SEAP reporter construct into fibroblasts. After an 18-h serum starvation step, cells were exposed for 45 min to commercially available signal transduction pathway inhibitors. Cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h with or without 25 ng/ml TGF-β2. Preincubation of fibroblasts with the protein kinase C (PKC) α, β, γ, δ, and ε inhibitor Go 6850 (5 μm; bisindolylmaleimide, GF 109203X; Ref. 24Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) blocked the TGF-β induction of CTGF promoter activity (Fig.2, CTGF-SEAP). Smad-dependent TGF-β induction of gene expression seemed not to generally require PKC as Go 6850 did not block the TGF-β2-mediated induction of SBE-luciferase (Fig. 2,SBE-LUX). To further analyze the PKC dependence of the TGF-β induction of CTGF in fibroblasts, we found that the PKC α and β inhibitor Go 6976 (10 μm; Ref. 25Qatsha K.A. Rudolph C. Marme D. Schachtele C. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4674-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) did not affect the TGF-β2-mediated induction of CTGF (Fig. 2). Conversely the PKC α, β, γ, δ, and ζ inhibitor Go 6983 (10 μm; Ref. 26Wang D. Yu X. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33027-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) blocked the TGF-β induction of CTGF (Fig. 2). Thus, by comparing the selectivity of the different PKC inhibitors used, we deduced that PKC γ or δ either alone or in combination is involved in the TGF-β induction of CTGF in fibroblasts. In many systems, MAP kinase pathways are involved in the TGF-β induction of gene expression. For example, TGF-β induces JNK and Ras/MEK/ERK kinase pathways in fibroblasts (Refs. 15Stratton R. Rajkumar V. Ponticos M. Nichols B. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 27Goldberg H.J. Huszar T. Mozes M.M. Rosivall L. Mucsi I. Cell Biol. Int. 2002; 26: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and not shown). We then investigated the role of MAP kinase pathways, namely the Ras/MEK/ERK, p38, and JNK cascades, in the TGF-β induction of CTGF. We found that a 10 μm concentration of the MEK 1 and 2 inhibitor U0126 (28Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) blocked the TGF-β2 induction of CTGF (Fig.2; Ref. 15Stratton R. Rajkumar V. Ponticos M. Nichols B. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Leask A. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1949-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Similarly dominant negative Ras (N17; Ref. 29Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) blocked the TGF-β2 induction of CTGF promoter activity (Fig.3, CTGF-SEAP). As for PKC, the Ras/MEK/ERK cascade did not seem to directly affect the ability of Smads to activate target gene expression as the TGF-β induction of the Smad-dependent reporter SBE-lux was not affected by either U0126 or dominant negative Ras (Figs. 2 and 3,SBE-LUX). We then continued our examination of MAP kinase signaling cascades in CTGF gene regulation. We found that a 20 μm concentration of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (30Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) or a 10 μmconcentration of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (31Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennett B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) had no impact on the TGF-β2 induction of CTGF promoter activity in fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Similarly dominant negative MKK4 (an activator of p38 and JNK; Ref. 32Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) had no impact on the TGF-β2 induction of CTGF promoter activity (Fig.3). However, overexpressing the JNK cascade mediator MEKK1 (33Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) blocked CTGF induction (Fig. 3). Furthermore, overexpressing the JNK target c-Jun reduced the TGF-β induction of the CTGF promoter (Fig. 3). Similarly overexpressing dominant negative c-Jun (TAM67, which lacks the activation domain of c-Jun; Ref. 34Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

We then assessed whether the ability of c-Jun to suppress the TGF-β induction of CTGF promoter activity could be via a Smad-dependent mechanism. First, we found that the ability of overexpressed c-Jun to suppress TGF-β-induced CTGF promoter activity was rescued by overexpressing Smad 3 and 4 (Fig. 3,CTGF-SEAP). Second, we found that c-Jun seemed to generally suppress Smad-dependent activation of target gene expression as overexpressing c-Jun markedly attenuated the ability of TGF-β to induce SBE-lux (Fig. 3, SBE-LUX). These results are consistent with the notion that activated c-Jun might suppress Smad-dependent gene activation by sequestering Smads and preventing them from activating gene expression of non-Ap-1-dependent promoters (see “Discussion”). In summary, our studies investigating the role of MAP kinase pathways in CTGF gene expression implied that the MAP kinase pathway Ras/MEK/ERK is necessary for the TGF-β induction of CTGF promoter expression in fibroblasts and that the JNK MAP kinase cascade is refractory to this process. Therefore, a proper balance between activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK MAP kinase cascade relative to the JNK MAP kinase cascade is important in controlling CTGF induction in fibroblasts. To further characterize the element in the CTGF promoter necessary for its fibroblast-specific induction by TGF-β, we sought to identify elements in the CTGF promoter sufficient to confer fibroblast-specific TGF-β responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. We subcloned a fragment of the CTGF promoter between −805 and −23 upstream of the minimal, non-TGF-β-responsive herpes simplex virus TK promoter (21Leask A. Sa S. Holmes A. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Confirming previous results (21Leask A. Sa S. Holmes A. Shiwen X. Black C.M. Abraham D.J. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we found that, in fibroblasts, the segment of the CTGF promoter lying between −805 and −23 conferred TGF-β responsiveness to the TK promoter (Fig.4A). However, this promoter construct did not confer TGF-β responsiveness to the TK promoter in MvLu epithelial cells (Fig. 4A). Thus, the fragment of the CTGF promoter that lies between nucleotides −805 and −23 is sufficient to confer fibroblast-specific TGF-β responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. To precisely identify the CTGF promoter elements required for fibroblast-selective TGF-β induction, we introduced a progressive series of 5′ and 3′ deletions in the CTGF promoter and assayed the ability of these fragments to confer TGF-β responsiveness to the TK promoter. CTGF/TK promoter constructs that lacked either nucleotides −244 to −143 or −126 to −77 of the CTGF promoter no longer responded to TGF-β in fibroblasts (Fig. 4A). The element in the CTGF promoter between nucleotides −244 and −143 has been extensively analyzed. This CTGF promoter segment consists of two elements involved with CTGF gene expression: the BCE-1 site necessary for basal CTGF promoter activity in fibroblasts (20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and a Smad site necessary for the TGF-β response (Ref. 20Holmes A. Abraham D.J. Sa S. Shiwen X.

Accordingly, for further study, we focused on analyzing the contribution of the region of the CTGF promoter between −126 and −77 to the induction of CTGF by TGF-β2. Nucleotides −351 to −77 of the CTGF promoter conferred TGF-β responsiveness in fibroblasts to the minimal TK promoter (Fig. 4A). However, nucleotides −351 to −126 were not able to confer TGF-β inducibility to the TK promoter (Fig. 4A). To further characterize the contribution of nucleotides −126 to −77 to TGF-β induction of the CTGF promoter, we decided to mutate the −351 to −77 CTGF promoter fragment between nucleotides −126 and −77 and assess the ability of the resultant mutant CTGF promoter fragments to confer TGF-β responsiveness to the TK promoter. The sequence between nucleotides −126 and −77 of the resultant CTGF promoter mutants is shown in Fig.4B. We found that although three of the new mutant CTGF/TK promoter constructs could still respond to TGF-β, constructs bearing mutations that disrupted either nucleotides −97 to −92 or −92 to −83 no longer responded to TGF-β treatment (Fig. 4B,m3 and m4). Interestingly these regions of the CTGF promoter each contain a single copy of the nucleotides 5′-GAGGAATG-3′ (Fig. 5, underlined).

Previous studies have shown that the nuclear receptors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) are involved in the transcriptional regulation of CYP2B genes through the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module (PBREM). However, for humanCYP2B6 the relatively weak response of the PBREM to PXR and CAR activation in transfection assays fails to describe the potent induction observed in primary human hepatocyte cultures. In this report, a novel nuclear receptor response module located −8.5 kilobases upstream from the CYP2B6 encoding region is described. Several potential PXR/CAR binding motifs were identified within the distal regulatory cluster. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, one DR4 motif showed the strongest binding to both PXR and CAR. Transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells demonstrated that the novel distal response cluster could be activated by PXR and CAR. In primary human hepatocytes, both PBREM and the distal responsive element were activated individually by endogenous nuclear receptors upon exposure to prototypical inducers. However, in both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes maximal reporter activation was observed in a construct containing both PBREM and the distal responsive element. In mouse tail-vein injection experiments, a construct containing both the distal responsive element and the proximal PBREM exhibited a strong synergistic expression in phenobarbital-treated mice. These results show that a novel xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module in the distal region of the CYP2B6 promoter (CYP2B6-XREM) together with the PBREM mediates optimal drug-induced expression ofCYP2B6.

Predominantly expressed in liver, members of the CYP1–3 families exhibit broad substrate specificity and metabolize the majority of administered drugs. Although human CYP2B6 was thought historically to play only a minor role in drug metabolism, more recent estimates suggest that CYP2B6 is involved in the metabolism of nearly 25% of drugs on the market today (2Xie W.

In addition, significant interindividual differences in hepatic CYP2B6 expression, which varies in some studies from 25- to 250-fold, have been reported (11Code E.L. Crespi C.L. Penman B.W.

CYP2B6 has been found to be highly inducible by a series of structurally diverse compounds, such as phenobarbital (PB), rifampicin (RIF), clotrimazole (CLZ), phenytoin (PHY), and carbamazepine (16Goodwin B.

Thus, significant drug-drug interactions could occur by induction of this enzyme in patients subjected to combination drug therapy, such as during chemotherapy and treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (19van Heeswijk R.P.

Similar elements have been identified in the promoters of rat and human CYP2Bgenes (22Sueyoshi T. Kawamoto T. Zelko I. Honkakoski P. Negishi M. J. Biol.

The definitive role of CAR in the xenobiotic-induced expression of rodent CYP2B was shown in CAR knockout mice, wherein total ablation of CYP2B10 induction by PB and 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) was observed (23Ueda A.

Recently, the pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2) has been proposed as a xenobiotic-responsive transcription factor that regulates multiple drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (26Bertilsson G.

Utilizing electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays, in vitro cell-based reporter gene transfection assays, and P450 induction assays in primary human hepatocytes, several labs have demonstrated that PXR can bind to the NR1 and NR2 sites within theCYP2B6 PBREM and that known PXR ligands can effectively induce CYP2B6 expression in primary human hepatocytes (16Goodwin B.

Dispos., in press.RIF, which is traditionally known as one of the most potentCYP3A4 inducers in humans, is able to induceCYP2B6 up to 20-fold in primary cultures of human hepatocytes (18LeCluyse E.L. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2001; 13: 343-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar).3 Clotrimazole, which is a PXR agonist and possible CAR deactivator, increased CYP2B6 expression and activity up to 20-fold in some human hepatocyte cultures.2Likewise, the prototypical CYP2B inducer PB caused a 30–70-fold induction of both CYP2B6 mRNA and protein in primary human hepatocytes (16Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar).3 Notably, only small increases (2–4-fold) in reporter gene activity have been observed in transfection assays using constructs containing the PBREM alone (16Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar,28Xie W. Barwick J.L. Simon C.M. Pierce A.M. Safe S. Blumberg B. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3014-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).3 Thus, the potent induction of CYP2B6 gene expression in primary cultures of human hepatocytes cannot be explained entirely by the relatively modest activation of reporter gene constructs containing the PBREM alone.More recently, several lines of evidence show that PXR and CAR regulate target genes such as MDR1, CYP3A4, andCYP2C9 via distal enhancer modules to achieve optimal transcriptional activation (27Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 30Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar module is involved in the PXR and CAR regulation of CYP2B6, which might explain the discrepancy between drug-induced expression ofCYP2B6 in primary hepatocytes and PBREM reporter constructs, we searched for and identified a distal xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module that could specifically bind to PXR and CAR and mediate the transcriptional regulation of CYP2B6. Optimal activation profiles were observed using reporter constructs containing both this novel distal module and the PBREM. Moreover, synergistic effects were demonstrated between these two response modules in in vivotransfection assays conducted in mice. The results from these studies demonstrate that a distal response module in the CYP2B6promoter synergistically functions with the PBREM to achieve maximal drug-induced gene expression.DISCUSSIONA growing body of evidence suggests that human CYP2B6plays a major role in the clearance of a number of drugs. The fact that it is highly inducible by chemicals, such as phenobarbital, rifampicin, clotrimazole, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, underscores the importance of understanding its involvement in drug-drug interactions in patients subjected to combination drug therapy. In this report, we have demonstrated that CYP2B6 is highly induced in primary cultures of human hepatocytes by PB, RIF, PHY, and CLZ. Our results confirm and expand on those that have been reported by several other laboratories (16Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xie W. Barwick J.L. Simon C.M. Pierce A.M. Safe S. Blumberg B. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3014-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).Although it has been a topic of intense debate for more than a decade, the molecular determinants of xenobiotic-induced expression of theCYP2B genes are only now becoming fully appreciated (2Xie W. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37739-37742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

Induction of CYP2B gene expression is predominantly regulated at the transcriptional level. Most findings to date suggest that induction of CYP2B genes by inducers is mediated by activation of the nuclear receptors CAR and/or PXR through the PBREM located approximately −2 kb upstream from the CYP2B gene transcriptional start site. Several studies demonstrate that CAR and PXR can mutually bind to and activate response elements in the promoter regions of several P450 genes, suggesting that cross-talk occurs between these receptors in the regulation of these genes (16Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar, 28Xie W. Barwick J.L. Simon C.M. Pierce A.M. Safe S. Blumberg B. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In contrast to the potent induction of the CYP2B6 gene observed in primary hepatocytes, relatively weak activation of PBREM reporter constructs by prototypical inducers (PB, RIF, PHY, and CLZ) was observed in the present study. In agreement with this observation, Goodwin et al. (16Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar) report that RIF resulted in only a 2.5-fold activation of PBREM reporter constructs in Huh7 cells. Similarly, in CV-1 cells only 3-fold activation of PBREM reporter gene expression was observed by human PXR after RIF treatment (28Xie W. Barwick J.L. Simon C.M. Pierce A.M. Safe S. Blumberg B. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3014-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The relatively weak response of the PBREM to PXR and CAR ligands or activators in in vitro cell-based transfection assays fails to correspond with the potent induction profiles observed with the same compounds in primary human hepatocyte cultures, suggesting that other cofactors or response elements may be involved.Recently, several studies demonstrate that distal response elements are located on several PXR and/or CAR target genes, such asCYP3A4, MDR1, and CYP2C9 (27Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 30Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Considering the discrepancy between the potent induction ofCYP2B6 gene in primary hepatocytes and the relatively weak activation of PBREM, we hypothesized that an additional distal nuclear receptor-responsive element might exist that would be functionally involved in the regulation of CYP2B6. After computer analysis of the −10-kb upstream region of the CYP2B6promoter, a PXR/CAR-responsive element at −8.5 kb was identified that contained several potential nuclear receptor binding motifs, including DR4 and IR6 elements. Notably, a subsequent computer-based search revealed that this cluster of motifs is unique out to −20 kb upstream from the CYP2B6-encoding region. Among these motifs, NR3 and NR8 exhibited the greatest capacity to bind CAR and PXR. Because the NR8 included both the NR3 and an adjacent AGGTCC half-site (Fig. 2), the binding capacity of PXR/RXRα and CAR/RXRα heterodimers to the NR8 most likely is derived mainly from the NR3 motif. Moreover, the NR3 has the most sequence homology to the NR1 motif within the human PBREM, therefore suggesting that the NR3 element plays a pivotal role in this distal-responsive module in mediating the nuclear receptor response.Linkage of a 400-bp cluster containing the NR3 and other identified motifs to the CYP2B6 1.6-kb promoter revealed that this XREM-like module could be activated by PXR or CAR to a similar degree as the PBREM after transfection into HepG2 cells. Of importance, maximal activation of the reporter gene was achieved with a construct containing both the proximal PBREM and the distal XREM. These findings indicate that the distal responsive element is involved in PXR/CAR-mediated transactivation of CYP2B6 gene transcription and suggests that optimal gene regulation may require both elements.Site-directed mutagenesis of the NR3 motif in the B-1.6k/XREM construct reduced reporter activation by CAR or PXR to the level of the B-1.6k construct. This result is significant because it demonstrates that, within the distal response element, NR3 alone appears to be sufficient to confer CAR/PXR-mediated reporter activation. In addition, mutation of NR1 and NR3 individually or simultaneously in the B-1.6k/PB/XREM vector showed that both elements are involved in CAR- and PXR-mediated transactivation of CYP2B6 and that only the double mutation totally eliminated CAR and PXR activation of the reporter gene. These results further demonstrate that NR1 and NR3 in combination contribute predominantly to the overall transcriptional activation of theCYP2B6 gene by drugs and other xenobiotics.In contrast to transformed cell lines, primary cultures of human hepatocytes represent the most reliable in vitro model for evaluating the xenobiotic-mediated induction of CYP in human liver (29Li A.P.

One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that primary hepatocytes retain most of the endogenous cellular and nuclear cofactors that are essential for normal liver function. The current study is the first report demonstrating that both the PBREM and the distal XREM are activated by endogenous nuclear receptors expressed in a primary human hepatocyte culture system. Notably, maximal activation was observed with the B-1.6k/PB/XREM construct that contains both the proximal PBREM and distal XREM. These results further indicate that the two enhancer modules act cooperatively to confer full xenobiotic-induced expression of the CYP2B6 gene as mediated by endogenous nuclear receptors and cofactors.To further investigate the role of the XREM in regulatingCYP2B6 expression, we determined the activation profiles of different CYP2B6 promoter constructs by PB in vivo by conducting mouse tail-vein gene delivery experiments. Both the PBREM and the distal XREM were activated equivalently by endogenous nuclear receptors after exposure to PB. More importantly, however, a synergistic activation of the CYP2B6 reporter construct containing both the PBREM and distal responsive element was observed. Although these results were conducted in mice, this is the first study to demonstrate that, under in vivo conditions, the distal response element functions more efficiently in conjunction with the proximal PBREM to exert maximal drug-induced transactivation of theCYP2B6 gene.The observed synergy between the PBREM and distal elements in our studies is in accordance with an earlier report on CYP3A4, in which a distal XREM located −7 kb upstream from theCYP3A4-coding region was found to mediate PXR-dependent induction in cooperation with a proximal ER6 element (30Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In addition, Geick et al. (27Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) recently reported a distal responsive element at −8 kb upstream of theMDR1 gene that is responsible for the PXR-mediated induction of intestinal MDR1 by RIF. In two recent reports on the nuclear receptor regulation of CYP2C9, response elements located at −2 and −3 kb upstream from the CYP2C9-coding region exhibited activation by CAR but not by PXR (31Ferguson S.S. LeCluyse E.L. Negishi M. Goldstein J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37Gerbal-Chaloin S. Daujat M. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Vilarem M.J. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Notably, RIF is an efficacious inducer of CYP2C9 both in vivo and in primary human hepatocytes (8Gerbal-Chaloin S. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Daujat M. Waechter F. Fabre J.M. Carrere N. Maurel P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 242-251PubMed Google Scholar). With this discrepancy between the induction of CYP2C9 gene expression by PXR activators observed in primary hepatocytes and the lack of response in reporter constructs containing only the proximal 3-kb promoter sequence, it has been proposed that another PXR-responsive element might be present in the distal CYP2C9 promoter region that has not yet been identified (37Gerbal-Chaloin S. Daujat M. Pascussi J.M. Pichard-Garcia L. Vilarem M.J. Maurel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 209-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations suggest that the existence and location of these PXR/CAR distal response elements are critical for optimal xenobiotic-responsive induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters mediated by these nuclear receptors.In summary, we have identified a novel cluster of response elements located −8.5 kb upstream from the CYP2B6-encoding region that is involved in PXR- and CAR-mediated transcriptional activation ofCYP2B6 gene expression. Within this distal cluster of half-sites lies a single DR4 response element (NR3), which is nearly identical to the DR4 element in the human PBREM (NR1) and which bestows most, if not all, of the nuclear receptor-mediated binding and activation properties of the entire module. Moreover, these results demonstrate that the distal XREM-like module operates synergistically with the proximal PBREM for full xenobiotic-induced expression of theCYP2B6 gene.

Predominantly expressed in liver, members of the CYP1–3 families exhibit broad substrate specificity and metabolize the majority of administered drugs. Although human CYP2B6 was thought historically to play only a minor role in drug metabolism, more recent estimates suggest that CYP2B6 is involved in the metabolism of nearly 25% of drugs on the market today (2Xie W.

Underwood J.C.E. General and Systematic Pathology. 3rd Ed. Churchill Livingstone, London2000: 383Google Scholar). They account for more than 3 million deaths each year, mostly among children and immunocompromised adults in developing countries (2Donnenberg M.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Infections usually occur where hygiene is poor as the major route of infection with Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, and Shigella spp. is the consumption of contaminated food (3N. N. Berkow R. Burs M. Beers M.H. Centenial Edition. The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy. Merck Publishing Group, London, United Kingdom2000: 1164-1166Google Scholar) and water (4Szewzyk U. Szewzyk R. Manz W. Schleifer K.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 81-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Despite significant differences among the distantly related genera, a common macromolecular system, the type III secretion system (TTSS1 or secreton), is the basis of each infectious cycle. This system consists of >20 proteins that form a macromolecular assembly, which delivers the bacterial virulence effectors not only across the bacterial inner and outer membranes but also directly into the host cell. The TTSS is well conserved among these bacteria, whereas the specific properties of the effectors and hence the resulting symptomatic effects on the host organism vary widely (5Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTSSs are not constitutively active but are activated to secrete by signals that apparently vary among the different genera, yet they seem to ultimately derive from physical contact between the bacterium and its host cell. Understanding how an activation signal is transmitted in such a complex macromolecular assembly and how it results in secretion is one of the major questions to be answered. 10 of the 25 TTS-encoding genes show a strong similarity to those that encode the flagellar basal body, indicating a common ancestry (5Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insights into the morphology of the system to date are derived from electron microscopy that reveals a supramolecular structure grossly resembling the flagellar hook-basal body complex (6Thomas D. Morgan D.G. DeRosier D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6404-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J.

Science. 1998; 280: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The major TTSS structure seen is termed the needle complex and spans the inner and outer bacterial membranes with a basal body into which a needle (∼70 Å in diameter traversed by a central channel 20–30-Å wide) is inserted that protrudes ∼500 Å into the extracellular space (8Kubori T. Matsushima Y. Nakamura D. Uralil J. Lara-Tejero M. Sukhan A. Galan J.E. Aizawa S. Science. 1998; 280: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 9Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The activation of the Shigella TTSSs for secretion seems to require the contact of the needle tip with the host cell-limiting membrane (7Blocker A. Gounon P. Larquet E. Niebuhr K. Cabiaux V. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). It is particularly difficult to understand how such physical contact leads to a change at the cytoplasmic face of the basal body ∼800 Å away and results in secretion of proteins through the structure. Gross structural homologies can be added to the genetic resemblance to the flagella noted above. Common ancestry has been used to gain insights into the functioning of the TTSSs on the basis of the well studied flagellar system (10Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, TTSS homologues for several of the key flagellum-building blocks, notably hook protein and flagellin, are lacking. Their absence combined with a lack of any detailed knowledge of the TTSS structures involved means that the hypothesis of the common mode of biological function remains unproven. This hypothesis implies that the needle of the Shigella TTSS will be made up by a helical arrangement of the 10-kDa protein MxiH (previously identified to be the major needle component (9Blocker A.

Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)) with an architecture similar to that shared by both the flagellar hook and filament. However, MxiH shows no sequence homology to either the hook or filament subunits and is in fact a much smaller protein being approximately one-fifth the molecular weight of either of the flagellar proteins. Homology between these two systems leads to the hypothesis (10Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) that signal transduction will occur via changes in the architecture of the needle because it is known that the flagellar filament is able to switch between different helical forms (12Samatey F.A.

Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Namba K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test this predicted homology, we have used x-ray fiber diffraction and electron microscopy-based three-dimensional reconstruction techniques to determine the structure of the Shigella flexneri needle at ∼16 Å. We find that as the hypothesis predicts, the MxiH subunits making up the needle are arranged in a helical fashion to form an extended cylindrical structure with a central channel. The parameters that describe the geometry of the helix are very similar to those of the flagellar hook (14Morgan D.G. Macnab R.M. Francis N.R. Derosier D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and filament (15Mimori Y. Yamashita I. Murata K. Fujiyoshi Y. Yonekura K. Toyoshima C. Namba K. J. Mol.

Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) hereafter termedmxiH−/mxiH+++, is plated on a Congo Red culture plate containing kanamycin (50 ॖg/ml), ampicillin (100 ॖg/ml), and trimethoprim (5 ॖg/ml) as selecting antibiotics. Within a week of plating the strain, a single Congo Red-positive colony is selected and grown at 37 °C for 8–10 h in 60 ml of trypticase soy broth, plus antibiotics as above. Using this culture as inoculate, it is diluted 1:100 into the main culture volume of trypticase soy broth (plus antibiotics). After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-औ-d-galactopyranoside at the time of inoculation, the culture is incubated overnight at 37 °C to obtain maximum bacterial density. 107 weight/volume polyethylene glycol 6000 (catalog number 443915V, BDH Ltd.) is added to the culture to precipitate free needles in the media, and the culture is cooled on ice as soon as the polyethylene glycol has dissolved. Cells (and precipitated needles) are pelleted at 2000 × g (all centrifuge runs at 4 °C) in swing-out buckets. The supernatant is discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in 17 the initial culture volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The cell suspension is transferred to a 40-ml Dounce glass-glass tissue grinder (“tight” pestle, manufactured by Wheaton, Millville, NJ) that shaves needles from the cell surface through the exertion of sheer forces. An examination of the sample in an electron microscope showed that 60 cycles of up and down “grinding” were sufficient to remove the majority of needles from the bacteria while keeping most cells intact. The total volume of the suspension is adjusted with phosphate-buffered saline to 27 the initial culture volume and centrifuged at 2000 × g. The pellet is discarded, and the supernatant is spun at 12,000 × g to remove remaining macromolecular contaminants. Trichloroacetic acid protein precipitation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and EM confirmed that the supernatant contained MxiH (in the form of long needles) free from major contaminants. Finally, needles are precipitated by adding polyethylene glycol 6000 and NaCl to a final concentration of 107 and 100 mm, respectively. Following 60-min incubation on ice, needles are pelleted at 27,000 × g. After discarding the supernatant, the small opaque needle pellet is resuspended in ∼0.5 ml of buffer (roughly 0.0017 of the initial culture volume) at a physiological pH (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) when it becomes translucent and stored at 4 °C. This protocol allows ∼5 mg of MxiH (in the form of intact needles) to be purified from a culture of 6 liters of Shigella mxiH−/mxiH+++ grown overnight. Oriented samples of TTSS needles were prepared by a modification of the method of Yamashita et al. (16Yamashita I. Vonderviszt F. Noguchi T. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 17Yamashita I. Suzuki H. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 200 ॖl of needle sample (typically with a concentration ∼8 mg/ml) is diluted approximately twice in a salt-free Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and needles concentrated by centrifugation overnight at 10,000 × gin a swing-out rotor containing a long thin tube (Beckman Rotor SW50.1/55 using 5 × 41-mm tube and suitable adapter). The supernatant is then carefully removed, and 10-ॖl aliquots of the viscous translucent pellet are transferred into quartz capillaries with an internal diameter of 0.7 mm. The capillaries are centrifuged at 2000 × g for 8–24 h in a swing-out rotor to concentrate the needles at the bottom of the capillary. The careful removal of the liquid above this region reduces dilution effects and increases sample stability. Samples were allowed to order in capillaries for 1–3 weeks at room temperature within the bore of a 15 Tesla electromagnet (Magnex Scientific, Yarnton, Oxford, United Kingdom). Capillaries were then mounted in the beam at station 14.2 of the SRS Daresbury, and images were collected on a ADSC scanner using λ = 0.96 Å, d = 407 mm, Δφ = 0°, and exposure time = 300 s. Purified needles were diluted 1:250 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. An aliquot of 5 ॖl was deposited for 1 min on a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid. After the removal of the excess liquid with filter paper, the sample was stained with a drop of 27 uranyl acetate, pH 7.5. The needles were observed with a defocus value of −700 nm in low dose electron beam conditions (≈10 e−/Å2) on a Philips CM12 TEM at 120 kV. Micrographs were recorded at a ×60,000 magnification on Kodak S0163 films. Images were scanned on a Eurocore Hi-SCAN rotating drum scanner at a 1600 dots per inch resolution. Individual filaments were selected using EmTool (ncmi.bcm.tmc.edu/ncmi/software), and image analysis was carried out using SPIDER/WEB (18Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y.H. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar) software package. Three-dimensional reconstructions were done within SPIDER using the iterated helical real space reconstruction method (IHRSR) (19Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Approximately, 10,000 segments (each = 100 pixels or ∼265 Å in length) were extracted from micrographs of the mutant filaments, and roughly 5000 segments were extracted from wild-type needle complexes (9Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The averaged power spectrum was computed for each group of images after only allowing the rotations of the individual segments to make the filament axis vertical. This is because the power spectrum is invariant under translations surmounting the need to align particles. The intensities of the power spectra from each individual segment were simply added to produce an averaged power spectrum. Resolution was determined by generating two reconstructions, each from half of the image segments, and comparing the correlation of Fourier coefficients from these two reconstructions within resolution shells. The coefficient of correlation dropped below 0.5 at a resolution of 12.5 Å, but a significantly more conservative value of 16 Å was used for filtering the final volume. The prerequisite for the majority of biophysical techniques is a highly purified and concentrated sample of the structure to be studied. To facilitate such studies of theShigella flexneri needles, we used a Shigella mxiH− strain harboring a plasmid carrying mxiHunder an inducible promoter (hereafter calledmxiH−/mxiH+++). This strain can be induced to hugely overexpress the needle subunit MxiH. The overexpression of MxiH produces a phenotypic change in the TTSS with the mean needle length changing from ∼500 Å in the wild-type bacteria to ∼3000 Å in the mutant (11Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Using the protocol described above, the needles (3000 Å in length on average) could be shaved from the mutant bacteria and purified to greater than 957 homogeneity as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy analysis (Fig.1). X-ray fiber diffraction (XRFD) can be a useful method for determining helical parameters of filamentous assemblies as well as for obtaining constraints in building pseudoatomic models of helical polymers when only the atomic structure of a monomer is known (20Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no atomic structure exists yet for MxiH. However, XRFD has been used on the needles to provide information that is complementary to that obtainable by electron microscopy (see below). The key to recording high resolution XRFD data is the preparation of a highly ordered, highly concentrated sample of the macromolecular complex to be studied, i.e. the preparation of the biological molecule in the form of a liquid crystal. We used a variation on the method of Yamashita et al. (16Yamashita I. Vonderviszt F. Noguchi T. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,17Yamashita I. Suzuki H. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), which uses repeated centrifugation and equilibration of the samples in a high magnetic field to produce highly ordered needle samples (see “Experimental Procedures”). The exposure of these samples to high intensity x-rays allowed for the collection of patterns such as that shown in Fig. 2. All of the patterns showed the diffraction expected of a helical assembly, demonstrating that MxiH assembles in a helical fashion to produce theShigella needle. The parameters needed to completely define the helical symmetry are the axial rise (along the filament axis) per subunit and the azimuthal rotation (around the filament axis) per subunit. The axial rise per subunit gives rise to a reflection in the XRFD pattern that is on the meridian, and the first meridional reflection was observed at a spacing of ∼1/4.3 Å (Fig.2C). Strong near-meridional reflections were also observed at a spacing of ∼1/24 and 1/5.2 Å. The full interpretation of this pattern comes from using electron microscopy. To obtain more detailed structural information regarding the needle, we collected a series of electron micrographs from negatively stained specimens. The attempts to use conventional methods of helical image analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction (21DeRosier D.J. Klug A. Nature. 1968; 217: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) were not successful in part because of the very weak contrast provided by these thin polymers. Long segments could not readily be found that consistently showed the multiple layer lines needed for Fourier-Bessel methods. Instead, a single particle approach was used (19Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) based on the analyses of overlapping segments extracted from the micrographs (where each segment was ∼265-Å long for the mutant and ∼220-Å long in length for the wild type). The averaged power spectrum derived from these segments (Fig. 2B) is the computational equivalent of the XRFD pattern, because the diffraction intensities have been added from specimens that have been aligned only to have the filament axes oriented in the same direction. Three layer lines with spacings of ∼1/(58 Å), 1/(37 Å), and 1/(24 Å) were seen in both the average spectrum and in the XRFD pattern (Fig. 2). The 1/(24 Å) layer line had peak intensities that were near-meridional, suggesting that it arose from a one-start helix. A reference-free average (22Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) of these segments (data not shown) gave rise to a power spectrum showing these same three layer lines. The 1/(24 Å) layer line was determined to be odd and must correspond to a Bessel order of ±1. The strongest layer line was at 1/(37 Å). An analysis of this layer line showed that it was also odd and that it most likely corresponded to a Bessel order of ±5. Similarly, the layer line at 1/(58 Å) was determined to be even and most likely corresponded to a Bessel order of ±6. The only indexing scheme possible would involve the layer lines at 1/(58 Å) and 1/(24 Å) arising from helices with the same hand and the layer line at 1/(37 Å) arising from a helix with the opposite hand. We are unable to determine the handedness of this structure from these data and have therefore assigned a hand based on earlier reconstructions of the flagellar hook and major filament forms, right-handed one-start helix and left-handed five-start helix (14Morgan D.G. Macnab R.M. Francis N.R. Derosier D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,15Mimori Y. Yamashita I. Murata K. Fujiyoshi Y. Yonekura K. Toyoshima C. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A crude three-dimensional reconstruction was generated by Fourier-Bessel methods from the reference-free average, and this was used as an initial model for the IHRSR method (19Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This method allows for the precise determination of helical symmetry during the course of many cycles where the symmetry is freely allowed to change and, in this case, converged to a structure with ∼5.6 subunits/turn of a 24-Å pitch helix after starting from the preliminary model. A confirmation of this reconstruction was that the trans-form of the image generated from the projection of the structure was found to closely match both the averaged power spectrum and the XRFD data. Since generating either the averaged power spectrum or the XRFD patterns involved no assumptions regarding symmetry, this is a strong check on the reconstruction. The use of very different indexing schemes to generate the starting model either led the IHRSR cycles to diverge with the program terminating when the axial rise per subunit became less than zero (when starting with 7.5 subunits/turn) or led to a three-dimensional reconstruction whose power spectrum did not match the averaged power spectrum or XRFD pattern (when starting with 3.5 subunits/turn). Fig. 3 shows the helical symmetry parameters as a function of cycle number during the course of iterations starting from ∼5.2 subunits/turn. The parameters converge back to approximately the same value obtained when the procedure is started with ∼5.6 subunits/turn. Most importantly, the results of the IHRSR method predict an axial rise per subunit of ∼4.2 Å, well beyond the resolution of the EM images. This is the actual rise (within the level of error introduced by uncertainties in the magnification of the EM images (∼27)) seen in the XRFD pattern as judged by the meridional intensity corresponding to this spacing (Fig.2C). This can completely exclude alternate indexing schemes that would have ∼3.6 or ∼7.6 subunits/per turn of the 24-Å pitch helix, predicting an axial rise of 6.7 or 3.2 Å, respectively. Reconstructions were made from long needles (Fig.4, A and B) and also from wild-type needles (segments extracted from micrographs of intact purified needle complexes prepared as described by Blockeret al. (9Blocker A. Jouihri N. Larquet E. Gounon P. Ebel F. Parsot C. Sansonetti P. Allaoui A. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 652-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar); data not shown). The helical parameters defining both reconstructions converged to similar values (TableI), indicating that the architecture of the needle is essentially unaltered by the overexpression of MxiH. We have conservatively estimated the resolution of the reconstruction to be ∼16 Å, even though a power spectrum generated from this shows a layer line at 1/14 Å that is in good agreement with the layer line observed at this spacing in the XRFD pattern (Fig. 2A). The needle is revealed to be a cylinder of an approximate outer diameter of 70 Å traversed by a central canal of ∼20 Å in diameter. The three-dimensional model shows distinct subunits connected by weaker density in the helix. Assuming that each subunit corresponds to a single copy of MxiH, we can determine an expected molecular volume assuming a partial specific volume of protein of 0.75 cm3 g−1. The reconstruction is reasonable when a threshold is chosen that encloses this volume. If a threshold is chosen that encloses a much smaller or larger volume, the reconstruction is no longer reasonable (e.g. connectivity is lost, the stain filled volume in the center is eliminated, and so on), suggesting that there is a single copy of MxiH per asymmetric unit.Table IHelical parameters determined from the Shigella needle reconstructions and comparison with those obtained for the flagellar filament (13Yamashita I.

Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) that there must be TTSS homologues of either flagellin and/or the hook proteins. Our data show that the needle has the same architecture (∼5.6 subunits/turn, ∼24-Å helical pitch) (Table I) as the flagellar filament (12Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T.

Biol. 1993; 229: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), implying that MxiH and the flagellar hook protein and flagellin must be structural but not sequence homologues of one another. This is somewhat surprising given the huge difference in the size of these two proteins (MxiH is 83 amino acids long, flagellin is 494 amino acids long, and the hook protein 402 amino acids long). However, the three-dimensional reconstruction of the flagellar filament (13Yamashita I. Hasegawa K. Suzuki H. Vonderviszt F. Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Namba K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Mimori Y. Yamashita I. Murata K. Fujiyoshi Y. Yonekura K. Toyoshima C. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) shows homologies other than similarities of helical parameters to our needle structure. The flagellar filament structure can be divided into a series of different domains: D0, an inner tube of ∼70 Å in diameter with a central channel of ∼20 Å; D1, the outer tube that surrounds D0 and has an outer radius of ∼130 Å; and D2 and D3 that project outwards from the helical axis. The fitting of an x-ray crystallographic structure for flagellin into this EM reconstruction allowed Yamashita et al. (13Yamashita I. Hasegawa K. Suzuki H. Vonderviszt F. Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Namba K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to determine that the D0 domain was made up of the N and C termini of flagellin, which were not present in the x-ray model as they needed to be truncated to prevent the protein from polymerizing. The size and helical architecture of the inner tube, D0, is very similar to the structure we present here for the Shigella needle. Therefore, the question arises as to whether the Shigellaprotein MxiH shares any homology with the termini of flagellin. Although we cannot detect any sequence homology, there is some degree of homology at the level of predicted secondary structure (using programs such as PredictProtein/PHDsec (23Rost B. Doolittle R.F. Abelson J.N. Simon M.I. Computer Methods for Macromolecular Sequence Analysis. 266. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 525-539Google Scholar, 24Rost B. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 25Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar) and JPred (26Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar)) because we find that the N and C termini of MxiH and flagellin as well as those of the periplasmic rod, hook, and filament junction proteins give strong predictions for α-helices at their termini. Therefore, our data suggest that the needle represents the minimum core required to build a helix of this size with this architecture. In contrast, the flagellin subunit contains a large inserted domain between the N and C termini that is not required for helix formation but presumably relates to functions strictly required of flagellar filaments. By extending the homology with the flagellar system, it was proposed that the assembly of MxiH into the Shigella needle would require the presence of a cap at the needle tip (10Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Located at the end of the assembling structure, the cap would aid construction by forcing consecutive subunits into the correct position within the helix (27Yonekura K. Maki-Yonekura S. Namba K. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This cap protein would be present in the needle complex at such a low molar ratio to MxiH (and is likely to be of a similar size) that it is not surprising that we do not biochemically detect it in our purified needles. Further experiments will be required to address this issue. The hypothesis of common ancestry is primarily attractive in providing a mechanism by which secretion may be switched on by the tip of theShigella needle contacting a host cell (10Blocker A. Komoriya K. Aizawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a signal is propagated from the needle tip to the ATPase, putatively located at the base of the basal body at an approximate 800-Å distance, is difficult to understand on a molecular level. The flagellar filament is able to switch helical forms depending on the direction of motor rotation or in response to the chemical environment (28Calladine C.R. Nature. 1975; 255: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Switching is thought to be linked to small changes in the conformation of the flagellin subunit, leading to gross architectural changes in the filament as a whole (12Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This in turn leads to changes in the supercoiling of the filaments within the flagellum and thus transmits the change in motor direction to the rotating flagellum. The idea that this helical architecture might be poised to switch between different conformational states suggests that the effect of contact of the needle with the host cell may be to switch the helical state of the needle, thus producing a signal that is almost instantly transmitted to the basal end of the needle and the proteins associated with the basal body. Although this functional hypothesis remains to be proven, our structure in demonstrating that the Shigella needle equates to at least the D0 domain of the flagellar filament provides strong support for the hypothesis that contact-activated secretion byShigella is sensed by changes in the architecture of the needle itself. This remains to be confirmed by studies of activated needles; however, these are likely to be difficult because the preparation of homogenous, highly concentrated samples of activated needles presents many experimental challenges that will need to be overcome. We can now combine all of the structural information regarding theShigella needle to present the model for theShigella TTSS shown in Fig. 4C. This figure illustrates the global assembly of the TTSS and reinforces the structural similarities to the flagellar hook-basal body complex, raising interesting questions on how substrates are recruited, partially unfolded, and secreted. In particular, understanding the nature of the interfaces between the basal body and the needle and understanding the nature of the interfaces between the needle and its putative cap, which may allow a signal to be transduced to produce secretion, remain an interesting challenge.

HRG induces tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Our investigation into whether HRG is a factor likely to promote tumor formation independently of erbB-2 overexpression concludes that blockage of HRG expression suppresses the aggressive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by inhibiting cell proliferation, preventing anchorage-independent growth, and suppressing the invasive potential of the cells in vitro. More importantly, we observed a marked reduction in tumor formation, tumor size, and a lack of metastasis in vivo. These studies were achieved by blocking HRG expression in MDA-MB-231 cells using an HRG antisense cDNA. In the search for the mechanism by which blockage of HRG reverts this aggressive phenotype, we discovered that the cells in which HRG is blocked exhibit a marked decrease in erbB activation and a significant reduction in MMP-9 activity, demonstrating a direct causal role in HRG induction of tumorigenicity. Our study is the first report and serves as a proof of the concept that HRG is a key promoter of breast cancer tumorigenicity and metastasis independently of erbB-2 overexpression and should be deemed a potential target in developing therapies for breast cancer."

Syndecans are transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that play roles in cell adhesion, growth factor binding and presentation, regulation of lipases, and bacterial and viral entry among other functions (reviewed in Refs. 1Bernfield M.

Of the four mammalian syndecans, syndecan-4 appears to have a unique role in cell adhesion, acting in concert with the integrin family of matrix receptors (4Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol.

When primary fibroblasts adhere to the RGD-containing, cell-binding domain of fibronectin through α5β1 integrin, they attach and spread well but do not form focal adhesions or stress fibers (5Woods A.

Biophys. 2000; 374: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary cells leads to the formation of larger focal adhesions and thicker stress fibers, whereas transfection with cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants lacking the central variable (V) region prevents their formation (9Longley R.L.

All syndecans have short cytoplasmic tails with conserved amino acid sequences proximal (C1) and distal (C2) to the membrane with an intervening sequence unique to each family member (V region) (1Bernfield M.

The 4V peptide also binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which also partially activates PKCα. The combination of 4V and PIP2 results in a superactivation of PKCα and removes the dependence on calcium for activation (12Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

It can superactivate both PKCα and PKM (the free catalytic domain derived after calpain cleavage), and both PKCα and PKM interact with syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain as shown by coimmunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, and solid phase assays (11Oh E.S.

These interactions require prior PKC activation, which can translocate this kinase to the plasma membrane. PKCα, in addition to syndecan-4, is present in some focal adhesions (4Woods A. Couchman J.R.

To understand the molecular basis for the pathway of PKCα activation, identification of the interaction sites in the kinase and in syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain is essential. In this study, we used yeast two-hybrid assays to confirm the specificity of interaction of 4V with the PKCα isoform and to identify 1) the site in the PKCα catalytic domain that interacts with the syndecan-4 V region, 2) the requirements for syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain self-association, and 3) a specific residue within syndecan-4 that is needed for the interaction. Furthermore, we show that this interaction is biologically relevant since overexpression of syndecan-4 in REF cells results in increased association of PKCα with syndecan-4 and increased PKCα localization in focal adhesions. This is dependent on the V region of syndecan-4 and specifically requires tyrosine 192. Standard PCR techniques (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

For the yeast two-hybrid assays, syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail constructs were cloned into pLexA vector for baits, and PKC constructs were cloned into pB42AD vector as preys (Clontech). Human PKCα, -δ, and -ε cDNA were obtained from ATCC. For yeast two-hybrid constructs, all PKCα deletion and syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tails were generated with pairs of degenerate PCR primers having terminal EcoRI andXhoI restriction enzyme sites. To generate GST·PKC constructs, yeast two-hybrid inserts were excised and ligated into pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and ligation products were sequenced and transformed into the bacterial strain JM109 for protein expression.Figure 2Interaction between syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain and PKM subdomains.

To construct the His6/Xpress-containing tag from the pcDNA3.1 vector, HisCF primer (5′-CAAGCTGACTAGTGTTTAAAC-3′) was used (the SpeI site is underlined). The ligation products were sequenced and cotransfected into S2 cells with pCohygro selection vector at a plasmid ratio of 19:1 (w/w) using calcium phosphate (as per the manufacturer's protocol). Stable transfectants were selected with DES® medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks, and protein expression was induced with 500 μm CuSO4 for 3 days.

To test interactions, both bait and prey were transformed into yeast strain EGY48 (MATα, ura3, his3, trp1, LexAop(x6)-leu2) harboring p8op-lacZ reporter plasmids by the LiCl2/ssDNA/PEG method (24Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 25: 1425Crossref Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on selection media lacking uracil, histidine, and tryptophan and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. Colony growth was monitored by the X-Gal whole plate method on selection plates containing 80 μg/ml X-Gal lacking uracil, tryptophan, histidine, and leucine and by liquid β-galactosidase assays withO-nitrophenylglycoside (Sigma) for quantification (as per Clontech manufacturer's protocol). Statistical significance was determined by Student's ttest. Expression of prey constructs in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting (not shown) using hemagglutinin polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen). His6- and Xpress epitope-tagged full-length PKCα, its regulatory domain, and PKM were expressed in S2 Drosophila cells (Invitrogen). For small PKCα constructs, the GST fusion expression and purification system was used (Amersham Biosciences). His6/Xpress constructs were purified by Ni2+ agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and GST constructs were purified by glutathione bead chromatography (as per the manufacturer's instructions). Except for PKM1, all small fragments showed a tendency for degradation. Synthetic 4V peptide (CLGKKPIYKKA; Synpep, Dublin, CA) was immobilized to Sulfo-Link agarose beads (Pierce). Purified proteins were subjected to 4V-conjugated bead pull-down assays (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using monoclonal Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) or polyclonal GST antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NJ) to detect bound protein. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs), REFs overexpressing wild type syndecan-4 (S4), or truncated at arginine 175 (S4ΔR), isoleucine 191 (S4ΔI), or glutamic acid 198 (S4ΔE) were subjected to immunoprecipitation as previously (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These constructs were cloned into LK444 vector under the control of a β-actin promoter. 2R. L. Longley, S.-T. Lim, J. R. Couchman, and A. Woods, manuscript in preparation.Subconfluent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were transferred into new tubes and precleared with 10% fetal bovine serum-blocked protein-A conjugated Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Preclearing beads were removed, and the supernatants were incubated with monoclonal antibody 150.9 against syndecan-4 core protein for 45 min at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) were added for 30 min prior to further addition of protein A-coated beads for 30 min at 4 °C. For displacement assays, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 0.2 μg/ml GST·PKM subdomain proteins for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound complexes were separated by 3–15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using monoclonal anti-PKCα (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-PKCδ, or goat anti-PKCε (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The blot was then incubated with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min, washed three times for 10 min in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween, 100 mm NaCl), and reprobed with anti-GST. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with template rat syndecan-4 in pcDNA3 vector using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and PCR (30 s at 94 °C, 16 min at 68 °C, 30 s at 55 °C with 15 cycles) for amplification. Tyrosine 192 in the central V region was changed to phenylalanine using complementary forward 5′-gcaagaaacccatcttcaaaaaagccc-3′ and reverse 5′-tgggcttttttgaagatggctttcttgc-3′ primers. The underlined sequences are mutation targets. After PCR, parental (template) plasmid DNAs were digested with the restriction enzyme DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C and transformed into XL-Blue competent cells. Mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the 5′-upstream sequencing primer, 5′-ctgaggtcttggcagctc-3′. Six μg of mutated and wild type syndecan-4 constructs were transfected into REF cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 18 h in serum-free media. Transfected cells were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks. Increased cell surface expression of syndecan-4 was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (not shown) at University of Alabama at Birmingham flow cytometry core facility and by staining with 150.9 monoclonal antibody. REFs and stable transfectants were seeded onto coverslips for 24 h and fixed and permeabilized with 3.5% paraformaldehyde containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Cells were stained with monoclonal anti-PKCα, rabbit polyclonal anti-PKCδ, goat polyclonal anti-PKCε, monoclonal anti-vinculin (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG or goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC), rabbit anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-rabbit IgG, conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red dependent on the combination of primary antibodies. Cells were viewed on a Nikon Optiphot microscope and photographed with Ilford HP5 film. Yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between the V region of syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain and PKCα. The syndecan-4 constructs used for these and self-association assays are shown in Fig.1A, and the structure of PKCα and its constructs are shown in Fig. 1, B andC. Monitoring colony growth on selective media, 4L, which codes for the full-length cytoplasmic domain, did not interact with any PKCα construct (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with previous biochemical data indicating a lack of PKCα by 4L in the absence of PIP2 (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 4V (which codes for the peptide sequence LGKKPIYKK) interacted well (Fig. 1C) with the −PS construct, which lacks the pseudosubstrate site that masks the catalytic site and is an active form of PKCα but interacted less strongly with full-length PKCα. These results are consistent with a need for prior activation of PKCα before binding to the 4V peptide in in vitroassays (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and PKC activation during cell spreading (21Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 4V(YF), where tyrosine 192 of 4V was mutated to phenylalanine, did not show interaction in colony growth assays (Fig. 1C). Deletion of the C2 domain in 4L (C14V) did allow interaction (Fig.2A). Despite the fact that most activators of PKCs bind to the regulatory domain (Fig.1B), no interaction was detected between syndecan-4 baits and PKCα regulatory domain (Fig. 1C). However, a clear interaction was detected between syndecan-4V and PKCα catalytic domain (PKM). Colony growth assays were complemented by quantitative β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1D), which confirmed these interactions. To determine more precisely the interaction site(s), syndecan 4V or C14V baits were used in further experiments with smaller PKM fragments. Yeast transformed with PKM1 or 4 showed no growth, but colony growth assays indicated an interaction of PKM5 with syndecan-4 (Fig. 2A). PKM2 showed occasional slight growth activity. The growth assays were again confirmed by β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 2B). The PKM5-binding site for syndecan-4 (amino acids 513–672) contains an important module for activation of PKCα, two autophosphorylation sites at threonine 638 and serine 657 (25Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Bornancin F. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3544-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To confirm the interactions between syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain and PKCα detected in yeast two-hybrid assays, recombinant PKCα fromDrosophila S2 cells and GST·PKM subdomains from bacteria were subjected to pull-down assays with syndecan-4V-conjugated beads. Full-length PKCα bound to immobilized 4V peptides (Fig.3A), but consistent with the yeast two-hybrid analysis, no binding of the regulatory domain (Reg) was detected. There was no binding of PKCα, Reg, or PKM to beads blocked with cysteine as a negative control (not shown). Previous studies showed that PKCα does not bind to beads conjugated with the syndecan-2V region (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A higher proportion of input PKM than PKCα bound to 4V-conjugated beads. Neither PKM1 nor PKM4 bound to 4V-conjugated beads (Fig. 3B), whereas PKM5 did bind, albeit to a lesser extent than intact PKM. PKM3, which contains PKM4 and PKM5, bound to a higher extent than PKM5, possibly due to increased stability (not shown). Further truncation of the PKM5 construct indicated that a peptide containing the C-terminal 41 amino acid sequence still interacted with the syndecan-4 V peptide (not shown), but results were less reproducible, and the isolated peptide appeared to be unstable. Previous in vitro studies using synthetic peptides demonstrated that 4V peptides oligomerized to form dimers and larger oligomers up to octamer size, based on gel filtration chromatography (14Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and NMR spectroscopy (15Lee D. Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Lee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13022-13029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but 4L peptides remained mostly as monomers with some dimers. Syndecan 4L peptides did not bind added PKCα in in vitro assays except when induced to oligomerize in the presence of PIP2 (11Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 12Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and 4L baits in this present study did not interact with PKCα or PKM in yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 1C). We, therefore, monitored the self-association activity of syndecan-4 tail baits by yeast two-hybrid assays. When 4L was used as both prey and bait, no growth was detected in colony growth assays (Fig.4A). In contrast, transformants containing syndecan 4V constructs exhibited strong growth, indicative of self-association. Interestingly, mutated 4V(YF), which forms dimers but does not activate PKC in vitro (12Oh E.S. Woods A. Lim S.T. Theibert A.W. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10624-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), also self-associated when analyzed by yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig.4). Thus, the central tyrosine 192 residue appears to be important in binding to PKCα, rather than in self-association. A critical role for tyrosine 192 is confirmed by a lack of interaction with PKM in yeast two-hybrid assays (Figs. 1C and 6C). C1(SD)4V constructs, where serine 183 is mutated to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation, did not self-associate (Fig. 4). Other studies indicated that a 4L peptide phosp"
https://openalex.org/W2158068988,"Cdc25B is a dual-specific phosphatase that mediates cell cycle progression by activating the cyclin-dependent kinases. It has been shown to possess oncogenic potential. To elucidate its potential contribution to human prostate cancer development, the expression profile of Cdc25B protein in human patients was analysed by immunohistocytochemistry. Cdc25B is frequently overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissues (29 of 30; 97%). In addition, the overexpression is more profound in the tumors of high combined Gleason scores and in late stages. Subsequently, we demonstrated that Cdc25B acts as a coactivator for AR in a hormone-dependent manner in the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. This coactivator function, surprisingly, is independent of its cell cycle functions. Cdc25B, on the other hand, directly interacts with AR as evidenced in GST-pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assays. In addition, it is also able to enhance AR-mediated transcription in synergy with other coactivators, including CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP associated factor. Therefore, upregulation of Cdc25B in human prostate cancer and its interplay with AR may contribute to prostate cancer development."

Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). It has been shown that high [Ca2+] (100–500 μm) is necessary for PTP opening in isolated mitochondria (1Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar), but this [Ca2+] is not attained in the cytosol of intact cells. It has been proposed that mitochondrial Ca2+overload in intact cells can trigger the opening of PTP and release of proapoptotic factors during neuronal ischemic and/or excitotoxic cell death (4Schinder A.F. Olson E.C. Spitzer N.C. Montal M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6125-6133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), but the downstream events that couple the rise in calcium to cell death are unknown. Mitochondrial Ca2+ overload would be a side result of the rise in the cytosolic Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]c) promoted by Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane receptor-operated and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. When the [Ca2+]c increases, Ca2+ is taken up into the mitochondria via the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), a low affinity, high capacity Ca2+ transport system driven by the ΔψM. Since uptake through MCU is a function of ([Ca2+]c) (6Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its extent critically depends on both the magnitude and duration of the [Ca2+]c rise (7Montero M. Alonso M.T. Carnicero E.

In the ischemic/excitotoxic stress model, the precise role of Ca2+ overload in neuronal cell death is too complex to trace (5Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Stress stimuli often produce, in addition to Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane, other effects, including (i) changes in membrane potential that can activate a variety of ion channels, (ii) metabolic changes that may lead to free radical production, (iii) activation of kinases, and (iv) release of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Release of Ca2+ from the stores may be particularly relevant, as Ca2+ depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) blocks protein synthesis and is proapoptotic per se(8McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 142: 343-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 161-168PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is induced through Ca2+-dependent pathways in several cell types. This raises the question of whether Ca2+ influx is sufficient for cell death. An apoptotic pathway involving up-regulation of the FasL gene has been extensively studied in T cells (10Strasser A.

This activation-induced cell death (AICD) pathway can be triggered by receptors that stimulate phosphoinositide turnover, such as the T cell receptor or the human muscarinic type 1 receptor (HM1R), which produce an increase in [Ca2+]c by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release from ER and capacitative Ca2+entry. This is followed (>6 h) by calcium-dependent up-regulation of FasL mRNA expression (12Izquierdo M. Ruiz-Ruiz M.C. López-Rivas A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 21-28PubMed Google Scholar, 13Dhein J., H., W.

Sci. 1999; 14: 161-168PubMed Google Scholar). We address here the specific role of Ca2+ overload as a cell death trigger by transiently expressing vanilloid receptor type 1 (VR1) (17Caterina M.J.

VR1 is a receptor-operated Ca2+ channel, which is naturally expressed in some neurons (17Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Lavine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7218) Google Scholar), peripheral blood T lymphocytes, and Jurkat cells (18Schumacher M.A. Moff I. Sudanagunta S.P. Levine J.D. J. Biol.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Selective activation of VR1 with capsaicin allows for the control of Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane and the study of specific effects of [Ca2+]c rises in our model. Since the T cell line used in this study also expresses HM1R, the effects of Ca2+ influx (through VR1) and Ca2+release from the ER (through HM1R) can be directly compared. We find that sustained Ca2+ entry though VR1 but not Ca2+ release from ER induced by HM1R causes fast mitochondrial damage with loss of ΔψM and caspase-independent, paraptotic cell death. This cell death pattern is completely different from AICD, thus revealing that different programmed cell death pathways can coexist in the same cell and be selectively induced by diverse stress stimuli. J-HM1–2.2 cells expressing the human HM1R have been previously described (20Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker Europe) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 mml-glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml; Bio-Whittaker Europe), and 0.5 mg/ml G418 as a selection medium for expression of the HM1R. The anti-Fas (clone CH-11) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd. Rabbit polyclonal Anti-AIF was a kind gift from Dr. Susin (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome C was from Pharmingen (clone 6H2.B4). Human polyclonal anti-mitochondria Ab was from Dr. A. Serrano. Reagents used include 8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamida (capsaicin; Sigma), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma), and Z-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD; Bachem AG). Monoclonal antibody 12C4 against cytochrome oxidase subunit II was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and AC15 monoclonal antibody anti-β-actin was from Sigma. The pEF-GFP-VR1 plasmid was generated by subcloning the VR1 cDNA into the plasmid pEF-GFPC1 (21Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using theSalI and KpnI restriction sites. For that purpose, the VR1 cDNA was subcloned into pCDNA3 (17Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Lavine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (7218) Google Scholar) and was amplified by PCR with ECOTAQ Plus polymerase (Ecogen, Ltd.), using the oligonucleotides VR1.1 (GGAATTCCGTCGACATGGAACAACGGGCTAGC) and VR1.2 (GCTCTAGAGGTACCGCGGCCGCTTATTTCTCC). The construction of expression plasmids pEF-p35 and pEF human Bcl-2 (pEFhbcl-2) was previously described (22Claveria C. Albar J.P. Serrano A. Buesa J.M. Barbero J.L. Martinez A.C. Torres M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7199-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For some experiments involving measurement of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH2) oxidation by flow cytometry in the FL1 channel, VR1 cDNA was subcloned into the pEF4/Myc-His B expression plasmid (pEF-VR1) (Invitrogen). For transfection, cells in logarithmic growth were transfected with 20–30 μg of the pEF-GFP-VR1 plasmid by electroporation at 270 V/975 microfarads using the Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. J-HM1–2.2 cells stably expressing baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35 were obtained by transfecting J-HM1–2.2 cells with pEF-p35 plasmid and five rounds of selection with anti-Fas. These cells expressed similar levels of Fas on the cell surface as compared with parental J-HM1–2.2 cells. The expression of the GFP-VR1 protein was analyzed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy. For the Western blot analysis, transfected cells were lysed for 10 min in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant protein was electrophoresed (25 μg/lane) on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot (WB). For the flow cytometry expression assays, cells were resuspended in PBS-propidium iodide (PI; 200 ng/ml) and then analyzed (Coulter Epics XL-MCL). Data analysis was performed with System II software (Coulter) by measuring the green (505–545 mm; FL1) fluorescence in the cells excluding PI (605–635 mm; FL3). Single cell measurements of [Ca2+]c were performed by time-resolved ratiometric digital imaging fluorescence microscopy in cells loaded with the low affinity Ca2+ dye fura-4F. The dye was loaded into the cells by incubation with 4 μm fura-4F/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 60 min at room temperature, in standard solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES-sodium, pH 7.4. Cells were then washed with fresh medium, resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml, and used for measurements. Coverslips (12-mm diameter) were coated with fibronectin by incubation (2 h, 37 °C) in PBS containing 20 μg/ml fibronectin (from human plasma; Sigma), followed by incubation in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (1 h, 37 °C). Coverslips were mounted under the microscope (Diaphot; Nikon) in a 37 °C chamber, and 105cells loaded with fura-4F were attached to the coverslip during 10 min. Test solutions were applied by continuous perfusion at 2–3 ml/min. This allowed >95% exchange of the medium bathing the cells within 5–10 s. For fluorescence measurements, cells were alternately epi-illuminated at 340 and 380 nm. Light emitted above 520 nm was recorded by an extended ISIS-M camera (Photonic Science, Robertbridge, East Sussex, UK) and analyzed using an Applied Imaging Magical image processor (Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, UK) with 32-megabyte video RAM. Sixteen video frames of each wavelength were averaged by hardware with an overall time resolution of about 5 s for each pair of images at alternate wavelengths. Consecutive frames obtained at 340- and 380-nm excitation were rationed pixel by pixel, and the [Ca2+]c was estimated using the following formula (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar): [Ca2+]c =Kd·β·{(R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R)}, where R is the ratio between the fluorescence emissions measured at 340- and 380-nm excitation,Rmax and Rmin are the ratios obtained at saturation of the dye with Ca2+ and in the absence of Ca2+, respectively, Kd is the dissociation constant for the dye (0.77 μm), and β is the ratio of the maximal (in the absence of Ca2+) and the minimum (at saturation with Ca2+) fluorescence emissions measured at 380-nm excitation. The values ofRmax and Rmin and β were determined in cells permeabilized to Ca2+ with ionomycin and perfused with media containing either no Ca2+(5 mm EGTA) or 10 mm Ca2+. These values were similar to the ones obtained with fura-2. These procedures have been previously described (24Villalobos C. Nunez L. Garcia-Sancho J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The standard perfusion solution was as described above for fura-4F loading except that bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and EGTA (50 μm) were added to prevent spontaneous activation of cells during measurements. For the Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was omitted from the standard perfusion solution, and 100 μm EGTA was added. Detection and quantification of apoptosis at the single cell level was determined using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which labels DNA strand brakes (TUNEL assay), following the manufacturer's instructions, followed by flow cytometry analysis. DNA degradation was determined by measuring the orange-red (555–600 mm; FL2) fluorescence in both GFP-VR1+ and GFP-VR1− cells. DNA degradation was determined by staining cellular DNA with PI, followed by flow cytometry analysis. Briefly, transfected cells (0.5–1 × 106) were fixed and permeabilized in 70% ethanol (−20 °C) for 5 min in order to preserve GFP fluorescence. Cytosolic DNA fragments were then extracted by incubation with DNA extraction buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4, 1 mm citric acid, 10 min). Finally, cells were resuspended in DNA staining solution (PBS; 100 μg/ml RNase A, 20 μg/ml PI) before analysis by flow cytometry. DNA degradation was determined as the percentage of DNA located in the sub-G0/G1 peak of the cell cycle in both GFP-VR1+ and GFP-VR1− cells. For the determination of DNA fragmentation in oligonucleosomal fragments (DNA laddering), total cellular DNA was extracted from 106 cells using the Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Half of the DNA obtained was loaded on 1.5% agarose gel and electrophoresed. PS exposure was evaluated by staining the cells with annexin V-PE (BD Pharmingen) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; Sigma) following the instructions given by the manufacturer. Calcium-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2 mm EGTA to chelate calcium from fetal calf serum and the same medium plus 2 mm CaCl2 were used in experiments that required the absence of extracellular calcium. Briefly, cells treated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.1 μmcapsaicin unless otherwise indicated) were collected by centrifugation, washed once in PBS, and incubated for 5 min with annexin V-PE in the appropriate binding buffer. Cells were then incubated for 5 min with 7-AAD (1 μg/ml) and analyzed by flow cytometry. GFP-VR1+cells and GFP-VR1− cells were electronically gated, and PS (phosphatidylserine) exposure and 7-AAD permeability were analyzed in both populations. For continuous recording of annexin-V binding, cells were incubated with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with up to 2.5 mm CaCl2, and annexin-V PE binding was measured in gated cell populations by the increase in FL2 fluorescence. Active caspase-3 in cells transfected with the pEF-GFP-VR1 plasmid was detected using the PE-conjugated polyclonal active caspase-3 antibody apoptosis kit 1 (BD Pharmingen), followed by flow cytometry analysis of the orange-red (555–600 mm; FL2) fluorescence in the GFP-VR1+ and GFP-VR1−cells. Total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (HybondTM ECLTM; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS buffer. Subsequent antibody incubations and membrane washes were performed in 0.5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 buffer. The blot was developed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies using ECL reagents. Changes in ΔΨm were determined by staining the cells after transfection with 100 nm MitoTracker Red (CMX-Ros; Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were then washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution, supplemented or not with calcium (2 mm) when required, and analyzed by flow cytometry by measuring the red (605–635 mm; FL3) fluorescence in both GFP-VR1+ and GFP-VR1− cells. The decrease in ΔΨm is seen as a decrease in CMX-Ros fluorescence. Control experiments were performed using CCCP (10 μm; Sigma). For the continuous recording of measurements determining ΔΨm changes, cell suspensions were kept at 37 °C during data acquisition (20 min). Release of cytochromec and AIF from the mitochondria to the cytosol in sorted GFP-VR1+ and GFP VR1− cells was analyzed by Western blot analysis as previously described (25Chandra J. Niemer I. Gilbreath J. Kliche K.O. Andreeff M. Freireich E.J. Keating M. McConkey D.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants (cytosolic extracts free of mitochondria) and pellets (particulate fraction that contains mitochondria) from digitonin-permeabilized cells were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then analyzed by WB using anti-cytochrome c antibody (7H8.2C12; BD Pharmingen) or polyclonal anti-AIF antibody as described above. To verify proper separation of the mitochondria, membranes were reprobed with anti-cytochrome oxidase antibody. Protein loading was normalized by using an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody. Transfected cells (106) were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, preincubated in 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (anti-mitochondria, anti-cytochrome c, anti-AIF) in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were washed three times with the same buffer and incubated for 1 h with goat Fab2 anti-human Cy3, goat Fab2 anti-mouse Cy5, or goat Fab2 anti-rabbit Cy5 (Jackson Immunoresearch Inc.), respectively. After antibody staining, cells were labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole following standard protocols. Confocal images were captured with Bio-Rad microscope model Radiance 2000 MP with four lasers, argon (488 nm), helium-neon (543 nm), red laser diode (633 nm), and infrared multiphoton (Mira 690–1000 nm), mounted on an Olympus IX70 microscope and using a ×60 Plan Apo NA, 1.4 objective. For visualization of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole we used two-photon excitation at 760 nm and emission filter HQ390/70. Oxidative/nitrative stress was measured by analyzing DCFH2 oxidation to DCF. To this end, cells transfected with pEF-VR1 plasmid were labeled with 10 μmcell-permeable DCFH-DA (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) for 30 min, washed, and challenged for the indicated periods of time with different stimuli. The fluorescence corresponding to the oxidized probe was followed by measuring the green (505–545 mm; FL1) fluorescence in the annexin V-PE+ population (555–600 mm; FL2). We constructed an N-terminal GFP fusion protein (Fig.1A) that enabled us to simultaneously follow the expression of VR1 (by GFP fluorescence) and the functional consequences of VR1 stimulation with capsaicin in transient expression experiments with J-HM1–2.2 cells. The GFP-VR1− cells in this heterogeneous cell population constituted an excellent internal control for the functional experiments. In routine experiments, GFP-VR1 expression was achieved in 20–40% of Jurkat cells, as evidenced by flow cytometry (Fig.1B). Expression of the construct was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C), and its localization to the plasma membrane was assessed by confocal microscopy (Fig.9B).Figure 9Ca2+influx-dependent paraptosis does not involve cytochromec or AIF release. A, GFP-VR1− and GFP-VR1+ sorted cells were analyzed for cytochrome c release to cytosol by WB after treatment with capsaicin (0.1 μm, 45 min) or actinomycin D (2 μg/ml, 4 h) as a control. B, cytochromec (Cyt c) redistribution was analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence in GFP-VR1+ and GFP-VR1−cells treated as indicated in A. A polyclonal anti-human mitochondria (MIT) antibody was used for co-localization (47Ruiz-Vela A. Gonzalez de Buitrago G. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4988-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). C, same as in A, but AIF release to soluble fractions was assessed by WB by using polyclonal anti-AIF. As a control, cells were treated with staurosporin (sts; 2 μm) for 1 h. Mitochondria contamination in the soluble fractions was assessed by using anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COX). D, AIF redistribution was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence. DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To characterize calcium transport through the VR1 channel, we followed the Ca2+ influx induced by capsaicin by single cell ratiometric calcium imaging in cells loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+probe (fura 4F, Kd for Ca2+ = 0.77 μm), which allows for an accurate estimation of [Ca2+]c in the micromolar range. Cells bound to coverslips were superfused with the appropriate solutions, and fluorescence emission was imaged for [Ca2+]cquantitation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Individual cells expressing GFP-VR1 were identified by their fluorescence at the end of each experiment, and Ca2+ influx in GFP-VR1+and GFP-VR1− cells present in the same field was analyzed separately. Sequential stimulation of cells with capsaicin and carbachol induced changes in [Ca2+]c; the time course of this response is shown in Fig.2A. The traces have been averaged for all of the cells in each group, identified by GFP fluorescence. Stimulation with capsaicin (0.1 μm) in Ca2+-containing medium induced a fast increase of [Ca2+]c from 0.1 to 6 μm in a subpopulation of the cells, which quickly returned to base line after the removal of capsaicin. The capsaicin-sensitive cells corresponded to cells expressing GFP-VR1, as assessed by superimposition of fluorescence images excited at 490 nm (to visualize GFP) and the ratiometric Ca2+ images (fura-4F, excited at 340 and 380 nm; see upper panels in Fig. 2A). We compared Ca2+ influx through VR1 with receptor-controlled, capacitative calcium influx. To this end, we took advantage of the fact that J-HM1–2.2 cells stably express HM1R, and HM1R stimulation by carbachol induces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER and subsequent capacitative calcium influx (20Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More than 95% of the cells responded to carbachol with a rise in [Ca2+]c of up to 3–4 μm (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Material). We also confirmed the source of the calcium responsible for these changes by stimulating the cells with the agonists in Ca2+-free medium. Under these conditions, the ability of capsaicin to induce the [Ca2+]c rise was completely blocked, but carbachol still induced a considerable [Ca2+]cincrease (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Material). These results indicate unambiguously that the mechanisms for the [Ca2+]c increases induced by both agonists are completely different. Capsaicin exclusively induced ligand-gated Ca2+ influx, whereas carbachol induced Ca2+release from the ER and subsequent capacitative Ca2+influx. When cells were stimulated for a sustained period of time (5–6 min), [Ca2+]c remained increased during the full stimulation period with capsaicin but decreased rapidly from 3–4 to 0.7–0.9 μm within 2 min during stimulation with carbachol (Fig. 2, B and C). This behavior is consistent with different mechanisms of action, since release of Ca2+ from the ER by carbachol ceases once the calcium store is emptied, and then the [Ca2+]c increase is sustained only by the stimulated capacitative Ca2+ influx, which is much smaller than Ca2+ influx through VR1. The shapes of the frequency distributions of the maximal [Ca2+]c peaks induced by capsaicin and carbachol were completely different (Fig. 2C). The VR1 agonist increased [Ca2+]c in only 20–40% of the cells (the ones expressing the vanilloid receptor), and 88% of the peak values were within the 5–7 μm range (and 100% over 3 μm). On the contrary, the HM1R agonist increased [Ca2+]c in 95% of the cells, and the frequency distribution was quite uniform in the 1–7 μm range. The fraction of the total cell population that responded with"

We have been studying a previously identified human glioblastoma-derived PDGFR-alpha mutant that has an in-frame deletion in the extracellular domain, causing loss of exons 8 and 9 (PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9)). In the primary tumor, this deletion mutant receptor was shown to be amplified and overexpressed. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression, activity, localization, and transformation properties of this deletion mutant. In the absence of serum, or PDGF-AA, PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9) was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, indicating ligand-independent autoactivation. Localization by staining and cell surface biotinylation studies revealed expression of the deletion mutant predominantly in the cytoplasm, with very little present on the cell surface. To determine if PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9) was oncogenic, we transfected wild-type and mutant receptors into Rat1 cells and performed analyses of cell growth, in vitro transformation, and subcutaneous growth in the nude mouse. PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9)-expressing cells displayed enhanced cell growth and survival in low serum, and formed foci in monolayer cultures. PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9)-expressing Rat1 cells were also tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Expression of PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9) was also associated with increased c-Jun phosphorylation in the absence of PDGF ligand, demonstrating also that the mutant receptor is associated with altered intracellular signaling. These data demonstrate that PDGFR-alpha(delta8,9) is transforming, and it is the first demonstration of a naturally occurring tumor-derived mutant PDGFR-alpha with oncogenic properties."

The sulfur used to form the MPT dithiolene moiety is carried on the MoaD subunit in the form of a C-terminal thiocarboxylate that must be regenerated after each round of MPT biosynthesis (8Pitterle D.M.

In the MPT synthase crystal structure, the two MoaE subunits form a central dimer, and the MoaD subunits are located at opposite ends of this dimer. Each MoaD monomer contacts only one of the two MoaE monomers, and the most striking feature of this interaction is the insertion of the C terminus of each MoaD subunit into a pocket in one of the MoaE subunits to form one active site at each MoaE-MoaD interface (7Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A preliminary association constant of 2.2 × 105m−1 has been obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments for the interaction between MoaD and MoaE. 2H. Schindelin, personal communication.2H. Schindelin, personal communication. MoaD shares a high degree of structural similarity with both ThiS and ubiquitin (11Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 12Wang C. Xi J. Begley T.P. Nicholson L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All three of these proteins contain a C-terminal Gly-Gly motif, where the terminal glycine forms a thiocarboxylate in the case of MoaD and ThiS or a thioester in the case of ubiquitin. Comparison of MoaE sequence conservation with the three-dimensional structure of the protein localized a number of highly conserved MoaE residues to the central cavity that embraces the MoaD C terminus in each half of the MPT synthase tetramer. These include the invariant or highly conserved residues Phe-34, Arg-39, Met-115, Lys-119, Lys-126, and Arg-140 (7Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Additionally, loss-of-function mutations in MOCS2B, the human equivalent of MoaE, have been identified in cofactor-deficient patients. Two of these mutations correspond to an E128K substitution and to premature termination at Glu-141 in E. coli MoaE (13Reiss J. Dorche C. Stallmeyer B. Mendel R.R. Cohen N. Zabot M.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 706-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The observation that MPT synthase isolated from E. coli moeB− cells is inactive led to the proposal that the MoeB protein is essential for the formation of the MoaD thiocarboxylate and that it might serve as the donor of the dithiolene sulfur atoms (8Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence, however, indicates that MoeB does not carry the transferable sulfur atom and that its role in thiocarboxylate regeneration is limited solely to adenylation of the inactivated MoaD C terminus (14Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Leimkühler S. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34695-34701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A Nif-S like sulfurtransferase protein is the actual donor of a cysteine-derived sulfur to the activated MoaD C terminus to regenerate the thiocarboxylate (14Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the MoaD-MoeB complex in the apo, ATP-bound, and adenylated MoaD forms have been determined (16Lake M.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nature. 2001; 414: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The two proteins form a heterotetramer analogous to MPT synthase with the MoeB subunits as the central dimer. The MoaD fold in this complex is quite similar to that observed in the synthase complex, and the MoaD C terminus is again extended into a pocket on the MoeB surface to form the active site. Thus, MoaD is capable of forming two different stable, yet reversible, heterotetrameric complexes that perform biochemically distinct reactions involving the C terminus of MoaD. Mutations causing a defect in any step of molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis result in the combined loss of activities of all cofactor-containing enzymes. In humans, cofactor deficiency is a rare inborn disease that generally results in death in early infancy (17Johnson J.L. Duran M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3163-3177Google Scholar). Whereas the activities of all three human cofactor-containing enzymes (aldehyde oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and sulfite oxidase) are impaired by cofactor deficiency, the devastating consequences of the disease can be traced to the loss of sulfite oxidase activity, since isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency produces similarly dire consequences. Mutations in either MPT synthase subunit or in MoeB result in accumulation of precursor Z within the affected organism. This has been observed in bacteria (18Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), humans (19Johnson J.L. Wuebbens M.M. Mandell R. Shih V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Neurospora (20Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and such mutants can serve as experimental sources of precursor Z (21Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early attempts to study the E. coli MPT synthase reaction were hampered by the fact that enzyme generated by coexpression of the MoaD and MoaE subunits is almost completely inactive. Co-expression of the subunits with the E. coli MoeB protein resulted in synthase that was maximally 50% activated, and it was such a sample that was employed for the initial crystallographic studies of holo-MPT synthase (7Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In vitro production of fully activated synthase was recently accomplished using an intein-based expression system to produce activated MoaD monomer (MoaD-SH) (10Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This method was originally employed for the generation of activated ThiS, the MoaD-equivalent protein in the thiamine biosynthetic pathway (22Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using this system for MoaD-SH expression, Gutzke et al. (10Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated the both MoaD and MoaD-SH form the MPT synthase heterotetrameric complex upon incubation with MoaE and that the MPT synthase formed with MoaD-SH is capable of converting precursor Z to MPT in vitro. With the intein system as a source of MoaD-SH, we have further investigated the MPT synthase reaction using an in vitro, three-component assay consisting of MoaE, MoaD-SH, and precursor Z. By varying the ratios of the assay components, a stoichiometry of 2 molecules of MoaD-SH for the conversion of each precursor Z molecule to MPT was established. This assay was also used to explore the role of specific MoaE residues in the MPT synthase reaction. When taken together with the crystallographic data for MPT synthase and MoaE presented in the accompanying paper (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Turque O. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), these results further an understanding of the mechanism of the E. coli MPT synthase reaction. The genes encodingE. coli MoaD and MoaE were cloned by PCR from pSJE100 using the published sequence for the plasmid (24Rivers S.L. McNairn E. Blasco F. Giordano G. Boxer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to allow cloning into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the multiple cloning region of the pET15b expression vector (Novagen) to generate pMW15aD and pMW15aE, respectively. The following single amino acid substitutions in pMW15aE were then created using the Transformer kit from Clontech: F34A, R39A, M115A, K119A, K126A, E128K, R140A, and E141Δ. For expression of MoaD-SH,moaD was also cloned into the NcoI andKpnI sites of the pTYB3 expression vector (New England Biolabs) using a 3′ PCR primer designed to place the C-terminal glycine of MoaD immediately prior to the intein cleavage site in the vector. The resulting expression vector was designated pMWTY BaD-SH. An expression vector for the G81Δ truncation variant of MoaD-SH was similarly generated by PCR using a 3′ PCR primer with the appropriate bases deleted. All nucleic acid sequences were verified by automated sequencing. During the course of cloning, the second amino acid of all variants of expressed MoaD was changed from isoleucine to valine. For expression of all proteins, 1-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the appropriate expression plasmid were induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm when the cultures had attained anA600 of 0.6. Following 4–5 h of aerobic growth at 30 °C, cultures were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, per liter of culture and frozen at −20 °C. For MoaE and MoaD purification, the cell pellet from 1 liter of the appropriate culture was thawed, passed twice through a French pressure cell, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g. The supernatant volume was increased to 150 ml with suspension buffer prior to the addition of 16.5 ml of 20% (w/v) streptomycin sulfate, and precipitated nucleic acids were removed by centrifugation at 10,400 × g. For MoaD purification, solid ammonium sulfate (351 g/liter) was slowly added to the cold solution, which was centrifuged prior to the addition of a second aliquot of 33 g/liter ammonium sulfate. The precipitated MoaD was then pelleted by centrifugation. The protein was suspended in and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. MoaE was precipitated from solution by the addition of 144 g/liter of solid ammonium sulfate and similarly dialyzed. For both MoaD and MoaE, all precipitation and dialysis steps were performed at 4 °C. Final purification of both proteins was achieved by chromatography on a 100-ml bed volume Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with dialysis buffer. Final yield for both proteins was ∼30 mg/liter of culture. For MoaD-SH purification, the cell pellets from 6 liters of culture were thawed, lysed, and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was combined with 30 ml of chitin affinity resin (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton-X 100, pH 8.0, and stirred for 3 h at 4 °C. The resin was then poured into a column and washed with 150 ml of equilibration buffer followed by 100 ml of a wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. For intein cleavage, the resin was incubated for 18 h with 30 ml of wash buffer containing 30 mm ammonium sulfide (Sigma). The released MoaD-SH was eluted with 30 ml of wash buffer and concentrated prior to final purification by chromatography on the Superdex 75 column as described above. The yield of MoaD-SH was 1.3 mg/liter culture. All protein concentrations were determined based on their calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm, and purified proteins were exchanged into 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, prior to storage at −80 °C in small aliquots. Size exclusion chromatography of the purified proteins was accomplished by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Zorbax GF-250 analytical column (Agilent). All HPLC analyses were performed at room temperature with a Hewlett Packard HP1090 liquid chromatograph. Absorbance was monitored with an HP1040A diode array detector. The column was equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Mixtures of MoaE and MoaD-SH were incubated for 2 min in a total volume of 100 μl prior to injection of the entire sample onto the column. Precursor Z was purified fromE. coli moaD− cells and quantitated as previously described (21Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard MPT synthase reactions were performed at room temperature in a total volume of 0.4 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2. MoaD-SH and MoaE were combined and preincubated for 10 min on ice and then transferred to the reaction tube. After adding buffer, the reaction was started by precursor Z addition. Whereas the final precursor Z concentration varied from 1 to 12 μm, the volume of precursor Z in 10 mmcitrate, pH 3.0, added to the reaction was always less than 50 μl. At the specified time, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of acid iodine to convert precursor Z to compound Z and MPT to Form A (25Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of the latter molecules are stable, fluorescent compounds that can be easily quantitated by HPLC analysis with fluorescent detection. Following incubation at room temperature for 16 h, excess iodine was reduced by the addition of 55 μl of 1% ascorbic acid, and the sample was made basic (pH 8–9) with NaOH. The phosphate monoester of Form A was cleaved by the addition of MgCl2 (final concentration of 33 mm) and 3 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were analyzed by subsequent injection of the entire reaction onto a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column (Alltech) equilibrated with 50 mmammonium acetate containing 10% methanol with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. In-line fluorescence was monitored by an Agilent 1100 series detector with excitation at 295 nm and emission at 448 nm. To assay for the extent of binding of precursor Z, the intermediate, and MPT to MPT synthase, a standard synthase reaction containing 3.8 μmprecursor Z and 3.8 μm K126A MPT synthase (equivalent to 7.6 μm each of K126A MoaE and MoaD-SH) was used. Following incubation at room temperature for 75 min, the reaction was passed through a Centricon 3 unit (Millipore Corp.) until the retained volume was ∼70 μl. The volumes of the filtrate and retained fractions were then increased to 400 μl with 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.2, prior to the addition of 50 μl of acid iodine solution. Following the procedure described above for alkaline phosphatase treatment and HPLC chromatography, the amount of precursor Z, intermediate and MPT present in the two fractions was determined. This experiment was performed in triplicate. Reactions contained K126A MoaE with MoaD, K126A MoaE with MoaD-SH, or MoaE with MoaD-SH in a total volume of 2.4 ml of 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.2. The final concentrations were 22 μm for each protein subunit and 11 μm for precursor Z. Following a 4-h incubation at room temperature, each sample was passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with water, and the protein fractions were concentrated to a final volume of 0.2 ml using a Centricon 3 concentrator. Mass spectral data were acquired on a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Beverly, MA) equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrostatic ion source operating in negative ion mode at atmospheric pressure. Samples were introduced by loop injection into a stream of 50% aqueous acetonitrile flowing at 10 μl/min. Mass spectra were acquired in continuum mode scanning from 180 to 430 atomic mass units in 2.5 s. The mass scale was calibrated using polyethylene glycol, and spectra were refined by customary background ion subtraction. Mass spectral analysis of MoaD-SH to verify the presence of the thiocarboxylate was performed as previously described (7Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that both the carboxylated (MoaD) and thiocarboxylated (MoaD-SH) forms of MoaD readily associate with MoaEin vitro to form the heterotetrameric MPT synthase complex but that only the complex containing MoaD-SH is active (8Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To examine this association and the MPT synthase reaction further, MoaD-SH was prepared by expressing MoaD with a C-terminal fusion to an intein and a chitin-binding domain following the procedure previously employed for both MoaD and ThiS (10Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 22Kinsland C. Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Induction of intein self-cleavage with ammonium sulfide released MoaD-SH from the chitin affinity resin, and mass spectrometry verified complete incorporation of the C-terminal thiocarboxylate on the purified MoaD-SH (data not shown). An SDS-acrylamide gel of the purified proteins used in this work is shown in Fig. 1A, and the absorption spectra of MoaD and MoaD-SH are shown in Fig. 1B. The presence of the thiocarboxylate moiety on MoaD significantly alters its absorption spectrum at lower wavelengths, resulting in a strong increase in absorbance below 280 nm. The spectrum of MoaD-SH was unaltered by either dialysis or passage through a sizing column. HPLC size exclusion chromatography was employed to verify that the expressed MoaD-SH was capable of forming the MPT synthase complex with MoaE. As seen in Fig. 2C, in the presence of a 0.5 molar ratio of MoaD-SH, half of the MoaE present was shifted into the MPT synthase complex. Although MoaD-SH and MoaE both eluted from the column at ∼11 min (Fig. 2, A andB), identification of these peaks was easily accomplished in light of the distinctive nature of the MoaD-SH absorption spectrum (Fig. 1B). Incubation of equimolar amounts of MoaE and MoaD-SH resulted in quantitative formation of the MPT synthase complex (Fig. 2D), and the addition of increasing ratios of MoaD-SH did not alter the elution parameters of the synthase complex peak (Fig.2, E and F). These results are comparable with those observed previously for MoaD-SH produced by the intein expression method (10Gutzke G. Fischer B. Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36268-36274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and they confirm the strong propensity of mixtures of MoaD-SH and MoaE to rapidly form the stable α2β2 MPT synthase complex. The elution position of MoaE in these experiments (Fig. 2, B andC) is clearly not consistent with its molecular weight. Since the observed elution positions of MoaD-SH and MPT synthase were within 20% of that expected by comparison with known protein standards, the behavior of MoaE cannot be attributed to lack of resolution by the HPLC column. Rather, the anomalous elution behavior of MoaE is more likely caused by interactions between the protein and the column matrix involving the hydrophobic surface of MoaE that interacts with MoaD to form the synthase complex (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Turque O. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using purified MoaD-SH and MoaE, the MPT synthase reaction was examined. For these reactions, precursor Z was added to a mixture of the two synthase subunits, and the MPT produced was quantitated by conversion to its fluorescent derivative, Form A. An examination of buffer requirements for the assay revealed that MPT synthase exhibited near maximal activity in a variety of buffers between pH 5.5 and 7.5 but that its activity dropped off sharply above pH 7.5 (data not shown). Time courses for the MPT synthase reaction at MoaD-SH/precursor Z ratios of 1× and 2× are shown in Fig.3A. From these data, the t½ for the reaction at room temperature was determined to be 0.24 min for the reaction containing a 2-fold excess of MoaD-SH over precursor Z and 0.30 min for the reaction with equimolar concentrations of MoaD-SH and precursor Z. Although the rate of MPT production in these two reactions was similar, the maximum amount of MPT produced in the reaction with a 2-fold excess of MoaD-SH was significantly higher than in that containing a stoichiometric amount of MoaD-SH. To explore this difference, MPT production and precursor Z depletion were quantitated in reactions containing various ratios of MoaD-SH and MoaE relative to precursor Z. For this experiment, MoaD-SH/precursor Z ratios ranging from 0.1 to 2.25 were assayed at MoaE/precursor Z ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0. Both the decrease in precursor Z (measured as compound Z in Fig.3B) and the increase in MPT (measured as Form A in Fig.3C) reached their maximum level at a MoaD/precursor Z ratio of 2, correlating with the addition of two sulfur atoms to each precursor Z side chain. Altering the MoaE/precursor Z ratio from 2 to 0.5 decreased MPT production less than 28% at any MoaD-SH/precursor Z ratio, suggesting that the MoaE subunit acts in a catalytic manner during MPT production. Standard reaction conditions were employed to evaluate the functionality of MoaE proteins with mutations in invariant or conserved residues. The positions of these residues, all located near the MoaD thiocarboxylate, are illustrated in Fig.4 along with the locations of two mutations corresponding to ones identified in human MOCS2B. As shown in Table I, when compared with the wild type rate, MPT synthase containing any of the MoaE mutants exhibited an increased t½ for MPT production. In the case of the F34A, M115A, and R140A MoaE variants, this increase was less than 5-fold, indicating that mutations at these positions only moderately affected the activity of the resulting MPT synthase. Both of the MoaE mutations corresponding to human mutations exhibited markedly slower rates. MPT synthase containing E128K MoaE was 16.6 times slower than the wild type protein, whereas synthase containing MoaE truncated after Arg-140 was 12.3 times slower. These greatly decreased reaction rates could account for the in vivo loss of function observed in patients with these mutations (13Reiss J. Dorche C. Stallmeyer B. Mendel R.R. Cohen N. Zabot M.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 706-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Conversion of the invariant, positively charged residues Arg-39 and Lys-126 to alanine severely decreased the rate of MPT production. MoaE containing the R39A mutation was 23.7 times slower than wild type, whereas K126A MoaE was 57.8 times slower. The arginine at position 39 of MoaE has been postulated to stabilize the negatively charged phosphate moiety of precursor Z (23Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Turque O. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J.

Platelet activation can be inhibited by a variety of agents, including aspirin and Ca2+ antagonists as well as cGMP- and cAMP-elevating agents such as NO and prostaglandin I2 (for review see Ref. 1von Bruchhausen F. Walter U. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 126. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1997Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of cGMP and cAMP are mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinases types I- and IIβ and by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iβ (cAK I,1 cAK IIβ, and cGK Iβ, respectively), representing the major forms of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases in human platelets (2Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrügge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,3Butt E. Walter U. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 18: 311-333Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of platelet inhibition by cGMP signaling downstream of cGK activation are only partially understood. In cGK-deficient mice cGMP-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation is impaired (4Massberg S. Sausbier M. Klatt P. Bauer M. Pfeifer A. Diess W. Fassler R. Ruth P. Krombach F. Hofmann F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To date, only a few substrates for cAK and cGK have been identified and characterized in human platelets. The 22-kDa small GTP-binding protein rap 1b is phosphorylated by cAK and cGK in intact platelets (Ref. 5Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar and this study). Phosphorylation of rap 1b is associated with translocation of the protein from the membrane to the cytosol (6Torti M. Lapetina E.G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein VASP is another major substrate of cAK and cGK in human platelets (7Halbrügge M. Friedrich C. Eigenthaler M. Schanzenbächer P. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3088-3093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its three phosphorylation sites are phosphorylated with different specificities by these two kinases (8Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VASP phosphorylation is thought to be involved in the negative regulation of integrin αIIbbIII (9Horstrup K. Jablonka B. Hönig-Liedl P. Just M. Kochsiek K. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Experiments in vitrorevealed reduced F-actin binding and actin polymerization of phosphorylated VASP (10Harbeck B.

Two recent studies investigated RhoA-mediated myosin light chain (MLC) activation and its contribution to platelet aggregation and secretion, showing that cGK phosphorylates RhoA and counteracts the phosphorylation of MLC through activation of MLC phosphatase (11Yoshinori S.

We previously identified heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) as a substrate for cGK in intact platelets (13Butt E. Immler D. Meyer H.E. Kotlyarov A. Laass K. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7108-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Hsp27 by cGK reduced the stimulatory effect of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2-phosphorylated Hsp27 on actin polymerization. There is also evidence that at least part of the inhibitory response mediated by cGK depends on phosphorylation of the thromboxane receptor (14Wang G.-R. Zhu Y. Halushka P.V. Lincoln T.M.

Goulding D. Lupu F. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Authi K. Blood. 2000; 95: 3412-3422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several other proteins have been reported to be phosphorylated in response to cGK activation either in vitro or in intact cells, including cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (2Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrügge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), myosin light chain kinase (17Nishikawa M. de Lanerolle P. Lincoln T.M. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

None of these proteins, however, has been established as a downstream target of cGK in platelets. Here we report the identification of a specific substrate for cAK and cGK in intact human platelets using differential phosphoproteomic display of radiolabeled human platelets. The protein was identified as the LIM and SH3 domain protein (LASP) (27Schreiber V. Moog-Lutz C. Regnier C.H. Chenard M.-P. Boeuf H. Vonesch J.-L. Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by nano-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation of LASP at Ser-146 leads to a redistribution of the actin-bound protein from the tips of the cell membrane to the cytosol, accompanied with a reduced cell migration. Urea (ultrapure), [γ-32P]ATP, [32P]orthophosphate (HCl-free), Protein A-Sepharose beads, thrombin, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, glutathione, HiTrap-NHS-activated HP column, pGEX4T1, and the ECL detection kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Actin was obtained from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO), CalyculinA was from Calbiochem, trypsin was from Promega, 8pCPT-cGMP was from BioLog (Bremen, Germany), IPG strips, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and nonfat dry milk were from Bio-Rad, FuGENE, the rapid ligation kit, and Complete MiniTM were from Roche, and nitrocellulose membrane was obtained from Schleicher und Schuell (Kassel, Germany). Primers were ordered from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, the first strand cDNA synthesis kit was from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany), LipofectAMINE, TA-vector, and pcDNA3 were from Invitrogen, xL1-blue competent cells were from Stratagene, Cy3 was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen, and Boyden chambers were from Corning Costar (Cambridge, MA). All other chemicals, reagents, and solvents of the highest purity available were purchased from Sigma. cGK Iα and the catalytic subunit of cAK type II were purified from bovine lung and bovine heart, respectively (23Walter U. Miller P. Wilson F. Menkes D. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3757-3762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGK Iβ and cGK II were expressed in and purified from the baculovirus-Sf9 cell system (24Pöhler D. Butt E. Meissner J. Müller S. Lohse M. Walter U. Lohmann S.M. Jarchau T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Freshly donated blood from healthy volunteers (50 ml) was collected in acid-citrate dextrose and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g to yield platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP was centrifuged for 20 min at 500 × g, and the platelet pellet was resuspended and washed once in an isotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.5 mmglucose and 1 mm EDTA at a density of 1 × 109 cells/ml. After resuspension, platelets were allowed to rest at 37 °C for 15 min. 32P-Labeling of Platelets—Platelet preparation was carried out essentially as described above. After washing, 1 ml of platelets at a concentration of 1 × 109/ml was incubated with 500 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (HCl-free) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Platelets were then centrifuged at 500 × g for 7 min and resuspended in 1 ml of isotonic buffer. Aliquots of 100 μl (corresponding to 200 μg of protein) were treated with 500 μm 8pCPT-cGMP for 30 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, platelets were briefly centrifuged (500 × g for 3 min) to yield a pellet. Isoelectric focusing for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using the Protean IEF cell from Bio-Rad according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The platelet pellet (about 200 μg of protein) was solubilized for 15 min by sonication in 320 μl of lysis buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 15 mm dithiothreitol (electrophoresis grade), 0.5% carrier ampholytes, pH 3–10. Pellet homogenate was loaded on a 17-cm immobilized IPG strip, pH 3–10, and reswollen overnight at 50 V. Focusing was carried out for 1 h at 250 V, 1 h at 500 V, and 15 h at 7000 V. After equilibration in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 6 murea, 30% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, gels were immediately applied to a vertical 10% SDS gel without a stacking gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 8 °C with a constant current of 40 mA per gel. The gels of radioactively labeled platelet proteins were fixed in 30% ethanol, 10% acetic acid and exposed. Radioactive spots visualized by autoradiography were excised. Gel pieces were washed sequentially for 10 min in tryptic digestion buffer (10 mmNH4HCO3) and digestion buffer: acetonitrile (1:1). These steps were repeated three times and led to a shrinking of the gel. It was reswollen with 2 μl of protease solution (trypsin at 0.05 μg/μl) in digestion buffer and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Analysis of the resulting peptides was carried out using a nano-HPLC system coupled directly to an electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom-built nano-electrospray ion source (LCQ™ Classic, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Fifteen μl of 5% (v/v) formic acid were added to the gel pieces and the peptides extracted by sonication for 15 min. The extraction step was repeated once. The supernatants were transferred to glass tubes, and the peptides were automatically flushed and preconcentrated on a μC18-precolumn (Nano-Precolumn™, 0.3-mm inside diameter × 1 mm, C18 PepMap™, LC Packings Dionex, Idstein, Germany) for 10 min with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and a flow of 40 μl/min. Tryptic peptides were injected automatically on the reversed-phase C18-column (75 μm inside diameter × 250 mm, C18 PepMap™, 5-μm particle size, LC Packings Dionex) using the Switchos™ system (LC Packings Dionex). Separation of the peptides was carried out in a gradient consisting of 0.5% (v/v) formic acid (solvent A) and 0.5% formic acid/84% acetonitrile (solvent B) with 5–15% B in 10 min, 15–20% B in 10 min, 20–50% B in 70 min, and 50–100% B in 5 min. The flow rate was adjusted from 200 μl/min to 160 nl/min using a precolumn split. Eluting peptides were transferred online to a heated capillary (Pico Tip™, FS360–20-10, New Objective Inc., Cambridge, MA) of an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ™ Classic, Thermo Finnigan). The following electrospray ionization parameters were used: spray voltage, 1.8 kV-2.15 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; capillary voltage, 42 V; tube lens offset voltage, 30 V; and the electron multiplier at −950 V. The collision energy was set automatically depending on the mass of the parent ion. Gain control was set to 107. The data were collected in the centroid mode using one MS experiment (Full-MS) followed by three MS/MS experiments of the three most intensive ions (intensity at least 3 × 105). “Dynamic exclusion” was used for data acquisition with an exclusion duration of 5 min and an exclusion mass width of ± 1.5 Da. Gene-specific primers used for PCR amplification of LASP and LASP mutants were designed based on the published human cDNA sequence (GenBankTM Access. No. X82456). Oligonucleotides used to generate wild-type LASP: AATGGATCCATGAACCCCAACTGCGCCCGGTGCGGCAAG (sense, starting at position 76) and CGGGAATTCTCAGATGGCCTCCACGTAGTTGGCCGGCA (antisense, starting at position 862) with BamHI andEcoRI restriction sites (underlined). Full-length human LASP cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/EcoR1sites of pGEX4T1 to generate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-LASP fusion protein. The single and double mutants were made by performing a second round of PCR using the wild type and single mutant as a template, respectively, and the appropriate pairs of oligonucleotides. For eukaryotic expression, LASP was cloned into pcDNA3. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Recombinant LASP and LASP mutants S61D, S146D, and S61/146D were expressed inEscherichia coli as GST fusion proteins using pGEX-4T1. Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Removal of GST from LASP was achieved by digestion with thrombin overnight at 4 °C. Purity was analyzed by examination of Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To generate a polyclonal antibody specific for LASP, recombinant human GST·LASP that had been expressed and affinity-purified from bacteria was injected into New Zealand rabbits (Immunoglobe, Himmelstadt, Germany). Immunoreactive serum was affinity-purified against LASP protein coupled to a HiTrap-NHS-activated affinity column according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After blotting on nitrocellulose membrane and blocking with 3% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, the membrane was first incubated with the polyclonal antibody raised against LASP (1:16,000) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) and detection by ECL. LASP and its mutants S61A, S146A, and S61/146A (0.5 μm each) were incubated at 30 °C in a total volume of 20 μl with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and the C subunit of cAK or cGK Iα, Iβ, or II (0.05 μm each) and 5 μm cGMP. Reactions were started by the addition of 50 μm ATP containing 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated after 30 min or at the times indicated in the figures by the addition of 10 μl of Laemmli SDS stop solution. Proteins were separated by SDS- PAGE on 10% gels. Incorporation of 32P was visualized by autoradiography. PTK2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 6-well plates to about 70% confluency and then transiently transfected with one of the LASP constructs cloned into a pcDNA3 vector alone or together with pCMV-cGKIβ (25Meinecke M. Geiger J. Butt E. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE. After 48 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h at 37 °C. Then cells were exposed to buffer alone and either 10 μm forskolin or 50 μm 8pCPT-cGMP for 20 min. After washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were scraped into RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton x-100, 0.1% SDS, 10% sodium pyrophosphate (all w/v %), 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 nmCalyculin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl difluoride). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 0.3 mg of proteins. Lysates were incubated with 1 μl of antibody (1.6 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C, then 1.5 h with pre-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose. Bound immune complex was washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli SDS stop solution. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Incorporation of32P was visualized by autoradiography. For immunofluorescence microscopy, transfected PtK2 cells grown on glass chamber slides were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with affinity-purified LASP antibody (1:1000) followed by secondary Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit antibody. F-actin cosedimentation assays were performed essentially as described by the actin manufacturer (Cytoskeleton). Briefly, purified recombinant human LASP (40 μg/ml) was incubated with 400 μg/ml freshly polymerized actin (F-actin) for 30 min at room temperature. Following incubation, the LASP/F-actin solution was subjected to centrifugation at 160,000 × g to pellet F-Actin and LASP bound to F-actin. After solubilization of the pellet fraction in a volume equal to the initial incubation volume, 20 μl of the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PtK2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in 5-cm dishes to about 80% confluency and then transiently transfected with pcDNA3 vector containing WT-LASP or S146D-LASP using LipofectAMINE. After 24 h, 1 × 105 cells per 100 μl incubation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mm MgCl2) were seeded in the upper chamber of bovine serum albumin-coated transwells. PtK2 cells were allowed to migrate through the porous membrane for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells remaining at the upper surface were completely removed using a cotton carrier. The lower surfaces of the membranes were then stained in a solution of 1% (w/v) crystal violet in 2% ethanol for 30 s and rinsed afterward in distilled water. Cell-associated crystal violet was extracted by incubation in 10% acetic acid for 20 min and measured at 595 nm. To identify substrates of cGK in intact human platelets, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, stimulated with 500 μmof the specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase activator 8pCPT-cGMP, and proteins of the resulting platelet lysate were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The two-dimensional phosphoproteomes resulting from this experiment (Fig.1) demonstrate the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of several proteins after stimulation with 8pCPT-cGMP. For identification of these proteins, the spots were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Spot 2a-c was identified as VASP, a well known substrate of cGK in human platelets (8Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with multiple phosphorylation isoforms (26Abel K. Mieskes G. Walter U. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Spot 3 was characterized as rap 1b, a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein. Phosphorylation of rap 1b has been observed in nitric oxide-stimulated human platelets through stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (5Reep B.R. Lapetina E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Spot 1 was identified as LASP, a novel type of actin binding protein (27Schreiber V. Moog-Lutz C. Regnier C.H. Chenard M.-P. Boeuf H. Vonesch J.-L. Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spots 4, 5, and 8 have not been identified yet because of their low amounts of protein in the gel. The specificity of the phosphorylation observed in intact platelets was further investigated by studying the role of LASP as a substrate for cGK in vitro. For this purpose, purified recombinant human LASP was incubated with cGK Iβ and with the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.2, LASP is clearly a substrate of cGK Iβ and cAK, the two isoforms known to be present in human platelets. Human LASP contains two cAK consensus motifs for serine phosphorylation, Ser-99 (KGFS) and Ser-146 (RRDS) (28Chew C.S. Parente J.R. Zhou C.-J. Baranco E. Chen X. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Google Scholar). In the present study, phosphorylation of amino acids was determined by mass spectrometry. A complete trypsin digest of phosphorylated LASP was fractionated on a nano-HPLC connected online to an ion trap mass spectrometer. The resulting MS/MS spectrum of the phosphopeptide with the sequence QpSFTMox-VADTPENLR is presented in Fig.3. The b-ion series shows many signals with a loss of −98 Da typical for phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing peptides (29Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), leading to the unequivocal identification of Ser-61 as phosphorylation site for cGK. In addition, the predicted Ser-146 was identified in a second phosphopeptide (data not shown). However, no phosphorylation of Ser-99 was observed. The same results were obtained with LASP phosphorylated by cAK. To study the specificity of phosphorylation, the identified serine phosphorylation sites Ser-61 and -146 were mutated to alanine (S61A, S146A, and S61/146A). The purified, recombinant proteins (wild-type, single mutants, and double mutant) were incubated with the cGK isoforms Iα, Iβ, and II and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Incorporation of phosphate was observed after 30 min with each of the four kinases, albeit at different levels (Fig. 4). cGK Iβ and cAK, the two isoforms present in human platelets, caused the highest phosphate incorporation. As expected, no phosphorylation was observed for the double mutant S61/146A. In a control experiment, VASP, a well known substrate for cAK and cGK (8Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was equally phosphorylated by each of the four kinases (Fig. 4). To evaluate the role of LASP as an in vivosubstrate of cGK Iβ and cAK (the two isoforms present in human platelets), LASP-deficient PtK-2 cells were transfected with wild-type LASP or the mutants S61A and S146A and cGK Iβ simultaneously or with either protein alone. The cells express cAK endogenously. Phosphorylation of the proteins by cGK Iβ or cAK was analyzed after stimulation of the cells with 8pCPT-cGMP or forskolin, respectively, followed by immunoprecipitation. Wild-type LASP and the mutant S61A showed identical in vivo phosphorylation (Fig.5). In contrast, no phosphorylation was observed with the S146A mutant, indicating that in vivoSer-146 is the only cGK Iβ phosphorylation site in LASP. In the absence of cGK Iβ no phosphorylation was detected. Similar results were obtained for cAK phosphorylation of LASP (data not shown). The expression of human LASP in different cell types was studied using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against GST-tagged human LASP. Western blot analyses of cell extracts from several human tissues and from different cell lines showed LASP expression in human platelets, brain, heart, kidney, lung, liver, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and various cell lines (Fig. 6, A and B). In earlier studies by Schreiber et al.(27Schreiber V. Moog-Lutz C. Regnier C.H. Chenard M.-P. Boeuf H. Vonesch J.-L. Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in our experiments, the filamentous expression pattern of LASP suggested that the protein is colocalized with F-actin. To test whether this association might be affected through phosphorylation of LASP, we performed F-actin/LASP cosedimentation experiments with wild-type LASP and the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant S146D, becausein vitro phosphorylation by cAK and cGK would also phosphorylate Ser-61. In the absence of F-actin, LASP was exclusively located in the soluble fraction, whereas in the presence of F-actin, about half of the LASP protein was found in the pellet (Fig.7). However, using LASP S146D (mimicking the phosphorylation by cAK and cGK in vivo), two thirds of the protein remained in the supernatant (Fig. 7, left panel). In control experiments, the actin binding protein α-actinin (positive control) cosedimented almost completely with F-actin, whereas >95% of bovine serum albumin (negative control) remained in the soluble fraction (Fig. 7, right panel). These results suggested that upon phosphorylation of Ser-146, LASP loses its ability to bind to F-actin. In view of these results, we investigated whether the intracellular localization of LASP is directly affected by phosphorylation. PtK2 cells, which express no detectable amount of endogenous LASP (Fig. 6 B), were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding either wild-type LASP, LASP mutant S146A, or LASP mutant S146D. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were prepared for immunofluorescence. Wild-type LASP and LASP S146A were predominantly present in the tips of cell membrane extensions and at cell-cell contacts where it colocalizes with F-actin (Fig.8, A, B,D, and E). However, double staining analysis with the LASP antibody and Oregon green phalloidin for F-actin staining revealed no colocalization with actin stress fibers (Fig. 8,D and E). In contrast, the phosphorylation-mimicking mutant LASP S146D was found predominantly in the cytosol (Fig. 8 C). The specificity of the staining was controlled with preadsorbed LASP antibody, which showed no immunofluorescence (data not shown). Because LASP is prominently present within focal contacts and the leading edges of the cell membrane, we wondered whether the protein might be involved in cell motility. Therefore we tested migration of PtK2 cells transiently expressing wild-type LASP or LASP mutant S146D in a modified Boyden chamber system. Cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a transwell polycarbonate membrane, and after 4 h cells that had migrated through the porous membrane were counted. Cells transfected with LASP S146D, mimicking the phosphorylation and exhibiting cytosolic localization (Fig.8 C), showed a 25% reduced motility compared with untransfected cells or WT-LASP-expressing cells displaying membrane localization (Fig. 9). As an approach to identify novel substrates of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, we analyzed cGK-mediated protein phosphorylation in intact human platelets using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In addition to the previously known substrates VASP and rap 1b, we identified LASP as a novel substrate for cGK and cAK. LASP consists of an N-terminal zinc-binding LIM domain, followed by two actin binding sites and a Src homology region 3 at the C-terminal end (30Tomasetto C. Moog-Lutz C. Regnier C.H. Schreiber V. Basset P. Rio M.-C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The human LASP gene was previously cloned and identified from a human breast cancer cDNA library (31Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Liderau R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It was mapped to human chromosome 17 q12-q21 and was shown to be amplified and overexpressed in breast tumors (32Bieche I. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Moog-Lutz C. Rio M.C. Lidereau R. Cancer Res. 1996; 1: 3886-3890Google Scholar). Theoretical sequence analysis of human LASP revealed two potential phosphorylation sites at Ser-99 (KGFSF) and Ser-146 (RRDSQ), with Ser-146 having an additional basic amino acid on either side of the consensus sequence. These sites agree well with the minimal motif for efficient cGK phosphorylation (RKXS/T) (33Tegge W. Frank R. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10569-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that human LASP Ser-146 is directly phosphorylated by cAK and cGK in vivo. Using site-directed mutagenesis of all serine residues, we excluded phosphorylation at Ser-99 and at Ser-61 in vivo, although Ser-61 was phosphorylated in vitro. Interestingly, serine in position 146 is only found in human and rabbit, whereas the corresponding amino acid in mouse and rat is an alanine. In contrast, Ser-99 and Ser-61 are conserved in all four species. Just recently, Chew et al. (34Chew C.S. Chen X. Parente J. Tarrer S. Okamoto T. Qin H.-Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 15: 4784-4799Google Scholar) identified Ser-146 and Ser-99 as the majorin vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites of rabbit LASP by cAK. Phosphorylation of rabbit LASP at Ser-146 induced aM r band shift that is absent in human LASP phosphorylated by cAK and cGK, indicating differences in the structure of the two proteins. Further studies are underway to explore phosphorylation of LASP in the different species and its possible physiological role. LASP is expressed in all human tissues tested, including platelets, brain, heart, kidney, lung, liver, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Northern blot analysis of murine LASP revealed a constant expression of the protein during embryogenesis from day 7.5 to day 18.5 with various levels in all adult tissues, which is consistent with an essential role for LASP in basic cellular function (32Bieche I. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Moog-Lutz C. Rio M.C. Lidereau R. Cancer Res. 1996; 1: 3886-3890Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of LASP subcellular distribution showed that the protein colocalizes with F-actin at focal adhesion plaques and membrane edges in mouse cardiac fibroblasts and rat mesangial cells. 2E. Butt, unpublished data. These results confirmed earlier observations by Schreiber et al.(27Schreiber V. Moog-Lutz C. Regnier C.H. Chenard M.-P. Boeuf H. Vonesch J.-L. Tomasetto C. Rio M.-C. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who found LASP at peripheral cell extensions in individual epithelial cancer cells. Experiments performed using PtK2 cells transfected with wild-type LASP also demonstrated that the protein is colocalized with F-actin at membrane extensions, although not along intracellular stress fibers. In PtK2 cells, however, the LASP mutant S146D, which simulates phosphorylation at Ser-146, accumulates in the cytoplasm when transiently expressed, suggesting that phosphorylation of human LASP by cAK and cGK regulates the intracellular localization of the protein. Recently, it was shown that the cAK-dependent acid secretory agonists histamine and forskolin induce a rapid sustained rise in LASP phosphorylation in rabbit gastric parietal cells, and this increase is closely correlated with the acid secretory response (28Chew C.S. Parente J.R. Zhou C.-J. Baranco E. Chen X. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C56-C67Google Scholar). In parallel, LASP redistributes from a predominantly cortical location to a region surrounding the intracellular canaliculus, which is the site of active HCl secretion (35Chew C.S. Parente J.A. Chen X. Chaponnier C. Cameron R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2035-2045PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the two major cAK phosphorylation sites in rabbit LASP, Ser-99 and Ser-146, to alanine appears to block this recruitment (34Chew C.S. Chen X. Parente J. Tarrer S. Okamoto T. Qin H.-Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 15: 4784-4799Google Scholar). The function of LASP in living cells seems to be complex and cell type-specific. The localization of LASP to the part of active membrane extension in addition to our observations of a reduced cell migration after phosphorylation and relocalization to the cytosol indicates a prominent role for LASP in cell movement, either by interacting directly with actin and promoting actin polymerization or by acting as a scaffolding molecule recruiting other motility proteins to the tips of the cells involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton. In gastric parietal cells, LASP was identified to bind to dynamin, a large GTPase involved in vesicular fission and control of membrane trafficking in the H+/K+-ATPase pathways at the apical membrane (36Okamoto C.T. Li R. Zhang Z. Jeng Y.Y. Chew C.S. J. Control. Release. 2002; 78: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Apart from LASP, cGK phosphorylates VASP (8Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protein that has been implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics and associated processes such as cell adhesion and motility by its ability to associate with F-actin, profilin, zyxin, and vinculin (37Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 243-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In platelets, VASP phosphorylation seems to be involved in the negative regulation of the integrin αIIbbIII (9Horstrup K. Jablonka B. Hönig-Liedl P. Just M. Kochsiek K. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Actually, in vitro phosphorylation of VASP reduces F-actin binding (10Harbeck B. Hüttelmaier S. Schlüter K. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. J..Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30817-30825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar); however, in contrast to LASP, phosphorylation of VASP plays no obvious role in subcellular targeting (38Loureiro J.J. Rubinson D.A. Bear J.E. Baltus G.A. Kwiatkowski A.V. Gertler F.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As a newly identified signaling protein within the cGMP and cAMP pathway, the specific function of LASP is still under investigation. Future experiments will address the question of whether there are platelet-specific binding partners for LASP and determine whether LASP might be a phosphorylation-dependent molecular switch that regulates the interaction of other proteins with F-actin-rich compartments, thereby modulating platelet function. We thank U. Walter and M. Zimmer for helpful suggestions and comments."

This is a critical step necessary for cell migration and occurs prior to cell body translocation, yet little is known about how this process is regulated. Here we show that myosin II light chain (MLC) phosphorylation at its regulatory serine 19 is elevated in growing and retracting pseudopodia. MLC phosphorylation in the extending pseudopodium was associated with strong and persistent amplification of extracellular-regulated signal kinase (ERK) and MLC kinase activity, which specifically localized to the leading pseudopodium.

In contrast, inhibition of RhoA activity specifically decreased pseudopodia retraction but not extension. Importantly, inhibition of RhoA activity specifically blocked MLC phosphorylation associated with retracting pseudopodia. Inhibition of either ERK or RhoA signals prevents chemotaxis, indicating that both pathways contribute to the establishment of cell polarity and migration.

Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made in linking various signals to the general process of chemotaxis, little is known about how these signals facilitate morphological polarization, which is characterized by establishment of a leading pseudopodium (lamellipodium), cell body, and trailing tail region (1Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 4Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that when cells encounter a directional cue such as a chemoattractant gradient, they respond by local activation and amplification of signals on the side facing the stimulus (1Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 2Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For example, pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins strongly and persistently localize to the plasma membrane facing the gradient (2Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 3Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), indicating that intracellular signals are spatio-temporally organized within chemotactic cells. This suggests that cells sense gradients and establish morphological polarity through the formation of an intracellular gradient of signals. Although it is not well defined, signals organized on the gradient side of cells presumably facilitate localized actin polymerization leading to membrane protrusion in the direction of the chemoattractant (6Machesky L.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R164-R167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extension of a single dominant leading pseudopodium marks the first sign of morphological polarity prior to cell movement (1Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 4Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). Despite its inherent importance to chemotaxis, little is known about gradient-sensing mechanisms and how these responses are transmitted to the actin-myosin cytoskeleton to achieve cell polarity and pseudopodia extension. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and RhoA are key signals that have been linked to cell migration and chemotaxis. However, their precise roles in mediating cell polarity and their spatio-temporal organization within the cell are still undefined. Recent evidence has shown that ERK mediates cell migration via regulation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation (7Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MLCK activity and MLC phosphorylation have been shown to localize to the front of migrating cells, suggesting a potential role for ERK and MLCK in mediating contractile processes in the pseudopodium (8Chew T.L. Wolf W.A. Gallagher P.J. Matsumura F. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Matsumura F. Ono S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). MLCK controls contractility through phosphorylation of the regulatory serine 19 on MLC. This phosphorylation event facilitates assembly of a fully functional actin-myosin motor unit capable of generating tension and contractile forces (10Smith J.L. Silviera L.A. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Adelstein R.S. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1863-1866Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Jay P.Y. Pham P.A.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, RhoA also regulates MLC phosphorylation and contractility through inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity (14Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 15Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although Rho, ERK, and MLCK are necessary for proper migration, it is not known whether these signals separately or coordinately regulate this process. Moreover, the spatio-temporal organization of these signals in chemotactic cells is not known. We recently reported a novel method of purifying differentially the pseudopodium and cell body of cells morphologically polarized toward a chemoattractant gradient (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Using this model, we show here that ERK and RhoA are two separate pathways that differentially regulate myosin function to control pseudopodial dynamics leading to cell polarity and chemotaxis.

COS-7 cells were from American Tissue Type Culture Collection. In most instances COS-7 cells were utilized; however, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were also tested in some cases, and similar results were obtained. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts), 200 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg ml−1 gentamicin (Sigma), and 100 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma). Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfection experiments, 100-mm dishes of 60–80% confluent cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 μl of LipofectAMINE was preincubated with 3.5 μg of total DNA in 1 ml of transfection medium for 45 min. The volume was brought to 6 ml and layered over cells for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Cells were used for the appropriate assays within 48 h subsequent to serum starvation overnight. The HA-tagged kinase-dead Raf (HA-Raf-KD) and wild type Raf (HA-Raf-WT) constructs were provided by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). The constitutively active MEK1 mutant (MEK+) was provided by Dr. Christopher J. Marshall (Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research).

The dominant negative Rho mutant (HA-tagged RhoN19) and wild type Rho construct were kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz (The Scripps Research Institute). pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) was used as the empty vector to keep the total amount of DNA to 3.5 μg. Cells used in chemotaxis assays were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of a reporter construct encoding β-galactosidase (pCMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase; Invitrogen). Cells analyzed by fluorescence staining were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of green fluorescent protein reporter construct (pEGFP-C1, Clontech) as a cell transfection marker. Migration assays were performed using Boyden chambers containing polycarbonate membranes (tissue culture-treated 6.5-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness, 8.0-μm pores, Transwell®; Costar) or QCM kit (Chemicon International) as described previously (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Membranes were coated on both sides with either 5 μg/ml human fibronectin or 5 μg/ml collagen I for 2 h at 37 °C. 150,000 cells were allowed to attach to the upper membrane surface for 2 h and then stimulated to migrate toward 100 ng/ml LPA in the lower chamber for 3 h. After migration, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet (Sigma), or transfected cells were fixed in β-galactosidase fixative and stained using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega Corp.). Collagen-coated cell culture wells were prepared by incubating 5 μg/ml collagen I in 24-well cell culture plates (Costar) for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then blocked with bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Cells were allowed to adhere for the indicated times at 37 °C. To assess cellular adhesion, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with crystal violet in 2% ethanol, and cells on the underside were counted directly or were eluted with 10% acetic acid and measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (A600). Pseudopodia extension and retraction were monitored using a pseudopodia assay kit (ECM 650; Chemicon International) as described previously (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, 150,000 serum-starved cells were placed in the upper chamber of a 3.0-μm porous polycarbonate membrane and coated on both sides with the appropriate ECM protein (5 μg/ml fibronectin for NIH 3T3 cells and 5 μg/ml collagen type I for COS-7 cells). Cells were allowed to attach and spread on the upper surface of the membrane for 2 h, and then stimulated with LPA, insulin, or buffer only, which was placed in the lower chamber to establish a gradient or placed in the upper and lower chamber to form a uniform concentration. Cells were allowed to extend pseudopodia through the pores toward the direction of the gradient for various times. To initiate pseudopodia retraction, the chemoattractant was removed, or an equivalent amount of chemoattractant was placed in the upper chamber to create a uniform concentration. The cell body from the upper surface was removed manually with a cotton swab, and the total pseudopodia protein on the underside was determined using BCA and a microprotein assay system and measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at A562 (Pierce Chemical Co.). In some instances, pseudopodia were fixed and stained with crystal violet in 2% ethanol and were eluted with 10% acetic acid and measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (A600). To isolate proteins from growing pseudopodia specifically, 1.5 × 106 cells were induced to form pseudopodia toward LPA for 60 min as described above or not treated and then harvested using a pseudopodia isolation kit (ECM 660; Chemicon International) as described previously. Briefly, cells were rinsed in excess cold phosphate-buffered saline and either rapidly fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol (for immunoblotting of whole cell lysates) or not fixed (for Rho GTPase activity only). Cell bodies were removed manually with a cotton swab from the upper membrane surface and pseudopodia from the undersurface scraped into lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors (mixture tablet; Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp.)) containing the appropriate detergent for immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (1% SDS) or Rho GTPase activity assay (Triton X-100 according to the manufacturer's recommendation; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Cell bodies were purified in a similar manner except that pseudopodia on the undersurface were removed, and the cell body on the upper surface was scraped into lysis buffer and detergent. Retracting pseudopodia were induced for various times by removing or placing a chemoattractant in the upper chamber to create uniform concentration and then harvested as described above. For haptotaxis pseudopodia, Transwell® Boyden chambers (3.0-μm pores) containing polycarbonate membranes were coated with 10 μg/ml collagen I on the underside of the membrane only for 2 h at 37 °C. 150,000 cells were added to the top of each chamber and allowed to extend pseudopodia to the underside for the indicated times, and lysates were harvested as described above. Cell bodies, growing or retracting pseudopodia were purified as described above in the appropriate lysis buffer and then boiled for 10 min (for immunoblotting) or placed on ice for 30 min (for Rho GTPase activity assay). Lysates on ice were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C and protein concentration of both lysates determined using BCA and a microprotein assay system (Pierce Chemical Co.). Briefly, 10–20 μg of whole cell lysate was separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted according to standard protocols. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce Chemical Co.) were used to visualize the blotted proteins of interest. Rho activity GTPase assay was performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) using 100 μg of total protein. It is known that LPA induces ERK activation through a PTX-sensitive pathway (17Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. van Corven E.J. Oolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Rho activation is through a PTX-insensitive mechanism (18Manning T.J. Parker J.C. Sontheimer H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This prompted the hypothesis that ERK and Rho may be distinct signaling pathways responsible for cell proliferation and migration, respectively. However, we found that exposure of cells to PTX prevented LPA-induced cell chemotaxis independent of changes in Rho activation (Fig.1A). Furthermore, inhibition of Rho activity by expression of a dominant negative Rho (19Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar) prevented chemotaxis independent of ERK activation (Fig. 1C). These findings implicate ERK and a PTX-sensitive Gαi signaling pathway in the regulation of cell chemotaxis in response to LPA (20Sallusto F. Mackay C.R. Lanzavecchia A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar,21Rossi D. Zlotnik A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 217-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). PTX and dominant negative Rho did not affect cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM), demonstrating that these signals regulate chemotaxis and do not prevent ECM recognition and attachment (Fig. 1, B and D). These findings indicate that ERK and Rho represent two distinct signaling pathways necessary for LPA-mediated chemotaxis. Chemotactic cells move toward shallow chemoattractant gradients, indicating that they can compare and process extremely small differences in concentrations of extracellular stimuli (2Jin T. Zhang N. Long Y. Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 2000; 287: 1034-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This is attributable, in part, to the fact that chemotactic cells localize and amplify G protein-coupled signaling pathways in the leading pseudopodium (22Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We showed previously that cells exposed to a gradient of LPA readily chemotax, whereas cells exposed to a uniform concentration do not (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cells may differentially regulate ERK activity during chemoattractant sensing and cell translocation compared with cells that encounter a uniform concentration of chemokine. Indeed, ERK activation was more rapid and significantly elevated in cells exposed to a chemoattractant gradient compared with cells exposed to a uniform concentration of chemokine (Fig.2A). On the other hand, cells exposed to a gradient of insulin, which does not induce chemotaxis (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), showed significantly delayed and reduced ERK activity compared with cells exposed to a uniform concentration of growth factor (Fig.2B). In our studies, we have seen that ERK1 and ERK2 activities (i.e. ERK-P) are the same and are representative of changes in ERK activity overall. These findings support the idea that ERK activation is a downstream process of chemosensing mechanisms necessary for directional cell migration. We next wanted to determine how ERK activity controls the migration machinery of cells. Stationary cells are often observed to extend and retract pseudopodial-like processes from their cell body as they interact with the surrounding extracellular environment (23Gustafson T. Wolpert L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Ueda M. Ogihara S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2071-2079PubMed Google Scholar, 25Bennett H. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 83: 61-76PubMed Google Scholar). However, directional cell migration or chemotaxis is characterized by protrusion of a dominant leading pseudopodium in the direction of a chemoattractant gradient followed by cell body translocation (1Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1999; 284: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 4Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that establishment of a leading pseudopodium involves the engagement of localized membrane protrusive activity and the uncoupling of retraction mechanisms. Although little is known about the molecular processes that coordinate this event, actin-myosin contractility is likely to be important. ERK has been reported to regulate the actin-myosin contractile machinery of cells through its ability to phosphorylate MLCK leading to increased MLC phosphorylation and contractile activity (26Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent reports indicate that MLCK activity and MLC phosphorylation are elevated in the leading front of migrating cells (8Chew T.L. Wolf W.A. Gallagher P.J. Matsumura F. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Adelstein R.S. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1863-1866Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Ueda M. Ogihara S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2071-2079PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known how these events are regulated or whether they contribute to pseudopodial growth or retraction, per se. To investigate a possible role for ERK and MLCK in pseudopodial dynamics, we utilized an in vitro model that allows for quantification as well as biochemical analysis of pseudopodia undergoing growth or retraction in response to a chemoattractant gradient (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on 3.0-μm porous membranes attached to a Boyden chamber and then polarized toward an LPA gradient. Cells then extend leading pseudopodia through the pores to the underside of the chamber in the direction of the gradient. Importantly, removal of the LPA gradient from the bottom chamber causes pseudopodia to retract back to the cell body on the upper surface (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The cell body and extending or retracting pseudopodia can be harvested differentially from the different sides of the filter for analysis. Our previous work had shown that pseudopodia extension through the micropore filters in response to an LPA gradient is linear for 30–120 min, whereas retraction is linear for up to 120 min (16Cho S.Y. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that ERK activity was increased significantly in extending pseudopodia and decreased during retraction (Fig. 3, A and B). ERK activity in extending pseudopodia was persistent for 15–120 min, whereas initiation of pseudopodia retraction caused a rapid decrease in ERK activity that reached basal levels by 10 min (Fig. 3B). Therefore, ERK activation is associated with extension and growth of pseudopodial processes and not retraction. Inhibition of ERK activity in cells with PTX (27Joshi S.A. Fan K.P. Ho V.W. Wong Y.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), expression of a dominant blocking form of Raf-1, or treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (28Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) prevented pseudopodia extension (Fig. 3, C,D, and E, respectively). However, treatment with an inhibitor of the EGF receptor, AG1478 (29Eguchi S. Mumaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of a constitutively active form of MEK (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar) did not alter basal chemokine-induced pseudopodial extension, suggesting that the activation of the ERK pathway alone is not sufficient to facilitate directional membrane protrusion (Fig.3G). Importantly, treatment of retracting pseudopodia with PD98059 or the expression of constitutively active MEK1 did not alter membrane retraction, per se. These findings demonstrate that ERK activity was not necessary for this response and that an independent pathway controls this process (Fig. 3, F and H, respectively). It is noteworthy that total ERK protein was the same in the cell body and pseudopodium under growth and retraction conditions, indicating that ERK protein levels remain constant under these conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, MEK, the upstream activator of ERK, showed increased activity in growing pseudopodia and decreased during retraction (data not shown). The level of MEK protein was also the same in both conditions (data not shown). Together these findings demonstrate that ERK activity is necessary for pseudopodium extension but not retraction. These findings also indicate that ERK activity is spatially localized to the leading pseudopodium of cells polarized toward a chemoattractant gradient. ECM gradients also provide spatial cues that cause directional pseudopodial extension and haptotactic cell migration (34Filardo E.J. Deming S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1615-1622PubMed Google Scholar,35Leng J. Klemke R.L. Reddy A.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37855-37861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ERK activity was elevated in haptotactic pseudopodia extending toward a collagen gradient, and PD98059 inhibited this response (Fig.4, A and B). Again, ERK protein levels were the same in the pseudopodium and cell body. In addition, PTX did not block pseudopodium extension under these conditions, indicating that PTX-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins are not involved in this response (data not shown). Haptotactic pseudopodia do not readily retract and therefore were not investigated further. These findings provide additional evidence that ERK is necessary for directional pseudopodial extension and establishment of cell polarity. ERK phosphorylates MLCK leading to increased kinase activity and MLC phosphorylation. MLC phosphorylation at serine 19 (MLC-19) leads to increased actin-myosin association and contractility. Expression of a dominant blocking form of MLCK in cells or treatment with the MLCK kinase inhibitor ML-7 (36Saitoh M. Ishikawa T. Matsumisha S. Naka M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prevented pseudopodia formation and MLC-19 phosphorylation in cel"

IP-10 also binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), an interaction thought to be important for its sequestration on endothelial and other cells. In this study, we performed an extensive mutational analysis to identify the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of murine IP-10. The mutants were characterized for heparin binding, CXCR3 binding, and the ability to induce chemotaxis, Ca2+ flux, and CXCR3 internalization. Double mutations neutralizing adjacent basic residues at the C terminus did not lead to a significant reduction in heparin binding, indicating that the main heparin binding site of IP-10 is not along the C-terminal α helix. Alanine exchange of Arg-22 had the largest effect on heparin binding, with residues Arg-20, Ile-24, Lys-26, Lys-46, and Lys-47 further contributing to heparin binding. A charge change mutation of Arg-22 resulted in further reduction in heparin binding. The N-terminal residue Arg-8, preceding the first cysteine, was critical for CXCR3 signaling. Mutations of charged and uncharged residues in the loop regions of residues 20–24 and 46–47, which caused reduced heparin binding, also resulted in reduced CXCR3 binding and signaling. CXCR3 expressing GAG-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that GAG binding was not required for IP-10 binding and signaling through CXCR3, which suggests that the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of IP-10 are partially overlapping.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). Chemokines are 8–10-kDa proteins that have been subdivided based on the position of the first two cysteine residues into four subfamilies. IP-10 is a member of the CXC subfamily and was first identified as a gene markedly induced by interferon γ (2Luster A.D. Unkeless J.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1985; 315: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) and has since been shown to be a potent chemoattractant of activated T cells (3Taub D.D. Lloyd A.R. Conlon K. Wang J.M.

It is expressed constitutively at low levels in thymic, splenic, and lymph node stroma (4Gattass C.R. King L.B. Luster A.D. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp.

IP-10 binds to the CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3), which it shares with two other ligands, interferon-inducible T cell-α chemoattractant (I-TAC/CXCL11) and monokine induced by γ-interferon (Mig/CXCL9). IP-10, like many chemokines, also binds to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (21Luster A.D. Greenberg S.M. Leder P. J. Exp.

While our understanding of the biological activities of the CXCR3 ligands has increased, relatively little is known about the importance of their interaction with GAGs. It has been postulated that GAGs on the cell bearing the 7 transmembrane receptors facilitate chemokine binding to their high affinity receptor (25Hoogewerf A.J. Kuschert G.S. Proudfoot A.E. Borlat F. Clark-Lewis I. Power C.A. Wells T.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13570-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), while GAGs on endothelial cells and in the extracellular matrix might be important for retaining chemokines close to their site of secretion (26Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Hubscher S. Hirano H. Siebenlist U. Shaw S. Nature. 1993; 361: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that GAGs might also be involved in the signaling of chemokines, as has been recently shown for RANTES (CCL5) (27Chang T.L. Gordon C.J. Roscic-Mrkic B. Power C. Proudfoot A.E. Moore J.P. Trkola A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and PF4 (platelet factor 4, CXCL4) (28Fleischer J. Grage-Griebenow E. Kasper B. Heine H.

GAGs have also been shown to be important for the anti-HIV effect of SDF-1α (stromal cell-derived factor-1α, CXCL12) (29Valenzuela-Fernandez A. Palanche T. Amara A. Magerus A. Altmeyer R. Delaunay T.

Nature. 1998; 391: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, GAGs might also be important for chemokine activity on non-hematopoietic cells, such as endothelial cells. In this study, we performed an extensive mutational study to locate the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of murine IP-10 to begin to dissect the role of CXCR3 and GAG binding in the biological activity of IP-10. We found that the N-terminal residue Arg-8 as well as residues in the loop regions 22–26 and 46–47 are important for CXCR3 binding. Interestingly, these same loop regions are also the major heparin binding site, suggesting that the CXCR3 and heparin binding sites of IP-10 are partially overlapping. Recombinant murine IP-10 was obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ), 125I-labeled IP-10 (human) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Endotoxin testing reagents were from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. BCA reagents were from Pierce. All other materials were of biological grade and purchased either from Sigma or Fisher. 300–19 cells were maintained in complete RPMI, 107 FCS. 300–19 cells transfected with human CXCR3 (300–19/hCXCR3) were a gift from B. Moser. CHO K1 cells and CHO cells deficient in GAGs (CHO 745) (ATCC), a mutant cell line defective in xylosyltransferase (the first committed enzyme involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis) (32Esko J.D.

The murine CXCR3 (mCXCR3) gene in pcDNA3 was transfected into 300–19 or CHO cells by electroporation, and selection was performed in G418. Clones were obtained by limiting dilutions, selected by their mCXCR3 expression and their ability to induce Ca2+ flux in response to murine IP-10 (mIP-10), and are referred to as 300–19/mCXCR3 or CHO/mCXCR3. The mIP-10 cDNA (in Bluescript, from Joshua Farber) was cloned into the pET9a expression vector (Novagen). To avoid the Shine-Delgarno sequence, conservative changes to the N-terminal DNA sequence were introduced. Mutagenesis was performed in pET9a using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Clontech) or the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). The desired mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pET9a expression vectors containing the mutated IP-10 gene were transformed into the BL21 DE3 pLys Escherichia coli strain. Cultures were grown with 40 ॖg/ml kanamycin and 34 ॖg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C with shaking up to anA600 of 0.5 before inducing protein expression by the addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-औ-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested 4 h after induction, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 16 mm MgCl2, and 20 mg/liter DNase and broken by two passages through a French press (Carver, Wabash, IN). IP-10 was purified from the inclusion bodies, which were dissolved in 6 m guanidine-HCl, 0.1m Tris base, pH 8.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol. To ensure complete monomerization, the solution was heated to 60 °C for 30 min and separated on a Sephacryl S200 HR HiPrep 26–60 (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing monomeric IP-10 were pooled. The protein was renatured by dropwise addition to 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 mmoxidized glutathione and 0.1 mm reduced glutathione at 4 °C with stirring to reach a 15-fold dilution. The pH of the renatured protein solution was adjusted to 4.5 with acetic acid and loaded onto a 5-ml SP HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1007 2 m NaCl in 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.5. Fractions containing IP-10 were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1.7 mammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, and loaded on a 1-ml Resource (Phenyl-Sepharose) column equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a 1.7–0.0 m ammonium sulfate gradient. Fractions containing pure IP-10 were identified by SDS-PAGE (4–207 Tris-HCl gels, Bio-Rad), pooled, and dialyzed twice against 17 acetic acid and once against 0.17 trifluoroacetic acid prior to lyophilization. Protein concentration was determined with a combination of BCA assay (Pierce), SDS-PAGE, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Selected purified mutants were analyzed for the presence of LPS by the limulus amebocyte assay (Charles River Laboratories). To verify the correct folding of mutants with decreased in vitroactivity, near UV CD spectra were run on an Aviv 62DS CD spectrometer at 20 °C. 20 ॖg of IP-10 protein were loaded on a 1-ml Heparin HiTrap orS-Sepharose FF (cationic exchange) column (both fromAmersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, on an AKTA machine (Amersham Biosciences). The mutants were eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0–2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and their elution time were measured by absorbance at 214 nm. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. Binding assays were performed in 96-well tissue culture plates in a total volume of 150 ॖl of binding buffer (0.57 BSA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2). 300–19/hCXCR3 cells (4 × 105/well) or CHO/mCXCR3 cells (3 × 105/well) were incubated with 0.04 nm125I-labeled IP-10 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, human IP-10), and increasing concentration of IP-10 mutants (5 × 10−6 to 500 nm). After 90 min at room temperature with shaking the cells were transferred to 96-well filter plates (Millipore) previously soaked in 0.37 polyethylenimine and washed four times with 200 ॖl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.5m NaCl. Radioactivity was counted after addition of scintillation fluid in a Microbeta counter (Wallac). The data were analyzed with GraFit (34Leatherbarrow R. GraFit, Version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. Chemokine dilutions in RPMI media supplemented with 17 low endotoxin BSA were added to the bottom well of a 96-well chemotaxis plate (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD). 300–19/mCXCR3 cells were washed into the same buffer at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and 50 ॖl of cells were added on top of the membrane (5-ॖm pore size, polycarbonate filters). The chemotaxis plate was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and transferred to 4 °C for 10 min before removing the membrane. Cells in the bottom wells were counted under a microscope and are expressed in total cell numbers. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated a minimum of two times. 300–19 or CHO (wt or GAG-deficient) cells expressing mCXCR3 were resuspended in their growth media with 17 FCS at 1 × 107 cells/ml and loaded with 5.0 ॖm acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in calcium flux buffer (145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmNaHPO4, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES and 22 mm glucose). Fluorescence readings were measured in a continuously stirring cuvette at 37 °C in a DeltaRAM (Random Access Monochromator) fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ). The data were recorded as excitation fluorescence intensity emitted at 510 nm in response to sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm and are presented as the relative ratio of fluorescence at 340/380 nm. Fold induction (FI) of each stimulation was calculated by dividing the peak fluorescence ratio after stimulation by the peak fluorescence ratio during the 10 s before stimulation. Each experiment was repeated at least twice. Internalization of mCXCR3 was measured as previously described (35Sauty A. Colvin R.A. Wagner L. Rochat S. Spertini F. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7084-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300–19/mCXCR3 were resuspended in complete RPMI, 107 FCS, and various concentrations of wt and mutant IP-10 were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were stained with anti-mCXCR3 antibody or isotype control (provided by Julie DiMartino, Merck), followed by a phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed by FACS. Residues of mIP-10 were chosen for mutagenesis by homology to the human and murine CXCR3 ligands IP-10, Mig, I-TAC, as well as comparison to known receptor and GAG binding sites of other CXC chemokines (Fig.1). The first series of mutants included single point mutations to alanine or double mutations of adjacent basic residues to alanine. We chose a total of 16 mutants, including residues at the N terminus, identified for a number of chemokines to be important for signaling (36Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol.

Based on the results of the first series of mutants, another six mutants were created. Residues of IP-10 mutated in this study are indicated with anarrow in Fig. 1. Of the 22 mutants, one single point mutation, R38A, could not be expressed in a number of E. coli expression strains and was not further pursued. All the other mutants were successfully expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 (pLys) and purified from inclusion bodies by gel filtration, cationic exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography to at least 957 homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE gels. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein from the plasmid containing the unmutated wt IP-10 gene revealed that the N-terminal methionine was retained. We found this IP-10 to be fully active as compared with commercially available murine IP-10 from Peprotech, which has the initiating methionine cleaved off, in calcium flux, chemotaxis, and competitive receptor binding assays using 300–19 cells transfected with mCXCR3 (300–19/mCXCR3) as well as for chemotaxis and CXCR3 internalization of in vitro polarized murine Th1 cells (data not shown). The purified product from E. coli expressing the wt DNA was therefore called wt IP-10, and all other mutants for this study were similarly purified with the N-terminal methionine most likely retained. To eliminate the possibility that some of the effects seen with the IP-10 proteins could be due to LPS contaminations, wt IP-10 as well as selected mutants were tested for the presence of endotoxin using a Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml and were found to be below the detection limit of 0.03 EU/ml. Mutants with reduced CXCR3 binding and reduced in vitro activity were analyzed for correct folding by near UV CD spectra. The spectra of all tested mutants were superimposable with the spectrum of wt IP-10, apart from mutant E40A, which displayed a clear shift. Mutant E40A was therefore excluded from the results. The ability of the IP-10 mutants to bind heparin was analyzed by heparin affinity chromatography. Wt IP-10 eluted at a concentration of 0.96m NaCl (Fig. 2). Of the first set of 14 mutants successfully expressed, 10 eluted at salt concentrations similar to the wt protein (difference of less than 0.10m NaCl), including single and double mutations along the C-terminal helix. Mutations along the 20s loop region (also called N-loop) resulted in a larger difference; in particular, mutating Arg-22 had the largest impact of a single mutation. Mutations of the basic residues of the 40s loop also resulted in a reduction in heparin binding. The specificity of heparin binding compared with electrostatic interaction was investigated by eluting the mutants from a cationic exchange column (SP HiTrap). The difference in salt concentration needed to elute mutants from the SP column in relation to the wt protein compared with the difference in elution from the heparin column confirmed that the residue Arg-22 had the highest specific binding to heparin. In contrast, residues along the C-terminal helix all displayed a negative differential (i.e. had at least as much a reduction in binding to the SP column as for the heparin column), indicating that the reduction in heparin binding due to mutation of these residues is mainly an electrostatic effect. Based on the previous results, we created a second set of mutants, with a charge change of residues Arg-22 to glutamic acid and combining mutation of R22A with R20A, K47A, and R75E. In addition, the four basic residues of the C-terminal helix were mutated together, in a fashion similar to a mutant of PF4 that showed nearly no heparin binding affinity (43Mayo K.H. Ilyina E. Roongta V. Dundas M. Joseph J. Lai C.K. Maione T. Daly T.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), to glutamic acid and glutamine yielding the mutant K71E/R72Q- K74Q/R75E (named “C-t mut”). This C-terminal mutant was also combined with the R22A mutation (C-tR22A). Mutation of Arg-22 to a negatively charged glutamic acid further reduced the heparin binding affinity, as did combination with R20A and K47A (Fig. 2). These mutants displayed the highest amount of specificity for heparin binding, revealed by the differential in SP and heparin column elution. Although the double mutant of K74A/R75A had only a moderate effect on heparin binding, the combination of R22A with R75E still reduced the heparin binding. Similarly, K71E/R72Q-K74Q/R75E also showed a reduction of heparin binding of 0.29 m NaCl, and combining this mutation with R22A led to the largest decrease in heparin binding observed in this study. However, a comparison with binding to the SP column showed that this effect was mainly electrostatic in nature. In a competitive binding assay using 300–19/hCXCR3 cells, wt IP-10 competed for the binding of 40 pm125I-labeled human IP-10 with an IC50 value of 0.11 nm (Fig.3), in agreement with publishedKd values (44Cox M.A. Jenh C.H. Gonsiorek W. Fine J. Narula S.K. Zavodny P.J. Hipkin R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Eight of the mutants (I12A, E28A, S33A, T44A, K62A, K66A, K71A/R72A, K74A/R75A) had IC50values comparable to the wt protein. The N-terminal mutant R5A showed a 7-fold higher value, while mutant R8A had a 60-fold higher value. Mutant R22A, I24A, and K26A, which had shown lower heparin binding affinity, displayed 6-, 4-, and 2-fold lower receptor binding affinity, respectively. K46A/K47A, which had similarly reduced heparin binding, had a much more reduced CXCR3 binding affinity. The second set of mutants (R22E, R20A/R22A, R22A/K47A, R22A/R75E), all with further reduced heparin binding, had 15- to 60-fold reduced binding affinity for the receptor. Mutation of the four basic residues of the C terminus decreased the receptor binding 80-fold, and combination with the R22A mutation further reduced the binding another 10-fold, resulting in a nearly 1000-fold reduction in binding affinity. All mutants were tested at concentrations of 200 and 1000 ng/ml for their ability to induce calcium mobilization in 300–19/mCXCR3 cells with a subsequent challenge of 200 ng/ml wt IP-10 to test the ability of the mutant proteins to desensitize the cells (Fig.4). The eight mutants with CXCR3 binding and heparin binding comparable to wt IP-10 (I12A, E28A, S33A, T44A, K62A, K66A, K71A/R72A, K74A/R75A) all behaved equivalently to wt IP-10 in terms of calcium flux, chemotaxis, and internalization (data not shown) and will therefore not be listed in the remaining figures. The ability to cause calcium flux in 300–19/mCXCR3 cells followed a similar pattern as for receptor binding. Mutant R8A did not induce calcium mobilization at concentrations of 200 or 1000 ng/ml (Fig. 4) or at 5000 ng/ml (data not shown) and did not desensitize the cells to a subsequent challenge of wt IP-10. Mutants R5A and R22A, with 5- to 6-fold reduced receptor binding affinity, triggered only a small calcium mobilization at 200 ng/ml but were more effective at 1000 ng/ml. Mutants with more reduced CXCR3 binding (R22E, R22A/K47A, R22AR75E, C-t mut), all displayed strongly reduced ability to cause calcium mobilization even at 1000 ng/ml. The ability to cause chemotaxis of 300–19/mCXCR3 cells was related to the receptor binding and calcium mobilization data (Fig. 5) with some notable exceptions. Small reductions in receptor binding affinity did not affect the chemotactic activity of the mutants as much as it did for calcium mobilization. Mutants R5A, R22A, and K26A, with only slightly reduced CXCR3 binding, displayed nearly wt chemotactic activity with similar potency and efficacy. Mutants R22E, R22A/K47A, R22A/R75E and C-t mut, which had reduced CXCR3 and heparin binding, exhibited both reduced potency and efficacy for chemotaxis. Mutant C-tR22A was 6- to 7-fold less potent than wt IP-10 for chemotaxis, even at concentration of 5000 ng/ml. Mutant R8A did not cause chemotaxis up to concentrations of 5000 ng/ml. All of the IP-10 mutants were analyzed for their ability to cause CXCR3 internalization. For this, 300–19/mCXCR3 transfected cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of IP-10, after which time the cells were stained on ice with an anti-mCXCR3 antibody and CXCR3 expression was analyzed by FACS. No internalization was observed with incubation at 4 °C (data not shown). Wt IP-10 caused 687 internalization at 10 ng/ml and 927 at 1000 ng/ml (Table I). As seen for receptor binding and chemotaxis, mutant R22A was slight"

Chem. 1993; 268: 13011-13014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the plethora of functions played by processing enzymes in RNA metabolism, in eukaryotes only a few endoribonucleases have been isolated to date. Most of these activities are involved in the biosynthesis of translation components. In particular, RNase P and RNase mitochondrial RNA processing are ribonucleoprotein enzymes, functioning as site-specific endoribonucleases (3Nashimoto M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3642-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Lygerou Z. Allmang C. Tollervey D. Séraphin B. Science. 1996; 272: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Other well characterized endonucleolytic activities, such as the 3′-tRNase, the tRNA splicing endonuclease, and members of the RNase III-like family are protein-only enzymes (5Trotta C.R. Miao F.

Although the majority of these activities participate in the biosynthesis of a specific class of RNA molecules, RNase III was shown to be required for a large number of different maturative pathways. Saccharomyces cerevisiaeRNase III (Rnt1p) was shown to be involved in pre-rRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA),1 and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) processing (8Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares Jr., M.

Recently, Rnt1p was also shown to participate in processing the intron-encoded snoRNAs U18 and snR38 from their host pre-mRNA (13Giorgi C. Fatica A. Nagel R. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6856-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a new member of the metazoan RNase III family has been identified to be involved in the RNA interference process (14Ambros V. Science. 2001; 293: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Another process in which the participation of endoribonucleases was expected to play an important role is the biosynthesis of snoRNAs. These RNAs are part of a complex class of molecules that are localized in the nucleolus where they participate, as small ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs), in different rRNA maturative events such as processing and nucleotide modifications (15Weinstein L.B. Steitz J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Qu L.H. Garret R.A. Douthwaite S.R. Liljas A. Matheson T. Moore P.B. Noller H.F. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics and Cellular Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 191-203Google Scholar). Most snoRNAs in vertebrates are encoded in introns of protein-coding genes and are released from the host primary transcript either by debranching and exo-trimming of the spliced lariat (splicing-dependent pathway) or by endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA (splicing-independent pathway) (15Weinstein L.B. Steitz J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 16Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Qu L.H. Garret R.A. Douthwaite S.R. Liljas A. Matheson T. Moore P.B. Noller H.F. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics and Cellular Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 191-203Google Scholar). There are only a few cases of intron-encoded snoRNAs in vertebrates, which are released through the intervention of endoribonucleases (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Filippini D. Renzi F. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but so far these activities have not been purified and characterized. We previously showed, by microinjection experiments in X. laevis oocytes, that precursors containing U16 and U86 snoRNAs undergo very little splicing, whereas they efficiently produce snoRNAs through a processing pathway, involving specific endonucleolytic cleavages inside the intron (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,18Filippini D. Renzi F. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The common feature of U16 and U86 snoRNAs is their localization in introns, which are poor splicing substrates, due to the presence of non-canonical consensus sequences. We previously reported the identification in oocyte nuclear extracts (ONE) of an endoribonucleolytic activity, named XendoU (19Caffarelli E. Maggi L. Fatica A. Jiricny J. Bozzoni I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), that produced the release of U16 snoRNA from its host intron by cleaving at the same sites identified in vivo (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The same activity was described to operate also for the processing of U86 snoRNA (Ref. 18Filippini D. Renzi F. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and this study). From massive preparations of X. laevis ONE, we purified to homogeneity the XendoU endoribonuclease and characterized its activity. Partial protein sequencing enabled us to clone a XendoU cDNA, to express it, and to perform a functional characterization of this enzyme. Several aspects of XendoU make this protein a novel enzyme, different from all known endoribonucleases characterized so far in the following ways: i) it is poly(U)-specific, ii) its activity depends on Mn2+ ions, and iii) it releases cleavage products with 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate termini. The X. laevisoocyte nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pellet obtained after two sequential ammonium sulfate precipitations (45 and 70% saturation) was dissolved in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) and applied onto an hydroxyapatite column (CHT-II Econocolumn, Bio-Rad). Elution was carried out with 100 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7, in buffer A. The active fractions were diluted with 3 volumes of buffer A and applied on a Blue-Sepharose column (Blue-Sepharose Fast Flow,Amersham Biosciences). Elution was performed with 0.2m NaCl in buffer A, and fractions containing XendoU activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A. The protein mixture was subjected to a second fractionation on hydroxyapatite column. The elution was performed with 10-column volumes of a linear gradient 0–100 mm Na-phosphate, pH 7, in buffer A. Selected fractions were then applied on a gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in buffer A. By this procedure, starting from 15 ml of ONE (7 mg/ml), we obtained sufficient amounts for protein sequencing analysis (∼70 μg). The protein band from SDS-PAGE (5 μg) stained with Coomassie Blue R250 was excised, reduced with dithiothreitol, and carboxamidomethylated. The gel piece was equilibrated in 25 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8, and finally digested in situ with trypsin at 37 °C for 18 h. Peptides were extracted by sonication with 100 μl of 25 mmNH4HCO3/acetonitrile 1:1 v/v, pH 8 (twice). The peptide mixture was fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column 218TP52 (250 × 1 mm), 5 μm, 300 Å pore size (The Separation Group) by using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a flow rate of 90 μl/min. Individual components were manually collected and lyophilized. Sequence analysis was performed using a Procise 491 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 140C microgradient apparatus and a 785A UV detector (Applied Biosystems) for the automated identification of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives, as previously described (20Allegrini S.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra were recorded using a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems), as previously reported (20Allegrini S. Scaloni A. Ferrara L.

Mass calibration was performed using the molecular ions from peptides produced by trypsin auto-proteolysis and the matrix as internal standards. U16- and U86-containing precursors were previously described (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell.

Losito M. Giorgi C. Fatica A. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 2: 1023-1028Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alternatively, 3 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled pre-mRNAs were incubated with 1 μg of ONE (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or with 1 ng of purified XendoU, in 5 mmMnCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg ofEscherichia coli tRNA, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega). The products of the reactions were then analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Oligoribonucleotides P1 (5′-GGAAACGUAUCCUUUGGGAG-3′), P2 (5′-GGAAACGUAUCCUUGGGAGG-3′), and P3 (5′-GGAAACGUAUCCUCUGGGAG-3′) were 5′ end-labeled and incubated in the same conditions as above. Double-stranded P2 was obtained by incubating labeled P2 oligo with its reverse complementary oligo, in a molar ratio of 1:2 for 1 h at 37 °C in 100 mm KOAc, pH 7.5, 30 mm Hepes KOH, pH 7.4, and 2 mm Mg(OAc)2. Double-stranded formation was controlled on a native gel. The RNA ladder was obtained by incubation of P1 oligo (200,000 cpm) in 500 mmNaHCO3 at 90 °C for 20 min. This analysis was performed by two different approaches. In the first one,32P-labeled gel-purified I-1b molecules, generated by incubation of U16-containing precursor with ONE, with purified XendoU, or in vivo, were treated with 10 μl of 10 mmHCl at 25 °C for 2 h to hydrolyze the cyclic phosphate moiety as described by Forster et al. (23Forster A.C. Davies C. Hutchins C.J. Symons R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 583-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The phosphate was then removed by incubation of the RNA in 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, in the presence of 1 unit of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase at 50 °C for 60 min. RNA was subjected to two subsequent purification steps with phenol/chloroform, ethanol precipitated, and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. In the second approach, the I-1b molecule, obtained by incubation with purified XendoU, was gel-eluted and redissolved in 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mmMgCl2, and 1.5 units/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase, and the mixture was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C to remove the 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate (24Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). RNA was then extracted and labeled using [5′-32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase for 5 h at 16 °C. RNA was then analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gel. A X. laevis stage 28 embryo cDNA library, constructed in λZAP II vector, was screened using a specific probe obtained by PCR amplification on X. laeviscDNA with degenerate oligonucleotides (MAHs 5′-ATGGCICAYGAYTAYYTIGT-3′ and IGTa 5′-ACIGGRTAIGCIGTICCIAT-3′) designed on tryptic peptides of purified XendoU. The XendoU ORF was cloned into Blue Script vector and, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were produced byin vitro transcription and translation using the TnT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System kit (Promega). Translational products were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. The XendoU coding sequence was also cloned downstream to the His6coding region of the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). The fusion protein (His6-XendoU) was induced in the E. coli M15 strain. The I-2 and I-4 products, derived from U16 processing, were gel-purified and reverse-transcribed with 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides B3 (5′-TACGTCCACCACGACACAT-3′) and γ (5′-TTTTCCTCAGAACGCAAT-3′), respectively. For the I-4 products derived from U86 processing, oligonucleotide UHindIII (5′-AAGCTTCTTCATGGCGGCTCGGCCAAT-3′) was utilized. We previously developed an in vitro system able to reproduce the in vivo processing of U16 snoRNA from its host intron (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When 32P-labeled U16-containing precursor was incubated with X. laevis ONE, specific endonucleolytic products were obtained (Fig.1B). The I-1 and I-2 molecules derive from cleavage upstream to the U16 coding region, whereas the I-3 and I-4 molecules are produced by cleavage downstream to U16. When double cleavage occurs on the same precursor molecule, pre-U16 products accumulate; these intermediates are eventually converted by exo-trimming to the mature snoRNA (see Fig. 1A). The cleavage sites were previously mapped in correspondence of short U-stretches. Four of them are clustered upstream to U16 and one is located downstream. This cleaving activity was named XendoU (19Caffarelli E. Maggi L. Fatica A. Jiricny J. Bozzoni I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this work we carried out the biochemical purification of XendoU (Fig. 1D). The enzymatic activity was followed, throughout the different steps, by incubating 32P-labeled U16-containing precursor with aliquots of the different fractions and by analyzing the cleavage products on polyacrylamide gels. Because we previously observed the dependence of XendoU activity on Mn2+ ions (19Caffarelli E. Maggi L. Fatica A. Jiricny J. Bozzoni I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), this cofactor was always added to the reaction mixture. The protein content of the active fractions is shown in Fig. 1E. After several chromatographic steps, a single component of 37 kDa was identified in those fractions displaying specific activity (Fig. 1E, lane 6). The elution profile on the gel filtration chromatography was consistent with XendoU being a monomeric protein (not shown). Fig. 1Bshows the comparison of processing activity of 1 μg of ONE (ONElanes) with that of 1 ng of the purified 37-kDa polypeptide (XendoU lanes). In both cases, the same primary cleavage products (I-2 and I-3), their complementary cut-off molecules (I-1 and I-4), and pre-U16 molecules were generated. To analyze the specificity of cleavage of the purified enzyme, primer extension analysis was performed on gel-purified I-2 and I-4 products (Fig.1C). The results indicate that, at short incubation times, XendoU cleaves intronic sequences at the same U-rich regions previously identified in vivo and in extracts (17Caffarelli E. Arese M. Santoro B. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2966-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Four I-2 molecules are generated by cleavages at the a, b, c, and d sites, whereas two I-4 molecules are produced by cleavage at two adjacent U residues, 14 nucleotides downstream to U16 (see representation of Fig.1A). From the reverse transcriptase experiment it appears that the a and b sites are preferentially utilized in the upstream cleavage. As a consequence two major I-1 molecules (a and b) are identified (see gels of Figs. 1 and 4). Efficient cleavage with the purified enzyme was obtained only when Mn2+ ions were present in the reaction (Fig. 1B,lane 7). It is remarkable that the addition of Mn2+ ions in the in vitro assay is required for the purified protein and for all the fractions obtained after the blue-Sepharose step. This finding, along with the requirement of Mn2+ supply when aged oocyte extracts are utilized (not shown), is consistent with a loosely bound metal ion in the protein moiety. The purified enzyme is poorly activated by Mg2+, whereas it is inactive in the presence of Cd2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Pb2+ (not shown). The time course of Fig. 1B shows that the purified enzyme cleaves preferentially at specific sites. Nevertheless, at longer incubations also the primary cleavage products become substrates for further digestion, producing small-sized RNAs only visible on short run gels (not shown). The substrate specificity of XendoU was then tested by incubating the purifed enzyme with a synthetic oligoribonucleotide (P1), containing the upstream distal XendoU cleavage site (site d, Fig.1A), and with mutated derivatives thereof (P2 and P3). The results indicate that the sequence specificity of XendoU is limited to U-stretches and that only two U residues are sufficient for cleavage (Fig. 2A). Incubation of XendoU with the P2 oligo in a double-stranded configuration did not produce any cleavage (lane dsP2), indicating that the enzyme is unable to cleave U-stretches present in double-stranded structures. From these data it appears that, despite the presence of several U-stretches in the U16-host intron upstream and downstream to the snoRNA, specific sites are preferentially cleaved by XendoU. This is similar to what is described for the bacterial RNase E endonuclease, which, even if it has a low primary sequence specificity, cleaves the substrate only at a limited number of sites. In this case, it was shown that the overall secondary structure of the substrate modulated cleavage activity and that the role of stem-loop structures was to limit rather than promote RNase E cleavages (25McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature (London). 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because sno RNAs are folded in specific secondary structures characterized by the conserved terminal core motif (see wild type RNA in lower part of Fig. 2B) (16Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Qu L.H. Garret R.A. Douthwaite S.R. Liljas A. Matheson T. Moore P.B. Noller H.F. The Ribosome: Structure, Function, Antibiotics and Cellular Interactions. ASM Press, Washington, D.

Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and, in many cases, by an apical stem-loop region (27Tycowski K.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1176-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Nicoloso M. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Michot B. Azum M.C. Bachellerie J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5766-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we asked whether these structural elements could influence XendoU activity. Mutants affecting either structure were raised on precursor molecules and tested for XendoU cleavage. The terminal core motif was destroyed in the pre-open stem and pre-ΔC/bD mutants, whereas the apical stem-loop structure was deleted in the pre-Ms1 derivative (see schematic representation of Fig.2B). The pattern of XendoU cleavage on such mutants (Fig.2B) was not altered, suggesting that these structures do not represent entry sites or positioning elements for XendoU. This conclusion was definitely confirmed by the analysis of pre-ΔU16, a mutant completely lacking the snoRNA sequence. XendoU cleaves this RNA at the same sites as the wild type RNA substrate, as indicated by the size of the cleavage products (see Fig. 1A for schematic representation). The chemistry of XendoU cleavage was assessed by determining the chemical nature of the termini in the cleaved products. The ends of 32P-labeled I-1b molecules produced with ONE or with the purified XendoU were analyzed. These molecules were gel-purified and treated either with HCl or alkaline phosphatase or with both. Fig. 2C shows that a slight decrease in migration, due to the loss of a negative charge, is obtained only when the alkaline phosphatase follows the HCl treatment (lane 3). These data allowed us to conclude that the 3′ end of the cleavage products, obtained with ONE (ONE lanes) and with the purified XendoU (XendoU lanes), carry a 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate (23Forster A.C. Davies C. Hutchins C.J. Symons R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 583-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1992; 255: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In fact, only after the acid treatment the phosphate group can be removed by phosphatase, such as to confer slight decrease in gel mobility. As previously reported (21Caffarelli E. Fatica A. Prislei S. De Gregorio E. Fragapane P. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 1996; 5: 1121-1131Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the products of primary cleavage such as I-1 molecules are quite unstablein vivo because, after cleavage, they are rapidly trimmed out. Nevertheless, at very short incubation times we were able to purify small amounts of I-1b molecules and to subject them to the same treatment described above. Fig. 2C (in vivo lanes) shows that a slight reduction in migration was obtained, demonstrating that the products of the in vivo reaction also have 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate ends. The nature of the 3′ ends was also tested by a different approach (24Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The I-1b molecule, generated by XendoU cleavage, was ligated to [5′-32P]pCp directly or after kinase treatment, which removes the 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate. The appearance of a radioactive band only after kinase treatment (lane 3 of Fig. 2D) confirms that this molecule has 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate. After elution from the gel, the 37-kDa polypeptide was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting peptide mixture was resolved by reversed-phase HPLC, and selected peptide fractions were submitted to automated Edman degradation. Three tryptic peptides (indicated as #1, #2, and #3 in Fig. 3) were utilized to derive degenerate oligonucleotides. These were employed, in different combinations, in PCR amplification reactions on cDNA from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from X. laevis oocytes. Only the reaction performed with sequence #1 (forward) and sequence #3 (reverse) gave a specific amplification product of 500 nucleotides. Sequencing of this product indicated the presence of an open reading frame containing peptide #2. This cDNA probe was then utilized for screening a X. laevis stage 28 embryo cDNA library, allowing the isolation of a full-length cDNA (Fig. 3). 65% of the amino acid sequence determined was confirmed by MALDI-mass spectrometry spectra of the tryptic peptides. The XendoU ORF, 876-bp-long, was cloned into the Blue Script vector and the protein was produced by in vitro transcription and translation using a reticulocyte lysate. The translation product was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and resulted in a 37-kDa protein (Fig.4A). To assess the activity of this polypeptide, the reticulocyte lysate expressing the XendoU ORF was incubated with 32P-labeled U16-containing precursor. Fig.4B shows that the cleavage pattern produced by the in vitro-translated 37 kDa protein (lane 2) matches that obtained with the extracts (lane 1). Furthermore, the lack of cleavage when Mn2+ ions were not added to the reaction mixture (lane 3) confirms the specific ion requirement of XendoU and suggests that the binding to this cofactor is reversible. As a negative control, the activity assay was carried out by incubating the RNA substrate with an uncommitted reticulocyte lysate in the presence of Mn2+ ions (lane 4). Fig. 4 also shows that a His6-XendoU recombinant protein expressed in bacteria is able to reproduce the cleavage pattern of the purified enzyme (lane 5). We previously identified a novel box C/D snoRNA, named U86, which is encoded by an intron of the NOP56 gene ofX. laevis (18Filippini D. Renzi F. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly to U16 snoRNA, U86 is also contained in a poorly spliceable intron and its biosynthesis appears to be alternative to that of the co-transcribed mRNA. Injection of32P-labeled U86-containing precursor into X. laevis oocytes generates the truncated products I-2 and I-3 and their 5′ and 3′ cut-off molecules, I-1 and I-4 (Fig.5A, in vivo lanes). Processing of U86-containing precursor with purified XendoU (Fig. 5A, XendoU lanes) or with the reticulocyte lysate expressing XendoU ORF (Fig. 5C, lane 2) demonstrates that the enzyme is responsible for the cleavage occurring downstream to the U86 coding region. The activity responsible for the cleavage upstream to U86, which produces I-2 and I-1 molecules, is still unidentified and it is not also reproduced in oocyte nuclear extracts (Fig. 5A, ONE lanes). The XendoU cleavage sites, downstream to U86, were mapped by primer extension on I-4 molecules and found to localize in correspondence of three U-rich sequences (Fig. 5B). In this study we report the purification to homogeneity of XendoU, an activity previously shown to be involved in the release of the intron-encoded U16 and U86 snoRNAs from their host primary transcripts in X.laevis oocytes. XendoU is a novel endoribonuclease in that it requires Mn2+ ions and produces 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate termini. Such ends have been previously associated solely with metal-independent (2Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13011-13014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1985; 40: 731-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or Mg2+-dependent endoribonucleases (31Bachmann M. Messer R. Trautmann F. Muller W.E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 783: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Gandini-Attardi D. Margarit I. Tocchini-Valentini G.P.

On the contrary, Mn2+-requiring endonucleases usually produce 5′-P and 3′-OH ends (34Cirino N.M. Cameron C.E. Smith J.S. Rausch J.W. Roth M.J. Benkovic S.J. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9936-9943Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Eder P.S. Walder J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6472-6479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemistry of cleavage of XendoU strongly resembles that of ribozymes, where the metal, positioned near the attacking 2′-oxygen, increases its nucleophilicity and allows the transesterification reaction with the production of cyclic 3′ ends (36Pan T. Long D.M. Uhlenbeck O.C. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. CSHL Press, New York1993: 271-302Google Scholar). Until structural data are available, it will not be possible to assess the role of Mn2+ in the catalytic activity of XendoU. A clear example that metal ions can have a direct role in phosphoryl-transfer reactions in the context of metallo-proteins was derived from the crystal structure of the DNA polymerase I, 3′-5′-exonuclease domain, complexed with single-stranded DNA. In this case, two metal ions form complexes with the scissible phosphate and water, facilitating formation of the attacking hydroxide ion and stabilizing the transition state (37Freemont P.S. Friedman J.M. Beese L.S. Sanderson M.R. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8924-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 38Steitz J.A. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6498-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The role of the protein component would be exclusively to correctly orient the metal ions, the substrate, and the attacking water molecule. By analogy, it could be possible that in the case of XendoU, Mn2+ might participate directly in the catalytic step, whereas the protein component may assist the reaction by orienting the ions to specific sites on the substrate. The availability of the active recombinant protein will allow us to answer this question in the near future. Characterization of XendoU activity indicated that it does not have a stringent sequence specificity in that only two U-residues are sufficient for cleavage. Nevertheless, preferential cleavages occur at specific U-stretches localized upstream and downstream to U16 snoRNA. At prolonged incubations the other U-rich regions are also cleaved, converting the primary products into small-sized RNA species. Because sno RNAs, and in particular U16, have been described to be folded in specific secondary structures characterized by the conserved terminal core motif (16Bachellerie J.P. Cavaillé J. Qu L.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 17: 4473-4479Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and, in many cases, by an apical stem-loop region (27Tycowski K.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1176-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Nicoloso M. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Michot B. Azum M.C. Bachellerie J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5766-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we asked whether these elements could provide some structural information for directing the preferential activity of the enzyme. Instead, we have observed that these structural motifs of U16 are not required for positioning XendoU cleavage. This is analogous to the case of RNase E in which McDowall et al. (25McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature (London). 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have described that stem-loops do not serve as entry sites for the enzyme, but instead they limit cleavage at potentially susceptible sites more accessible than others to the nuclease. It is possible to suggest that in vivo specific RNA/protein interactions should control the accessibility of the nuclease only to the specific sites on the pre-mRNA. hnRNP C was previously shown (40Santoro B. De Gregorio E. Caffarelli E. Bozzoni I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6975-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to interact in vivo with the U-stretches, which are XendoU substrates and to interfere with cleavage. It is possible to imagine that the hnRNP C, deposited on the nascent RNA during transcription, can be displaced at specific locations and under specific circumstances. An attractive hypothesis is that the assembly of snoRNP factors on the nascent snoRNA could displace hnRNP C from the flanking regions and help the recruitment of XendoU, allowing site-specific cleavage and release of the snoRNA. This would be similar to what is demonstrated in the yeast system where the endonucleolytic release of U18 snoRNA from its host intron depends on assembly of snoRNPs, which in turn recruit the Rnt1p endoribonuclease (13Giorgi C. Fatica A. Nagel R. Bozzoni I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6856-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The antagonistic effect of hnRNP C and XendoU can represent the basis for the post-transcriptional regulation of the U16 snoRNA processing. In analogy with Rnt1p, which is involved in the maturation of different RNA molecules (pre-rRNA, snRNAs, and snoRNAs) it is possible that XendoU is required for many other processes of RNA maturation or turnover. So far, we do not know whether XendoU is also present in the cytoplasm and whether it plays any role in this compartment. Data base search for XendoU homologs identified significant homology (38% identity and 55% similarity) only with a human putative serine protease (41Grundmann U. Romisch J. Siebold B. Bohn H. Amann E. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which, in turn, has homologs inCaenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Mus musculus.

The scaffold of the PSII reaction center is formed by two protein subunits, D1 and D2, where the cofactors for photosynthetic electron transport are located, and by cytochromeb559. Cytochrome b559 is located in close proximity to D1/D2 and is found in the smallest experimentally obtainable PSII complex capable of carrying out light-induced charge separation (1Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytochrome, encoded by thepsbE and psbF genes, has a heterodimeric structure consisting of one α- and one β-subunit, both of which form single transmembrane α-helices (2Tae G.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10060-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The heme group is ligated by two histidine residues, one located in the α- and one in the β-subunit, as revealed by x-ray crystallography (3Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The heme is bis(histidine) 6-fold-coordinated, as was demonstrated spectroscopically (4Babcock G.T. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Oertling W.A. Metz J.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Walker F.A. Huynh B.H. Scheidt W.R. Osvath S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5288-5297Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the oxidized heme iron is anisotropic, with gz ∼3.00, gy ∼2.20, and gx ∼1.50, indicative of a low-spin species. These values are consistent with two ligating histidine planes being perpendicular (or nearly perpendicular) to each other (5Walker F.A. Huynh B.H. Scheidt W.R. Osvath S.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5288-5297Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Likewise, the orientation of the heme ring was determined to be perpendicular to the membrane plane (6Bergstroem J. Vaenngard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 452-456Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Different potential forms for cytochrome b559are known: the high potential form, which is found in active oxygen-evolving PSII; the intermediate form; and the low potential form, which is found in PSII with an impaired oxygen-evolving complex (for review, see Ref. 7Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The different redox forms of cytochromeb559 are characterized by small changes of the g-values in their EPR spectra, indicating very subtle changes in the heme coordination (such as a small change in the relative orientation of the histidine planes). There is an ongoing debate whether one or two cytochrome b559 units are present per PSII, although most recent publications (for reviews, see Refs. 2Tae G.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10060-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and7Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and the x-ray structure suggest that there is only one (3Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b559 is an indispensable constituent of PSII, but its function remains unclear. It is a redox-active protein, and both photooxidation and photoreduction of its heme iron have been observed. Because these reactions are very slow and characterized by low quantum yields, it is generally assumed that the cytochrome takes no active part in the primary electron transfer reaction. A direct electron donation from cytochromeb559 to P680+ bypassing the physiological donor, the Mn-cluster, is observed only under prolonged illumination at 77 K (8Butler W.L Visser J.W.M. Simmons H.L Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 9Thompson L.K. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that electron donation from the cytochrome occurs via a redox-active carotene (10Hanley J. Deligiannakis Y. Pascal A. Faller P. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8189-8195Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) rather than via a redox-active chlorophyll as previously thought. Several functions have been assigned to cytochromeb559 in the literature, ranging from its putative participation in the mechanism of water oxidation (11Fiege R. Shualov V.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 387: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), a function in the assembly of PSII (12Morais F. Barber J. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29315-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Morais F. Kühn K. Stewart D.H. Barber J. Brudvig G.W. Nixon P.J. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), to a role in photoprotection (for review, see Ref. 7Stewart D.H. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Morais et al. (13Morais F. Kühn K. Stewart D.H. Barber J. Brudvig G.W. Nixon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31986-31993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) investigated cytochrome b559 mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in which the heme-ligating histidine of the α-subunit was replaced by different amino acids. In contrast to earlier reports of cytochrome b559 knockout mutants (e.g. 15) or mutations of the heme axial ligands (16Pakrasi H.B. De Ciechi P. Whitmarsh J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that did not assemble PSII, these mutants assembled few but functional oxygen-evolving PSII centers, although the cytochromeb559 did not contain a heme group. This finding seems to exclude a function of cytochrome b559in photosynthetic water splitting, and it was proposed that cytochromeb559 plays a protective role under photoinhibitory illumination. Recently, it has also been suggested that cytochrome b559 may function as a plastoquinol oxidase (17Kruk J. Strzalka K. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 62: 273-279Crossref Google Scholar, 18Kruk J. Strzalka K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 86-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In higher plants, the cytochrome b559 α- and β-subunits are encoded by the psbE and psbFgenes in the plastid genome and are cotranscribed as part of a tetracistronic transcription unit (psbE operon). Here we describe the characterization of a cytochromeb559 mutant created in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in which the conserved phenylalanine at position 26 in the β-subunit of cytochrome b559 was changed to serine (19Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In tobacco, the codon for phenylalanine is present at the DNA level, whereas in spinach the codon for phenylalanine is created post-transcriptionally from a genomically encoded UCU (serine) codon by C-to-U RNA editing. The mutant was produced by inserting the spinach editing site into the tobacco psbF gene via chloroplast transformation (19Bock R. Kössel H. Maliga P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The resulting transplastomic tobacco plants were incapable of editing the spinach site and hence contained a serine instead of the conserved phenylalanine in position 26 of the PsbF protein. This single amino acid change resulted in an altered phenotype. The mutant tobacco plants grew photoautotrophically but significantly slower than the wild type. The mutants had a light-green leaf color and showed a high chlorophyll fluorescence phenotype. Here we present a detailed analysis of this mutant at the levels of chloroplast ultrastructure and photosynthetic electron transport. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacumcv. Petit Havanna) plants were grown in soil at a light intensity of 100 μmol quanta m−2s−1. Based on published sequences in the data bases, two primers were designed to amplify the gene coding for the α-subunit of cytochrome b559 fromNarcissus pseudonarcissus L. Total RNA was isolated from daffodil flowers using RNA-Easy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and a 280-bp cDNA fragment encoding the entire α-subunit of cytochrome b559 was amplified by RT-PCR. The fragment was then cloned into PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), yielding the plasmid pCYT, and the insert was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was highly homologous to previously determined sequences of the cytochromeb559 α-subunit gene from other plants. To express the cytochrome b559 α-subunit as a GST fusion in Escherichia coli cells, aSmaI/EcoR I fragment containing the coding region was excised from pCYT and cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to yield pGST-cytochrome b599. Attempts to purify the fusion protein by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose failed. Therefore, total E. coliprotein extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the overexpressed protein was excised from the gel and subsequently purified by electroelution. The purified protein was finally used to immunize mice and a rabbit. Specimens were prepared for thin sectioning by fixing small pieces (1 mm2) of tobacco leaves with 1.0% formaldehyde and 0.5% glutardialdehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). For routine preparations, the samples were dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin (20Luft J.H. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 9: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (6126) Google Scholar). Samples for immunolabeling techniques were embedded in LR White (21Newman G.R. Jasani B. Williams E.D. Histochem. J. 1983; 15: 543-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thin sections were performed with the ultramicrotome Ultracut E (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and prepared on formvar-coated nickel grids. Routine sections were stained with uranyl acetate (22Watson M.L. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1958; 4: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) followed by lead citrate (23Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1958; 17: 208-212Crossref Scopus (17747) Google Scholar). Sections to be used for immunolabeling techniques were stained with uranyl acetate only. Ultrathin sections were examined with a Philips CM-10 electron microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a Bioscan camera (model 792, Gatan, München, Germany). The electron micrographs taken at an acceleration voltage of 60 and 80 kV were processed by a digital image system (Digital Micrograph, Gatan, München, Germany). Immunolabeling techniques were carried out on ultrathin sections after embedding and sectioning (24Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). As primary antibodies we used an anti-α-cytochrome b559antiserum raised against the recombinant protein (see below), and 12 nm Colloidal Gold-AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and 12 nm Colloidal Gold-AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG were employed as secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). In control experiments preimmune serum was used instead of specific primary antibodies. Morphometric measurements were performed on electron micrographs enlarged to a final magnification of ×62500. The grade of labeling intensity of cytochromeb559 in wild-type and mutant chloroplasts was compared by counting gold particles per area (1 μm2) on longitudinally sectioned chloroplasts. 16 or more areas were counted on different chloroplasts of the mutant and the wild type and compared with control samples labeled with preimmune serum. SDS gel electrophoresis was carried out in 14% polyacrylamide gels according to the method described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using a Multiphor II Novablot unit (Amersham Biosciences). For detection, the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thylakoid membranes were prepared according to Ref. 26Laasch H. Planta. 1987; 171: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, with the modification that the grinding medium additionally contained 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.2% (w/v) ascorbate. PSII-enriched membrane fragments (PSII particles) were prepared essentially as described in Ref. 27Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-236Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar. The activity of samples obtained from wild-type plants was 325 μmol O2/(mg Chl * h) (measured in the presence of 0.5 mmp-phenylbenzoquinone). To determine contamination with PSI 77-K fluorescence was examined, and the area of the emission band at 730 nm was less than 5% for the wild type and ∼50% for the mutant. Oxygen evolution activity was measured using a Hansatech O2 electrode in a suspension medium containing 0.3 m sucrose, 15 mm NaCl, and 20 mm MES, pH 6.5. The chlorophyll concentration of the samples was adjusted to 30 μg/ml. 0.5 mm methylviologen was used as electron acceptor and 1 μm nigericin as uncoupler. PSII activity was measured by using 0.5 mmphenyl-p-benzoquinone instead of methylviologen as electron acceptor. PSI activity was measured as the rate of oxygen uptake using 30 μg of Chl/ml, 10 μm DCMU, 5 mmascorbate, 30 μm DCPIP, 0.5 mmmethylviologen, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 μm nigericin. Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured in vivowith a pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometer (PAM 101–3, Walz, Effeltrich) as described in Ref. 28Schreiber U. Schliwa U. Bilger W. Photosynth. Res. 1986; 10: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar. The intensity of the measuring analytic light (standard PAM 101 set) was sufficiently low (integral intensity about 10−8 mol quanta·m−2·s−1, frequency of modulated light: 1.6 kHz) to prevent the reduction of PQ. As actinic white light, a cold light source was used with an intensity of 300 μmol quanta·m−2·s−1. 77-K fluorescence was measured using a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer (ISAII) equipped with a Dewar cuvette. 40% glycerol was added prior to filling the sample (5 μg Chl/ml) into a quartz capillary. Thermoluminescence was recorded with a home-built apparatus described in Ref. 29Krieger A. Bolte S. Dietz K.J. Ducruet J.M. Planta. 1998; 205: 587-594Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Leaf segments (1 cm × 0.5 cm) were incubated for 5 min in the dark at 20 °C, then cooled within 1 min to 1 °C and illuminated with a saturating single turnover flash. Light emission was recorded during heating of the sample up to 70 °C with a heating rate of 0.4 °C/min. Data analysis was performed according to Ref.30Ducruet J.M. Miranda T. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 33: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Difference absorption spectra were recoded using an Aminco dual wavelength photometer. PSII particles (120 μg of Chl/ml) were oxidized by adding 0.1 mm K3(Fe(CN)6). The reduction was performed by first adding hydroquinone (0.3 mm), followed by ascorbate (0.6 mm), and finally a few grains of dithionite. EPR was performed using a Bruker ER-300 spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford ESR 9 cryostat, a Hewlett-Packard 5350B frequency counter, and a Bruker 035-mNMR gauss meter. Illumination at 200 K was performed in an ethanol/solid CO2 bath in an unsilvered Dewar flask, using a 300-watt projector lamp. 150 μl of material was transferred in a fused-quartz sample holder. A typical chlorophyll concentration for the measurements was 3.4 mg of Chl/ml. Studies of the ultrastructure of wild-type and mutant chloroplasts by electron microscopy (Fig.1, A and B) showed that the structural organization of the membrane was significantly altered by the single amino acid exchange from phenyalanine to serine in the cytochrome b559 β-chain at position 26. In the mutant, the structure of thylakoid grana and stroma lamella was disordered, whereas in the wild type the well ordered structure of grana stacks separated by stroma lamella as well as starch granules was nicely seen. The mutant had only small grana stacks, which were less well stacked than in the wild type and showed a much lower degree of structural order. In addition, starch accumulation was much less pronounced in the mutant, and starch granules (when present) were significantly smaller than in the wild type. Fig. 1E shows a Western blot of thylakoid membrane proteins from wild type and the cytochrome b559 mutant stained with antibodies raised against the α-subunit of cytochromeb559. The alteration in the sequence of the β-subunit of cytochrome b559 led to a lower concentration of cytochrome b559 relative to the chlorophyll concentration. Western blots conducted with a range of chlorophyll concentrations per sample indicated a reduction of the levels of PsbE to 10–30% of the wild type (data not shown). Immunolocalization of cytochrome b559, using secondary antibodies coupled to gold particles for detection, showed that the staining of the wild-type chloroplasts was much higher than for the mutant (Fig. 1, C and D). In the wild-type chloroplast a clustering of gold particles can be seen at the grana stacks, whereas in the mutant the less abundant gold particles are more equally distributed. The gold labels, unequivocally identifiable by their intense electron contrast and size (12-nm diameter) were morphometrically evaluated. 92 ± 39 gold particles were counted per μm2 for the wild type compared with 20 ± 13 particles for the mutant, whereas in controls with preimmune serum less than 1 gold particle per μm2 was counted. The mean values of wild-type and mutant chloroplasts are significantly different at a 99.5% confidence level. We then investigated the effect of the mutation on other proteins of the photosynthetic machinery. Thylakoids and PSII-enriched membrane fragments (PSII particles) from wild type and the cytochromeb559 mutant were compared by Western blot analyses for the abundance of CP47, FNR, OEC 33, and OEC 23. Fig.2 shows that the amount of the membrane-integral PSII protein CP 47 was considerably reduced in mutant thylakoids, whereas there was no significant difference in PSII particles, as expected. All other proteins examined remained largely unchanged in thylakoids. On the other hand, in PSII particles a signal for the 23-kDa protein was not detectable in the mutant, although it was present in thylakoid membranes. This indicates that this luminal extrinsic protein was not attached to PSII. The extrinsic OEC 33 behaved differently, being detectable in PSII particles of both origins. Previous studies have shown that high concentrations of OEC 23 protein are present in the thylakoid lumen (31Kieselbach T. Hagman A. Andersson B. Schröder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6710-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and even in etioplasts in the complete absence of PSII (14Müller B. Eichacker L.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K recorded with thylakoid membranes from the wild type and the mutant. The maxima at 684, 690, and 730 nm are generally attributed to emissions originating predominantly from light-harvesting complex and antenna pigments of PSII (684 and 690 nm) and PSI (730 nm) (32van Dorsen R.J. Plijter J.J. Dekker J.P. den Ouden A. Amesz J. van Gorkom H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 134-143Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the mutant, the ratio of emission at 684/730 nm (ratio PSII/PSI) was lower compared with the wild type, indicating that the amount of PSII was decreased relative to PSI. In addition, in the mutant the first peak was slightly shifted by 2 nm to 682 nm. Absorption spectra at room temperature of thylakoid membranes from mature leaves showed no difference between the wild type and the mutant. Likewise, the chl a/b ratio was unchanged, indicating that there were no severe structural changes in the antenna system of PSII (data not shown). To test whether the photosynthetic electron transport chain was inhibited in the mutant, we measured the activity of PSII, PSI, and the entire electron transport chain in the presence of an uncoupler (TableI). PSII activity was reduced by 60% in thylakoid membranes obtained from the mutant, whereas the PSI activity remained unchanged compared with the wild type. The activity of the total electron transport chain was reduced in the mutant by 75%. Similarly, PSII-enriched membrane fragments isolated according to Ref.27Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-236Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar showed a 75% lower activity than the wild type. This latter result is somewhat unexpected but could either be because of reduced PSII stability during preparation or a certain degree of PSI impurity. Consequently, the loss in PSII activity may be overestimated.Table IActivity of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in wild-type and mutant thylakoid membranesMutantWild typeμmol O2/(mg chl*h)μmol O2/(mg chl*h)Thylakoid membranes PSII activity51120 PSI activity156141 Total electron transport34145PSII particles PSII activity85325Total electron transport was measured as O2 uptake using methylviologen as electron acceptor.

Open table in a new tab Total electron transport was measured as O2 uptake using methylviologen as electron acceptor. PSII activity was measured as O2 evolution using p-phenylbenzoquinone as electron acceptor. PSI activity was measured as O2 uptake in the presence of DCMU, DCPIP, ascorbate, Na azide, and methylviologen. All activities were determined in the presence of nigericin as uncoupler. To test whether the cytochrome b559 of the mutant contained a heme group, we measured difference absorption spectra of PSII-enriched membrane fragments between 535 and 590 nm. Fig.4 shows the respective reduced minus oxidized optical difference spectra of the wild type and the mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). Ferricyanide was used as oxidant, whereas hydroquinone, ascorbate, and dithionite were subsequently added as reductants to estimate the potential form of cytochrome b559. As shown in Fig. 4, an absorption maximum was observed at 559 nm, indicative for cytochromeb559 in both mutant and wild type. However, the signal size was approximately five times smaller in the mutant on a chlorophyll basis. In addition the α-absorption band was broadened (FWHM 13 nm compared with 10 nm in the wild type). About 30% of the oxidized cytochrome b559 was already reduced by the addition of hydroquinone, indicating that a certain fraction was present in the high potential form. Subsequent addition of ascorbate reduced the signal to about 50% compared with the completely reduced cytochrome b559. This indicates that cytochromeb559 was present in all the known potential forms. To further characterize the electron transport in PSII of the mutant, EPR spectra arising from radical species formed at the donor and acceptor side of PSII upon 200 K illumination were recorded (Table II). Upon illumination at 200 K, a normal multiline signal of the S2 state of the Mn-containing water-oxidizing complex (33Dismukes G.C. Siderer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 274-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was detected, showing that the ability of the oxygen-evolving complex to advance from the dark stable S1 state to S2 was not affected by the mutation. TyrD+ could also be detected in both the mutant and the wild type. 200 K illumination induced the Fe-QA− at g = 1.90 signal (34Zimmermann J.L. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 416-423Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the acceptor side of PSII also functioned normally. In addition, some photoaccumulation of ChlZ+was observed. This indicates that the electron transfer reactions associated with PSII were not perturbed by the mutation. However, the EPR signal sizes were significantly smaller in PSII particles from the mutant as compared with the wild type when the samples were measured at an equal chlorophyll basis. Here, one has to keep in mind that, because of the altered PSII:PSI stoichiometry, the enrichment of PSII relative to PSI was low in PSII particles from the mutant.Table IIFluorescence and EPR signals obtained with mutant and wild-type tobacco plantsMutantWild-typeFv/Fm0.350.76EPR signals S2 multiline++ Signal IIvery smallvery small YD++ Fe-QA− signal++Fluorescence values were obtained with intact dark-adapted leaves, EPR signals with PSII-enriched membrane fragments. Open table in a new tab Fluorescence values were obtained with intact dark-adapted leaves, EPR signals with PSII-enriched membrane fragments. In dark-adapted mutant samples, no oxidized high-potential cytochromeb559 was seen by EPR following incubation with 5 mm potassium ferricyanide (an adequate oxidant for both the cytochrome b559 and the non-heme iron). Surprisingly, even under prolonged 77 K illumination no signal of oxidized cytochrome b559 could be detected, although the amount of Car+/Chl+ formed was significantly smaller than in the wild type. This indicates that some cytochrome b559 was oxidized but invisible, perhaps because of a broadening of the signal. To study the PSII activity in vivo, chlorophyll fluorescence and thermoluminescence measurements were performed. Fig.5 shows fluorescence curves measured on dark-adapted leaves of wild-type (upper panel) and mutant plants (lower panel). In the mutant, a high level ofF0 fluorescence was detected, and this causes the low variable fluorescence/maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) ratio shown in Table II. Upon switching on the actinic light (I = 300 μmol quanta m−2s−1), first theFm was reached, but this was then quenched during prolonged illumination. This quenching during illumination with actinic light was slower in the mutant than in the wild type, and a longer illumination time was needed to reach the steady state. The minimum fluorescence level finally reached was equivalent to the steady state level in actinic light observed with wild-type plants (close to the F0 level). After switching off the actinic light, the fluorescence increased to the fluorescence level observed prior to the illumination with actinic light. Lowering of the light intensity of the measuring light beam did not change this behavior, indicating that this high F0 level was not caused by a too high intensity of the measuring light. Such elevatedF0 levels are most likely caused by dark reduction of the plastoquinone pool, resulting in a reduced acceptor side of PSII in the dark. In a"
https://openalex.org/W2157169279,"Entry of enveloped animal viruses into their host cells always depends on a step of membrane fusion triggered by conformational changes in viral envelope glycoproteins. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection is mediated by virus spike glycoprotein G, which induces membrane fusion at the acidic environment of the endosomal compartment. VSV-induced membrane fusion occurs at a very narrow pH range, between 6.2 and 5.8, suggesting that His protonation is required for this process. To investigate the role of His in VSV fusion, we chemically modified these residues using diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC). We found that DEPC treatment inhibited membrane fusion mediated by VSV in a concentration-dependent manner and that the complete inhibition of fusion was fully reversed by incubation of modified virus with hydroxylamine. Fluorescence measurements showed that VSV modification with DEPC abolished pH-induced conformational changes in G protein, suggesting that His protonation drives G protein interaction with the target membrane at acidic pH. Mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments of modified G protein allowed the identification of the putative active His residues. Using synthetic peptides, we showed that the modification of His-148 and His-149 by DEPC, as well as the substitution of these residues by Ala, completely inhibited peptide-induced fusion, suggesting the direct participation of these His in VSV fusion."

Biochemical characterizations of Pol ε have been cumbersome due to protease sensitivity and the limited amounts of Pol ε in cells. We have developed a protocol for overexpression and purification of Pol ε from S. cerevisiae. The native four-subunit complex was purified to homogeneity by conventional chromatography. Pol ε was characterized biochemically by sedimentation velocity experiments and gel filtration experiments. The stoichiometry of the four subunits was estimated to be 1:1:1:1 from colloidal Coomassie-stained gels. Based on the sedimentation coefficient (11.9 S) and the Stokes radius (74.5 Å), a molecular mass for Pol ε of 371 kDa was calculated, in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 379 kDa for a heterotetramer. Furthermore, analytical equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments support the proposed heterotetrameric structure of Pol ε. Thus, both DNA polymerase δ and Pol ε are purified as monomeric complexes, in agreement with accumulating evidence that Pol δ and Pol ε are located on opposite strands of the eukaryotic replication fork.

Thus, both DNA polymerase δ and Pol ε are purified as monomeric complexes, in agreement with accumulating evidence that Pol δ and Pol ε are located on opposite strands of the eukaryotic replication fork. Pioneering studies in the SV40 DNA replication system by several research groups resulted in the reconstitution of the SV40 replication fork with mammalian proteins in vitro (1Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This system showed that DNA polymerase α is required for priming the DNA since it is associated with primase activity. Only DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) 1The abbreviations used are: Pol εDNA polymerase εPol δDNA polymerase δssedimentation coefficient was required to replicate both leading and lagging strand, leaving another essential eukaryotic DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε), without a specific function. However, there are several lines of evidence for the presence of Pol ε at the eukaryotic replication fork. Evidence for a physical interaction came from cross-linking experiments, which showed that Pol ε is located at or near the replication fork (2Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have shown that Pol ε participates at the replication fork. Cells grown in the presence of 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine showed a strand-specific mutation rate on the chromosome, depending on whether they carried an exonuclease-deficient Pol ε or Pol δ (3Shcherbakova P.V. Pavlov Y.I. Genetics. 1996; 142: 717-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that loss of the exonuclease site in either Pol δ or Pol ε alters the mutation spectra of the sup-4 gene when replicated on a plasmid (4Karthikeyan R. Vonarx E.J. Straffon A.F.L. Simon M. Faye G. Kunz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The altered mutational spectrum was again strand-specific. In addition, the overall mutation rate is increased about 10-fold in yeast strains that carry a pol2 mutant that is lacking proofreading capability, suggesting that Pol ε contributes to the bulk synthesis of newly replicated DNA (5Morrison A. Sugino A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Evidence for a direct role during the progression of the fork has emerged from in vitroreplication assays in Xenopus extracts in a cell-free system (6Waga S. Masuda T. Takisawa H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase ε DNA polymerase δ sedimentation coefficient A very surprising result was obtained when the catalytic domain of Pol ε was deleted in yeast (7Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain was not essential. The essential property of the enzyme was instead located at the C terminus of the largest subunit (7Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 8Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Cells that were expressing only the C terminus were viable, although they had growth problems. However, later it was shown that cells were not viable when carrying a point mutation in the conserved catalytic site of Pol ε (9Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although Pol ε is normally present at the fork, in the absence of the catalytic domain, another DNA polymerase, presumably Pol δ, can substitute its function. Pol ε consists of four subunits, Pol2p (256 kDa), Dpb2p (79 kDa), Dpb3p (23 kDa), and Dpb4p (22 kDa) (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The largest subunit, Pol2p, contains the catalytic site and an essential putative zinc-finger domain at the C terminus (9Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The other three subunits have an unknown function. There has been very limited biochemical characterization of the four-subunit enzyme since it was first purified in 1990 (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in part due to the limited amount of enzyme in the cells, the tedious purification protocol, and the sensitivity of the enzyme to proteolytic cleavage (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu W. Linn S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several models of the structure of the eukaryotic replication fork have been proposed (1Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 12Falaschi A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 88-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Burgers P.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Mol. Cells. 2001; 12: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar). A common theme has been the coupled synthesis of the leading and lagging strands in which the replicative DNA polymerase should form a dimer as has been observed inEscherichia coli (15Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Earlier studies suggested the existence of a dimeric Pol δ with two catalytic assemblies, and a model where a dimeric Pol δ would replicate both leading and lagging strand was proposed (13Burgers P.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it has now been demonstrated that Pol δ actually is a monomer in vitro and that the previous estimates of the molecular weight of Pol δ were misleading due to the elongated shape of the enzyme (18Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The initial analysis of the four-subunit Pol ε included an estimate of the molecular mass and the subunit stoichiometry (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass was estimated to be 295 kDa from the hydrodynamic properties of the enzyme, and the molar ratio of the four subunits was estimated at Pol2:Dpb2:Dpb3:Dpb4 = 1:1:3:4. This molar ratio predicted a molecular mass of 492 kDa, which was substantially different from that determined experimentally. The authors concluded that the enzyme was purified as a monomer with an elongated shape. Pol ε has also been proposed to form a dimer based on yeast two-hybrid assays and gel filtration experiments using Pol ε overproduced in a baculovirus system (9Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In light of these contradictory results we wished to clarify whether Pol ε exists as a monomer or a dimer when overproduced in yeast. Therefore, we developed an overexpression system that allowed us to purify native Pol ε from yeast, i.e.without tags. Our studies of the assembly state of this enzyme show it to be a monomeric assembly of one each of the four subunits. A protease-deficient yeast strain was used for the overexpression of Pol ε. PY116 (ura 3–52, trp 1Δ, his 3–11, 15, pep 4–4, prb 1–1122 (prc1–407) (CANsens), leu 2–3, 112, nuc 1: LEU 2) was transformed with plasmids pJL1 and pJL6 (see below). This strain for overexpression of Pol ε was called YEJ1. PJL1 contained the POL2 gene and pJL6 contained theDPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 genes under the control of the GAL1–10 promoter. The plasmids carried a 2-μm origin and either TRP1 or URA3as selective markers. All plasmids were based on the pRS424GAL and pRS426GAL from the pRS424–426GAL series of plasmids (a kind gift from P. Burgers). The POL2 gene was amplified from the plasmid YCplac33 POL2 (20Araki H. Ropp P.A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Morrison A. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with the following oligonucleotides: POL2–1, 5′-TTCTAGAGCGGCCGCATGATGTTTGGCAAGAAAAAAAACAACGG-3′; POL2–2, 5′-AACACGAGCTCTCATATGGTCAAATCAGCAATACAACTCAATAA-3′. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with NotI and SacI, purified, and ligated into prs424GAL opened in NotI andSacI. The 500 nucleotides most approximate toNotI and SacI were sequenced to make sure that no mutations were inserted by KlenTaq LA during the amplification of the insert. After this, the overexpression plasmid was digested withPshAI and NgoMIV to remove most of the POL2 gene. The YCplac33 POL2 plasmid was also digested with PshAI andNgoMIV, and the 6151-nucleotide fragment containing the POL2 gene was subcloned into the opened prs424GAL-POL2 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named pJL1. DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 were amplified from W303 genomic DNA with the following oligonucleotides: DPB2–1, 5′-TTCTAGGATCCATGTGTGAAATGTTTGGCTCTGGGA-3′; DPB2–2, 5′-TTCTAGAGCGGCCGCAAACGGTAGGCCAAGTAAACTGCCC-3′; DPB3–1, 5′-TTCTAGAGCGGCCGCTCAACCGTGTTGCAAAAAAAATGTCC-3′; DPB3–2, 5′-AACACGAGCTCGTAATTGTGGCACAGGCAAGCTG-3′; DPB4–1, 5′-TTCTAGAGAATTCATGCCACCAAAAGGTTGGAGAAAAG-3′; DPB4–2, 5′-AACACGTCGACATATTCAGTTGCTCTAATCGGAGC-3′. The amplifiedDPB2 gene was digested with BamHI andNotI, purified, and ligated into theBamHI-NotI sites of prs424GAL. The resulting plasmid was called pJL2. The amplified DPB3 gene was digested with NotI and SacI, purified, and ligated into the NotI-SacI sites of prs426GAL. This plasmid was called pJL3. The amplified DPB4 gene was digested with EcoRI and SalI, purified, and ligated into the EcoRI-SalI sites of prs426GAL. This plasmid was called pJL4. Next, DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 were sequenced to confirm that no mutations had been inserted by the polymerase during the amplification. This was followed by the digestion of pJL3 and pJL4 with BamHI andSacI. The fragment from pJL3 that contained DPB3was cloned into the BamHI-SacI sites of the pJL4 plasmid. This plasmid was digested with SacI and blunt-ended with Klenow. pJL2 was digested with SapI andHincII, over-hangs were filled in by Klenow, andDPB2 was ligated into the opened blunt-ended plasmid containing DPB3 and DPB4. The resulting plasmid, prs426GAL with DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4, was called pJL6. For Pol ε overexpression the YEJ1 strain was grown as previously described in (21Burgers P.M. Methods. 1999; 18: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, the YEJ1 strain was grown in 100 ml of glycerol-lactate media overnight. After 24 h, the culture was aliquoted into six 6-liter flasks, each containing 1.2 liters of glycerol-lactate media, and left vigorously shaking at 30 °C. After another 24 h 1.2 liters of YPGL media was added to every flask. YPGL media consists of 1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 3% glycerol, 2% lactic acid, and 0.1% glucose, pH 5.5–6. After 3–4 h the protein expression was induced by adding solid galactose to a final concentration of 2%. After another 6 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in H2O and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The following buffers were used. Buffer A: 150 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.8, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, 0.3 mmp-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine. Buffer B: 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm pepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, and 5 mm NaHSO3. The concentration of sodium acetate is indicated as suffix, for example, buffer B100 = buffer B with 100 mm sodium acetate. A beadbeater was used to open 60–70 g of cells in Buffer A. Beating continued for 5 min with intervals of 1 min of cooling every 30 s. The volume of the lysate from the beadbeater was measured, and saturated ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 175 mm, followed by the addition of 40 μl of 10% Polymin P per ml of extract. The lysate was incubated on ice with occasional stirring for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm in a Beckman JA25.5 rotor for 1 h. The volume of the cleared lysate was measured, and 0.28 g of solid ammonium sulfate was added per ml of extract. The ammonium sulfate was dissolved for 45 min on a magnetic stirrer, followed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm in a Beckman JA25.5 rotor for 1 h. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspended in buffer B50 and frozen. The next day, the frozen extract was thawed and dialyzed against 1000 ml of buffer B100 for 3 h, and thereafter centrifuged for 30 min. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a 20-ml phosphocellulose column equilibrated in B200. The column was washed with B200 and eluted with B750. Fractions with protein were loaded onto a MonoQ column eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from B800 to B1200. After dialysis against 500 ml of buffer B100, peak fractions from MonoQ were loaded onto a MonoS column equilibrated in B100and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from B100 to B500. Finally, the MonoS peak fraction was passed over a Superose 6 gel filtration column as described below. The protein concentration in various fractions throughout the purification was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A Superose 6 gel filtration column was equilibrated at 4 °C in Buffer C. Buffer C: 25 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm sodium acetate, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaHSO3, 2 μmleupeptin, and 2 μm pepstatin A. The column was calibrated by injection of proteins with a known Stokes radius. The Stokes radii of the standard proteins were plotted against their elution volumes. The standard proteins used were: carbonic anhydrase (Ve = 18.07 ml), bovine serum albumin (Ve = 16.68 ml), catalase (Ve = 15.92 ml), ferritin (Ve = 14.82 ml), E. coliβ-galactosidase (Ve = 14.45 ml), and thyroglobulin (Ve = 12.65 ml). 0.2–20 μg of Pol ε from the MonoS peak fraction was passed over the equilibrated Superose 6 column. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the polymerase activity was measured. The specific activity of purified Pol ε was determined to be 25–40,000 units/mg of protein, as defined by Hamatake and co-workers (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 0.2–20 μg of Pol ε from the MonoS peak fraction together with 0.5 μg of bovine liver catalase (Sigma) as an internal control, in a total volume of 100 μl, were layered on top of a 4-ml 15–30% linear gradient of glycerol in buffer C. The samples were spun for 16 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW60 rotor at 1 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, DNA polymerase assays, or Western blot analysis with Dpb4p antibodies. The rabbit Dpb4p polyclonal antibodies were raised against Dpb4p that was overexpressed and purified from E. coli. Aliquots of each fraction were also removed for spectrophotometric assay of catalase activity (23Chance B. Herbert D. Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 402-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from wild-type yeast were prepared as previously described, and cleared lysate was loaded onto the 15–30% glycerol gradient in buffer C400. The density of glycerol gradient fractions was measured refractometrically. Standard proteins with known sedimentation coefficients were used to calibrate the gradients: carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S), aldolase (8.9 S), catalase (11.3 S), and ferritin (17.6 S). For DNA polymerase assays an oligo(dT)16-primed (dA)300 template was used (24Burgers P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A typical reaction (50 μl) contained 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm MgAc2, 80 μm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 20 μm[3H]dTTP (400–600 cpm/pmol), 0.01 unit of poly(dA)·oligo(dT), and 1 mm spermidine and enzyme. Reactions were assembled on ice and incubated for 30 s to 5 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 150 μl of stop solution (50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The insoluble material was precipitated by adding 1.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. The insoluble material was filtered on GF/C filters, washed 4 × 2 ml with 1m HCl in 0.05 m sodium pyrophosphate, rinsed with ethanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. One unit of enzyme activity incorporates 1 nmol of total nucleotide/hour (10Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out at 10 °C in a Beckman XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, equipped with an An50Ti rotor using six sector centerpieces. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments on Pol ε were analyzed in Buffer D (as Buffer C but with 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol instead of dithiothreitol) at three different initial protein concentrations, 2.1, 0.28, and 0.14 μm. Absorbance at 280 nm was measured as a function of radial position for three rotor speeds, ranging from 4000 to 7500 rpm. Equilibrium at each rotor speed was reached after 20 h. At that time, five scans were averaged for each sample at each rotor speed. The sedimentation properties of Pol ε were analyzed by using the self-association model in the Beckman software package. We chose to overexpress Pol ε in S. cerevisiae for several reasons. Earlier attempts to overexpress Pol ε in a baculovirus system experienced several problems (19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Dua R. Levy D.L. Li C.M. Snow P.M. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7889-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Not only was the largest subunit of 256 kDa expressed at low levels, but in addition Pol2p was cleaved by a protease and the proteolytic fragment copurified with the holoenzyme. Finally the purified protein was tagged, and this could affect the properties of the enzyme. We chose to overexpress Pol ε in S. cerevisiae without any tags added, similar to earlier overexpression studies of Pol δ from S. cerevisiae(18Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The POL2 gene was subcloned into one plasmid andDPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 were subcloned into the second plasmid. All genes were cloned under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1–10 promoter (21Burgers P.M. Methods. 1999; 18: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This protocol proved successful and allowed us to purify 400 μg of Pol ε from as little as 70 g of cells. The complex was purified by successive phosphocellulose, MonoQ, and MonoS chromatography, and the enzyme was finally purified to homogeneity by gel filtration column (Fig.1) or by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Our overexpressed Pol ε was purified as a four-subunit complex with all subunits co-migrating through a glycerol gradient and co-eluting from a Superose 6 column (Figs. 2B and3B). The peak fractions from the gel filtration column and the glycerol gradient were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, the stained gels were scanned, and the intensity of the protein bands was quantified. The molar ratio of the four subunits was estimated to be 1.00:1.12:1.07:1.06 (Pol2p:Dpb2p:Dpb3p:Dpb4p) (Fig.4). In contrast, we found that the apparent molar ratio of the four subunits was ∼1:1:3:4 when the SDS-PAGE was silver-stained (data not shown). Earlier estimates of the subunit stoichiometry have been based solely on silver staining, and it appears that the amounts of Dpb3p and Dbp4p may have been overestimated due to the silver staining (10Hamatake R.K.

A, the calibration of the Superose 6 column was carried out with thyroglobulin (data point 1, 85 Å), β-galactosidase (data point 2, 69 Å), ferritin (data point 3, 61 Å), catalase (data point 4, 52.2 Å) bovine serum albumin (data point 4, 35.5 Å), and carbonic anhydrase (data point 5, 23.9 Å). The elution volumes of the complexes are as indicated. Pol ε eluted at 13.8 ml, and the Stokes radius was estimated to be 74.5 ± 2.4 Å.

Using an antibody to Dpb4p we measured the sedimentation coefficient of Pol ε when a crude extract from a wild-type strain was separated over the same glycerol gradient. The sedimentation of Pol ε in a crude extract was similar to that of the purified Pol ε (data not shown). Pol ε was analyzed on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Fig. 3). The enzyme was injected over the column in the concentration range between 5 nm and 0.5 μm (as monomer), and the elution volume was 13.8 ml over the entire concentration range. The Stokes radius was determined to be 74.5 Å from the standard curve. The measured Stokes radius and the sedimentation coefficient allowed us to estimate the molecular mass, according to Siegel and Monty (26Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Our calculated molecular mass of 371 kDa suggests that Pol ε is purified as a monomer of a Pol2:Dpb2:Dpb3:Dpb4 complex with the molar ratio of 1:1:1:1 in the concentration range studied (Table I). The frictional coefficientf/f0 of Pol ε is 1.56, suggesting a moderately elongated shape of the enzyme.Table IMolecular Mass of DNA polymerase ɛTheoretical masss valueStokes radiusMass from s and Åf/f0Mass from equilibrium sedimentationMonomerDimerPol ɛ37975811.88 ± 0.8474.5 ± 2.4371 ± 381.56366 ± 7 Open table in a new tab To obtain a more precise molecular mass independent of the shape of the enzyme, we carried out sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Three different starting concentrations of Pol ε ranging from 0.14 to 2.1 μm were analyzed at four different speeds until equilibrium was reached. The molecular mass of Pol ε was determined to be 366 kDa under these conditions. A comparison with the predicted distribution of a monomeric versus a dimeric assembly clearly showed that Pol ε was present as a monomer in the solution under all conditions investigated (Fig.5). We have presented a method to overexpress and purify Pol ε to homogeneity from S. cerevisiae. The yield and purity of the enzyme will allow us to perform a careful characterization of the enzyme. We have initiated this study by determining the molecular mass and subunit stoichiometry of the enzyme. These are essential parameters for further studies of the enzyme. From these studies and recent studies of Pol δ we can conclude that, at least under the conditions studied, both enzymes are monomeric multisubunit assemblies with each subunit occurring once. An attractive model of the replication fork describes how there should be coupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis. This is a model that has emerged from studies in E. coli (15Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 925-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is very likely that a similar mechanism is present at the eukaryotic replication fork. Initial experiments with Pol δ suggested that Pol δ was a dimeric enzyme (17Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 27Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A model was proposed in which Pol δ formed a dimeric unit with two catalytic domains. In this model Pol δ would replicate both leading and lagging strand in a coordinated manner (13Burgers P.M. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This model has recently been questioned, and it has been shown that Pol δ is a monomer with one catalytic site (18Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Bermudez V.P. MacNeill S.A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36853-36862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, Pol ε was also suggested to be dimeric (19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The evidence for a dimeric enzyme originated from yeast two-hybrid assays and gel filtration experiments (9Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid assays, particularly with yeast genes, can be misleading because false positives can result from a bridging interaction through a third yeast protein, as for instance was observed with the third subunit of Pol δ. Pol32 appeared to interact with itself in a two-hybrid analysis, but this interaction was actually mediated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (18Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A second line of evidence for a dimeric Pol ε was based upon gel filtration experiments (19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of the protein was based upon the assumption that Pol ε was globular. We have measured both the sedimentation coefficient and the Stokes radius of Pol ε, and from those data calculated the frictional coefficient to be 1.56 (Table I), indicating that the complex is slightly elongated. As a consequence, the molecular mass will be overestimated when determined by gel filtration only (19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of 371 kDa from both gel filtration and density centrifugation measurements agrees well with the theoretical molecular mass of a four-subunit complex with the subunit stoichiometry of 1:1:1:1 (TableI). Finally, the sedimentation equilibrium experiments confirmed the results of our other studies where Pol ε was found to exist as a monomer in solution (Fig. 5 and Table I). Thus, our results clearly support a model of Pol ε as a monomer of a (Pol2:Dpb2:Dpb3:Dpb4) heterotetrameric complex. The role of Pol ε and Pol δ at the eukaryotic replication fork is still not known with certainty. Genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae have shown that there is an asymmetry present at the replication fork (30Pavlov Y.I. Newlon C.S. Kunkel T.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 207-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The current hypothesis that the coupled synthesis of the leading and lagging strand involves both Pol ε and Pol δ agrees with our observations that both Pol δ and Pol ε are monomeric assemblies. Pol δ has been suggested to replicate the lagging strand based on a genetic interaction with the flap endonuclease (RAD27) (31Jin Y.H. Obert R. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Pol ε has been suggested to replicate the leading strand, based on experiments in cell-free Xenopusextracts (6Waga S. Masuda T. Takisawa H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the fact that both Pol δ and Pol ε are purified as monomers in solution does not exclude the possibility that they dimerize in the presence of a template. The yeast two-hybrid result indicating that Dpb2p may interact with itself may suggest that Pol ε could be present as a dimer in vivo (19Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More experiments are required to determine which strands Pol ε and Pol δ do replicate. We are now in a position to study the various activities of Pol ε using a well defined source of the enzyme. These studies may help us understand the role of Pol ε during DNA replication and DNA repair. We thank P. Burgers for comments on the manuscript and for providing the prs421–424GAL plasmids and pY116 strain."

Mediated by its C-terminal high mobility group (HMG) box domain, SSRP1 binds DNA non-sequence specifically but recognizes certain DNA structures. Using acetic acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we have examined the phosphorylation of maize SSRP1 by protein kinase CK2α. The kinase phosphorylated several amino acid residues in the C-terminal part of the SSRP1 protein. Two phosphorylation sites were mapped in the very C-terminal region next to the HMG box domain, and about seven sites are localized within the acidic domain. Circular dichroism showed that the phosphorylation of the two C-terminal sites by CK2α resulted in a structural change in the region of HMG box domain, because the negative peak of the CD spectrum at 222 nm was decreased by ∼10%. In parallel, the phosphorylation induced the recognition of UV-damaged DNA, whereas the non-phosphorylated protein does not discriminate between UV-damaged DNA and control DNA. The affinity of CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1 for the DNA correlates with the degree of UV-induced DNA damage.

In many cases, chromatin represses these processes by restricting the access of DNA binding regulatory factors to their DNA target sites. Numerous nuclear activities have been identified that can overcome the repressive effects of chromatin. Post-translational modification of histones and ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling complexes are involved in altering the chromatin structure so that the DNA becomes more accessible to the DNA-binding proteins required for transcription initiation (1Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R185-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Narlikar G.J. Fan H.-Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). DNA repair and other DNA-dependent processes occurring in the chromatin context are also coupled to the structural properties of chromatin. DNA is frequently damaged by a variety of agents that are of endogenous or environmental origin. For many organisms, the most important environmental mutagen is the ultraviolet component of sunlight. The DNA lesions induced by UV light (mainly dipyrimidine photoproducts) are both mutagenic and cytotoxic. Therefore, constant removal and replacement of damaged nucleotide residues by DNA repair mechanisms is required to maintain the DNA as a carrier of stable genetic information (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 4Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). DNA damage and repair processes are influenced to a great extent by the packaging of the DNA into chromatin. The repair machinery is therefore dependent on the assistance of ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling complexes (5Green C.M. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

In human cells, a protein complex termed FACT (facilitateschromatin transcription) has been identified that is a chromatin-specific elongation factor required for transcription of chromatin templates in vitro (8Orphanides G. LeRoy G. Chang C.-H. Luse D.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 92: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The FACT complex interacts with the H2A/H2B dimers of the nucleosome, indicating that it may promote transcription by nucleosome remodeling. Biochemical analyses have revealed that the FACT of HeLa cells consists of the general transcriptional regulator CDC68/Spt16 and the SSRP11 protein containing an HMG box DNA-binding domain (9Orphanides G. Wu W.-H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, a homologous complex termed DUF (DNA unwindingfactor) has been identified that is involved in DNA replication in cell-free extracts (10Okuhara K. Ohta K. Seo H. Shioda M. Yamada T. Tanaka Y. Dohmae N. Seyama Y. Shibata T. Mirofushi H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 341-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Extensive genetic and biochemical work in yeast has demonstrated the existence of the CP complex consisting of CDC68 and Pob3 (which is homologous to SSRP1) and shown that both proteins are encoded by essential genes. The CP complex plays a role in transcription and replication (11Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21972-21979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Wittmeyer J. Joss L. Formosa T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8961-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Yeast Pob3 lacks the HMG box DNA binding domain of the homologous SSRP1 occurring in higher eukaryotes, and the small HMGB-type protein NHP6 appears to provide the HMG domain function, mediating the interaction with nucleosomes (13Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In plants, SSRP1 proteins (∼72 kDa) with similarity to the vertebrate counterparts have been identified from both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species (15Grasser K.D. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Physiol. Plant. 2000; 110: 427-435Crossref Google Scholar). Mediated by its HMG box domain, maize SSRP1 binds non-sequence specifically to linear DNA and recognizes nucleosomes and certain DNA structures such as DNA minicircles and supercoiled DNA. Moreover, maize SSRP1 can bend DNA and facilitate the formation of specific nucleoprotein structures (16Lichota J. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7860-7867Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Röttgers K. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Merkle T. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 2000; 23: 395-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that maize SSRP1 is a substrate for protein kinase CK2 and that the phosphorylated protein (but not the non-phosphorylated protein) recognizes UV-damaged DNA. Furthermore, we show that a yeastnhp6a/b double mutant is sensitive toward UV irradiation compared with the wild type strain and that the expression of maize SSRP1 can complement the increased UV sensitivity of the yeast Δnhp6a/b strain. The region encoding SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639) was amplified from the maize SSRP1 cDNA sequence using Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the primers 5′-AAGGATCCGATGTTCTACGAGACACTGAT-3′ and 5′-AATTAACTGCAGCTAGTCAGACTCGTTCCCAGA-3′, digested withBamHI and PstI, and cloned into pQE9cm (providing an N-terminal His6 tag) (18Grasser K.D.

The SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639) protein was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by three-step column chromatography (nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, S-Sepharose Fast Flow, Resource Q) as described previously (18Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Full-length SSRP1 and the other truncated SSRP1 derivatives were expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by three-step column chromatography as described previously (17Röttgers K. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Merkle T. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 2000; 23: 395-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant SSRP1 proteins were phosphorylated by purified recombinant maize protein kinase CK2α as described previously for HMGB proteins (19Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For the control experiments with non-phosphorylated proteins, the substrate proteins were incubated in mock phosphorylation reactions lacking either ATP or the protein kinase. The phosphorylation state of the SSRP1 proteins was examined by mass spectrometry and acetic acid urea (AU)-PAGE (20Lennox R.W. Cohen L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analyses of SSRP1 proteins and tryptic peptides were performed on a Voyager-DE PRO system equipped with a nitrogen laser (Applied Biosystems) using the linear and the reflector mode. The system was calibrated with standards provided by the supplier. As matrix sinapinic acid (20 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was used. Samples were mixed 1:1 with the matrix on the target plate and air-dried. CD spectra of non-phosphorylated and CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1(K532-D639) were recorded and analyzed as described previously (19Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The purified 78-bp XbaI/KpnI fragment of pBluescript (Stratagene) was UV irradiated with 5 or 10 J/m2 at 254 nm. The UV-induced DNA damage was analyzed by determining the cleavability of the DNA fragment with EcoRI, because the UV-induced dimerization of the thymine bases occurring within the GAATTC EcoRI recognition sequence abolished the endonuclease digestion of the fragment (21Whittaker P.A. Southern E.M. Gene. 1986; 41: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For instance, at an UV dose of 5 J/m2, ∼50% of the fragment was cleavable withEcoRI (data not shown). Binding reactions contained binding buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5%(w/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylenecyanol), various amounts of protein, and 15 ng of the 78-bp fragment. Binding reactions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature before loading of the samples onto 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The DNA was stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes) and detected with the Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the Image Quant software. The coding region for maize SSRP1 was obtained by digesting the plasmid pQE9cm-SSRP1 (17Röttgers K. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Merkle T. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 2000; 23: 395-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with PstI, creating blunt ends using the Klenow DNA polymerase and subsequent digestion with BamHI. The pMTL1 yeast expression vector (22Wittmeyer J. Formosa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4178-4190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared by digestion withHindIII, creating blunt ends using the Klenow DNA polymerase and subsequent digestion with BamHI. The SSRP1 coding region was ligated with pMTL1, resulting in the expression plasmid pMTL1-SSRP1, which was checked by DNA sequencing. The plasmids pMTL1 and pMTL1-SSRP1 were transformed into the yeast strains Y18 (MATα ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ1 leu2–3 112 gal2 gal10) and Y82 (MATα ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ1 leu2–3 112 gal2 gal10 nhp6A-Δ2::URA3 nhp6B-Δ1::HIS3) by the lithium acetate method. The increased generation time and the temperature sensitivity of the Δnhp6Aa/b strain (Y82) was examined and proved to match the results published previously (23Costigan C. Kolodrubetz D. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The UV-sensitivity of the different strains was determined by calculating the survival rate of the cells on solid YPD medium (24He Z. Wong J.M.S. Maniar H.S. Brill S.J. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28243-28249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Birrell G.W. Giaever G. Chu A.M. Davis R.W. Brown J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). After serial dilution in TE buffer, the cells were spread onto YPD plates (strains transformed with pMTL1 plasmids on galactose-containing plates), which were irradiated using a UV StratalinkerTM 2400 (Stratagene) with different UV doses of UV254 nm. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days before scoring of the surviving colonies. Human SSRP1 can occur in an UV-induced complex with Spt16, p53, and CK2, resulting in specific CK2-meditated Ser392phosphorylation of p53 (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H.

Blom N. Brunak S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) revealed that maize SSPR1 contains a number of potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase CK2. Therefore, we examined whether maize SSRP1 (schematically depicted in Fig. 1A) is also a substrate of CK2. In contrast to most other protein kinases, CK2 can utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphate donors (29Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of SSRP1 by recombinant maize CK2α was analyzed for different reaction times in the presence of [32P]GTP or [32P]ATP (Fig. 1B). Both phosphate donors were utilized by CK2α to phosphorylate SSRP1 with similar efficiency. To determine which domain(s) of SSRP1 are phosphorylated, full-length SSRP1 (residues Met1–Asp639) and the truncated proteins SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639), lacking the large N-terminal domain, and SSRP1(Lys532–Asp639), consisting essentially of the HMG box DNA-binding domain (Fig. 1A), were tested for phosphorylation by CK2α in the presence of [32P]ATP (Fig. 1C). Both full-length SSRP1 and SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639) were readily phosphorylated by CK2α to similar extents, suggesting that the C-terminal part of the protein is phosphorylated. The very C-terminal end of the protein, SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639), is phosphorylated by CK2α to a lesser extent (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that SSRP1 is mainly phosphorylated within the acidic domain (residues Asp455–Gln531). To estimate the number of amino acid residues phosphorylated in SSRP1, truncated versions of SSRP1 were phosphorylated for different times by CK2α in the presence of unlabeled ATP. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by AU-PAGE, which can resolve proteins depending on their phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal protein constructs SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639) and SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) resulted in the appearance of two protein bands with reduced electrophoretic mobility (relative to the non-phosphorylated protein) upon CK2α phosphorylation, indicating the presence of two phosphorylation sites in these proteins (Fig. 2). The same experiment was performed with the C-terminal portion of SSRP1 including the acidic domain SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639), resulting in the appearance of several phosphorylated protein bands, which could not be completely resolved. From the analysis of several gels, we estimated that up to approximately nine residues are phosphorylated by CK2α in this protein. The number of phosphorylation sites in SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) and SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639) was further examined using MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry. Comparison of the masses determined for non-phosphorylated and CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) and SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639) revealed mass differences of 161 and 729 Da, respectively (data not shown). This indicates the presence of two phosphorylated residues in SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) and (depending on the number of sodium adducts, Ref. 19Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) up to nine phosphorylated residues in SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639), which is in line with the analysis of the phosphorylated proteins by AU-PAGE. To determine more precisely which amino acid residues of the C-terminal part of SSRP1 are phosphorylated by CK2α, non-phosphorylated and CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were examined by MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry (Table I). This analysis revealed that the very C-terminal peptide Gly626–Asp639 (comprising the peptide C-terminal of the HMG box domain) occurs in the double-phosphorylated form. This peptide contains one threonine and two serine residues, which theoretically could be phosphorylated. However, the threonine Thr629 is unlikely to be phosphorylated, first because serine residues are by far preferred over threonine residues as phosphor acceptor sites of CK2 and, second, because the sequence context of the two serine residues more closely resembles typical CK2 phosphorylation sites (29Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol.

Moreover, the two serine residues are well conserved among SSRP1 proteins of different plant species, whereas the threonine residue Thr629 occurs exclusively in maize SSRP1 (17Röttgers K. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Merkle T. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 2000; 23: 395-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Ser634 and Ser638 are most likely phosphorylated by CK2α. Because of the unusual acidity of the involved peptides (which poses a problem for mass spectrometry), we were, to date, unable to determine precisely which of the 14 possible Ser/Thr residues (of which ∼8 are situated in a CK2 consensus sequence) in the acidic region (Asp455–Gln531) are actually phosphorylated by CK2α.Figure 2Several amino acid residues of SSRP1 are phosphorylated by CK2α. The C-terminal SSRP1 constructs, SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639), SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639), and SSRP1-(Asp455–Asp639) were phosphorylated for the indicated times by CK2α in the presence of unlabeled ATP, separated by AU-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. In the course of the phosphorylation reaction, the initially non-phosphorylated proteins are increasingly phosphorylated by CK2α and display, depending on the number of phosphorylations, a reduced electrophoretic mobility relative to the non-phosphorylated proteins. The number of protein phosphorylations corresponding to the differently migrating protein bands is indicated next to the bands in the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IMasses of tryptic peptides derived from non-phosphorylated and CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639)PeptideCalculated mass1-aThe mass values (in Da) were calculated based on the known protein sequence.Untreated1-bThe masses of the tryptic peptides (in Da) were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.CK2α1-bThe masses of the tryptic peptides (in Da) were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,1-cTryptic peptides of SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) phosphorylated by CK2αLys552–Lys5581-dThe N-terminal peptide includes also the 6xHis-tag.2167.02165.72165.0Ala560–Arg5721581.7ND1-eNot determined.1581.9Ser577–Lys5891372.71372.61373.0Lys590–Lys5971019.61019.51019.7Met598–Lys603680.3680.1ND1-eNot determined.Gln604–Lys6141317.71317.61317.8Lys615–Lys619723.4724.3724.5Glu621–Arg625724.4724.3724.5Gly626–Asp6391394.61394.61555.71-a The mass values (in Da) were calculated based on the known protein sequence.1-b The masses of the tryptic peptides (in Da) were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.1-c Tryptic peptides of SSRP1-(Lys552–Asp639) phosphorylated by CK2α1-d The N-terminal peptide includes also the 6xHis-tag.1-e Not determined. Open table in a new tab To examine whether the phosphorylation of the two C-terminal amino acid residues of SSRP1 results in structural changes of the protein, we recorded CD spectra in the range of 195–260 nm. In these wavelength scans, non-phosphorylated and CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639) were compared (Fig.3). The decrease (∼10%) of the negative peak at 222 nm in the CD spectrum of the phosphorylated protein (relative to the non-phosphorylated protein) indicates loss of α-helical structure. The structure of the HMG box domain is ∼75% α-helical, suggesting that there may be phosphorylation-induced structural changes in the DNA-binding domain. Because the C-terminal phosphorylation of maize chromosomal HMGB proteins by CK2 reduces the affinity of the HMGB1 and HMGB2 proteins for linear DNA (19Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we examined whether the phosphorylation of the two amino acid residues at the C-terminal end of SSRP1 influences the DNA binding of SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639). The interaction of non-phosphorylated and CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639) with a 78-bp DNA fragment was analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Various concentrations of the protein were incubated with the DNA fragment, and the formation of protein/DNA-complexes was examined using native PAGE (Fig. 4). The non-phosphorylated and the CK2α-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639) bound the DNA-fragment with similar affinity, as can be seen by the disappearance of the unbound fragment and the appearance of a rather diffuse complex of lower electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4, top panels; lanes 5 and 6). To examine whether UV-damaged DNA is a preferred target for SSRP1, the DNA fragment was treated with different doses of UV prior to the protein binding studies. The UV-damage of the DNA is evident from the more diffuse and slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility of the DNA fragment (32Lysetska M. Knoll A. Boehringer D. Hey T. Krauss G. Krausch G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2686-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) relative to the untreated DNA (compare Fig. 4, lanes 1) and from its reduced cleavability by EcoRI (data not shown). The phosphorylated protein bound the UV-treated DNA fragment at significantly lower protein concentrations when compared with the non-phosphorylated protein (Fig. 4), demonstrating that the phosphorylated protein displayed a higher affinity for the UV-damaged DNA. This effect was dependent on the UV dose used to irradiate the DNA. When the DNA was irradiated with 5 J/m2, the phosphorylated protein displayed a ∼5-fold higher affinity for the DNA than the non-phosphorylated protein, whereas with the DNA that was irradiated with 10 J/m2 there was a ∼10-fold difference in affinity. Unlike the CK2-phosphorylated protein that discriminated UV-damaged DNA and control DNA, non-phosphorylated SSRP1-(Lys532–Asp639) bound the UV-damaged DNA and the control DNA with the same affinity. The yeast homologue of animal and plant SSRP1, termed Pob3, lacks an HMG box DNA-binding domain. Recently, it was demonstrated that the HMGB-type protein NHP6A/B interacts with the CDC68/Pob3 complex (CP complex) to provide an HMG box domain so that Pob3 and NHP6A/B function as a bipartite analogue of SSRP1 (13Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). An artificial SSRP1-like protein, created by fusing Pob3 and NHP6A, is able to perform several in vivo functions (13Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Yeast mutant strains lacking either NHP6A or NHP6B (88% amino acid sequence identity) grow normally, whereas the strain lacking both proteins displays, among other defects, a temperature-sensitive growth (23Costigan C. Kolodrubetz D. Snyder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2391-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After confirming some of these published growth characteristics (data not shown), we have monitored the sensitivity of the double mutant strain Δnhp6a/b (Y82) toward UV irradiation in comparison to the control strain (Y18). The yeast strains were treated with different doses of UV light, and the colony formation of surviving cells was scored on YPD plates. The survival rate of the Δnhp6a/b strain was ∼2.5-fold lower than that of the control strain at an UV irradiation of 25 and 50 J/m2 (Fig. 5A). To examine whether maize SSRP1 had an effect on the increased UV sensitivity of the Δnhp6a/b (Y82) strain, the survival upon UV irradiation with 25 J/m2 of the non-transformed Y82 strain and Y82 bearing pMTL1-SSRP1 or pMTL1 was analyzed in comparison to the control strain Y18. Y82 bearing pMTL1-SSRP1 displayed UV sensitivity comparable with that of the Y18 control strain (Fig. 5B), indicating that the expression of SSRP1 could complement the lack of NHP6A/B with respect to UV sensitivity, whereas the presence of the insert-less plasmid pMTL1 in Y82 had no significant effect. Protein kinase CK2, typically found in a heterotetrameric (α2β2) complex, is a Ser/Thr kinase conserved in a wide variety of eukaryotes, including plants, mammals, and yeast (29Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol.

CK2 phosphorylates predominantly serine residues that occur in an acidic environment within the substrate proteins and is involved in cell growth and proliferation but also in stress response and cell survival (33Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 34Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Plant CK2 from various species occurs as heterotetrameric enzyme but also as catalytically active monomeric CK2α (35Dobrowolska G. Meggio F. Szczegielniak J. Muszynska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 36Espunya M.C. Martı́nez M.C.

Here we have shown that CK2α phosphorylates several residues of the maize SSPR1 protein. Two phosphorylation sites were mapped within the very C-terminal tryptic peptide of SSRP1, which are in agreement with typical CK2 phosphorylation sites (29Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 30Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The two serine residues are well conserved among different plant SSRP1 proteins but not in mammalian orDrosophila SSRP1 (17Röttgers K. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Merkle T. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 2000; 23: 395-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mammalian and Drosophila SSRP1 proteins contain (in comparison to the plant counterparts) a more extended domain C-terminal of the HMG box domain, which contains serine residues that perfectly match CK2 consensus recognition sites. Accordingly, CK2 can phosphorylate the C-terminal part of human SSRP1 (amino acid residues 471–709), but the exact phosphorylation site(s) have not yet been mapped (27Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of residues C-terminal of the HMG box DNA-binding domain could be a general mechanism of SSRP1 regulation. Like the non-sequence-specific HMG domain proteins of the HMGB family, SSRP1 appears to be involved in a variety of DNA-dependent processes such as replication and transcription (38Dyer M.A. Hayes P.J. Baron M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2617-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hertel L. De Andrea M. Bellomo G. Santoro P. Landolfo S. Gariglio M. Exp.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In complex with CDC68/Spt16, SSRP1 (Pob3 in yeast) can act as facilitator of transcription and recombination in the chromatin context (9Orphanides G. Wu W.-H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Nature. 1999; 400: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 11Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21972-21979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mediated by its HMG box domain, SSRP1 binds DNA non-sequence specifically but has the ability to recognize certain DNA structures (minicircles, cisplatin-modified DNA, four-way junctions, and supercoiled DNA) and to bend DNA (17Röttgers K. Krohn N.M. Lichota J. Stemmer C. Merkle T. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 2000; 23: 395-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Bruhn S.L. Pil P.M. Essigmann J.M. Housman D.E. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As shown here, the phosphorylation of two amino acid residues at the C-terminal end of maize SSRP1 resulted in an increased binding to UV-damaged DNA, whereas the interaction with untreated DNA was unchanged. SSRP1 may recognize the bend or kink introduced by the UV-induced DNA lesion. Depending on the type of lesion, a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer or a pyrimidine (4Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 5Green C.M. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog.

Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 7Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the situation with SSRP1, HMGB proteins that are phosphorylated by CK2 C-terminal of the HMG domain display (depending on the DNA substrate) a rather reduced affinity for DNA (19Stemmer C. Schwander A. Bauw G. Fojan P. Grasser K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1092-1098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 45Wisniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The yeast Pob3 protein can be considered an HMG domain-less SSRP1 protein. Pob3 interacts with the small HMGB-type protein NHP6A (containing an HMG domain) and may form a higher eukaryote type “bipartite SSRP1 protein” (13Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A yeast strain lacking both the NHP6A and NHP6B proteins (Δnhp6a/b strain, Y82) displays an increased UV-sensitivity, as evident from the reduced survival rates of the mutant cells upon UV irradiation, relative to control cells. Expression of maize SSRP1 in the Δnhp6a/b strain restored the UV sensitivity comparable with the levels of the control strain. An artificial Pob3-NHP6A fusion protein proved to be functional in yeast cells (13Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and such a fusion protein has, over the entire sequence, a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity to maize SSRP1. Moreover, the C-terminal region of the NHP6 proteins (46Kolodrubetz D. Burgum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3224-3239Google Scholar) contains (similar to maize SSRP1) a serine residue that is compatible with a CK2 phosphorylation site. CK2-mediated phosphorylation is correlated with a UV-response in two ways. CK2 activity can be induced by UV irradiation (47Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M. Schwamborn E. Schneider L.-A. Ma W. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and CK2 can associate in an UV-dependent way with SSRP1/Spt16/p53 (26Keller D.M. Zeng X. Wang Y. Zhang Q.H. Kapoor M. Shu H. Goodman R. Lozano G. Zhao Y. Lu H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 27Keller D.M. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50206-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The CK2-mediated phosphorylation of SSRP1 induces the recognition of UV-damaged DNA by SSRP1 and may link SSRP1 to an UV damage response. Therefore, in addition to its established functions in transcription and replication (9Orphanides G. Wu W.-H. Lane W.S. Hampsey M. Reinberg D.

However, the molecular mechanism of the activation of these signaling pathways by LTβR is not clear.

Since there is no enzymatic activity associated with TNF receptor family, the activation of downstream signals is mediated by the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to the intracellular portion of the receptors. To date, two families of proteins have emerged as candidates of these proteins, the death domain (DD)-containing proteins and the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs). Each of these families is defined by a characteristic sequence homology domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions. Death domain was also found in the intracellular domains of a subgroup of TNF family receptors such as TNFR1 and Fas (19Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). The DD-containing receptors initiate their signals by DD-mediated recruitment of DD-containing proteins such as TRADD, FADD, and receptor-interacting protein kinase to the receptors. TRAFs are a family of six RING finger (except TRAF1) containing proteins with a homologous TRAF domain at their C terminus. Different TRAFs are widely used by the TNF family receptors. They can directly interact with non-DD receptors; whereas their interaction with DD-containing receptors are mostly through other DD-containing proteins (20Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

However, only endogenous TRAF3 was shown to be recruited to the receptor in a ligand-dependent manner (24VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Given the distinct phenotype of LTβR knock-out mice and the diverse activity of LT cytokines, additional signaling proteins are yet to be identified. DD-containing receptors initiate their death signals by recruitment of FADD to oligomerized receptors, which in turn recruits and activates caspase 8 (21Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Activated caspase 8 then cleaves Bid, a BH3 domain containing pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family. The trans-location of cleaved Bid to mitochondria evokes cytochromec release, demonstrating the cross-talk of receptor-induced apoptosis with mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (29Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J.

TRAIL-induced apoptosis also induces and requires the mitochondrial release of Smac, a second mitochondrial protein that is released to cytosol concurrent with the release of cytochrome c (31Zhang X.D.

The function of Smac is to antagonize the inhibition of caspases by IAPs and thus promote apoptosis (34Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

In contrast to death domain receptors, LTβR does not contain a death domain nor can it recruit FADD (36Wajant H. Grell M. Scheurich P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, LTβR induces cell death in some carcinoma cell lines (17Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I.

VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of LTβR-mediated apoptosis remains to be elucidated. Since TNF family receptors are at a very low abundance in cells, most of our knowledge of receptor-signaling complexes is acquired by enhanced amplification of signals in overexpressed systems. Typically, little is known regarding the endogenous signaling complex. The recently developed proteomic approach provides us a powerful means to detect very low abundant proteins in an endogenous ligand-receptor complex. To better understand the molecular mechanism of LTβR signaling, we applied this approach to identify proteins associated with an affinity-purified endogenous LIGHT·LTβR complex from U937 cells. Here we report the identification of TRAF2, TRAF3, cIAP1, and Smac in this complex. Additional protein identified in this study is currently under investigation and will be reported elsewhere. Our work for the first time demonstrates the physiological association of TRAF2, cIAP1, and Smac in the LIGHT·LTβR complex and reveals a novel mechanism of apoptosis utilized by LIGHT·LTβR. U937, HEK293, and MCF7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), and Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC) with 0.01% insulin, respectively. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. TRAF2 and TRAF3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. cIAP1 antibody was obtained from R & D Systems. Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and affinity beads were obtained from Sigma. HA antibody (3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Smac antibodies were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals and Cell Signaling Technology. All chemical reagents otherwise specified were purchased from Sigma. N-terminal FLAG-tagged full-length LTβR in pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak, Co.) was a kind gift from Dr. Shie-Liang Hsieh (18Wu M.Y. Wang P.Y. Han S.H. Hsieh S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11868-11873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The full-length and Δ76 deletion mutant of Smac with a C-terminal HA tag were amplified by PCR reaction from a human ovary cDNA library. The PCR fragments were then cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) at NdeI and XhoI sites. 1 × 1010 U937 cells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C) and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 10 7 cells/ml. Cells were either treated or left untreated with 20 ng/ml of FLAG-LIGHT (Alexis) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 1 mmNaVO4, and protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and gently rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation twice at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Lysate was preclarified by incubation with Gamma binding beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The resulting lysate was applied twice to a mini-column (Bio-Rad) of 0.2 ml of M2-affinity beads (Sigma). The beads were washed twice with high salt (1 mNaCl) lysis buffer, three times more with lysis buffer, and then transferred into an Eppendorf tube. The immunocomplex was first eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The residual binding proteins were then further eluted with 8 m urea. 50% of the peptide-eluted proteins or one-tenth of the 8 murea-eluted proteins were separated on the 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting using TRAF3 antibody. These samples were also separated on the 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by silver staining. Protein bands of interest were manually excised from the gel, reduced, and alkylated with iodoacetamide and then digested in situ with trypsin using an automated digestion robot (ABIMED, Langenfeld, Germany) as described previously (38Houthaeve T. Gausepohl H. Ashman K. Nillson T. Mann M. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The peptide digests were then sequenced using a high throughput tandem mass spectrometer (LCQ-DECA ion trap, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a microelectrospray reversed phase liquid chromatography interface. Data were acquired in automated MS/MS mode using the data acquisition software provided with the mass spectrometer to detect and sequence each peptide as it eluted from the column. The dynamic exclusion and isotope exclusion functions were employed to increase the number of peptide ions that were analyzed. During the LS-MS/MS run, typically >1000 fragmentation spectra are collected from each sample and matched against the nonredundant databases (NCBI) using the Sequest software package (ThermoQuest). For immunoprecipitation, 1 × 10 8 U937 cells were treated with FLAG-LIGHT at 20 ng/ml for different times or left untreated. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 4 ml of lysis buffer (see above). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting lysate was precleared with Gamma binding beads for 1 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of M2 beads then were added to cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. After binding, beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. Immune complexes bound to the beads were eluted with sample buffer, resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with TRAF2, TRAF3, or cIAP1 antibody. Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection kits (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells, 4 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-LTβR, pcDNA3-Smac-HA or pcDNA3-Δ76Smac-HA were transfected into cells on a 100-mm dish using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were collected with cell lifters and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed in the same fashion as in U937 cells with either M2 beads for LTβR or with HA monoclonal antibody for Smac or Δ76Smac. The presence of Smac, LTβR, TRAF2, and cIAP1 in the immune complex were then analyzed by Western blots. MCF7 cells (5 × 105cells/well) were seeded on cover slides in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. Cells in each well were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3 vector, pcDNA3-Smac-HA, or pcDNA3-Δ76Smac-HA expression constructs together with pEMC-β-galactosidase using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Chemicals). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (control), LIGHT (20 ng/ml), or LTα1β2 (20 ng/ml) for 6 h and then fixed and stained with X-gal (Sigma). Apoptosis was assessed by morphological analysis and expressed as a percentage of apoptotic (round and detached) cells in the total of transfected blue cells. The binding of either homotrimer LIGHT or heterotrimer LTα1β2 to LTβR induces aggregation of the receptors and subsequent recruitment of cytosolic signaling proteins, resulting in the formation of ligand-LTβR complex that initiates the downstream signal transduction. Similar to other members of the TNFR family, LTβR activates multiple signaling pathways but so far only endogenous TRAF3 was shown to be recruited to LTβR in a ligand-dependent manner (16Mackay F.

To identify these signaling proteins, we have applied a proteomic approach. LIGHT binds to both LTβR and TR2/HVEM. In U937 cells, LTβR is constitutively expressed while the expression of TR2/HVEM is induced by differentiating agents (5Zhai Y. Guo R. Hsu T.L. Yu G.L. Ni J. Kwon B.S. Jiang G.W. Lu J. Tan J.

To form a specific ligand-LTβR complex, we took the advantage of this phenomenon. Undifferentiated U937 cells were treated with FLAG-tagged LIGHT for 10 min to form the LIGHT·LTβR complex. Endogenous receptor complex was affinity-purified with anti-FLAG antibody (M2)-conjugated beads and then eluted with FLAG peptide. The eluted proteins were resolved on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by silver staining. Approximately, eight protein bands were found to be present only in the LIGHT-treated sample but not in the control (Fig.1A). Consistent with a previous report (24VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we detected TRAF3 in the LIGHT-treated sample by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against TRAF3 (24VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and demonstrated the formation of the physiological LIGHT·LTβR complex (Fig. 1B). To identify proteins in this complex, these eight bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. As expected, LIGHT was detected in band 6 (Fig. 1) (TableI). Several peptides of TRAF2 were detected in band 3. The association of TRAF2 with LTβR has been reported previously in the overexpression system (23Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C.F. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Marsters S.A. Ayres T.M. Skubatch M. Gray C.L. Rothe M. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

Our detection of TRAF2 in the endogenous LIGHT·LTβR complex confirmed the previous observation and further demonstrated that the endogenous TRAF2 is a signal transducer of LTβR. Proteins in other bands either could not be determined due to the poor quality of the spectrum or later turned out to be nonspecific binding proteins such as Hsp90 at band 1 and actin at band 4. Surprisingly, we were unable to detect peptides corresponding to TRAF3 at the expected position of band 3. Neither could we detect peptides corresponding to receptors. One possibility was that the amount of TRAF3 and receptors, if any, was below the detection limit of mass spectrometry. As indicated by the Western blot of TRAF3, FLAG peptides only eluted one-tenth of the total TRAF3 protein on the beads (data not shown). This low efficiency was probably the result of the multimeric and high affinity interactions between antibody and ligand-receptor complex. To increase the recovery of proteins from the beads, we further eluted the beads with 8m urea. Samples were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and bands at the expected position of TRAF3 were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Three peptides of TRAF3 (Table I) were detected in the LIGHT-treated sample, and these peptides were totally absent in the sample without LIGHT treatment. Given the success with the identification of TRAF3 in the urea-eluted sample, we decided to process all of the bands in both LIGHT-treated and control samples even though 8 m urea also eluted proteins nonspecifically bound to the beads, resulting in an indistinguishable pattern between LIGHT-treated and control samples on SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). After protein identification, nonspecific binding proteins in the control sample were subtracted from those in the LIGHT-treated sample, resulting in proteins that specifically bind to the LIGHT-receptor complex. A total of five signaling proteins were identified. Among them four, are reported here. Table I summarizes the peptides detected and their assigned proteins.Table IList of proteins identified in LIGHT · LTβR complexProteinsBands1-aF stands for bands in FLAG-eluted sample, and U stands for bands in 8 m urea-eluted sample.

The detection of LIGHT and LTβR in the complex further confirmed our success in the isolation of LIGHT·LTβR complex. TRAF2 and TRAF3 were detected (Table I). In addition, four peptides of cIAP1 at the position of band 2 and two peptides of Smac at the position of band 6 were detected (Table I). Fig.2 shows two representative mass spectra of these peptides. cIAP1 is a member of IAP family that inhibits apoptosis by direct interaction with caspases to block their activity (40Rothe M. Pan M.G.

We examined the role of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) in gonococcal invasion of epithelial cell lines expressing either CEACAM1 or CEACAM3. CEACAM3-mediated internalization, but not that mediated by CEACAM1, was accompanied by localized and transient accumulation of the class I PI3K product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate at sites of bacterial engulfment. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases reduced CEACAM3-mediated uptake but, paradoxically, led to an increase in intracellular survival of bacteria internalized via either CEACAM1 or CEACAM3, suggesting additional roles for PI3K products. Consistent with this finding, the class III PI3K product phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate accumulated and persisted in the membrane of gonococcal phagosomes after internalization. Inhibition of PI3K blocked phagosomal acquisition of the late endosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 and reduced phagosomal acidification. Inhibiting phagosomal acidification with concanamycin A also increased survival of intracellular gonococci. These results suggest two modes of action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases during internalization of gonococci: synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is important for CEACAM3-mediated uptake, while phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is needed for phagosomal maturation and acidification, which are required for optimal bacterial killing.

Inhibiting phagosomal acidification with concanamycin A also increased survival of intracellular gonococci. These results suggest two modes of action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases during internalization of gonococci: synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate is important for CEACAM3-mediated uptake, while phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate is needed for phagosomal maturation and acidification, which are required for optimal bacterial killing. Gonorrhea is typified by a urethral or cervical exudate that predominantly consists of polymorphonuclear neutrophils with intracellular and extracellular associated Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Gonococci interact with various human cell types, including mucosal epithelia, endothelia, and immune cells, through a number of adhesins.

Four of these, CEACAMs 1, 3, 5, and 6, can act as receptors for bacteria expressing these adhesins. CEACAM1 is the most broadly distributed, being expressed in a variety of tissues and cell types where it can support bacterial invasion into and trafficking across epithelial layers (1Dehio C.

In contrast, CEACAM3 is expressed exclusively by neutrophils and supports the efficient non-opsonic uptake of Opa-expressing bacteria by a process reminiscent of that mediated by phagocytic Fc receptors (4Billker O.

The fate of gonococci after internalization and host cell factors that influence that fate are also unclear. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play a key role in signaling downstream of numerous receptors and in orchestrating a range of membrane traffic events (5Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4679) Google Scholar, 6Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin.

These kinases generate phosphoinositides bearing phosphate on the 3-position of the inositol ring. The resulting lipid second messengers can be recognized by a variety of effector proteins, leading to changes in membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics (8Cullen P.J. Cozier G.E. Banting G. Mellor H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R882-R893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Of note, PI 3-kinases have been implicated in bacterial invasion of epithelial cells by Listeria monocytogenes (9Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and Helicobacter pylori (10Kwok T. Backert S. Schwarz H. Berger J. Meyer T.F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2108-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, invasion of epithelial cells by Salmonella typhimurium is PI3K-independent (11Mecsas J. Raupach B. Falkow S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PI3K activity is also required for efficient phagocytosis of antibody-coated particles by macrophages, a process of engulfment that is similar in several respects to some forms of bacterial invasion (12Cox D. Tseng C.C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1240-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 13Araki N. Johnson M.T. Swanson J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1249-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Given the importance of PI 3-kinases in numerous instances of membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling and our limited understanding of the mechanisms of Opa-dependent gonococcal uptake into human cells, we investigated whether PI 3-kinases are involved in uptake of gonococci via CEACAM receptors. To this end, we used human epithelial cells stably transfected with individual CEACAM receptors, a model system that has been used successfully before (3Gray-Owen S.D. Lorenzen D.R. Haude A. Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4Billker O. Popp A. Brinkmann V. Wenig G. Schneider J. Caron E. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 560-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By expressing single CEACAM receptors in isolation, the reconstituted system circumvents complications arising from the co-expression of multiple CEACAM receptors in native cells. It also has the advantage that the cells are amenable to transfection, whereas primary human cells such as neutrophils are refractory to such manipulations. Our results reveal major differences in phosphoinositide dynamics during gonococcal internalization depending on the CEACAM receptor used. In addition, distinct 3-phosphoinositides are involved at different stages during gonococcal internalization and the subsequent maturation of the gonococcal phagosome.

Plasmids encoding chimeras of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the PH domain of Akt, with two tandem FYVE domains, and with the PX domain of p40phox have been described previously (14Haugh J.M.

Meyer T.F. Dehio C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HeLa-CEACAM1 and HeLa-CEACAM3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections of these cells were performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions with overnight incubations for plasmid expression. N. gonorrhoeae N313, a non-piliated strain expressing the CEACAM-binding Opa57 (17Kupsch E.M. Knepper B. Kuroki T. Heuer I. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), was used for all experiments except for some experiments visualizing Akt-PH recruitment in which strain N309 expressing the CEACAM-binding Opa52was used instead. These gonococcal strains were generously provided by Dr. T. F. Meyer (Max-Planck-Institut fur Infektionsbiologie, Berlin, Germany). Bacteria were grown on GC agar plates supplemented with 1% Isovitalex at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa-CEACAM cells were grown to 50–80% confluency in 24-well plates. Cells were washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium prior to infection and incubated in serum-free medium (with inhibitors as indicated) for ≥30 min. Gonococci were scraped from a plate after overnight growth, resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium, washed once, and resuspended to a concentration of 2 × 107/ml. Gonococci were added to the cells at a multiplicity of infection of ∼50:1 (0.5 ml/well in 24-well plates). Samples were subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 67 ×g to bring the bacteria into association with the HeLa cells. Cells were then incubated in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h, and then gentamicin (100 μg/ml) was added for 2 h at 37 °C to kill extracellular bacteria. Wells were washed, and saponin was added to permeabilize cells followed by plating of appropriate dilutions of the lysate on GC agar (18Gray-Owen S.D. Dehio C. Haude A. Grunert F. Meyer T.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3435-3445Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For measuring total bacterial association, lysis with saponin was done without prior gentamicin treatment. For microscopy assays, infections were performed as for the gentamicin assays with the following exceptions. HeLa-CEACAM cells were grown on glass coverslips. In experiments for scoring efficiency of uptake, as well as in some of the experiments visualizing GFP probes, the cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium after centrifugation of bacteria to remove loosely adherent bacteria. After centrifugation (and washing when it was performed), cells were incubated with bacteria at 37 °C for various times from 20 min to 3 h. Also a 10-fold lower number of bacteria were added to HeLa-CEACAM1 cells in order to obtain levels of bacterial binding to the cells comparable to that seen with the HeLa-CEACAM3 cells. After infection the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+ and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed coverslips were processed for microscopy as follows. Extracellular bacteria were labeled by incubating with polyclonal rabbit anti-gonococcal antibody UTR01 and then Alexa488-anti-rabbit antibody (or, in experiments where GFP constructs were expressed, Cy5-anti-rabbit). Cells were then permeabilized in 0.4% Triton X-100 for 15 min after which they were incubated with UTR01 as before and then with Cy3-goat anti-rabbit; in experiments where scoring of uptake was performed, Alexa633-phalloidin was also included at this step to label actin to facilitate localization of the HeLa cells. Cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted using Dako fluorescence mounting medium. All incubations with antibodies were preceded by three washes in phosphate-buffered saline and a 10-min incubation in 0.2% bovine serum albumin to block, and all antibody labeling steps were performed for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 0.2% bovine serum albumin. For experiments with LAMP-2 labeling, bacteria were detected either by prelabeling with FITC or with UTR01 and Cy3-anti-rabbit, and LAMP-2 was detected with antibody H4B4 and either Texas Red- or Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies. Slides were analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) with a 100× oil immersion objective and the conventional laser excitation and filter sets or by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DMIRB/E microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca ER camera controlled by OpenLab v.2.2.5 digital imaging software (Improvision). For experiments with live cells, bacteria were labeled with TRITC before infection. Confocal stacks of z-slices were acquired at successive time points during infection. Fluorescence intensity was quantified by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity of the 50 brightest pixels in a region of interest containing the phagosome; this was then divided by the average of the mean fluorescence intensities of two separate reference regions of cytoplasm to correct for effects of photobleaching. Gonococci were prelabeled by incubating in 12 μg/ml FITC in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.5, with gentle shaking in the dark for 30 min. Bacteria were then washed in 1% bovine serum albumin to quench residual FITC, and the bacteria were used to infect HeLa-CEACAM3 cells. After 30 min of infection, coverslips were moved into a Leiden chamber and placed on a 37 °C heated stage of a Leica DMIRB/E inverted fluorescence microscope. pH measurements were performed as described previously (19Demaurex N. Romanek R. Rotstein O. Grinstein S. Celis J. 2nd Ed. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 380-386Google Scholar). Briefly, images were acquired using Metafluor software (Universal Imaging) with excitation at either 440 or 490 nm. pH was estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 440 and 490 nm. For each field acquired, the pH of the extracellular buffer was rapidly changed between 6.15 and 7.35; internal bacteria could be identified retrospectively as those for which the fluorescence intensities did not change significantly upon change of the buffer. pH measurements were performed over a period of 20 min. Calibration was then performed in situ with nigericin and buffers of defined pH values from 5.75 to 7.35. A minimum of 50 bacteria was analyzed at each pH to construct the calibration curves. For determining significance of differences of means, two-tailed Student's t tests were used. We first assessed bacterial invasion of transfected epithelial cells by means of standard gentamicin resistance assays. Transfected HeLa cells stably expressing either CEACAM1 or CEACAM3 were infected with the gonococcal strain N313 expressing the CEACAM-specific Opa57. After allowing for internalization, adherent extracellular bacteria were killed by treatment with the cell-impermeant antibiotic gentamicin. Host cellular membranes were then solubilized to release internal bacteria that were plated on GC agar, and the resulting colonies were counted. To obtain an indication of whether PI 3-kinases are required for bacterial internalization, uptake assays were also performed after pretreatment of the HeLa cells with PI3K inhibitors. Surprisingly we observed a substantial increase in the number of N. gonorrhoeae colonies recovered after gentamicin treatment when the HeLa-CEACAM3 cells were treated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig.1A). Similar results were obtained with LY294002, a drug that inhibits PI3Ks by a distinct mechanism (Fig. 1C). Wortmannin and LY294002 also typically increased the recovery of gonococci following their infection of HeLa-CEACAM1 cells, although the amplitude of the effects was somewhat more variable (ranging from an insignificant to a 5-fold increase observed in independent experiments). No difference in the number of total (intracellular plus extracellular) bacteria associated with either of the HeLa cell lines was observed between cells that were untreated or treated with either inhibitor (Fig. 1, B andD). The unexpected finding that bacterial recovery was increased after treatment with the inhibitors could be interpreted to indicate that impairment of PI3K stimulates bacterial uptake. To test this notion and to obtain an independent measure of bacterial internalization, we directly observed bacterial invasion by fluorescence microscopy. CEACAM-transfected HeLa cells were infected and then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Extracellular and internal bacteria were distinguished by immunostaining with an anti-gonococcal antibody before and after permeabilization of the host cells, respectively. Notably, as illustrated in Fig. 2, inhibition of PI 3-kinases did not increase the efficiency of uptake mediated by either CEACAM1 or CEACAM3. In fact, for HeLa-CEACAM3 cells, PI3K inhibition significantly lowered the proportion of associated bacteria that became internalized (Fig. 2, p < 0.014). The results in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that PI3K inhibition leads to no change or a decrease in bacterial uptake as judged by direct visualization yet results in an increase in bacterial recovery in gentamicin assays. While these results appear at first sight contradictory, it should be noted that gentamicin resistance assays reflect a combination of two factors. For bacteria to be recovered as colony-forming units, they must not only be internalized by the eukaryotic cell to avoid contact with gentamicin, but they must also survive in the intracellular milieu until the time of host cell lysis. In this regard, it is noteworthy that a sizable fraction of the bacteria associated with the HeLa cells is seen to be internalized by microscopy (Fig. 2), but only a small fraction of the total cell-associated bacteria is recoverable as gentamicin-resistant colony-forming units at longer times (compare scales ofaxes in Fig. 1, A and C versus B and D). This implies that extensive death of intracellular gonococci is occurring over time. We hypothesized that the divergent observations made using the two assay systems result from PI 3-kinases being involved in multiple steps during bacterial internalization and killing. PI3K activity appears to be required for optimal initial uptake of bacteria via CEACAM3. However, in the absence of PI3K activity, survival of those bacteria that do become internalized via either CEACAM receptor must be enhanced, leading to a greater recovery of gentamicin-resistant bacteria. In further considering possible roles for PI 3-kinases during bacterial invasion, it is important to note that several classes of PI3Ks are inhibited by LY294002 and wortmannin, and the activity of these different enzymes can result in synthesis of distinct 3-phosphoinositides. Class I PI3Ksin vivo use mainly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as a substrate to generate PIP3, whereas class III PI3Ks generate predominantly phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate (20Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). These phosphoinositide species perform distinct functions in cell signaling and may be differentially involved in bacterial invasion and phagosome maturation. A major advance in studies of phosphoinositide metabolism has been the recent development of probes consisting of GFP fused to protein domains that bind with high affinity to specific phosphoinositides (21Balla T. Varnai P. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2002/125/pl3)PubMed Google Scholar). Using such probes, localized accumulation of specific phosphoinositide second messengers can be evaluated with high spatial and temporal resolution. It was thus demonstrated that engagement of Fcγ receptors can lead to highly localized accumulation of PIP3, presumably via activation of a class I PI3K (22Marshall J.G. Booth J.W. Stambolic V. Mak T. Balla T. Schreiber A.D. Meyer T. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1369-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). CEACAM3, but not CEACAM1, contains an ITAM similar to those found in immune receptors like the Fcγ receptor. It was therefore conceivable that a class I PI3K might be differentially involved in uptake mediated by these two distinct CEACAM receptors. To analyze this possibility, HeLa cells expressing CEACAM1 or CEACAM3 were transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the PH domain of Akt, which binds with high affinity to PIP3, fused to GFP (Akt-PH-GFP). The Akt-PH-GFP probe localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus in uninfected cells (data not shown). However, upon infection of HeLa-CEACAM3 cells with gonococci, we observed a striking accumulation of the probe at sites where bacteria bound to the cell surface (Fig.3, A and B). Akt-PH-GFP was particularly concentrated in pseudopod-like extensions of the plasma membrane extending around the bacteria (Fig.3A, inset). The accumulation of Akt-PH-GFP was abolished upon inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin (Fig. 3, Cand D), confirming that the probe reports the distribution of 3-polyphosphoinositides. The main product of PI3K sensed by the probe is likely PIP3, although phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which binds to the probe in vitro, may contribute to the signal. Notably, in contrast to the observations in HeLa-CEACAM3 cells, no noticeable accumulation of Akt-PH-GFP at sites of bacterial entry was observed during invasion of HeLa-CEACAM1 cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, activation of localized synthesis of PIP3 is specific to the ITAM-containing CEACAM3 receptor. Accumulation of Akt-PH-GFP in HeLa-CEACAM3 cells was rarely seen on the membrane of phagosomes containing fully internalized bacteria. The paucity of Akt-PH-GFP in sealed phagosomes suggests that PIP3 accumulation is a transient phenomenon during bacterial uptake. To better appreciate the kinetics of PIP3accumulation, the dynamics of Akt-PH-GFP localization were followed in living HeLa-CEACAM3 cells during bacterial infection (Fig.4). Accumulation of the probe occurred while bacteria were bound to the cell surface. The intensity peaked at roughly the time of phagosomal closure as estimated from reconstructions in the xz and yz planes of stacks of confocal images (data not shown). Following internalization of the bacteria, the fluorescence intensity on the formed phagosome rapidly declined until no enhancement over the cytoplasmic intensity could be observed. Quantitation of a representative experiment is shown in Fig.4G. Thus, localized PIP3 accumulation is an early and transient event during CEACAM3-mediated uptake. This observation, along with the inhibitory effects of wortmannin on bacterial uptake via CEACAM3, suggests a functional role for this PIP3 formation in CEACAM3-mediated internalization of bacteria. As discussed above, the enhanced recovery of gentamicin-resistant bacteria after inhibition of PI3K is not due to an increase in internalization, implying an increase in bacterial survival inside the cells. The early and transient appearance of PIP3 during uptake mediated by CEACAM3, but not CEACAM1, makes it unlikely that this 3-phosphoinositide is regulating bacterial survival within the cell, which was enhanced by PI3K inhibitors in both CEACAM1- and CEACAM3-expressing cells. An alternate PI3K product that may be involved in regulating bacterial survival after internalization is the singly phosphorylated PI3P. This lipid is produced in vivoprimarily through action of class III PI 3-kinases and is localized predominantly in endosomal compartments (6Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To test the possible involvement of PI3P in bacterial invasion and intracellular traffic, two probes that specifically bind to this phospholipid were used. These probes consist of GFP fused to either the PX domain of the p40phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase (phox-GFP) or to two tandem repeats of the FYVE domain from EEA1 (early endosome autoantigen 1; 2-FYVE-GFP). Both have been used previously as probes of PI3P localization (15Kanai F. Liu H. Field S.J. Akbary H. Matsuo T. Brown G.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 16Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). First HeLa-CEACAM3 cells were transiently transfected with phox-GFP. In uninfected cells, the probe localizes to the cytoplasm as well as to small vesicular structures, reflecting the existence of PI3P in endosomal compartments. These cells were then infected with gonococci. In contrast to the early, transient accumulation of Akt-PH-GFP, phox-GFP was primarily seen on formed phagosomes (Fig. 5,A–C). On occasion, it did appear to localize also to phagosomes that had not yet closed in which bacteria were still accessible to labeling with external antibodies; however, such recruitment occurred only occasionally and was less intense (data not shown). In contrast, virtually all intracellular bacteria were found to be in phagosomes that accumulated phox-GFP (Fig. 5,A–C). The acquisition of phox-GFP appeared to be long-lived as phagosomes were still labeled with the probe several hours after infection (data not shown). As expected, phox-GFP localization to phagosomes was abolished by wortmannin treatment (Fig.5, D–F). Similar persistent accumulation on gonococcal phagosomes was seen for the 2-FYVE-GFP probe, verifying the presence of PI3P (Fig. 5, G–I). We further examined the kinetics of PI3P accumulation by following the phox-GFP probe during infection in living HeLa-CEACAM3 cells (Fig.6). These experiments indicated that phox-GFP probe was rapidly acquired shortly after the apparent closure of the phagosome and persisted for long periods of time (>1 h).Figure 6Time course of phox-GFP accumulation during CEACAM3-mediated uptake.

For identifying the full repertoire of bikunin-regulated genes, a cDNA microarray hybridization screening was conducted using mRNA from bikunin-treated or bikunin-transfected HRA cells. A number of bikunin-regulated genes were identified, and their regulation was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Our screen identified 11 bikunin-stimulated genes and 29 bikunin-repressed genes.

These include transcriptional regulators, oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes, signaling molecules, growth/cell cycle, invasion/metastasis, cytokines, apoptosis, ion channels, extracellular matrix proteins, as well as some proteases. This screen identified suppression of several genes such as CDC-like kinase, LIM domain binding, Ets domain transcription factor, Rho GTPase-activating protein, tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase, hyaluronan-binding protein, matriptase, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), which have previously been implicated in enhancing tumor promotion. Northern blot analysis confirmed that several genes including matriptase and PAPP-A were down-regulated by bikunin by ∼9-fold.

Although bikunin was originally identified as a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor essential for inhibition of trypsin and plasmin, there is now increasing evidence to indicate a role for this glycoprotein in the regulation of cell biology (2Fries E. Blom A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Bikunin may be important in inhibiting the inflammatory response: it has been shown to inhibit the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in several types of cells (2Fries E. Blom A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Nakamura H. Abe S. Shibata Y. Sata M. Kato S. Saito H. Hino T. Takahashi H. Tomoike H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 112: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In animal models of inflammatory status, mice treated with bikunin exhibit decreases in several indices of inflammation (3Nakamura H. Abe S. Shibata Y. Sata M. Kato S. Saito H. Hino T. Takahashi H. Tomoike H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 112: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 4Futamura Y. Kajikawa S. Kaga N. Shibutani Y. Obstet. Gynecol. 1999; 93: 100-108PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the case of neoplastic cells, exposure of bikunin to cancer cells induces suppression of invasion and metastasis (5Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (PMID: 12496270)Google Scholar). The bikunin molecule has effects independent of its ability to inhibit trypsin and plasmin (7Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A number of high affinity specific receptors and binding proteins exist for bikunin on the tumor cell surface (8Hirashima Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It binds cartilage link protein (Crtl1), one of the hyaluronan-binding proteins (8Hirashima Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bikunin also interacts with the 45-kDa bikunin receptor, a putative CD44 accessory protein (8Hirashima Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Bikunin may cause inhibition of ECM invasion by interacting both with its receptor and Crtl1 in various cell types (8Hirashima Y. Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is possible that bikunin is associated as a heterotrimer with the bikunin receptor and Crtl1. It has been established that uPA and uPAR have been shown to modulate the invasion of tumor cells derived from several organs (9Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that bikunin down-regulates genes involved in tumor aggressiveness (6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (PMID: 12496270)Google Scholar, 7Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, bikunin target genes uPAand uPAR are central components of the tumor invasion program (9Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that bikunin repressed uPAand uPAR expression by inhibiting the MAP kinase pathway (10Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further, transfection of HRA cells with the bikunin gene caused pronounced inhibition of uPA expression and drastic suppression of ECM invasion (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Exogenously added bikunin could suppress peritoneal disseminated metastasis and intraperitoneal ovarian tumor growth, and expression of uPA in tumors of bikunin-injected nude mice was significantly lower than in controls. 2M. Suzuki and H. Kobayashi, unpublished data. Similarly, when bikunin-transfected cells were intraperitoneally injected into the mice, the size of the intraperitoneal tumors and the levels of uPA were also suppressed compared with luciferase-transfected control cells (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These data strongly support that uPA is mechanistically involved in the regulation of these processes. Why bikunin treatment is capable of inducing inhibition of cancer cell invasion is not fully known. Presumably, there are select target genes that bikunin is capable of regulating. The physiological function of bikunin still remains to be established. To understand better how bikunin regulates different facets of tumor cell biology, we sought to identify bikunin-regulated genes in a human ovarian cancer cell line, HRA, using microarray technology. There has not been any attempt to systematically define the full repertoire of bikunin-regulated genes. Identification of these genes is required not only for revealing the nature of all signaling pathways used by bikunin but also for defining the set of proteins that are induced or repressed by this inhibitor. In the current study, we started this investigation using a cDNA microarray hybridization analysis of RNA isolated from bikunin-treated and untreated HRA cells. In other experiments, we used HRA cells transfected with the bikunin gene. Here we show, using two different approaches, that we have identified at least 40 bikunin target genes, and that bikunin-selective targets include genes involved in the regulation of transcription factors, oncogenes/tumor suppressor genes, signal transduction modifiers, cell growth, cell cycle, inflammation, invasion/metastasis, apoptosis, ion channels, extracellular matrix proteins, and several proteases. The encoded proteins are involved in a broad range of cellular functions and signaling pathways. Interestingly, two different members of the protease (matriptase and PAPP-A) were markedly repressed by bikunin. We confirm that, consistent with this, exposure of ovarian cancer cells to bikunin or bikunin gene transfection suppresses a matriptase/PAPP-A-dependent invasion, suggesting a potential role for bikunin in modulating tumor biology. Purified human bikunin was obtained from Mochida Pharmaceutical Co. (Gotenba, Japan). LipofectAMINE Plus reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal anti-PAPP-A antibodies (IgG2b) were obtained from CosmoBio Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Boyden-type cell invasion chambers (BioCoat MatrigelTM invasion chambers) were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical (Franklin Lakes, NJ). The nude mice (Balb-c, nu/nu) were obtained from SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). All other chemicals were analytical grade. The ovarian cancer cell line, HRA, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) under a 5% CO2atmosphere with constant humidity (6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (PMID: 12496270)Google Scholar). For all experiments in which bikunin was added, cells were incubated in serum-free medium. Cells were disaggregated routinely with 0.1% trypsin/EDTA solution and replated at a split ratio of 1:10. Total RNA isolations were performed using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Protein concentrations in the supernatants of cell extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The cDNA microarrays (TaKaRa Human 3K CHIP Ver. 3.0; TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan; www.takara-bio.co.jp) were spotted with 3,126 sequence-verified clones that are available from GenBankTM(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html). Probes for cDNA microarrays were generated using total RNA from cells either exposed to bikunin (1 μm, 6 h; Exp. 1) or transfected with the bikunin gene (Exp. 2) in a standard reverse transcriptase reaction in which some of the dTTP was replaced with either Cy3-labeled dUTP or Cy5-labeled dUTP. In some experiments, the bikunin sample was labeled with Cy3; and in others, it was labeled with Cy5, with essentially identical results. Hybridization of both Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes to the same microarray was carried out in a sealed, humid hybridization cassette for about 14 h at 65 °C. Microarrays slides were washed and then dried by centrifugation at room temperature. Nine genes were tested for confirmation by Northern blot hybridization. To determine the fluorescent intensities of the two dyes for each spot, the fluorescence signals of Cy3- and Cy5-tagged cDNA spots on arrays at 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) simultaneously were scanned immediately with an Affymetrix 428 Array Scanner and quantitated using a BioDiscovery ImaGene Ver. 4.2 (TaKaRa Bio Inc.). The background-subtracted median ratio value was calculated for each spot, and replicate spots on each slide were averaged. The fluorescence intensities were normalized by applying a scaling factor so that the median fluorescence ratio of all spots with detectable signals above background on each microarray was 1.0. The spots that displayed a 2-fold or greater difference in fluorescence intensities between the two dyes were used to generate gene clusters. Poor quality spots were removed if they were very small, irregularly shaped, or with pixels that were not uniformly distributed throughout the spot. Northern blot hybridization was carried out as described previously (5Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1.2% agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon or nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences) using standard molecular biological techniques. Hybridization was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming to specific activities of 0.4–0.9 × 109 cpm/μg. The following cDNA sequences were used as probes: DYRK2, bp 1344–2154 of the human cDNA (12Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol.

Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Filters were reprobed with the cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to correct for the amount of RNA loaded onto the filters (5Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed on Kodak BioMax MS-1 film at −70 °C. Filters were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad model 620 Video Densitometer with a 1-d Analyst software package from Macintosh. The bikunin expression vector pCMV-bikunin-IRES-bsr and the control vector pCMV-luciferase-IRES-bsr (16Urabe M. Hasumi Y. Ogasawara Y. Matsushita T. Kamoshita N. Nomoto A. Colosi P. Kurtzman G.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) encoding luciferase (luc) were transfected into HRA cells by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (17Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1978; 14: 725-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) as described previously (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cells were selected in the presence of 10 mg/ml blasticidin S hydrochloride (Funakoshi Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Resistant clones were obtained after 4 weeks, andbik+ transfectants and aluc+ transfectant were obtained. The cells were subsequently maintained in the presence of 10 mg/ml blasticidin S hydrochloride. The initial bik+ mass cultures were subjected to at least two rounds of subcloning in order to obtain stable bik+ clones (Clones 1–5). DNA sequencing verified the correct insertion of the bik cDNA. Finally, HRA bik+ tumor cell clones with inducible bik protein expression were confirmed by immunocytochemical staining and Western blot analysis (18Chen Y.T. Holcomb C. Moore H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6508-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). luc+ transfectants were used as a control (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antisense 18-base phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the human MT-SP1and PAPP-A mRNA were synthesized and consisted of the antisense sequences of 5′-AGC TGC TCA TCC TAG GCA-3′ (AS-MT-SP1) and 5′-GCC CAA CTC CTG CTG GAA-3′ (AS-PAPP-A), respectively. Oligonucleotides mixed with lipofectin reagent were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the oligonucleotide-liposome complexes were then added to cells and washed twice with medium (19Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4388) Google Scholar). After 4 h, fresh normal growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Forty-eight hours later the cells were analyzed for PAPP-A protein expression by Western blot, and the cells were used for ECM invasion experiments as described below. HRA cells transiently transfected with either AS-PAPP-A as well as stably transfected with bikunin were harvested in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Centrifuged lysates (50 μg) from each cell line were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry transfer. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2% bovine serum albumin. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: rabbit polyclonal anti-bikunin (1:1000) or monoclonal anti-PAPP-A (1:1000). This was followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) at a dilution of 1:50,000 for 1 h. Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To examine the proliferation of each cell line, 5 × 103 cells were seeded, and the number of cells in each cell line was counted in triplicate after 24 h to assess plating efficiency. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Chemoinvasion assays were carried out in a Boyden chamber as described (10Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The upper surface of chamber was precoated with a layer of artificial basement membrane, Matrigel. The cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/well) was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium, which acted as a chemoattractant. To measure invasion, incubation was at 37 °C for 24 h. The invaded cells in the lower side of the filter were stained with hematoxylin. Triplicate filters were used for each cell type and assay condition, and 10 random fields were counted per filter under a microscope (×400). The experiments were repeated in duplicate. The primary goal of this study was to identify genes regulated at the transcriptional level by bikunin signaling in human ovarian cancer cells. HRA cells were evaluated for its suitability in studying gene expression changes in response to bikunin stimulation. The cell line was found not to express mRNA and protein for bikunin (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Exogenously added bikunin induced a suppression of tumor cell invasive ability in a modified Boyden chamber assay compared with control cells (5–8,10). Furthermore, transfection of bikunin gene in these cells also induces a specific and significant decrease in cell invasiveness (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Bikunin had negligible effects on the in vitro growth of the HRA cells (5Kobayashi H.

Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that bikunin could down-regulate uPA and uPAR expression in some of ovarian cancer cell lines (5Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (PMID: 12496270)Google Scholar, 7Suzuki M.

Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, this decrease in cell invasiveness was not due to a decrease in cell proliferation but rather a suppression of uPA and uPAR gene expression. Therefore, two different methods (bikunin exposure and bikunin gene transfection) were used to identify genes induced or repressed in the HRA cells in microarray technologies. In the first set of experiments, we tried to achieve the overexpression of the bikunin gene in HRA cells (Exp. 1, Table I). To test whether bikunin transfection could activate or inactivate potential target genes, HRA cells were stably transfected with bikunin or luciferase control (luc+). Of the stable bikunin transfectants, the clone 1 (C1) cells were selected for the microarray analysis because it showed the greatest bikunin expression (11Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from these samples, labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescence, and then hybridized to the TaKaRa Human 3K CHIP. Each slide contained duplicate sets of samples, and the colors of the two cDNA probes were reversed in duplicate assays. Quantitation of the signals produced two kinds of information: the intensity of the signal was proportional to the abundance of the corresponding mRNA, and the degree of redness or greenness indicated the fold induction or repression of mRNA by bikunin transfection of the cells. The average hybridization intensity across all probe sets from C1 cells was normalized to that obtained from a control luc+. For each gene, the intensity ratio of C1/luc+was calculated. Ratios of 1 indicate equal intensities and, therefore, no change in gene expression between the two cell lines. Ratios below 0.5 indicate down-regulation of gene expression in C1 cells. In contrast, ratios above 2.0 indicate an up-regulation of gene expression in C1 cells. Using this criterion, we found that 12 and 31 genes were up- and down-regulated in C1 cells, respectively. Further, our analyses revealed that 3 mRNAs (D30612, BC012816, and NM005399) were induced by 3.0-fold or more, and 7 mRNAs (NM030941, NM021978, NM003992,AB028983, NM006482, NM002375, and U28727) were repressed by 3.0-fold or more (Table I, Exp. 1).Table IMicroarray analysis of HRA cellsGenBank™ accession no.-Fold change1-aThe numbers indicate the -fold induction of each gene as determined by the microarray analysis software. + and − are increased and decreased in mRNA after bikunin treatment, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2028558454,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells and at moderate levels in many other cell types including epithelial cells. Although SHP-1 has been shown to be a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells, very little is known about the biological role of SHP-1 in epithelial cells. In order to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the loss of proliferative potential once committed intestinal epithelial cells begin to differentiate, the role and regulation of SHP-1 were analyzed in both intact epithelium as well as in well established intestinal cell models recapitulating the crypt-villus axis in vitro. Results show that SHP-1 was expressed in the nuclei of all intestinal epithelial cell models as well as in epithelial cells of intact human fetal jejunum and colon. Expression and phosphatase activity levels of SHP-1 were much more elevated in confluent growth-arrested intestinal epithelial cells and in differentiated enterocytes as well. Overexpression of SHP-1 in intestinal epithelial crypt cells significantly inhibiteddhfr, c-myc, and cyclin D1 gene expression but did not interfere with c-fos gene expression. In contrast, a mutated inactive form of SHP-1 had no effect on these genes. SHP-1 expression significantly decreased β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription in intestinal epithelial crypt cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that β-catenin is one of the main binding partners and a substrate for SHP-1. Taken together, our results indicate that SHP-1 may be involved in the regulation of β-catenin transcriptional function and in the negative control of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation.

Numerous PTPs have been identified to date, including the extensively studied SHP-1 (initially designated as SHPTP-1, SHP, HCP, and PTP1C) and SHP-2 (initially designated SHPTP-2, Syp, PTP2C, and PTP1D). Whereas SHP-1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and moderately in many other cell types such as epithelial cells, SHP-2 has a more widespread distribution (2Adachi M. Fisher E.H. Ihle J.

Both proteins have similar structures, comprising two tandem SH2 domains at the N terminus, a single central catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain. The SH2 domains recruit SHP-1 and SHP-2 to tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules, enabling dephosphorylation to be performed by the catalytic domain. Understanding the biological roles of SHP-1 has been vastly invigorated by the discovery that loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding SHP-1 are responsible for the profound immunological dysfunction observed in mice homozygous for the motheaten (me/me) or allelic viable motheaten (mev/mev) mutations (5Tsui H.W.

These mice express either no SHP-1 or a catalytically defective SHP-1 protein consequent to splice site mutations in theSHP-1 gene (6Shultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N.

These defects, in turn, engender severe hematopoietic disruption as exemplified by an enormous expansion and tissue accumulation of myeloid/monocytic cells that lead to patchy dermatitis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and hemorrhagic pneumonitis resulting in death at about 2–3 (me/me) or 9–12 (mev/mev) weeks. Lymphocyte ontogeny and function are also dramatically altered. Cells isolated from me and mev mice have enabled the identification of SHP-1 target proteins in hematopoietic cells (7Klingmüller U.

SHP-1 has been shown to negatively regulate downstream signaling of the erythropoietin receptor and to dephosphorylate several target molecules such as c-Kit, the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, the B and T cell antigen receptor, the adapter protein SLP-76, the cytosolic tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, and the lymphoid-specific Src family kinase Lck (7Klingmüller U.

Very little is known on the other hand about the biological roles of SHP-1 in epithelial cells, although the existence of an epithelium-specific isoform of SHP-1 (the epithelial and hematopoietic variants differ in the sequence of 4 amino acids at the N terminus) is suggestive of specific function(s) in these cells (14Banville D. Stocco R. Shen S.H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recently, Keilhack et al. (15Keilhack H. Müller M. Böhmer S.-A. Frank C. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier W.

Podolsky D.K. Yamada T. 3rd Ed. Growth and Development of the Gastrointestinal Tract. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1999: 547-584Google Scholar). Cell differentiation begins with a sudden loss of proliferative ability, a process characterized by marked changes in cell ultrastructure and by the expression of several newly acquired end products, including the expression of the gut disaccharidase sucrase-isomaltase (17Babyatsky M.W. Podolsky D.K. Yamada T. 3rd Ed. Growth and Development of the Gastrointestinal Tract. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1999: 547-584Google Scholar, 18Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Committed intestinal epithelial cells withdraw from the cell cycle to differentiate during the G1 phase. Hence, molecules that stimulate or inhibit G1 phase progression are thereby likely candidates for controlling cell cycle and differentiation in developing tissue. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a central role in the regulation of gastrointestinal proliferation, and mutations in this pathway have been detected in over 80% of colorectal cancers (19Smith K. Bui T.D. Poulsom R. Kaklamanis L. Williams G. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Indeed, β-catenin plays an essential role in intestinal epithelial cells, not only as a cadherin-associated complex but also as a signaling molecule in the nucleus. Specifically, β-catenin has been reported to transactivate gene expression through binding with its counterpart in intestinal cells, TCF-4 (21Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar, 22Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Downstream targets of the β-catenin-TCF complex include cyclin D1, c-Myc, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ, and E-cadherin (23He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

In order to mobilize into the nucleus and function as a signaling molecule, it is reasonable to assume that β-catenin must first dissociate from the cadherin complexes and be stabilized in the cytoplasm. Increased cytoplasmic pools of β-catenin can be prompted by several mechanisms such as down-regulation of E-cadherin (28Umbas R. Schalken J.A. Aalders T.W. Carter B.S. Karthaus H.F. Schaafsma H.E. Debruyne F.M. Isaacs W.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5104-5109PubMed Google Scholar), point mutation of β-catenin itself (29Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B.

In the present study, β-catenin is revealed as one of the key binding partners for SHP-1 in human intestinal crypt cells and a substrate for SHP-1 in these cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that SHP-1 negatively regulates β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity resulting in the inhibition of cyclin D1 and c-mycgene expression, the activation of which represents one of the earliest cell cycle-regulated events occurring during the transition from G0/G1 to S phase. Fifteen SHP-1 mutantmev/mev mice (C57aBL/6J-Hcphmev (homozygous males) and 12 control animals (C57BL/6J) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were fed Purina chow ad libitum and kept in a controlled temperature and light cycle environment (20 °C; 12 h light, 12 h darkness). All studies were conducted in agreement with the principles and procedures outlined in the Canadian Guidelines for Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Tissues from human fetuses varying in age from 18 to 20 weeks of gestation (post-fertilization fetal ages were estimated according to Streeter (32Streeter G.L. Contrib. Embryol. 1920; 11: 143-179Google Scholar)) were obtained from normal elective pregnancy terminations. No tissue was collected from cases associated with a known fetal abnormality or fetal death. Studies were approved by the Institutional Human Subject Review Board. Segments of human fetal small intestine were rinsed with 0.15 m NaCl, cut into small fragments, embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections 2–3 μm thick were spread on silane-coated glass slides and air-dried for 1 h at room temperature before storage at −80 °C (33Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.F.

For indirect immunofluorescence, sections were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4; 45 min, 4 °C) prior to detection of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and SHP-1 (a kind gift from Dr. A. Veillette, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada) (1:250, 2 h, room temperature). Secondary antibodies consisted of goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate from Roche Diagnostics. Negative controls (no primary antibody) were included in all experiments. Human intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC) were cultured as described previously (36Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (all obtained from Invitrogen), 0.2 IU/ml insulin (Connaught Novo Laboratories, Willowdale, Ontario, Canada), and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 248-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) and the Caco-2/15 cell line were obtained from A. Quaroni (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). This clone of the parent Caco-2 cell line (HTB 37; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) has been extensively characterized elsewhere (34Aliaga J.C. Deschênes C. Beaulieu J.F. Calvo E.L.

Both cell lines were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, as described previously (34Aliaga J.C. Deschênes C. Beaulieu J.F. Calvo E.L. Rivard N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G631-G641PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human differentiated enterocytes (PCDE) prepared from fetal small intestines ranging from 18 to 20 weeks of age were cultured as described above for HIEC. When tested after 5–7 days, these primary cultures remained well preserved, and both goblet and absorptive cells exhibited all the main characteristics of intact villus intestinal cells (40Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 254: 34-42Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. HIEC, Caco-2/15, and IEC-6 cells grown on sterile glass coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed in methanol/acetone (30–70%) for 15 min at −20 °C, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with PBS/bovine serum albumin 2% (20 min at room temperature). Cells were then immunostained for 1 h with primary antibody for the detection of SHP-1 or β-catenin and 30 min with the secondary conjugated antibody. Negative controls (no primary antibody) were included in all experiments. After mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the jejunum and colon were rapidly removed and the mucosae scraped and homogenized (1 mg of tissue/50 μl) in Triton buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm orthovanadate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min). One-half of the homogenates was mixed in Laemmli's buffer, boiled for 5 min, and frozen until preparation of Western blots; the other half was stored at −80 °C for β-catenin immunoprecipitation. Proteins were determined by the modified Lowry procedure described by Peterson (41Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 1 mm PMSF). Proteins (40 μg) from whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in 7.5 or 10% gels and detected immunologically following electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Protein and molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were localized with Ponceau Red. After blocking for 1 h at 25 °C in PBS, 0.05% Tween containing 5% powdered milk, membranes were first incubated for 2–4 h at 25 °C with antibodies against either SHP-1, β-catenin, E-cadherin and TCF-4 (BD Biosciences), actin, cyclin D1, and antiphosphotyrosine (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), pRb (Pharmingen), c-Myc (Roche Diagnostics), or sucrase-isomaltase (HSI-14 from A. Quaroni, Cornell University) in blocking solution, followed by a second incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:1000) IgG (both from Sigma) in blocking solution for 1 h. The blots were visualized by theAmersham ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowry procedure with bovine serum albumin as standard (41Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed on ice for 10 min with 1 ml/dish of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates (800 μg) cleared by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 10 min) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) that had been initially preincubated for 2 h with anti-SHP-1. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer and three times with ice-cold phosphatase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) prior to initiating the phosphatase assay according to Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and as described previously (42Yoshida K. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Levels of immunoprecipitated SHP-1 were analyzed by Western blotting. The phosphatase reaction was initiated by incubating the immunocomplexes at 30 °C in the presence of 750 μm of the phosphopeptide RRLIEDAEpYAARG (where pY is phosphotyrosine). After 45 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of malachite green solution. Sample absorbance was measured at 655 nm after allowing for color development. The increase in phosphatase activity (absorbance) in PCDE was calculated relative to the level observed in HIEC, which was set at 1, whereas the increase in phosphatase activity (absorbance) in differentiating Caco-2/15 cells was calculated relative to the level measured in subconfluent Caco-2/15, which was also set at 1. Specific phosphatase activity was calculated relative to the amount of immunoprecipitated SHP-1. Band intensities in Western blots were quantified by laser densitometry using an Alpha Imager 1200 documentation and analysis system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in chilled lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate), and lysates cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. Primary antibodies were added to 800 μg of each cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under agitation. Forty μg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was subsequently added for 1 h (4 °C under agitation). Immunocomplexes were harvested by centrifugation and washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli's buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Plasmid DHFR-luciferase, which contains a high affinity E2F-binding site in the dihydrofolate reductase promoter (43Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.G. Mol. Cell.

The dhfr gene, which is required for DNA synthesis, is transcribed at the G1/S transition. The cyclin D1 reporter construct, which contains the cyclin D1 gene promoter from nucleotides −944 to +139 cloned upstream of the luciferase gene of the pXP2 reporter construct, has been described previously (44Lavoie J.N.

The T cell factor (TCF) reporter construct TOPFLASH was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The constitutive active mutant of mouse c-Src p60Y529F was a kind gift from Dr. Josée Lavoie (Université Laval, Quebec, Canada). The full-length mouse SHP-1 cDNA (M.

Mutation of the critical cysteine 453 of the catalytic site of the molecule for serine (SHP-1C453S) was performed by site-directed mutagenesis of double-stranded DNA according to the Clontech protocol. Subconfluent HIEC were seeded in 12-well plates and cotransfected by lipofection (LipofectAMINE 2000, Invitrogen) with 0.2 μg of DHFR-luciferase, c-Myc-luciferase, cyclin D1-luciferase, c-Fos-luciferase or TOPFLASH reporters and 0.2 μg of the relevant expression vector (pcDNAneo) containing SHP-1 or SHP-1C453/S. The pRL-SV40 Renillaluciferase vector (Promega, Nepean, Ontario, Canada) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Two days after transfection, luciferase activity was measured as described previously (34Aliaga J.C. Deschênes C. Beaulieu J.F. Calvo E.L. Rivard N. Am. J.

Control andmotheatenv mice were injected with 10 mmBrdUrd (1 ml/100 g body weight) 2 h prior to sacrifice. Segments of jejunum and colon were rinsed with 0.15 m NaCl, cut into small fragments, embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound, and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Based on their enrichment in various signaling molecules, these membrane microdomains are recognized to be sites of localized signal transduction for a number of extracellular stimuli. We have previously shown that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) induced a specific signaling response within a lipid raft membrane microdomain in human neuroblastoma cells characterized by the tyrosine phosphorylation of a p80 phosphoprotein. Herein, we show that this protein is the signaling adaptor FRS2 and that it is localized exclusively to lipid rafts in vitro and in vivo. We have examined how the tyrosine phosphorylation and serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 within lipid rafts affect the response of cells to FGF2 signaling. Our data suggest that activation of protein kinase C, Src family kinases, and MEK1/2 are involved in regulating serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2, which can indirectly affect FRS2 phosphotyrosine levels. We also show that Grb2 is recruited to lipid rafts during signaling events and that activation of MEK1/2 by different mechanisms within lipid rafts may lead to different cellular responses.

Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, FGFs have been shown to stimulate both the differentiation and survival of post-mitotic cells as well as being proliferative factors for non-differentiated cells (3Gritti A. Parati E.A. Cova L. Frolischthal P. Galli R. Wanke E. Favarelli L. Morassutti D.J. Roisen F. Nickel D.D. Vescovi A.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGFs induce their biological effects by binding to and activating a family of trans-membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1–4) (2Galzie Z. Kinsella A.R. Smith J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The activation of the FGFRs occurs by dimerization of the trans-membrane receptors upon the binding of the FGF ligand followed by autophosphorylation of a number of tyrosine residues, some of which can act as recruitment sites for various downstream effectors (2Galzie Z. Kinsella A.R. Smith J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor target or SNT) (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). FRS2 associates directly with FGFRs and shows increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon FGFR signaling and functions to recruit SH2 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2 that link the FGFR to a variety of downstream pathways (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 9Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Ong S.H.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). FRS2 also exhibits a high level of serine-threonine as well as tyrosine phosphorylation (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 10Wang J.-K. Xu H. Li H.-C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the serine-threonine phosphorylation on FRS2 is presently unclear, although it may provide another level of specificity to the FGFR signaling by regulating pathways distinct from those associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2. The importance of FRS2 in FGF signaling is reflected in the embryonic lethal phenotype observed during mouse development after disruption of theFRS2 gene. In addition, FRS2 null cell lines derived from these embryos show an impairment of FGF-induced migration, proliferation, and MAPK activation (11Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8578-8583Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). FGFR signaling also leads to activation of members of the Src protein tyrosine kinase family (12Kuo W.-L. Chung K.-C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies on Xenopus laevis have demonstrated that Laloo, a novel member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, is required for mesoderm induction in response to FGF (13Weinstein D.C. Marden J. Carnevali F. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Nature. 1998; 394: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cooperation of FRS2 and Laloo in this pathway is suggested by the observed association of FRS2 with Laloo (14Kusakabe M. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,15Hama J. Suri C. Haremaki T. Weinstein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19806-19810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although many receptor tyrosine kinases activate similar downstream pathways such as the MAPK pathway, they induce specific phenotypic responses from the cell. Specificity can be achieved temporally by the developmentally regulated expression of certain components of the pathways. For instance, the expression of different FGFR types is regulated during oligodendrocyte maturation, providing a molecular basis for the developmentally varying response of cells to a common ligand (16Bansal R. Kumar M. Murray K. Morrison R.S. Pfeiffer S.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Specificity can also originate from the type of receptor expressed, because all of the FGFRs do not appear to have the same efficiency at activating various downstream pathways (17Lin H.Y. Xu J. Ischenko I. Ornitz D.M. Halegoua S. Hayman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3762-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F.

Biol. 1994; 14: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, the location of the receptor or downstream events within the cell may add another level of specificity in the signaling response. Microdomains within the plasma membrane such as lipid rafts function to sequester signaling molecules and act as sites of signal transduction that can regulate cell physiology (20Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 21Schlegel A. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Mehta P. Zhang X.-L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Cell.

Lipid rafts are characterized by their enrichment in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol as well as by their unique protein composition (20Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). On the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, proteins such as G-proteins and members of the Src-family of protein tyrosine kinases are found associated with these membrane microdomains (23Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). There are at least two different microcompartments that can be distinguished by their shape and protein composition (22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). Caveolae are one such compartment characterized by the presence of caveolin-1, a 22-kDa protein known as the structural component of these small flask-shaped caves (26Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 27Lipardi C. Mora R. Colomer V. Paladino S. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Zurzulo C. J.

Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Originally, caveolae were thought to function in receptor-mediated potocytosis (30Anderson R.G.W. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, their functions are rapidly expanding to include events such as an alternative route of receptor endocytosis, trans-cytosis, regulation of calcium homeostasis, a site of clustering of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins, and more recently, a localized site for signal transduction (20Anderson R.G.W.

Previously, we had observed an FGF2-induced signaling event that was localized to membrane microdomains that we termed caveolae-like domains (35Davy A. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Herein, we have identified the FGF2-responsive protein FRS2 as a lipid raft-associated protein, both in vitro and in the developing mouse brain. We have also examined FGF2 signaling through FRS2 within lipid rafts and show that serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 is dependent on a pathway involving protein kinase C (PKC), Src family kinases, and MEK1/2 and that FGF2 signaling through MEK1/2 may have different phenotypic consequences in the cell depending upon the pathway used for activation of MEK1/2. Anti-FRS2 polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Grb2 and anti-PKC monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); anti-active MAPK polyclonal was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI); and anti-MAPK was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). LAN-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Prior to growth factor treatment, cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% cosmic calf serum for 18 h. Cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml FGF2, 50 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or 100 nm thymeleatoxin for the times indicated in experiments. Inhibitor studies were done with the addition of 10 μmPP2 or PP3, 1 μm bisindolylmaleimide (Bis) I or V, or 10 μm U0126 to the cells for 30 min prior to cell stimulation. Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 (protein grade; Calbiochem), 1 mm PMSF (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin (Sigma)). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell-free lysates were incubated with 1 μg/ml FRS2 polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed several times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and the samples were boiled in 2× SDS Laemmli's sample buffer prior to separation on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were dried and blocked in Tris-buffered saline (5 mm Tris, 135 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with a 1:1000 dilution of the appropriate antibodies in their respective blocking buffers. The membranes were washed extensively in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% Tween 20 or 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% Tween 20 when α-phosphotyrosine antibody was used. This was followed by incubation for 20 min with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), each diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed as described above and developed using an ECL substrate. Cells were grown to confluence on 150-mm-diameter dishes and stimulated as described above. Cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer. The cells were fractionated on sucrose gradients, and low density soluble and pelleted fractions were isolated as described in detail previously (23Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). CD1 mouse embryos were recovered at stages E11, E16, and P1. Whole brain tissue was isolated and homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 buffer before fractionation on sucrose gradient and isolation of low density fractions as described above. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that FGF2 was unique from other growth factors (epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor) and neurotrophins in that it was able to induce a compartmentalized signaling response in a human neuroblastoma cell line, LAN-1 (35Davy A. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In our previous work, we referred to these membrane microdomains as caveolae-like domains, because the LAN-1 cells expressed both caveolin-1 and -2. However, since we have only characterized this membrane fraction based on its detergent insolubility and low buoyant density fractionation, it is more appropriate to refer to these domains as lipid rafts, consistent with recent nomenclature (36Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 737-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We observed that FGF2 was able to induce an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins within the lipid raft fraction including an unknown protein migrating between 75–80 kDa that bound to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing p13suc1 or Src-SH2 domains (35Davy A. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Association with p13suc1 or SH2 domains is a feature of the 80-kDa FGFR-associated adaptor protein, FRS2, and related family members (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Wang J.-K. Xu H. Li H.-C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in an attempt to characterize and identify the p75–80 protein, we used antibodies directed to FRS2 to probe fractionated LAN-1 cell lysates that had been treated with 20 ng/ml FGF2 for 5 min. Western blotting showed that FRS2 is localized exclusively to lipid raft fractions and correlates with the FGF2-induced phosphotyrosine seen at 80 kDa in the lipid raft fraction (Fig. 1A). A 90-kDa band was also observed in the Triton X-100-soluble and pelleted fractions when Western blotting for FRS2 (Fig. 1A). This band was never observed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FGF2, so it is probably a nonspecific band or possibly a FGF non-responsive FRS2-related protein. Immunoprecipitation of FRS2 from whole cell lysates confirmed that the 80-kDa FRS2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FGF2 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we have identified FRS2 as a FGF2-responsive protein that is localized specifically to the lipid raft fraction of LAN-1 cells. To establish that this localization was not unique to established cell lines, we also examined the expression and localization of FRS2 at various time points in the developing mouse brain. Whole mouse brain lysates were fractionated on sucrose gradients and probed by Western blotting for FRS2 expression. We found that FRS2 was expressed at each of the stages of development examined and that in all stages FRS2 was specifically localized to the lipid raft fractions (Fig.1C). The FRS2 response to FGF2 stimulation is characterized by an increased tyrosine phosphorylation as well as a change in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels that has been attributed to the action of serine-threonine kinases toward FRS2 (10Wang J.-K. Xu H. Li H.-C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used the mobility shift as an indicator of FRS2 serine-threonine levels. Because FGFRs have been shown to activate phospholipase Cγ (38Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can lead to the activation of PKC, we examined the possibility that PKC was involved in serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2. Using a 5-min stimulation of 20 ng/ml FGF2, we could visualize the shift in electrophoretic mobility of FRS2, indicative of its serine-threonine phosphorylation (Fig.2A). The effects of FGF2 on FRS2 could be blocked by PP2, an inhibitor of the Src family kinases, or the PKC inhibitor Bis I, suggesting that PKC and Src family kinase activity are required for FGF2-induced serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 (Fig. 2A). FGF2-induced serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 was also completely blocked by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, suggesting that activation of the MAPK cascade is also required for serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2. The electrophoretic shift in mobility in FRS2 using FGF2 treatment could be replicated using 50 ng/ml TPA, a diacyl glycerol analog that activates conventional and novel PKC isoforms (Fig. 2A), as well as when cells were stimulated with thymeleatoxin, which specifically activates conventional isoforms of PKC (data not shown) (39Llosas M.D. Batlle E. Coll O. Skoudy A. Fabre M. Garcia de Herreros A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1049-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility shift of FRS2 induced by TPA could also be abrogated in the presence of PP2, Bis I, or U0126 inhibitors. These data confirmed that direct activation of PKC could lead to serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 and that it was also dependent on downstream activation of Src family kinases and MEK1/2 as observed for FGF2 stimulation. FRS2 was only detected in lipid raft fractions and not in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of the cells (Fig.2A). An analysis of Western blots showing phosphotyrosine levels in lipid rafts revealed that FGF2 treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2, which was not blocked by pretreatment of the cells with PP2, Bis I, or U0126 (inhibitors that blocked serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2). Rather, under these conditions, tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 appeared to be enhanced (Fig. 2A). Unlike FGF2, treatment of the cells with TPA did not result in the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 is not required for tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 to occur and that blocking the serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 can lead to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 has been shown to directly recruit Grb2 and activate the MAPK pathway in response to FGF2 (40Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Xu H. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13049-13056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that Grb2 associates in a complex with FRS2 in LAN-1 cells as determined by immunoprecipitation of FRS2 (data not shown). Because FRS2 was associated exclusively with lipid rafts, we examined the level of Grb2 recruitment to lipid rafts after cell stimulation. Grb2 was present in the Triton X-100-soluble cell fraction under all of the conditions examined (Fig. 2A). Under control conditions, Grb2 was either not present in lipid rafts or at extremely low levels. FGF2 stimulation induced the recruitment of Grb2 to lipid rafts, and this was not blocked by PP2, Bis I, or U0126, which blocked serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2. As was observed for tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2, it appeared that Grb2 recruitment to lipid rafts was actually enhanced under conditions that inhibit serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 (Fig. 2A). TPA treatment did not induce Grb2 recruitment to lipid rafts, although some Grb2 was present after TPA treatment in the presence of U0126 (Fig.2A). These data suggest that serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 is neither sufficient nor necessary for the recruitment of Grb2 to lipid rafts; however, enhancing tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 recruits more Grb2 to lipid rafts. Equal loading of the lipid raft fractions was confirmed by Western blotting for caveolin protein levels (Fig. 2A). To address which PKC isoform might be involved in FRS2 signaling, we looked at the expression of PKC isoforms in fractionated LAN-1 cells to determine whether there was any localization to lipid raft microdomains. Several PKC isoforms were expressed in LAN-1 cells; however, PKCγ was the only isoform detected that showed strong lipid raft association, although the localization of PKCγ did not appear to be affected by FGF2 treatment (Fig. 2B). Of the other conventional PKC isoforms, PKCα was excluded from lipid rafts (Fig.2B) and PKCβ was not detected in Western blots (data not shown), suggesting that PKCγ may be the isoform involved in signaling through FRS2 in LAN-1 cells. We have already shown that Grb2 is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated FRS2 in lipid rafts in the absence of FRS2 serine-threonine phosphorylation. We next examined whether the serine-threonine phosphorylation levels of FRS2 affected downstream MAPK activation. After the treatment of LAN-1 cells with 20 ng/ml FGF2 for 5 min, FRS2 was immunoprecipitated and examined by SDS-PAGE for a change in electrophoretic mobility under various inhibitory conditions. Using the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 or the PKC family inhibitor Bis I, we observed an inhibition of the change in mobility of FRS2 induced by FGF2 treatment. The inhibitory effects of PP2 and Bis I were not observed when the control compound, PP3 or Bis V, was used (Fig.3A). As observed previously, neither PP2 nor Bis I inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2; however, there was an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylated FRS2 seen at 75 kDa that corresponds to the accumulation of FRS2 in the non-serine-threonine-phosphorylated form (Fig. 3A). Whole cell lysates from cells treated with the same conditions were used to determine the phosphorylation levels of MAPK. It was found that FGF2 activated p42ERK and that neither PP2 nor Bis I blocked MAPK activation by FGF2 (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that MAPK activation correlates with FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas global serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 is not required for the propagation of signals that lead to MAPK activation. LAN-1 cells that were treated with 20 ng/ml FGF2 for 18 h showed a change from a flattened dendritic morphology to a rounded refractile morphology (Fig.4A). This change in morphology was not seen when the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml TPA or 100 nm thymeleatoxin for the same time period (Fig.4A). When the cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor U0126, the FGF2-induced cell rounding was completely blocked and the cells remained in a flattened adherent morphology (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the pretreatment of the cells with the PKC inhibitor Bis I failed to inhibit the FGF2-induced cell rounding (Fig. 4B). Together, these results suggest that FGF2 acts to induce cell rounding through a MEK-dependent pathway and that this pathway does not require the activation of PKC. In summary, we have shown that FRS2 is a lipid raft-associated protein, both in the cell culture model used here and alsoin vivo. We have also shown that FGF2 signaling through FRS2 involves multiple pathways that appear to regulate distinct phenotypic responses in the cell. FRS2 was initially described as an adaptor protein involved in FGF signaling that was modified at the N terminus with the addition of a myristoylation moiety (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The acyl modification functions to target FRS2 to the membrane, and several reports (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 40Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that FRS2 is indeed localized to the membrane portion of fractionated cells and that membrane association is required for efficient signaling to occur through FRS2. Here, we have shown that FRS2 is not only targeted to the plasma membrane but that it is localized specifically to lipid rafts within the membrane, both in cultured LAN-1 cells and also in lipid rafts isolated from various stages of developing mouse brain. Many signaling molecules have been reported to be present within lipid rafts, and membrane microdomains are thought to act as sights for regulated formation of signal transduction complexes that influence downstream signaling from a variety of membrane receptors (22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). The localization of FRS2 to lipid rafts is probably important in regulating its interaction with other molecules such as bringing FRS2 into close proximity with FGFR to enable the association of the two proteins that has been demonstrated to occur between the juxtamembrane region of FGFR and the phosphotyrosine binding domain of FRS2 (42Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). FRS2 is known to be expressed in the developing nervous system (43McDougall K. Kubu C. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our observation that FRS2 is also localized to lipid rafts in developing mouse brain provides evidence that this localization may be functionally important for efficient signaling through FRS2in vivo during neural development. We have been unable to determine whether any of the FGFRs are localized to lipid rafts (35Davy A. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), possibly because of the fact that the receptors are extracted from the lipid raft fraction under the conditions used as has been noted for the epidermal growth factor receptor (44Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). FRS2 contains several tyrosine residues that have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to growth factor signaling (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 8Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 is important in signal propagation and has been shown to be required for association with Grb2 and downstream activation of the MAPK pathway (40Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 42Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as in the recruitment of several other signaling molecules such as Cbl (45Wong A. Lamothe B. Li A. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6684-6689Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (46Ong S.H. Hadari Y.R. Gotoh N. Guy G.R. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6074-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that the majority of phosphorylation on FRS2 is on serine and threonine rather than tyrosine (7Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 10Wang J.-K. Xu H. Li H.-C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports of the molecular weight of FRS2 have varied somewhat, possibly because of the change in electrophoretic mobility that is associated with serine-threonine kinase activity toward FRS2 (10Wang J.-K. Xu H. Li H.-C. Goldfarb M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 721-729PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the tyrosine and serine-threonine levels of FRS2 under various conditions to determine the effect they have on FRS2 signaling within lipid rafts. It has previously been shown that phospholipase Cγ associates directly with the FGFR through its SH2 domain and is involved in FGF signaling (38Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because phospholipase C is an upstream activator of PKC signaling, we examined the possibility that PKC was involved in the serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2. It has been reported that FRS2 associates with the atypical isoform PKCλ, although it was not found to be a substrate of PKCλ in vitro (47Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Lim J. Wong E.S. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a conventional PKC isoform is involved in the phosphorylation of FRS2, although in agreement with previous studies, FRS2 may not be a direct substrate of PKC because we observed an inhibition of TPA-induced serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 by both PP2 and U0126 treatment, suggesting a requirement for Src family kinase and MEK1/2 activity downstream of PKC. PKC can associate with Src family kinases through adaptor proteins, and tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC has been implicated in the modulation of downstream signaling (48Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 49Kronfeld I. Kazimirsky G. Lorenzo P.S. Garfield S.H. Blumberg P.M. Brodie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35491-35498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Of the three conventional PKC isoforms, we have shown that the PKCγ isoform is present in lipid rafts, whereas the PKCα isoform is excluded from lipid rafts isolated from LAN-1 cells. The PKCβ isoform was not detected (data not shown). Therefore, it is possible that PKCγ is the isoform involved in either direct or indirect phosphorylation of FRS2 in LAN-1 cells. During the preparation of this paper, it has been demonstrated that the activation of MAPK results in serine phosphorylation of FRS2, which acts to negatively regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling through FRS2 (50Lax I. Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Frost A. Hawes J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We also observed that the inhibition of serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels of FRS2 as well as a correlating increase in the level of Grb2 recruited to lipid rafts that suggests a negative regulation of FRS2 phosphotyrosine by serine-threonine phosphorylation. Although Lax et al.(50Lax I. Wong A. Lamothe B. Lee A. Frost A. Hawes J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) did not find PKC activity to be required for the serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 to occur, we have shown that PKC is involved in serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2 in LAN-1 cells, possibly through MEK1/2-dependent activation of MAPK. Both FGF and TPA have been shown to activate the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade in a PKC-dependent manner (51Liu J.F. Crepin M. Liu J.M. Barritault D. Ledoux D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and it is possible that PKC-dependent activation of Ras in response to FGF2 is only utilized by certain cell types or under certain conditions. Our data also suggest a requirement for the activation of MEK1/2 in both FGF2- and TPA-stimulated serine-threonine phosphorylation of FRS2. However, only FGF2 stimulation recruits Grb2 to lipid rafts and induces LAN-1 cell rounding in a MEK1/2-dependent manner. This would suggest that despite both FGF2 and TPA activating a MEK1/2-dependent pathway, only the FGF2-activated MEK1/2 leads to LAN-1 cell rounding. The data presented here suggest that FGF2 may activate MEK1/2 through the recruitment of Grb2 to FRS2 and also by activation of Ras by PKC. The activation of MEK1/2 through these different mechanisms may lead to different downstream responses in the cell as has been noted in other cell types where activation of different isoforms of PKC lead to differential localization of MAPK within the cell, leading to different cellular responses (37Besson A. Davy A. Robbins S.M. Yong V.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7398-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A model showing FRS2 signaling pathways is shown in Fig.5. In addition to FGF, a diverse array of signaling molecules has been shown to utilize lipid rafts for various aspects of their signaling mechanisms (36Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 737-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrins are also able to induce a compartmentalized signaling response within the lipid rafts of cells including neural cells. As is the case for FGF, ephrin signaling induces the phosphorylation of a p75–80 phosphoprotein (35Davy A. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, this protein is not FRS2. 2A. Davy, M. S. Ridyard, and S. M. Robbins, unpublished data. Therefore, there is specificity of signaling within lipid rafts through the recruitment of different signaling molecules to distinct signaling pathways In summary, we have shown that the FGF-responsive adaptor protein FRS2 is localized exclusively to lipid rafts within the cell membrane and that this localization is probably an important factor in the regulation of signaling via FRS2 through the regulation of interacting signaling molecules that either regulate the phosphorylation of FRS2 or are responsive to FRS2 phosphorylation levels. We have also shown that MEK1/2 is involved in multiple signaling pathways within lipid rafts and that the activation of MEK1/2 through different mechanisms may lead to different cellular responses. We thank the members of the laboratory for their constructive comments and discussions during the course of this work. We also thank Dr. Alice Davy for valuable input during the initial stages of this work."

Here, we explored the hypothesis that post-translational processing by a protease generates the LMW forms of cyclin E in breast tumors. In ZR75 tumor cell lysates, calcium-induced cyclin E truncation into peptides corresponding in size with LMW forms of cyclin E in tumor tissues. Calpeptin inhibited calcium-stimulated cyclin E truncation, indicating that cleavage resulted from activity of the calcium-dependent protease, calpain. Consistently, calcium+calpain caused truncation of cyclin E immunoprecipitated from tumor cells and tissues. Calcium also caused truncation of the calpain regulatory subunit in tumor cell lysates, indicating that elevated calpain activity accompanies cyclin E truncation. Increased levels of the calpain small subunit were also observed in breast tumors, and significant amounts of its proteolyzed forms indicated increased calpain activity. While elastase also caused cyclin E truncation, the cleavage pattern was distinct from that generated by calpain, suggesting discrete mechanisms in regulating the formation of LMW cyclin E in breast tumors. Treatment of ZR75 cultures with calcium+A23187 recapitulated the formation of the calcium/calpain-induced LMW forms of cyclin E. Altered calcium homeostasis and/or inability of the endogenous calpain inhibitor to control the activity of high levels of the calpain small subunit may contribute to increased calpain activity in breast tumors, causing abundant levels of LMW cyclin E."

Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,8Rizzi M. Schindelin H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The lack of mechanistic information about sulfur transfer chemistry as well as the biological importance of sulfur put great emphasis on understanding the sulfur transfer chemistry in these systems. A common step during thiamin and molybdopterin biosynthesis is the ATP-dependent transfer of sulfur froml-cysteine to yield a C-terminal glycine thiocarboxylate on ThiS and MoaD, respectively (9Leimkuhler S.

A. 2001; 98: 8513-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For Moco biosynthesis, MoeB, the MPT synthase sulfurylase, converts the C-terminal carboxylate of MoaD into the thiocarboxylate with the aid of an IscS-like protein (10Leimkuhler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22024-22031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The C-terminal thiocarboxylate of MPT synthase and ThiS are the sulfur donors during either Moco or thiamin biosynthesis. In order for MoaD to interact with both MoeB and MoaE, MoaD must reversibly bind to either protein (Fig. 1a). This complex interaction is vital for the action of MPT synthase, where two MoaD subunits transfer the required sulfur atoms in two subsequent steps (12Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the transfer of MoaD is important in clarifying the enzymatic function of MPT synthase and the sulfur transfer cycle between MPT synthase and MoeB. The high resolution crystal structure of MPT synthase (Fig.1b) revealed a heterotetrameric molecule in which the two MoaE subunits dimerize and the MoaD subunits are located on opposite ends of the molecule with their C termini deeply inserted into each MoaE subunit (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). MoaD adopts the same fold as ubiquitin despite the absence of detectable sequence homology, demonstrating a divergent evolutionary relationship between the MoaD-MoeB system and ubiquitin as well as the related protein modifiers SUMO and NEDD8 (Rub) and their activating (E1) enzymes. The MoaE subunit is characterized by an α/β hammerhead fold with an additional subdomain containing a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The active site of the enzyme is located in each MoaE subunit in close proximity to the MoaD C terminus (Fig. 1b), which is lined by conserved Lys, Arg, and His residues. While the majority of these residues originate from the proximal MoaE subunit, two residues (His-103′ and Arg-104′) are located in the distal MoaE subunit. Based on their phylogenetic conservation and their location in close proximity to the active site, these residues have been postulated to be important for the function of MPT synthase (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We present here the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure of MPT synthase in a novel orthorhombic space group. This structure revealed a bound sulfate ion near the MoaD C terminus that probably mimics the binding site for the terminal phosphate group of MPT, the product of the reaction. In addition, the homodimeric structure of MoaE in the absence of MoaD was derived at 2.15-Å resolution from the crystal structure of a MoaE deletion variant (MoaE 141Δ) in which the last 10 residues (positions 141–150) have been deleted. Including the earlier MPT synthase structure and the MoaD-MoeB complex, three structures each of MoaE and MoaD are now available, and these have been investigated to determine the conformational changes in MoaD and MoaE. From the available MoaE structures, the likely pterin-binding site was also deduced. Finally, the position of the thiocarboxylate sulfur of MoaD has been identified through anomalous scattering techniques. In an accompanying paper (12Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), site-directed mutagenesis has been employed to study the role of a number of highly conserved MoaE residues in the MPT synthase reaction. Taken together with these data, the structures presented here further define the mechanism of MPT synthase and the role of specific residues in its catalytic mechanism. Purification of partially activated MPT synthase was carried out as described (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Fully activated MoaD, MoaE, and the E141Δ variant of MoaE were purified as described in the accompanying paper (12Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14523-14532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Formation of fully activated MPT synthase was accomplished by mixing equimolar quantities of activated MoaD and MoaE. The resulting synthase was then passed through a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) size exclusion column, concentrated, and crystallized under the published conditions (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A new crystal form of MPT synthase using partially activated MPT synthase was obtained with 1.1 m (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1m Hepes, pH 7.5, as precipitant at a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. The crystals grew extremely slowly and reached their final size of 0.2 × 0.04 × 0.04 mm3 within 4–8 months. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group I212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 44.6 Å, b = 93.9 Å, andc = 137.0 Å and contain one MoaD-MoaE heterodimer in the asymmetric unit. Initial attempts to structurally characterize full-length apo-MoaE resulted in crystals that diffracted to only 3.5-Å resolution. Despite this low resolution, a structure was determined by molecular replacement and partially refined. Since this structure revealed that the MoaE C terminus was disordered, crystallization of a truncated version of MoaE was attempted. The E141Δ C-terminally truncated version of MoaE was crystallized from a solution containing 600 mm sodium formate, 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% isopropyl alcohol, and 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of 20 mg/ml. The crystals grew to their final size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 1.0 mm3 in 2–3 days and belong to the C-centered orthorhombic space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions of a = 104.1 Å, b = 127.8 Å, and c = 138.1 Å. Three MoaE homodimers are present in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data for the I-centered orthorhombic form of MPT synthase were collected from cryocooled crystals at beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory and at beamline X25 at the National Synchrotron Light Source for E141Δ MoaE at a wavelength of 1.1 Å. Crystals of both forms were soaked in mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol prior to cryocooling. A full sphere of diffraction data for fully activated MPT synthase crystals was collected at a wavelength of 1.54 Å on a rotating anode generator equipped with confocal optics and an Raxis IV++ imaging plate detector. All data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The data set of the orthorhombic crystal has an overall completeness and Rsym of 98.4 and 8.1%, respectively (82.1 and 34.6% in the last shell). The data possess an overallI/ςI of 16.1 and anI/ςI in the highest resolution shell of 2.5 (Table I). The data set of the MoaE 141Δ deletion mutant contains 50,343 unique reflections resulting from a total of 167,567 recorded reflections in the resolution range from 50 to 2.15 Å. The overall completeness and Rsym are 92.7 and 6.3%, respectively (73.1 and 36.7% in the last shell), and the data possess an overall I/ςI of 17.9 (1.7 in the highest resolution shell) (see Table I). Although the MoaE E141Δ crystals initially diffracted to 1.7 Å, radiation damage restricted the resolution limit to 2.15 Å, even with cryocooling.Table IData collection statisticsAnoI212121MoaE Δ141Resolution limits (Å)50–2.450–1.950–2.15Completeness0.932 (0.652)0.984 (0.821)0.927 (0.731)Rsym1-aRsym = ΣhklΣi‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/ΣhklΣiIi, where Ii is theith measurement, and I is the weighted mean of all measurements of I.0.081 (0.20)0.081 (0.346)0.063 (0.367)I/ςI1-bI/ςI indicates the average of the intensity divided by its standard deviation.14.7 (2.2)16.1 (2.5)17.9 (1.7)Redundancy2.36.43.3Observed reflections36,595156,022167,567Unique reflections16,05422,16247,2321-a Rsym = ΣhklΣi‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/ΣhklΣiIi, where Ii is theith measurement, and I is the weighted mean of all measurements of I.1-b I/ςI indicates the average of the intensity divided by its standard deviation. Open table in a new tab The I-centered orthorhombic MPT synthase structure was solved by molecular replacement using MPT synthase in the C2 monoclinic space group (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as the search model (Protein Data Bank entry 1FM0) and the program AMORE (15Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The rotational and translational searches were performed using data in the resolution range from 8 to 4 Å, and the correct space group (I212121) was identified during the translation search. The E141Δ MoaE structure was also solved by molecular replacement using a MoaE homodimer truncated after residue 140 as the search model. The rotational and translational searches were performed with data in the resolution range from 8 to 4 Å with the program MOLREP (16Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Two of the three MoaE dimers could be located by molecular replacement, but different molecular replacement programs (AMORE, MOLREP, COMO (18Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and BEAST (19Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar)) were unable to locate the third dimer. Therefore, the resulting phase information from the two correctly positioned homodimers was used to autobuild the polypeptide chain of the third homodimer with ARP (20Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) using structure factor amplitudes to 2.15-Å resolution. ARP was able to trace 23 separate chains containing 560 residues of 834 total residues with five of these chains belonging to the third homodimer. These five chains contained 98 of a total of 280 residues. After superposition of these fragments with an intact MoaE homodimer, the third dimer could be located in the asymmetric unit. Phases were subsequently improved by 6-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging, and the resulting electron density maps were used to fit and improve all six monomers of MoaE. The orthorhombic form of MPT synthase was refined at 1.9-Å resolution, the partially activated form of MPT synthase was refined at 2.5-Å resolution, and E141Δ MoaE was refined at 2.15-Å resolution, all with the program REFMAC (21Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). Water molecules for the orthorhombic form and E141Δ MoaE were added with the program ARP, and additional solvent molecules were included manually. Incorporation of the correct side chains and building of all additional residues was accomplished with O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). For subsequent calculations, the CCP4 suite was utilized (23Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The anomalous Fourier of partially activated MPT synthase was calculated at 2.5 Å. The active site cavity volume of MPT synthase was calculated with Voidoo (24Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar) using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. To locate the sulfur atom in the MoaD thiocarboxylate, activated MPT synthase was crystallized in the monoclinic crystal form, and diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.5 Å utilizing x-rays with a wavelength of 1.5418 Å (CuKα) to improve the anomalous signal originating from sulfur atoms. The resulting anomalous Fourier map (Fig.2) indicates the position of the thiocarboxylate sulfur at the C terminus of MoaD. The peak height corresponds to ∼3.5 times the r.m.s. deviation of the map and is clearly weaker than the adjacent chloride ion and the sulfur of Met-E115. Following the earlier convention (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), residues in the MoaD and MoaE subunits will be identified with a D and E, respectively, preceding the residue number. This result was somewhat surprising, since the incorporation of the sulfur was assumed to be greater than 90% as estimated by mass spectrometry, 2M. Wuebbens, unpublished data. taking into account the time required for crystallization. At the relatively low resolution of 2.5 Å, there is neither an indication for the formation of a covalent complex nor for disorder in the MoaD C terminus, which could potentially result in the weaker than expected anomalous signal. The model was refined with a carboxylate, and a positive peak in the difference density map (Fig. 2) at a somewhat larger distance than the position of the oxygen is additional proof of the presence of the sulfur atom. The oxygen of the thiocarboxylate forms a hydrogen bond with the amino group of the side chain of Lys-E126, whereas the sulfur atom forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys-E119. The latter interaction is presumably responsible for the formation of the covalent complex between the two subunits in which the side chain of Lys-E119 is covalently linked to the MoaD C terminus via an isopeptide bond (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The formation of this covalent complex is an unwanted side reaction of MPT synthase that inactivates the enzyme and occurs on a time scale of months at 4 °C. Whereas this approach could identify the position of the thiocarboxylate sulfur, it is not inconceivable that the MoaD C terminus undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding to yield the catalytically competent state. The structure of MPT synthase in the orthorhombic crystal form was refined at 1.9-Å resolution to an R-factor of 0.175 (Rfree = 0.206) (TableII). The final model comprises residues 1–81 of the MoaD subunit and residues 2–39 and 47–150 of the MoaE subunit, 198 water molecules, 3 sulfate molecules, and 2 glycerol molecules. Residues 40–46 of MoaE are also disordered in the original structure of MPT synthase (13Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The overall quality of the resulting model was very good as corroborated by the crystallographic and free R-factors. In addition, the model has well defined stereochemistry, with 94.7% (180 residues) of all non-Pro and non-Gly residues (190 residues) in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram (25Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), one residue (Ala-D8) in generously allowed regions, and two residues (Asp-D48 and Thr-E130) in disallowed regions. Both of these residues are located in weakly defined areas in the electron density maps.Table IIRefinement statisticsI212121MoaE Δ141Resolution limits (Å)50–1.947.14–2.15Number of reflections in working set21,02444,837Data to parameter ratio2.641.77Number of protein/solvent atoms1764/2255919/400Rcryst2-aRcryst = Σhkl∥Fo‖−‖Fc∥ / Σhkl‖Fo‖, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes.0.175 (0.281)0.177 (0.237)Rfree2-bRfree same as Rcrystfor 5% of the data randomly omitted from refinement.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the orthorhombic form of MPT synthase exhibits surprising differences when compared with the monoclinic structure of MPT synthase. Comparison of the MoaD-MoaE heterodimers reveals an r.m.s. deviation of 1.1 Å after superposition of 223 equivalent C-α atoms. Substantial conformational changes are present for residues D12–D17, D21–D23, D40–D47, and E133–E150. This structural dissimilarity appears to be caused by crystal contact variations between the orthorhombic and monoclinic crystal forms. Despite this unexpected structural difference, the MoaD-MoaE interface remains essentially unchanged (Fig.3a). The buried surface area in both complexes is very similar (around 1500 Å2 in both complexes with a slightly higher number in the orthorhombic crystal form), and there are 13 strong intersubunit hydrogen bonds in each form. Comparison of the MoaD-MoaE heterotetramers results in a slightly higher r.m.s. deviation of 1.33 Å, demonstrating that MoaE dimerization, mediated in both cases by a crystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry, is slightly different between the two crystal forms. Accompanying the differences in MoaE dimerization, the buried surface area of the MoaE dimer is ∼300 Å2 larger for the dimer in the orthorhombic crystal form than for the dimer in the monoclinic crystal form. A key difference between the two MPT synthase crystal forms is the presence of a sulfate molecule (Fig. 3b) in the orthorhombic crystal form that essentially replaces a chloride (Fig. 3c) in the original monoclinic crystal form grown from very high concentrations of NaCl. Both anions are located in the same anion-binding pocket located in close proximity to the MoaD C terminus. The sulfate is stabilized by electrostatic interactions involving His-E′103 and Arg-E′104 and by three hydrogen bonds. Residues of the distal MoaE subunit are given the E′ designation. Two of these hydrogen bonds involve the side chain N-δ1 atom of His-E′103 and N-ζ1 atom of Arg-E′104 (Fig. 3b), and the third hydrogen bond is formed by the main chain amide proton of Arg-E′104. Compared with the binding pocket in the monoclinic crystal form, Arg-E39 and His-E′103 undergo significant conformational changes in their side chains. In the orthorhombic crystals, Arg-E39 is oriented away from the anion and points toward the solvent, whereas His-E′103 rotates around the Cα–Cβ bond to make more room for the larger sulfate residue and to facilitate a hydrogen bond of this residue with its N-δ1 nitrogen atom. A total of three data sets for the orthorhombic crystal form of MPT synthase were collected, including an initial data set at 2.6 Å. Attempts to soak 6,7-dimethyltetrahydrobiopterin or guanine into these crystals produced data sets with resolutions of 2.3 and 1.9 Å, respectively. Careful analysis of the resulting electron density maps did not support binding of either added compound to the enzyme. However, in all three data sets, a consistent electron density feature was observed near the side chain of Arg-E140 in a pocket in close proximity to the bound sulfate (Fig. 3d). Since this residual density could not be modeled with any of the buffer components, it most likely represents substoichiometric amounts of bound substrate and/or product. If compound Z and/or MPT were indeed bound in a similar orientation, their pterin moieties would be inserted deeply into the binding pocket present near the MoaD C terminus (Fig.4). The volume of this cavity is ∼180 Å3, a size sufficient to accommodate the pterin moiety of either precursor Z or MPT. With the exception of the partially conserved Arg-E140 residue, none of the residues surrounding this pterin binding site are conserved. Instead, main chain atoms originating from three different regions of the polypeptide chains (residues E119–E120, E138–E139, and the MoaD C terminus) are the most likely partners for hydrogen-bonded interactions with the polar atoms of the pterin. The structure of the truncated MoaE homodimer (E141Δ MoaE) was solved by molecular replacement in combination with automated density interpretation with ARP. The six monomers (labeled A–F) in the asymmetric unit are organized into three dimers. The difficulties in locating the third dimer by molecular replacement techniques are presumably due to the fact that the atoms in this dimer have considerably higher average B-factors (by 13 Å2), and their contribution to the scattering is consequently reduced. Five of the six MoaE monomers show disordered C termini variably starting at residues 127–129, but one monomer (d-chain) shows interpretable density up to Arg-140, the last residue present in the protein. In contrast to both structures of intact MPT synthase, the residues in the disordered loop region from positions 40–47 are somewhat less flexible in the deletion mutant. In the B-subunit, all residues in this region could be tentatively modeled, and these residues form a loop structure that partially conceals the active site. In two of the other subunits, additional residues (compared with the two MPT synthase structures) are visible, but a gap still exists. The structure of E141Δ MoaE was refined to anR-factor of 0.177 (Rfree of 0.227) including all working data to 2.15-Å resolution (Table II). The overall quality of the model is very good, as corroborated by the crystallographic and free R-factors. In addition, the model has 95.4% (585 of 613 non-Pro and non-Gly residues) in the most favored regions, 0.3% (His-41 in the B-chain and Ala-122 in the E-chain) in generously allowed regions, and 0.2%"

Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). All these activities are elicited primarily through the heparan sulfate (HS) chains at the cell surface. The high degree of structural diversity observed in these HS chains is believed to impart the specificity of function of these macromolecules. Such diversity of structure is imposed by tightly regulated patterns of sulfation and epimerization upon the basic polysaccharide backbone during synthesis within the Golgi (2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5Gallagher J.T. Walker A. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Highly regulated HS synthesis permits HSPGs to accomplish their distinct biological roles, such as basic FGF binding and activation, which are mediated through specific sequences within the chains (6Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and which can be markedly modulated by the physiological degradation of HS in vivo (7Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Recently, HSPGs have been shown to regulate signaling by many diverse growth factors, including FGFs, members of the TGF-β superfamily, Wg/Wnt, heparin-binding-EGF, and hepatocyte growth factor through HS (reviewed in Refs. 4Bernfield M.

Thus, the HS chains are believed to be the principal determinants of the binding and regulatory activity of HSPGs on the external surface of the plasma membrane. Syndecans are a major family of four kinds of transmembrane HSPGs (4Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar,10Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian syndecans are similar in primary sequence in the cytoplasmic and membrane-spanning regions, but the extracellular domains (ectodomains) are largely non-homologous. According to the chromosomal localization, exon organization, and sequence relationships with Drosophila syndecan, the syndecan gene is thought to have arisen by gene duplication and divergent evolution from a single ancestral gene and that syndecan-1 and -3 and syndecan-2 and -4 comprise separate subfamilies (14Bernfield M. Hinkes M.T. Gallo R.L. Dev. Suppl. 1993; : 205-212PubMed Google Scholar). These members of the syndecan family are expressed in distinct cell-, tissue-, and developmental stage-specific patterns (15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It suggests that each syndecan family member may have distinct functions (17Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), although some shared activities of, for example syndecan-1 and -4, have been observed (4Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar,11Carey D.J. Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus far, evidence from knock-out mice indicates that no critical step in development depends on a specific syndecan gene. Syndecan-1 and -4 promote intercellular adhesion following their transfection into human B lymphoid cells, suggesting that both of them are important mediators of this event (20Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both syndecan-1 and -4 are induced during wound repair, but their cellular localization is different (21Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting that although both are involved in the wound healing process their functions may be dissimilar. Kinnunen et al. describe a unique role for syndecan-3 in the binding and activity of heparin-binding growth-associated molecule at E11 in the rat rhomboencephalon during neurite outgrowth (22Kinnunen A. Kinnunen T. Kaksonen M. Nolo R. Panula P. Rauvala H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 635-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), while syndecan-4 has a distinctive role in the generation and maintenance of focal adhesion complexes (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 24Woods A. Couchman J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and in signal transmission during dendritic process formation (25Yamashita Y. Oritani K. Miyoshi E.K. Wall R. Bernfield M. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5940-5948PubMed Google Scholar). The ectodomains of all syndecans may be shed intact by proteolytic cleavage of the core protein in a site adjacent to the plasma membrane. Proteolytic activity causes the release of syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains in acute human dermal wound fluids (26Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) where they modify the protease/antiprotease balance (27Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11563-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the shedding of syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains is regulated by multiple signaling pathways and mediated by a TIMP-3-sensitive cell surface metalloproteinase (28Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Although it is well documented that these molecules may display sometimes similar and sometimes very different biological activities, it is unclear whether it is the protein core component or the GAG chains of these proteoglycans that are the major determinants of differences in biological activity between syndecan family members. Comparative structural and functional analyses of the HS chains on syndecan-1 and -4 have not been undertaken to date. In the present study we describe such analyses on HS chains that were prepared simultaneously from the same cell type, namely NMuMG (normal murine mammary gland epithelium), and show that HS of syndecan-1 and -4 have highly similar, fine structural profiles and ligand-binding activities. These data provide further insights into the regulation of HS biosynthesis within a particular cell population. The findings indicate that heparan sulfate structure, although highly dependent upon cell type, appears to display very little variability within the syndecan population of an individual cell type (in this instance NMuMG), an observation that may have notable implications in the understanding of the biological roles of glycosaminoglycan chains. Na235SO4(carrier-free, -specific activity, 1200–1400 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum, heparinase, heparin lyase, EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned), and heparinase III/heparitinase (F. heparinum; heparitin-sulfate lyase, EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Aberdeen, UK). Chondroitin ABC lyase (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4) was obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Sodium chloride (HiPerSolv grade) for HPLC and all other analytical grade reagents were supplied from BDH-Merck Ltd. (Lutterworth, Leics, UK). Ultra-pure water (resistance 18 megohms) for all HPLC analysis was dispensed from a Milli-Q water system (Millipore, UK). Bio-Gel P-6 (fine grade) was from Bio-Rad (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). ProPac PA-1 analytical columns were purchased from Dionex (Camberley, Surrey, UK). Sepharose CL-6B was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Low-melting point agarose (SeaPlaque) and Gelbond were from FMC Corp. Bioproducts (Rockland, ME). Type I collagen from rat tail was from BD Biosciences. FGF-2 was from Intergen Co. (Purchase, NY). Antibodies specific to syndecan ectodomains included monoclonal antibodies 281–2 against the mouse syndecan-1 ectodomain (29Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), KY/8.2 against the mouse syndecan-4 ectodomain (25Yamashita Y. Oritani K. Miyoshi E.K. Wall R. Bernfield M. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5940-5948PubMed Google Scholar), and polyclonal antisera MSE-4 against the recombinant syndecan-4 ectodomain (17Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal antibody 281–2 directed against the mouse syndecan-1 core protein was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B and used as described previously (15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal antibody KY/8.2 against the mouse syndecan-4 conjugated Sepharose 4B was prepared and used. The 281–2 antibody was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA), and the KY/8.2 monoclonal was kindly supplied by Dr. P. W. Kincade (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). NMuMG cells were cultured as described previously (30David G. Van der Schueren B. Bernfield M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 719-728PubMed Google Scholar). Early passage (20Stanley M.J. Liebersbach B.F. Liu W. Anhalt D.J. Sanderson R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5077-5083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) of NMuMG cells was used for all the experiments. To purify labeled syndecan-1 and -4, the NMuMG cells were labeled by 35S in conditions as described previously (15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured NMuMG cells were stained by 281–2 for syndecan-1 and by MSE-4 (affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse syndecan-4) or KY/8.2 for syndecan-4. We used Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody (minimal cross-react to rabbit; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (minimal cross-react to rat; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) as a second antibody on commercially recommended conditions. Immunolabeled cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Photographs were taken using Kodak Tri-X pan film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 10 differently prepared cells and gave reproducible results. A control for nonspecific staining omitted the primary antibody. No staining was observed in control samples. To prepare the extracellular domains of syndecan-1 and -4, the conditioned media of NMuMG was used (15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After anion exchange chromatography, the samples were applied to density gradient centrifugation, and the fractions whose specific gravity were more than 1.35 g/ml were collected. Syndecan-1 and -4 were purified by using 281–2 and KY/8.2 affinity columns, respectively. To purify the labeled syndecan-1 and -4, mildly treated trypsinate was also used (15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the following HS structural and affinity co-electrophoresis analyses, the labeled samples were digested by chondroitin ABC lyase before the affinity chromatography. Proteoglycans were dissolved in 500 μl of distilled water containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS (Sigma) and then subjected to eliminative cleavage and reduction by adjusting to 100 mm NaOH/1m NaBH4 for 24 h at 37 °C. After neutralizing samples by dropwise addition of 1 m HCl, free HS chains were recovered by separation on a Sepharose CL-6B column (1 × 97 cm) eluting in phosphate-buffered saline at a flow-rate of 10 ml/h and collecting 1-ml fractions. Radioactivity in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The void volume (Vo, fraction 25) and total volume (Vt, fraction 63) of the column were established using Dextran Blue and sodium dichromate, respectively. Aliquots of 7000 cpm (35S) each of syndecan-1 and -4 HS chains were adjusted to 50 mm sodium acetate/0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0, before addition of 20 mIU/ml each of heparinase I, II and III in a total volume of 100 μl or less. Samples were incubated for 4 h at 25 °C followed by a second addition of the same amount of enzymes and incubation for a further 24 h at 25 °C. Each digest was then diluted to 1 ml with distilled water adjusted to pH 3.5 by addition of HCl before application to a ProPac PA-1 strong-anion exchange (SAX) column (4.6 mm × 25 cm, Dionex UK) attached to a gradient HPLC pump (Dionex, Surrey, UK). Disaccharides were eluted in a gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl, pH 3.5, over 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, collecting 0.5-ml fractions (31Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting, and disaccharides were identified by comparison with unlabeled disaccharide standards of known composition that were monitored by on-line UV absorption at A232 nm. Recoveries of radio-labeled sample were typically between 85–95%. Very little radioactivity was detected after elution of the most sulfated disaccharide, indicating almost complete depolymerization of GAG chains. Aliquots of 7000cpm (35S) each of syndecan-1 or -4 in distilled water containing 0.1% CHAPS were adjusted to 50 mm sodium acetate/0.5 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0 before addition of 40 mIU/ml of either heparinase I or heparinase III (heparitinase) and incubation at 25 °C for 24 h. Additionally, similar aliquots were subjected to low pH nitrous acid cleavage (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) for 20 min, followed by neutralization by dropwise addition of 2m sodium carbonate. The resulting oligosaccharide digestion products from the above treatments were then resolved by size exclusion chromatography on either a Bio-Gel P-6 column (1 × 106 cm, eluted at 3 ml/h in 0.1 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate) or on a Sepharose CL-6B column (as described above), collecting 1 ml fractions. Peaks of radioactivity were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Additional digests, containing 13,000 cpm each of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4, were undertaken in which the resulting oligosaccharides were then analyzed on a ProPac PA-1 SAX-HPLC column eluted with a gradient of 0–1.2 m NaCl, pH 3.5, over 90 min at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min and collecting 0.5-ml fractions for liquid scintillation counting. Recoveries for the above were typically above 85% of added material. NMuMG cells were labeled with radio-sulfate, and the [35S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomain from conditioned medium was purified as described above. HS chains from syndecan-1 and -4 were released by incubation with 0.5 m NaOH and 1 mNaBH4 for 16 h at 4 °C. Binding of each ectodomain or HS chains to type I collagen and FGF-2 was assessed by ACE as described elsewhere (15Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kainulainen V. Wang H. Schick C. Bernfield M. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1% (w/v) low-melt agarose gels were cast containing distinct lanes with various concentrations of type I collagen (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 nm, assuming that the molecular mass of type I collagen is 300 kDa) or FGF-2 (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 nm). [35S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 and -4 (12,500 cpm) was electrophoresed through these lanes. The migration on syndecan-1 and -4 was detected on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The pixel intensities were integrated and used to determine the migration distance of the major peak of 35S-labeled syndecan-1 and -4 in each lane. These mobilities were plotted as a function of ligand concentration and used to estimate the apparentKd values as described earlier (33Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Histochemical analysis was performed on the cultured NMuMG cells to investigate the simultaneous expressions of syndecan-1 and -4. For this purpose, we used 281–2 monoclonal and MSE-4 polyclonal antibodies to detect syndecan-1 and -4, respectively (Fig.1). Syndecan-1 was expressed at the cell surfaces of NMuMG cells uniformly as shown previously (34Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2683-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 35Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Jalkanen M. Firestone J. Trelstad R.L. Bernfield M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), while the focal expression of syndecan-4 was seen at the extracellular matrix regions as previously shown by Woods and Couchman (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 expressed rather strongly along the cell-cell interaction regions, whereas the syndecan-4 was expressed faintly. No signals were detected on the cells stained by second antibodies alone (data not shown). We also performed the immunohistochemical staining of syndecan-4 on the NMuMG cells using KY/8.2 monoclonal antibody that we used for the purification of syndecan-4 for the following analyses. KY/8.2 monoclonal antibody also showed the focal expression of syndecan-4. These results indicate that syndecan-1 and -4 are co-expressed in NMuMG, albeit with spatially different distributions. Therefore, metabolically labeled syndecan-1 and -4 were purified from these cells for HS structural analyses. NMuMG cells that were taken at 50% confluence were metabolically radiolabeled for 48 h with35SO4. Radiolabeled syndecan-1 and -4 were purified from the radiolabeled conditioned medium and cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HS chains from syndecan-1 and -4 were produced by alkali borohydride eliminative cleavage from the respective proteoglycans and then applied to Sepharose CL-6B column to compare the relative sizes of the HS chains (Fig. 2). The resulting HS chains for both syndecan-1 and -4 HS displayed a unimodal distribution with aKav of 0.35, which corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼40 kilodaltons (according to the calibration of Ref.36Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). No detectable difference in average chain length or distribution, therefore, could be established between the HS derived from syndecan-1 compared with syndecan-4 by this method. The void volume (Vo, fraction 25) and total volume (Vt, fraction 63) of the column were established using Dextran Blue and sodium dichromate, respectively. The HS chains from both syndecans were individually subjected to low pH nitrous acid degradation, which results in specific scission at N-sulfated disaccharides with the concomitant loss of the N-sulfate groups (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In these35S-labeled HS preparations, wherever N-sulfated disaccharides are situated consecutively within the chain, nitrous acid digestion will result in the liberation of disaccharides and free [35S]sulfate. When N-sulfated disaccharides are interspersed by disaccharides containingN-acetylated glucosamine residues (which are resistant to attack by nitrous acid) fragments larger than disaccharides will be generated, but with a 35S-label these will be visible only if they contain additional O-sulfates. The size of resistant oligosaccharides will be a reflection of the number of consecutive N-acetylated disaccharides possessed by that oligosaccharide. Fig. 3 indicates that there is a close association between N- and O-sulfation, which is a characteristic feature of HS. Approximately 89 and 90% of the radiolabel from syndecan-1 and -4, respectively, is represented in the above peak. The remainder of the sulfates, i.e. O-sulfates are located in alternating sequences, represented by peaks of radioactivity corresponding to tetrasaccharides, and containing 11 and 10% of the total incorporated [35S]sulfate for syndecans-1 and -4, respectively. Larger, sulfated oligosaccharides are not observed, demonstrating that in both HS species, there is a strong linkage between N- and O-sulfates, such thatO-sulfates do not appear to occur more than one disaccharide away from an N-sulfate. Heparinase III (heparitinase) can cleave only at unsulfated hexuronic acid (HexUA) (glucuronic acid (GlcUA) or iduronic acid (IdoUA)) residues, especially if there are relatively few SO4 groups on the adjacent residues. Heparinase III largely cleaves HS at hexosaminidic linkages to glucuronic acid residues (GlcN(NS or NAc, ±6S)-GlcUA) (37Linhardt R.J. Turnbull J.E. Wang H.M. Loganathan D. Gallagher J.T.

Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A.

Yamada S. Khoo K.H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) but with reduced efficiency. The samples of digested syndecan-1 and -4 were subjected to heparinase III digestion and then applied to a Bio-Gel P-6 chromatography to assess the distribution and ratios of the resulting oligosaccharides. Fig.4 illustrates the profiles of heparinase III-resistant fragments derived from both syndecan-1 and -4 heparan sulfates. This approach revealed no significant structural differences between the two HS species under investigation, with both displaying a similar pattern of resistant fragments ranging in size from disaccharide (dp2) to around tetradecasaccharide (dp14) in very similar proportions (Table I). Minor variations in the proportional spread of radiolabel among the resistant fragments of this digest may reflect incomplete enzymic scission at a small proportion of its potential cleavage sites. The small peals of radioactivity between fractions 84 and 85 arose due to partial resolution of the disaccharides into lower and higher sulfated constituents.

https://openalex.org/W1978560699,"Mot1 is an essential Snf2/Swi2-relatedSaccharomyces cerevisiae protein that binds the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and removes TBP from DNA using ATP hydrolysis. Mot1 functions in vivo both as a repressor and as an activator of transcription. Mot1 catalysis of TBP·DNA disruption is consistent with its function as a repressor, but the Mot1 mechanism of activation is unknown. To better understand the physiologic role of Mot1 and its enzymatic mechanism, MOT1mutants were generated and tested for activity in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrate a close correlation between the TBP·DNA disruption activity of Mot1 and its essentialin vivo function. Previous results demonstrated a large overlap in the gene sets controlled by Mot1 and NC2. Mot1 and NC2 can co-occupy TBP·DNA in vitro, and NC2 binding does not impair Mot1-catalyzed disruption of the complex. Residues on the DNA-binding surface of TBP are important for Mot1 binding and the Mot1·TBP binary complex binds very poorly to DNA and does not dissociate in the presence of ATP. However, the binary complex binds DNA well in the presence of the transition state analog ADP-AlF4. A model for Mot1 action is proposed in which ATP hydrolysis causes the Mot1 N terminus to displace the TATA box, leading to ejection of Mot1 and TBP from DNA.

TBP recruitment and activity are influenced by a large number of transcription factors and components of the general transcription machinery, many of which can interact directly with TBP (3Maldonado E.

Consistent with its function as a repressor, Mot1 was isolated independently as an ATP-dependent factor that disrupts the TBP·DNA complex (12Auble D.T. Hahn S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA, Mot1 also dimerizes with TBP (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T.

In this report, we refer to the Mot1·TBP complex as the “binary” complex, and the Mot1·TBP·DNA complex is referred to as the “ternary” complex. Mot1 homologs have been identified in many eukaryotes. The human homolog is BTAF1, which interacts with TBP (16van der Knaap J.A. Borst J.W. van der Vliet P.C. Gentz R. Timmers H.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), may interact with TBP or TBP-related factor 1 (TRF1) in vitro (19Adamkewicz J.I. Hansen K.E. Prud'homme W.A. Davis J.L. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11883-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Mot1 C terminus contains the conserved ATPase domain (7Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas the Mot1 N terminus is responsible for TBP binding (19Adamkewicz J.I. Hansen K.E.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7523-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structural basis for Mot1·TBP recognition is unknown, however, it was recently suggested that the Mot1 N terminus contains HEAT or ARM repeats, which compose a class of structurally related leucine-rich repeats (22Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 23Andrade M.A. Ponting C.P. Gibson T.J. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 521-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Neuwald A.F. Hirano T. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that HEAT and ARM repeats form two α helices joined by a short loop (ARM repeats have a short additional α helix), and these can stack upon each other to form a “superhelix” that provides an extensive surface for macromolecular interaction (22Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Previous analysis of Mot1 deletion mutants indicated that an extended portion of the Mot1 N terminus is responsible for recognition of TBP (19Adamkewicz J.I. Hansen K.E. Prud'homme W.A. Davis J.L. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11883-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that, in solution, Mot1 is a non-globular monomer (15Adamkewicz J.I. Mueller C.G. Hansen K.E. Prud'homme W.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21158-21168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest a model in which Mot1 adopts an extended conformation that provides a large surface for interaction with TBP. To test the model, mutations were made in both Mot1 and TBP, and the effects on the Mot1·TBP interaction were determined. Because HEAT and ARM repeats are based mostly on hydrophobic interactions (22Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Muller C.W. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), it was expected that most polar residues in the N-terminal domain would not be essential, which we have found to be the case. Mot1 is a member of the Snf2/Swi2 ATPase family (25Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 26Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 291-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that at least some Snf2/Swi2 ATPases are processive molecular motors, acting by driving DNA translocation or rotation (28Havas K. Flaus A. Phelan M. Kingston R. Wade P.A. Lilley D.M. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. 2000; 103: 1133-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29Cote J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The Mot1·TBP·DNA system has been used to test several theories about how these ATPases drive changes in protein·DNA interactions. Mot1 is not a helicase (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Poon D. Campbell A.M. Bai Y. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23135-23140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Adamkewicz J.I. Mueller C.G. Hansen K.E. Prud'homme W.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21158-21168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), nor does it travel long distances on DNA after TBP is removed from the TATA box (30Auble D.T. Steggerda S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Catalysis of TBP·DNA disruption requires a grip by Mot1 on both upstream DNA and TBP, although the upstream DNA and the TBP·DNA complex can be conformationally uncoupled without impairing catalysis (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Mot1 does not dissociate TBP·DNA by propagation of DNA twist or writhe through the TATA box. A similar result has been reported for the Snf2/Swi2 family member ISWI (31Langst G. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1085-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is possible that Mot1 interacts with the TATA box directly and in so doing alters its structure or that Mot1 uses ATP hydrolysis to disrupt TBP·DNA complexes via short-range tracking or ATP-driven insertion of Mot1 into the TBP·DNA interface. Alternatively, Mot1 may mediate TBP·DNA disruption by inducing a conformational change in TBP that deforms the DNA-binding surface of TBP. Here we demonstrate that residues on the DNA-binding surface of TBP impair the interaction of TBP with Mot1, suggesting that Mot1 contacts the DNA-binding surface of TBP, and explaining why the Mot1·TBP binary complex binds DNA poorly compared with TBP alone. Binding of an ATP transition state analog locks the binary complex into a form in which the Mot1·TBP complex can bind DNA better than the nucleotide-free form of the Mot1·TBP complex. These results suggest that ATP hydrolysis causes a change in either the conformation of TBP or the interaction of Mot1 with the DNA-binding surface of TBP and that these ATP-driven conformational changes explain how Mot1 drives disruption of the TBP·DNA complex. Oligonucleotide primers flanking the EcoRI site (bp position 1026 in theMOT1 open reading frame (ORF)) and ClaI site (position 2092) were used to amplify ∼1 kb of the MOT1 ORF using Taq polymerase under reduced fidelity conditions as described previously (32Leung D.W. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified DNA was digested withEcoRI and ClaI and cloned into anEcoRI-ClaI-gapped plasmid containing the rest of the MOT1 ORF under control of the GAL1 promoter on a CEN ARS plasmid bearing the LEU2 gene (20Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Note that an additional ClaI site is present in theMOT1 ORF, but this second site is blocked fromClaI digestion by overlapping dam methylation. Six independent transformants were picked at random from the bacterial transformation of the primary ligation mix, and these were sequenced and found to contain ∼1-bp change per kilobase (kb) of amplified DNA. Bacterial transformants containing the mutated DNA were then scrapeden masse from agar plates, inoculated at high density into liquid media, and used in a large-scale plasmid purification prep. The resulting purified plasmids were then used to transform yeast strain AY29 (mot1Δ::TRP1, carrying plasmid pMR13 (MOT1+ URA3+)) (20Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which is otherwise congenic to YPH499 (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by selection on synthetic complete media containing glucose but without leucine using standard techniques (34Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 194Google Scholar). Approximately 13,000 transformants were replica-plated to synthetic glucose- or galactose-containing media lacking leucine and incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Comparison of the glucose and galactose-containing plates did not reveal any GAL1-inducible alleles ofMOT1, which caused slow growth in the presence of wild-typeMOT1. Colonies were then replica-plated from galactose-containing media to media containing galactose and 5-fluoroorotic acid (34Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 194Google Scholar) to select for loss of theURA3-marked plasmid containing the wild-type MOT1gene. Approximately half of the transformants did not survive the 5-fluoroorotic acid selection, indicating that these strains harbored alleles of MOT1, which do not support growth in the absence of wild-type MOT1. The remaining viable strains were screened for temperature-sensitive growth defects by replica plating to synthetic galactose plates minus leucine and incubation at 30 °C and 35 °C. Temperature-sensitive strains were re-streaked, and the plasmids were isolated and re-transformed to the MOT1deletion strain to confirm the plasmid-linked temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype. Candidate genes were then sequenced through the entire EcoRI-ClaI region of the ORF, and the mutant fragments were subcloned to a new plasmid backbone containing the remainder of the MOT1 gene to be sure that mutations in the EcoRI-ClaI DNA fragment were responsible for the phenotypes observed. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using synthetic oligonucleotides and either overlapping PCR or the Stratagene QuikChange kit, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Each mutation was engineered to encode a change in a restriction site (either introduction of a new site or loss of an existing site) to facilitate subcloning. Candidate transformants containing the correct restriction sites were then sequenced completely in a region that overlaps a DNA fragment with convenient restriction sites. The sequenced DNA fragment was then sub-cloned to LEU2 CEN ARS plasmids derived from pRS315 (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contain theMOT1 ORF driven by the GAL1 promoter or by a 448-bp fragment of the MOT1 promoter. All constructs encode a Mot1 derivative with the Py tag (35Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) appended to the N terminus to facilitate quantitation by Western blotting and purification using antibody-coupled beads (20Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Additional details regarding plasmid construction are available upon request. Plasmids containing the site-directed alleles were transformed into AY29 yeast cells (see above), and the ability of the constructs to support viability was assessed by plasmid shuffling using standard techniques (34Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 194Google Scholar). Strains harboring alleles under control of the MOT1 promoter were analyzed for growth defects on synthetic media without leucine and containing raffinose, galactose, or glucose as the carbon source. Strains harboring alleles under control of the GAL1 promoter were streaked to galactose-containing plates to induce expression prior to plasmid shuffling. Growth of strains was compared with congenic wild-type cells by incubation at 16 °C, 30 °C, 32 °C, and 35 °C. Recombinant full-length TBP and TBP mutants expressed under the control of the T7 promoter as a fusion with N-terminal six-histidine tag were obtained by transformation of BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells with the appropriate plasmid expression vectors (13Darst R.P.

Cells were inoculated into 1 liter of yeast extract Tryptone (YT) media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin or 30 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C and were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7–1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (0.5 mm final concentration), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow protein expression. Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer I (40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm benzamidine, 2 μm pepstatin, 0.6 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml chymostatin) containing 5 mm imidazole and lysed by sonication. After sonication, the cleared lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer I, which included 5 mm imidazole. The mixture was then loaded into a column, and the resin was washed with 10 ml buffer I plus 5 mmimidazole and subsequently with 5 ml of buffer I containing 20 mm imidazole. Finally, the bound protein was eluted with buffer I containing 200 mm imidazole. The yield was quantitated by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the purity was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining of 10% protein gels. Based on the Coomassie Blue staining, the proteins were estimated to be about 90% pure. For detection of TBP by native gel electrophoresis (Figs. 6C, 6D, and7B), full-length TBP and Mot1 were incubated in binding buffer (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) containing 120 mm KCl and 12 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.6 (37Banik U. Beechem J.M. Klebanow E. Schroeder S. Weil P.A. J. Biol.

The gels in Figs. 6C and7B were run with the electrodes reversed: samples were loaded on the side of the positive electrode, and run toward the negative electrode. The gel was, however, pre-run for >50 min with the electrodes connected in the usual fashion before loading. Following electrophoresis, the gels were boiled in 1% SDS for 1 min, then transferred to Immobilon and TBP was detected using TBP antiserum. The TBE gel shift assay in Fig. 8A was performed as described previously (38Cang Y. Auble D.T. Prelich G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were otherwise performed as described previously (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using 5 nm core domain TBP (gift of J. Geiger) or full-length TBP with minor modifications as indicated. Synthesis and labeling of the 36- and 17-bp DNAs, and preparation of the radiolabeled 100-bp adenovirus major late promoter fragment, was as previously described (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA concentration was about 0.5 nm in the reactions. The concentration of Mot1 needed to bind 50% of the TBP·DNA complex is ∼5 nm (13Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The concentration of Mot1 used was estimated from this activity and is indicated in the figure legends. ATP was used at between 5 and 100 μm. ADP was used at 100 μm. NaF was used at 2.5 mm. AlCl3 was used at 10 μm(39Maruta S. Henry G.D. Sykes B.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7093-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bur6 was used at 13 nm and Ydr1/Ncb2 at 60 nm (38Cang Y. Auble D.T. Prelich G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); both proteins were a gift of G. Prelich.Figure 7ATP transition state analog facilitates binding of Mot1·TBP complex to DNA. A, gel mobility shift assay using radiolabeled 0.5 nm TATA DNA and 5 nm TBP. Approximately 40 nm Mot1, 5 μm ATP, and ADP-AlF4 (see “Materials and Methods”) were added where indicated. Orders of addition of DNA, TBP, Mot1, ATP, and ADP-AlF4 are indicated. In the first incubation (“Added 1st”), components were incubated for 30 min. Additional components were then added as indicated (“Added 2nd”), and the reactions were incubated for 30 min and loaded onto the gel. ATP was added 10 min after AlCl3 in lane 13. The position of the Mot1·TBP·DNA ternary complex is marked “3o.” Phosphorimaging analysis showed that the ternary complex band inlane 6 obtained after preincubation of Mot1 and TBP is only 10% the intensity of the ternary complex band in lane 3. The ternary complex bands in lanes 5 and 8 are both 50% the intensity of the ternary complex band in lane 3, indicating 50% loss of the ternary complex in the presence of ADP-AlF4, but that ADP-AlF4 completely restores the ability of pre-formed Mot1·TBP complexes to bind to DNA.B, Mot1 alone (lane 1), TBP alone (lanes 2, 3, and 7) or TBP plus Mot1 (lanes 4–6) were incubated in the absence (lanes 1,4, and 7) or presence of ATP (lanes 3and 6) or ADP-AlF4 (lanes 2 and 5). Proteins were incubated with ATP or ADP-AlF4for a total of 30 min. In reactions with both Mot1 and TBP, Mot1 was incubated with ATP or ADP-AlF4 for 20 min, followed by addition of TBP for 10 min. The reactions were loaded onto non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed as in Fig.6C. Following electrophoresis, Western analysis was performed to detect TBP. The position of TBP is shown. Mot1 and TBP were used at 50 nm, ATP was 100 μm, and ADP-AlF4 was used as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 8Mot1 binds and disrupts the TBP·NC2·DNA complex. A, gel mobility shift analysis using a Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) native gel, 0.5 nmradiolabeled TATA DNA, and 5 nm TBP. The positions of the various complexes are indicated by the arrows. Mot1 (5 nm) and NC2 (composed of Bur6, 13 nm, and Ydr1/Ncb2, 60 nm) were added where indicated. B, gel mobility shift analysis using a Tris-glycine (TG) native gel was performed using radiolabeled TATA DNA, TBP, Mot1, and NC2 as inA. The bracket in lane 3 marks the Mot1·TBP·DNA shift, which was not discrete in this experiment. Theasterisk indicates the distinct Mot1·NC2·TBP·DNA shift.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mot1 was expressed and purified from yeast using antibody-coupled beads exactly as described previously (20Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The antibody-coupled beads were prepared using Py monoclonal antibody that recognizes the Mot1 epitope tag (20Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which was prepared at the University of Virginia Lymphocyte Culture Center. For detection of TBP binding to immobilized Mot1, Mot1-coupled beads were equilibrated with buffer T-60 (30 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1% Brij-58, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors plus 60 mm potassium chloride). One hundred nanograms of full-length recombinant yeast TBP (or TBP mutant) was added in 500 μl of buffer T-60, and the reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After binding, the unbound material was collected and the beads were washed with buffer T containing increasing concentrations of KCl; samples marked “Eluate” were collected in T-1000. The eluted proteins were precipitated with acetone, and TBP present in the eluates was detected by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-TBP antisera. One-liter cultures of DH10B bacterial cells containing plasmid pGEX-1 (Amersham Biosciences) or a plasmid expressing GST fused to full-length yeast TBP (kindly provided by Ron Reeder) were grown in YT medium at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7–1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (1.0 mm, final concentration), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of buffer T (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 μm pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 150 mm KCl (T-150 buffer). Cells were lysed by sonication, and debris was removed by centrifugation. After centrifugation, 0.5 ml of GST lysate or 1.5 ml of GST-TBP lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose equilibrated with buffer T containing 60 mm KCl (T-60). The agarose was washed three times with 1 ml of T-150 buffer, and the entire 20-μl sample of agarose-bound material was used for testing the binding of Mot1. 10 ng of the eluted Mot1 protein obtained from yeast overexpression strains (see above) was added to a 20-μl suspension of GST or GST-TBP agarose in T-60 buffer and incubated on a roller for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose was washed once with 0.6 ml of T-60 buffer, then an elution step was carried out with 0.6 ml of T-60 buffer with 5 mmMgCl2, with or without 50 μm ATP and with or without 1 nm TATA sequence DNA. Eluted proteins were precipitated with acetone for analysis by Western blotting using the Py antibody (35Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which recognizes the N-terminal epitope tag. Blocks of conserved sequences in the Mot1 N terminus were identified with a set of Mot1 homologs found in Entrez protein sequence data bank (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Protein) (from Homo sapiens (accession number AAC04573), Arabidopsis thaliana (T47857), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (P32333),Schizosaccharomyces pombe (T40642), and Drosophila melanogaster (AAF55260)) using the MACAW (40Schuler G.D.

We observed sequence similarity of the second B block HEAT repeat to sequences immediately downstream using MACAW. This had not been found in the original sequence analysis, and Fig.1B therefore includes an additional HEAT repeat in the B block, for a total of six. Alignment of Mot1 homologs revealed conserved blocks outside of the ATPase, which we designate A–D (Fig. 1A). These blocks were not found in any protein except Mot1 or its homologs. The A and B blocks in the human and yeast proteins are about 40% identical. For example, Fig. 1B shows the sequence of theS. cerevisiae Mot1 A block; the asterisksindicate residues th"
https://openalex.org/W2029918942,"The transferrin receptor of Neisseria meningitidis is composed of the transmembrane protein TbpA and the outer membrane protein TbpB. Both receptor proteins have the capacity to independently bind their ligand human transferrin (htf). To elucidate the specific role of these proteins in receptor function, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the interaction between purified TbpA, TbpB or the entire receptor (TbpA + TbpB) with holo- and apo-htf. The entire receptor was shown to contain a single high affinity htf-binding site on TbpA and approximately two lower affinity binding sites on TbpB. The binding sites appear to be independent. Purified TbpA was shown to have strong ligand preference for apo-htf, whereas TbpA in the receptor complex with TbpB preferentially binds the holo form of htf. The orientation of the ligand specificity of TbpA toward holo-htf is proposed to be the physiological function of TbpB. Furthermore, the thermodynamic mode of htf binding by TbpB of isotypes I and II was shown to be different. A protocol for the generation of active, histidine-tagged TbpB as well as its individual N- and C-terminal domains is presented. Both domains are shown to strongly interact with each other, and isothermal titration calorimetry and circular dichroism experiments provide clear evidence for this interaction causing conformational changes.

The proteins that form the transferrin receptor of Neisseria meningitidis are promising candidates for inclusion in such a vaccine (2Gorringe A.R. Borrow R. Fox A.J. Robinson A. Vaccine. 1995; 13: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The receptor consists of two types of subunits, TbpA and TbpB (transferrin-binding proteinsA and B), both of which have the capacity to independently bind their ligand, human transferrin (htf)1 (3Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TbpA (100 kDa) is thought to be a porin-like integral membrane protein that is proposed to serve as channel for the transport of iron across the outer membrane. TbpA shares sequence similarities with FepA and FhuA (4Legrain M. Mazarin V. Irwin S.W. Bouchon B. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Jacobs E. Schryvers A.B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Both proteins have been shown to form an antiparallel β-barrel (5Buchanan S.K. Smith B.S. Venkatramani L. Xia D. Esser L.

Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). TbpB (65–85 kDa) is considered to be an outer membrane protein that is anchored to the membrane via the lipidated N-terminal part of the protein (8Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 9Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B.

Schryvers A.B. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 24: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,11Boulton I.C. Gorringe A.R. Carr R.J. Gorinsky B. Joannou C.L. Evans R.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).A sequence alignment of all currently available N. meningitidis TbpB sequences reveals the presence of two different isotypes (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both isotypes differ in their molecular masses: isotype I proteins (such as strain B16B6) have molecular masses of ∼68 kDa, whereas isotype II proteins (such as strain M982) are characterized by molecular masses of ∼80–90 kDa (13Rokbi B. Mazarin V. Maitre-Wilmotte G. Quentin-Millet M.-J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These differences are caused by large sequence inserts predominantly in the C-terminal part of isotype II proteins (4Legrain M. Mazarin V. Irwin S.W. Bouchon B. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Jacobs E. Schryvers A.B. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TbpB sequences from other bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (8Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) orMoraxella catarrhalis (14Myers L.E. Yang Y.-P. Du R.-P. Wang Q. Harkness R.E. Schryvers A.B. Klein M.H. Loosmore S.M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4183-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) resemble the isotype II proteins found in N. meningitidis, indicating that this isotype is predominant. However, the physiological relevance for two isoforms in the meningococcus is not understood.The immunological properties of both proteins have been studied extensively. Antibodies to TbpA and TbpB are detected in the sera of infected individuals as well as of healthy carriers (2Gorringe A.R. Borrow R. Fox A.J. Robinson A. Vaccine. 1995; 13: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The receptor (TbpA + B) was shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in laboratory animals and is protective in a mouse infection model (15Danve B. Lissolo L. Mignon M. Dumas P. Colombani S. Schryvers A.B. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1214-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). TbpB was shown to be protective and to generate bactericidal antibodies (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,16Lissolo L. Maitre-Wilmotte G. Dumas P. Mignon M. Danve B. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 884-890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas TbpA can confer protection in a mouse challenge model without a detectable bactericidal antibody response (17West D. Reddin K. Matheson M. Heath R. Funnell S. Hudson M. Robinson A. Gorringe A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The two isotypes of TbpB are also reflected in their immunogenic behavior, because it has been demonstrated that antibodies raised against one TbpB isotype do not have any cross-bactericidal activity toward meningococcal strains containing a TbpB that belongs to the other isotype (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This finding is of importance for vaccine development because it implies that a TbpB-based meningococcal vaccine needs to contain at least a representative of each isotype to achieve broad cross-protection (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).In contrast to the detailed knowledge concerning the immunogenicity of the receptor, a number of fundamental questions about the structure and function of the transferrin receptor remain to be answered. First, it is generally accepted that the receptor consists of TbpA and TbpB. However, the architecture of the receptor is unclear and reports on the TbpB:TbpA stoichiometry range from 1:2 (18Boulton I.C. Gorringe A.R. Shergill J.K. Joannou C.L. Evans R.W. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 198: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to 2:1 (19Ronpirin C. Jerse A.E. Cornelissen C.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6336-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 5:1 (3Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 9:1 to 15:1 (20Powell N.B.L. Bishop K. Palmer H.M. Ala'Aldeen D.A. Gorringe A.R. Borriello S.P. J. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 47: 257-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Second, the study of meningococcal and gonococcal mutants lacking the gene for either TbpA or B has shown that both proteins are required for the optimal uptake of htf iron (21Irwin S.W. Averil N. Cheng C.Y. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Anderson J.E. Sparling P.F. Cornelissen C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3162-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to TbpA, which forms a transmembrane pore permitting iron internalization, the role of TbpB in iron uptake remains unclear. Third, it needs to be elucidated whether htf binding by TbpA and TbpB occurs in an independent or sequential fashion. Both modes of ligand binding are supported by previous reports (3Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boulton I.C. Gorringe A.R. Shergill J.K. Joannou C.L. Evans R.W. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 198: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the number of htf-binding sites per receptor has been variously described. Fourth, little is known about the affinities with which the iron-free and iron-loaded forms of htf are bound by the bacterial receptor and how these affinities compare with the human transferrin receptor. Fifth, based on antigenic and sequence differences, TbpBs can be divided into isotype I and II proteins (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Rokbi B. Mazarin V. Maitre-Wilmotte G. Quentin-Millet M.-J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has not been established whether this classification is also reflected in differential htf binding characteristics. These questions will be addressed in the first part of this article where the interaction of purified TbpA, TbpB, or the receptor complex with apo- and holo-htf is analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar).In the second part we present a protocol for the cloning, expression, and purification of active, recombinant TbpB as well as its individual N- and C-terminal domains. These proteins have been used to characterize the interaction of both domains with each other as well as with htf and TbpA. Binding interactions were monitored by a combination of ITC, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and cd. In addition, DSC has shown utility in the characterization of vaccine antigens. Meningococcal disease continues to be a worldwide health problem and can lead to death within several hours if untreated (1Begg N. Cartwright K.A.V. Cohen J. Kaczmarski E.B. Innes J.A. Leen C.L.S.

Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This finding is of importance for vaccine development because it implies that a TbpB-based meningococcal vaccine needs to contain at least a representative of each isotype to achieve broad cross-protection (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to the detailed knowledge concerning the immunogenicity of the receptor, a number of fundamental questions about the structure and function of the transferrin receptor remain to be answered. First, it is generally accepted that the receptor consists of TbpA and TbpB. However, the architecture of the receptor is unclear and reports on the TbpB:TbpA stoichiometry range from 1:2 (18Boulton I.C. Gorringe A.R. Shergill J.K. Joannou C.L. Evans R.W. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 198: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to 2:1 (19Ronpirin C. Jerse A.E. Cornelissen C.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6336-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 5:1 (3Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 9:1 to 15:1 (20Powell N.B.L. Bishop K. Palmer H.M. Ala'Aldeen D.A. Gorringe A.R. Borriello S.P. J. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 47: 257-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Second, the study of meningococcal and gonococcal mutants lacking the gene for either TbpA or B has shown that both proteins are required for the optimal uptake of htf iron (21Irwin S.W. Averil N. Cheng C.Y. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Anderson J.E. Sparling P.F. Cornelissen C.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3162-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to TbpA, which forms a transmembrane pore permitting iron internalization, the role of TbpB in iron uptake remains unclear. Third, it needs to be elucidated whether htf binding by TbpA and TbpB occurs in an independent or sequential fashion. Both modes of ligand binding are supported by previous reports (3Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Boulton I.C. Gorringe A.R. Shergill J.K. Joannou C.L. Evans R.W. J. Theor. Biol. 1999; 198: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the number of htf-binding sites per receptor has been variously described. Fourth, little is known about the affinities with which the iron-free and iron-loaded forms of htf are bound by the bacterial receptor and how these affinities compare with the human transferrin receptor. Fifth, based on antigenic and sequence differences, TbpBs can be divided into isotype I and II proteins (12Rokbi B. Renauld-Mongenie G. Mignon M. Danve B. Poncet D. Chabanel C. Caugant D.A. Quentin-Millet M.-J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Rokbi B. Mazarin V. Maitre-Wilmotte G. Quentin-Millet M.-J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 110: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has not been established whether this classification is also reflected in differential htf binding characteristics. These questions will be addressed in the first part of this article where the interaction of purified TbpA, TbpB, or the receptor complex with apo- and holo-htf is analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). In the second part we present a protocol for the cloning, expression, and purification of active, recombinant TbpB as well as its individual N- and C-terminal domains. These proteins have been used to characterize the interaction of both domains with each other as well as with htf and TbpA. Binding interactions were monitored by a combination of ITC, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and cd. In addition, DSC has shown utility in the characterization of vaccine antigens. We thank John Brandts for critical reading of this manuscript and the entire MicroCal team for help and support. We thank Françoise Guinet for providing samples of TbpB; Bachra Rokbi, Catherine Hessler and Monique Dupuy for helpful discussions; and David Poncet, Frédéric Greco, Mary Matheson, and Meg Sims for technical assistance."

ZIF-1 has a number of properties similar to glycodelin-A. A binding kinetics experiment in the present study demonstrated the presence of two binding sites of ZIF-1 on human spermatozoa. These binding sites were saturable, reversible, and bound to 125I-ZIF-1 in a time-, concentration-, and temperature-dependent manner. Glycodelin-A shared one common binding site with ZIF-1 on spermatozoa, and it could displace only 70% of the 125I-ZIF-1 bound on human spermatozoa. ZIF-1 and glycodelin-A formed complexes with the soluble extract of human spermatozoa. Coincubation of solubilized zona pellucida proteins reduced the binding of ZIF-1 to two complexes of the extract, suggesting that the ZIF-1 binding sites and zona pellucida protein receptors on human spermatozoa were closely related. ZIF-1, but not glycodelin-A, significantly suppressed progesterone-induced acrosome reaction of human spermatozoa. The carbohydrate moieties derived from ZIF-1 reduced the binding of native ZIF-1 on human spermatozoa as well as the zona binding inhibitory activity of the glycoprotein, although the intensity of the effects are lower when compared with the native protein. These effects are not due to the action of the molecules on the motility, viability, and acrosomal status of the treated spermatozoa. Deglycosylated ZIF-1 had no inhibitory effect on both ZIF-1 binding and zona binding capacity of spermatozoa. We concluded that the carbohydrate part of ZIF-1 was critical for the functioning of the glycoprotein.

Zona binding inhibitory factor-1 (ZIF-1),1 a glycoprotein isolated from human follicular fluid, is partly responsible for the zona binding inhibitory activity of follicular fluid (4Yao Y.Q.

Glycodelin, previously known as placental protein 14 (PP14), is a member of the lipocalin superfamily. It is a glycoprotein consisting of 180 amino acids with three putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn-28, Asn-63, and Asn-85). There are two known isoforms of glycodelin, amniotic fluid glycodelin (glycodelin-A, GdA) and seminal plasma glycodelin (glycodelin-S, GdS). The two isoforms have identical protein backbones but have different glycosylation processes (5Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Oehninger S. Patankar M.S.

Coddington C.C. Hodgen G.D. Seppala M. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 63: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), whereas glycodelin-S does not affect spermatozoa zona binding (5Morris H.R. Dell A. Easton R.L. Panico M.

ZIF-1 is similar to glycodelin-A in a number of aspects. They have similar molecular size: 28 kDa for glycodelin-A (8Seppala M. Taylor R.N. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Milgrom E. Endocr.

Neither of the glycoproteins affects the motility and spontaneous acrosome reaction of spermatozoa in vitro (2Chiu P.C.N. Ho P.C. Ng E.H.Y. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Yao Y.Q. Chiu P.C.N. Ip S.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S.B. Hum.

Steril. 1995; 63: 377-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). ZIF-1 is also immunologically similar to glycodelin (13Tse J.Y.M. Chiu P.C.N. Lee K.F. Seppala M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Yao Y.Q. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our observations using N-terminal sequencing and protease-digested peptide mapping to be published elsewhere show that ZIF-1 has the same protein core as glycodelin-A. However, they are different in their oligosaccharide chains as demonstrated by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, lectin binding ability, and isoelectric focusing. 2P. C. N. Chiu, R. Koistinen, H. Koistinen, M. Seppala, K. F. Lee, and W. S. B. Yeung, unpublished data. These data suggest that ZIF-1 is a differentially glycosylated isoform of glycodelin. It is generally believed that follicular fluid stimulates fertilization. The physiological role of the paradoxical activity of ZIF-1 on spermatozoa zona pellucida binding inhibition is unclear. The presence of specific receptor/binding sites is a prerequisite for most physiological activities. Our previous data showed the presence of specific binding of iodinated ZIF-1 on human spermatozoa (2Chiu P.C.N. Ho P.C. Ng E.H.Y. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To study further the binding and biological properties of these ZIF-1 binding sites, we perform binding kinetics experiment of ZIF-1 on human spermatozoa. We confirm these findings by investigating the ability of ZIF-1 binding to soluble extract of spermatozoa. Spermatozoa zona pellucida binding in mammals involves carbohydrate-mediated events (14Wassarman P.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 175-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 15Tulsiani D.R. Yoshida-Komiya H. Araki Y. Biol.

It has been shown that sperm carbohydrate-binding proteins bind to glycoconjugates of the zona pellucida in different species and mediate gamete recognition (17Macek M.B. Shur B.D. Gamete Res. 1988; 20: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18O'Rand M.G. Gamete Res. 1988; 19: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Chapman N.R. Barratt C.L. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 2: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that ZIF-1 exerts its zona binding inhibitory activity via its carbohydrate moieties. In the second part of this report, we study the effects of deglycosylation on the biological activity of ZIF-1 and demonstrate that the oligosaccharide chains derived from ZIF-1 as well as monosaccharides can compete with ZIF-1 for the binding sites on human spermatozoa. The Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong approved the study protocol. Semen samples with normal sperm parameters (20World Health Organization Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical Mucus Interaction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1998Google Scholar) from men visiting the subfertility clinics of the Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong were used in this study. Spermatozoa were separated by Percoll (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation as described previously (21Yeung W.S.B. Ng V.K.H. Lau E.Y.L. Ho P.C. Hum. Reprod. 1994; 9: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The resulting pellet was resuspended in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS, Flow Laboratories, Irvine, UK) supplemented with sodium pyruvate, penicillin-G, streptomycin sulfate, and 3% bovine serum albumin. The spermatozoa were washed and resuspended in EBSS containing 0.3% BSA (EBSS/BSA) before experimentation. Fifteen batches of human follicular fluid samples (20 samples per batch) were collected during oocyte retrieval from women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment in the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Human menopausal gonadotropins after down-regulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist and human chorionic gonadotropin were used for ovarian stimulation in these women. Only human follicular fluid samples without blood contamination and from follicles with a retrieved oocyte were used in this study. The cell debris in human follicular fluid was removed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. The samples were sterilized by filtration with a 0.22-μm filter unit (Millipore, Bedford), pooled, and stored at −20 °C until used. Before experimentation, human follicular fluid was thawed and diluted with EBSS/BSA to the desired concentration. The purification of ZIF-1 was performed as described previously (2Chiu P.C.N. Ho P.C. Ng E.H.Y. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, human follicular fluid was passed successively through a Hi-Trap blue and a protein-G column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through fraction from these two columns was applied to a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The fraction that bound to the concanavalin A column was eluted with 0.3 m α-d-methylglucoside and was separated into two parts using Amicon-10 concentrator (Amicon Inc., Beverly, CA) according to their molecular size. The part with molecular size >10 kDa was further purified with Mono Q and Superose columns as described (4Yao Y.Q. Chiu P.C.N. Ip S.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S.B. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified ZIF-1 was measured with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The yield of ZIF-1 obtained was 30–100 μg/liter. Glycodelin-A and glycodelin-S were purified from amniotic fluid and seminal plasma, respectively. Seminal plasma was diluted 1:4 (v/v) with 50 mmTris-HCl-buffered saline containing 9 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.7 (TBS), before purification. Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v) was mixed with amniotic fluid or diluted seminal plasma and passed through a monoclonal anti-glycodelin antibody (clone F43-7F9)-Sepharose column as described previously (22Riittinen L. Narvanen O. Virtanen I. Seppala M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 136: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The column was then washed successively with TBS, 1m NaCl, containing 1% isopropanol and 10 mmammonium acetate before the bound glycodelin was eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified protein was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and its concentration was measured. Glycodelin-S was further purified using anion exchange column as described (13Tse J.Y.M. Chiu P.C.N. Lee K.F. Seppala M. Koistinen H. Koistinen R. Yao Y.Q. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2002; 8: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A kit,N-Glycosidase F Deglycosylation (Bio-Rad), was used to deglycosylate ZIF-1 or glycodelin-A. Fifty microliters of ZIF-1 or glycodelin-A (1 μg/μl in PBS) was denatured in 1 μl of 5% SDS and 1.5 μl of 1:10 dilution of β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min. Four microliters of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to entrap excess SDS after the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The denatured protein was incubated in an equal volume of releasing buffer supplied with the kit containing 2 μl of N-glycosidase F for 24 h at 37 °C. Deglycosylated protein was obtained after three successive protein precipitations, each with 3 volumes of cold 100% ethanol followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 ×g. The deglycosylated ZIF-1 (deglyco-ZIF-1) or glycodelin-A (deglyco-GdA) obtained was dried in a vacuum concentrator (Virtis, New York), redissolved in 20 μl of PBS and further purified by gel filtration using Superdex-75 column in a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The purity of the deglycosylated proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE, and their concentrations were determined. Oligosaccharide chains from ZIF-1 and glycodelin-A were isolated as reported (23Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, the glycoproteins were denatured as described above except that no Nonidet P-40 was added. The denatured protein was precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of 80% acetone at −20 °C, incubation of the mixture at −20 °C for 30 min and centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet obtained was redissolved and deglycosylated using theN-Glycosidase F Deglycosylation kit (Bio-Rad). Deglycosylated protein and oligosaccharide chains were precipitated in 80% acetone at −20 °C for 1 h, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was first triturated (23Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in 50 μl of ice-cold 60% aqueous methanol and subsequently dispersed in 1 ml of the same solution. The supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. This extraction process was repeated twice, and the methanol supernatant containing the peptide N-glycosidase F-released oligosaccharide chain (ZIF-1-glyco/GdA-glyco) was pooled, dried in a vacuum concentrator (Virtis, New York), and redissolved in 20 μl of water. The percentage recovery of oligosaccharide chains using this method was greater than 90% (23Verostek M.F. Lubowski C. Trimble R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the amount of oligosaccharide chains used in each experiment was expressed as the amount of native glycoprotein required for producing that quantity of oligosaccharide chains. Fifty microliters of PBS was also processed through all the above procedures and served as control (PBS control). The hemizona binding assay was performed as described (24Yao Y.Q. Yeung W.S.B. Ho P.C. Hum. Reprod. 1996; 11: 1516-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unfertilized oocytes from our intracytoplasmic sperm injection program were bisected into two identical hemizonae by a micromanipulator. In the assay, each hemizona was incubated with 2 × 105 spermatozoa/ml in a 100-μl droplet of EBSS/BSA under mineral oil for 3 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. We used a sperm concentration higher than those in a typical HZA because more spermatozoa would bind to the zona pellucida in this condition and, therefore, the variation of the assay would be smaller. Loosely attached spermatozoa were removed by pipetting the hemizonae through a micropipette of internal diameter 200 μm. The numbers of tightly bound spermatozoa on the outer surface of the hemizonae were counted. The hemizona binding index (HZI) was defined as, HZI=number of spermatozoa bound in test dropletnumber of spermatozoa bound in control droplet×100Equation 1 Fifty micrograms of ZIF-1/gylcodelin-A in 0.02 ml of 0.05 m PBS (pH 7.4) was mixed with 2 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (20 μl, Amersham Biosciences, England) in a small conical vial. Freshly prepared chloramine T (100 μg in 0.02 ml of 0.05 m PBS, pH 7.4) was then added and mixed thoroughly. After 60 s, sodium metabisulfite (300 μg in 0.05 ml of 0.05 m PBS, pH 7.4) was used to stop the reaction. Free 125I was removed by passing the mixture through a 10-ml disposable desalting column. The first radioactive peak containing iodinated ZIF-1/glycodelin-A was collected. Percoll-processed spermatozoa (n = 5) were divided into eight portions. They were incubated with 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 25, or 50 μg/ml125I-labeled ZIF-1/glycodelin-A in a 1-ml volume or in unlabeled ZIF-1/glycodelin-A at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 3 h. After incubation, the spermatozoa were washed with fresh EBSS/BSA. HZA were performed on these treated spermatozoa. Two million spermatozoa in 1 ml of EBSS/BSA were incubated with different concentrations (from 0.03 to 3000 pmol/ml) of 125I-ZIF-1 at 37 °C for 3 h. The binding was terminated by the addition of 15 ml of ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 150 × g for 10 min. The spermatozoa were further washed twice with fresh EBSS. A gamma counter (Model 5500B, Beckman) was used to count the radioactivity associated with the spermatozoa. Specific binding of ZIF-1 was determined by subtracting the counts bound in the presence of a 100-fold concentration of unlabeled ZIF-1 from the counts bound in the absence of unlabeled protein. The determinations of total binding and nonspecific binding were done in triplicate. After equilibration of 2 × 106spermatozoa (n = 3) to the desired temperature (4, 25, or 37 °C), 125I-ZIF-1 (300 pmol/ml) was added at the appropriate temperature and mixed rapidly. The mixture was incubated for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, or 210 min. A large volume of ice-cold buffer was added to terminate the binding. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 30 nmol/ml cold ZIF-1. Bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation at 150 ×g for 10 min. The radioactivity associated with the treated spermatozoa after washing twice in EBSS/BSA was measured. Two million human spermatozoa in 1 ml of EBSS/BSA were incubated with 125I-ZIF-1 (300 pmol/ml) at 37 °C for 150 min. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled ZIF-1 (30 nmol/ml) was then added. After a further incubation for 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, or 360 min, 15 ml of ice-cold buffer was added to stop the dissociation. The spermatozoa were then washed and their associated radioactivity was determined. Competition binding analysis was used to investigate the affinity of ZIF-1 binding sites to glycodelin and other lipocalins. The binding of labeled ZIF-1 (300 pmol/ml) to human spermatozoa (2 × 106/ml) was determined in the presence of an increasing concentration (from 0.3 pmol/ml to 30 nmol/ml) of unlabeled ZIF-1, lipocalins, or EBSS/BSA at 37 °C for 3 h. The lipocalins used included glycodelin-A, glycodelin-S, bovine β-lactoglobulin A (Sigma), and human retinol-binding protein (Sigma). Another zona binding inhibitory factor that we purified from the human follicular fluid, ZIF-2 (4Yao Y.Q. Chiu P.C.N. Ip S.M. Ho P.C. Yeung W.S.B. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 13: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was also used in this competition assay. Cell-bound radioactivity was determined after washing the treated spermatozoa twice with EBSS/BSA. Each individual experiment was repeated three times. Percoll-processed spermatozoa (n = 5) were divided into eleven portions. Each portion was incubated in 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 10 μg/ml ZIF-1, deglycosylated ZIF-1 (deglyco-ZIF-1), glycans of ZIF-1 (ZIF-1-glyco), glycodelin-A (GdA), deglycosylated glycodelin-A (deglyco-GdA), glycans of glycodelin-A (GdA-glyco), or EBSS/BSA (control) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 3 h. After incubation, the spermatozoa were washed with fresh EBSS/BSA. HZA were performed on the treated spermatozoa. To confirm that the effects of oligosaccharide chains or deglycosylated protein cores from ZIF-1 and glycodelin-A on spermatozoa zona pellucida binding are not due to their effects on sperm motility, viability, and acrosomal status, we also studied these parameters of the spermatozoa treated above. The acrosomal status of the spermatozoa was evaluated by fluorescein isothiocyanate-Pisum sativum agglutinin (Sigma) as described (2Chiu P.C.N. Ho P.C. Ng E.H.Y. Yeung W.S.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 61: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hoechst staining was used to determine the viability of the spermatozoa. The acrosomal status and viability of 300 spermatozoa were determined in randomly selected fields under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with ×1000 magnification. The filter set used for Hoechst staining consisted of an excitation filter G365, a chromatic beam splitter FT395, and a barrier filter LP420, whereas that for fluorescein isothiocyanate-Pisum sativumagglutinin staining consisted of an excitation filter BP 450–490, a chromatic beam splitter FT510, and a barrier filter LP520. The acrosomal status of spermatozoa was classified into: (i) intact acrosome: complete staining of the acrosome; (ii) reacting acrosome: Hoechst-negative and partial or patchy staining of the acrosome; and (iii) reacted acrosome: Hoechst-negative and complete staining of the equatorial segment only or no staining of the whole sperm head. The proportions of spermatozoa with reacted acrosomes were determined. Hobson Sperm Tracker System (HST, Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd., Sheffield, UK) was used to determine sperm motility. The system consisted of a phase-contrast microscope, closed circuit television video camera, a microcomputer, a tracking screen, and HST software (Hobson Tracking Systems Ltd.). The set-up parameters of the system were: (i) framing rate, 50 Hz; (ii) aspect ratio, 1.39; (iii) calibration, ×10.0; (iv) refresh time, 5 s; (v) thresholds, +20/−20; (vi) filter weights, 1 and −1, 2 and 0, 3 and 0, 4 and 0; (vii) minimum chamber depth, 20 μm; (viii) minimum trail point, 25; (ix) maximum trail point, 250; and (x) trail draw time, 3 s. The motility of spermatozoa was analyzed on a warmed microscope stage at 37 °C with a Cell-VU disposable semen analysis chamber (Fertility Technologies, Inc., Natick, MA). Five hundred spermatozoa per specimen in randomly selected fields were evaluated to determine 1) curvilinear velocity (VCL, μm/s), 2) mean straight line velocity (VSL, μm/s), 3) average path velocity (VAP, μm/s), 4) mean linearity (LIN, VSL/VCL), 5) amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, μm), 6) head beat cross-frequency (BCF, Hz), and 7) percentage of motile sperm (MOT). The binding of 125I-ZIF-1 (300 pmol/ml) to human spermatozoa (2 × 106/ml) was measured in the presence of increasing concentration (from 0.3 pmol/ml to 30 nmol/ml) of deglyco-ZIF-1, ZIF-1-glyco, deglyco-GdA, GdA-glyco, or EBSS/BSA (control). After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the treated spermatozoa were washed with fresh EBSS/BSA and the cell-bound radioactivity was measured. Each experiment was repeated three times. Sperm extracts was isolated as described (25Shi Y.L. Ma X.H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were separated from the seminal plasma by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, washed three times with 0.01m PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended in 0.01 mTris-HCl buffer containing 0.5 m KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycine, pH 8.3. Triton X-100 (1% v/v) was then added to the sperm suspension and stirred at 4 °C overnight. The insoluble material was discarded after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 40 min. The supernatant containing mainly proteins of the plasma membrane and acrosome (25Shi Y.L. Ma X.H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The protein concentration in the solution was determined by using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad). Human zona pellucida was separated from the oocytes using glass micropipettes under a microscope (26Franken D.R. Kruger T.F. Oehninger S.C. Andrologia. 1994; 26: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and heat-solubilized at 70 °C for 90 min in distilled water with pH adjusted to 9 with Na2CO3 (27Dunbar B.S. Wardrip N.J. Hedrick J.L. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The purified sperm extracts was divided into six identical portions (10 μg/ml). Each portion was incubated with 1 μg/ml125I-ZIF-1 in the presence of zona pellucida protein at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 zona pellucida/μl, or with 1 μg/ml 125I-glycodelin-A at 37 °C for 3 h. After incubation, the mixtures were analyzed by native-gel electrophoresis, and the radioactive bands were visualized by exposing the gel to BIO-MAX film (Kodak, New York). Spermatozoa (n = 5) were incubated in 0.03, 3, and 30 pmol/ml ZIF-1, glycodelin-A, or EBSS/BSA (as control) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air for 3 h. After washing with fresh EBSS/BSA, the treated spermatozoa were incubated with 1 μg/ml progesterone or EBSS/BSA (as control) for 30 min. The acrosomal status of the spermatozoa was then evaluated as described above. All the data were expressed as means ± S.E. The data were analyzed by SigmaStat statistical software (SigmaPlot 2000 & Enzyme Kinetics Analysis Module 1.0, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). A paired Student's t test was used to compare the number of spermatozoa bound to zona pellucida between matching hemizona. After glycosidase digestion and purification by gel filtration, both ZIF-1 and glycodelin-A showed a single band of size 19 kDa (Fig. 1) corresponding to the size of deglycosylated glycodelin-A. Our unpublished data showed that the sequence for the first 25 amino acids from the N-terminal of deglycosylated ZIF-1 was identical to that reported for glycodelin-A (11Julkunen M. Seppala M. Janne O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8845-8849Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The iden"

A large (1.80 metres in length and weighing 70 kg) Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichtus eleginoides Smitt, 1898) has been caught in the northwest Atlantic, representing the first Northern Hemisphere record of the diverse, abundant and mainly Antarctic suborder Notothenioidei. This extraordinary catch indicates that large, cold-temperate fishes may occasionally migrate from sub-Antarctic to sub-Arctic waters by using deep, cold water, supporting a widely accepted but unproven proposal that the anti-tropical distribution patterns of many marine biota could be explained by transequatorial migration1,2,3."
https://openalex.org/W2121071922,"We examined expression of the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), which is critical for inflammatory cell leukotriene synthesis. A 3.4-kb segment of the FLAP gene 5′-untranslated region accounted for a 22-fold increase in promoter activity when transfected into the monocyte-like cell line, THP-1, and demonstrated no activity in non-inflammatory cells. Virtually all of the promoter activity was mediated by the first 134 bp upstream of the transcription start site, a region that contains CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) consensus binding sites, at −36 to −28 bp (distal) and −25 to −12 bp (proximal). DNase I footprint analyses demonstrated THP-1 nuclear extract proteins bind to the proximal site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses revealed that C/EBPα, δ, and ε bind to the proximal site and C/EBPα and ε bind to the distal site, constitutively. Transfection studies indicated that mutation of both the proximal and distal sites decreased constitutive FLAP promoter activity. Overexpression of C/EBPα, β, and δ transactivated promoter activity and increased native FLAP mRNA accumulation. Mutation of both C/EBP sites essentially abolished promoter induction by C/EBP overexpression. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α induced FLAP mRNA expression, FLAP promoter activity, and C/EBPα, δ, and ε binding to the proximal and distal promoter consensus sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that C/EBPα, δ, and ε bound to this region of the 5′-untranslated region, whereas C/EBPβ does not bind even under conditions of overexpression and stimulation. We conclude that the FLAP gene is transactivated by members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors in inflammatory cells and that these factors play an important role in FLAP gene induction by TNFα.

LTA4 can be metabolized to LTB4by LTA4 hydrolase or to the cysteinyl leukotrienes LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, by the action of LTC4 synthase (6Samuelsson B. Dahlén S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A.

Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The exact function of the FLAP enzyme remains controversial, but previous studies suggest that it acts as an arachidonic acid transfer protein for 5-LO (9Abramovitz M. Wong E. Cox M.E. Richardson C.D. Li C. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In support of this role, MK-886, a specific inhibitor of FLAP, has been shown to inhibit the binding of arachidonic acid to FLAP and the resultant synthesis of leukotrienes (9Abramovitz M. Wong E. Cox M.E. Richardson C.D. Li C. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In several types of inflammatory cells, FLAP mRNA can be induced by dexamethasone, interleukin (IL) 3, and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (10Ring W.L. Riddick C.A. Baker J.R.

Cloning of FLAP gene by Kennedy et al. and computer-assisted analysis of this sequence suggested the existence of a possible TATA box 22 bp upstream of the transcription start site, as well as AP-2, NFκB, and glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (13Kennedy B.P. Diehl R.E. Boie Y. Adam M. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8511-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A promoter analysis, using a FLAP gene promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene construct in the mouse macrophage cell line, P388 D1, indicated the presence of enhancer elements and cell-specific activity (13Kennedy B.P. Diehl R.E. Boie Y. Adam M. Dixon R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8511-8516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also found a restriction site polymorphism in the second intron and that this polymorphism is present in the normal population at a fairly high frequency (13Kennedy B.P. Diehl R.E. Boie Y.

The functional significance of this finding is unclear. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family members, of which six have been identified, are transcription factors that regulate cellular differentiation and the inflammatory response (15Lekstrom-Himes J.

In this report, we investigate the role of cis-acting elements that are located in the first 134 bp of the FLAP promoter that are important in the transcriptional regulation of the FLAP gene in inflammatory cells. Our findings indicate that the α, δ, and ε members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors bind to these elements and that the α and δ isoforms, at least, function to up-regulate FLAP gene expression in mononuclear phagocytes. THP-1 and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The monocyte-like cell line, THP-1, constitutively expresses 5-LO and FLAP and has been extensively utilized as a model to study leukotriene metabolic pathways (11Riddick C.A. Ring W.L. Baker J.R.

THP-1 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2in RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), supplemented with 10% heat-treated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. HeLa cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids. The media were changed every two to three days for all experiments. A 3.4-kb segment of the FLAP 5′-UTR, ligated into a pCAT vector (Promega, Madison, WI), was generously provided by Dr. Brian Kennedy (Merck Frosst, Kirkland, Québec, Canada). The -3368FLAP-pGL3 construct was created by release of the 3.4 kb-segment from the pCAT vector by restriction digest with SacI, with subsequent ligation into the firefly luciferase pGL3 Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The -3368FLAP-pGL3 construct was used as a PCR template using primers with a common NheI restriction site engineered on the 3′ end (5′-ccgctagcggaaggggaagtggagc-3′). The following forward primers were used to create the designated deletion promoter-reporter constructs: 5′-gaataccaggcagccac-3′ (-965FLAP-pGL3), 5′-atgccactctgtctgac-3′ (-371FLAP- pGL3), 5′-gacacactgaaccacag-3′ (-134FLAP-pGL3), and 5′-ctgaaagagygcaagctctcacttccccttccg-3′ (-19FLAP-pGL3). Thirty six cycles of PCR were performed, with each cycle consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The promoter segment for the -1192FLAP-pGL3 construct was created by restriction digest of the 3.4-kb pCAT construct with RsaI. All fragments were subsequently subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). The FLAP promoter segments were released by restriction digest withSacI and NheI and directionally subcloned into the pGL3 Basic vector. Mutant constructs (containing mutations at the C/EBP consensus sites) were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences of the wild-type and mutant constructs were subsequently confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. All constructs were purified using the EndoFree Maxi-prep kit (Qiagen; Chatsworth, CA). THP-1 cells (1 × 106) were transiently co-transfected with 450 ng of the FLAP promoter-pGL3 firefly luciferase vector and 50 ng of the pRL-TKRenilla luciferase vector (Promega) or a pCMV-β-galactosidase vector (generously provided by Dr. Kenneth Chien, University of California, San Diego, CA) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), as has been previously described (27Serio K.J. Hodulik C.R. Bigby T.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For overexpression experiments, DNA mixtures consisted of 225 ng of the wild-type or mutant -134FLAP-pGL3 construct, 50 ng of theRenilla luciferase pRL-TK construct, and 225 ng of the C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε expression vectors to a total of 500 ng of DNA per condition. For TNFα experiments, the cells were subsequently treated with TNFα (at 10 ng/ml) for 24 h. HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in their respective media supplemented with 10% FCS. Luciferase activities were measured by the Dual Luciferase Assay Reporter System (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Tropix β-galactosidase assay system (Tropix, Bedford, MA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Measurements were made using an Optocomp I luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). Firefly luciferase values were normalized to either Renilla luciferase values or β-galactosidase values to control for transfection efficiency. Data are expressed as values normalized to the activity of the promoter less pGL3 Basic vector or to the activity of the SV40-driven pGL3 Control vector (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared from THP-1 and HeLa cells as previously described (28Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the FLAP gene from −134 to +12 bp (with respect to the transcription start site) was prepared by restriction digest of the -134FLAP-pGL3 construct with KpnI and NcoI. The probe was labeled on the 3′ end with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). DNase I footprinting was performed in 100-μl reaction volumes, with 4 ng (∼1 × 104 cpm) of labeled probe and 40 μg of nuclear extract. The reaction conditions consisted of 5% glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, CaCl2 (1 mm) and MgCl2 (0.5 mm) were added and the reaction was incubated for 1 min. DNase I (1 unit) (Promega) was added, and the reaction was digested for 60 or 120 s. The reaction was inactivated, and the DNA was extracted by phenol:chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then analyzed on an 8% PAGE and 50% urea gel. A G + A ladder was prepared by using the same end-labeled fragment and was run on the same gel. EMSA reactions were performed in 20 μl final volumes under the identical conditions as described for footprinting. The probe was labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Each reaction contained 10 μg of nuclear protein extracts from control or TNFα-conditioned THP-1 cells and ∼3 × 104 cpm of duplexed, labeled nucleotide probe. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Supershift analyses were conducted with antibodies against C/EBP family proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) added 5 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The samples were subsequently electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gel containing 1% glycerol. THP-1 cells were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) or transiently transfected with expression vectors for C/EBPα, β, δ, and ε (450 ng × 106 cells) as has been previously described (27Serio K.J. Hodulik C.R. Bigby T.D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Following 24 h of incubation, total cellular RNA was extracted and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gel. The RNA was then blotted overnight onto a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The blot was probed with a 32P-labeled full-length cDNA probe for FLAP, washed under high-stringency conditions, and exposed to autoradiographic film. Loading equivalency and transfer efficiency were assessed by probing with a 32P-labeled full-length cDNA probe for β-actin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). ChIP assays were performed by a modification of a previously described method (29Yan C. Wang H. Toh Y. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2309-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells (at 1 × 107 cells/ml) were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C and lysed in SDS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl/1% SDS/10 mm EDTA, pH 8.1). The chromatin samples were sonicated for 5–10 s (to reduce the DNA length to ∼200–500 bp) and were precleared with protein A-agarose beads to minimize nonspecific binding of proteins in protein A-agarose. Antibodies (2 μg) were added to the chromatin samples, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. To minimize nonspecific binding of DNA to protein A-agarose, salmon sperm DNA and protein A-agarose beads were incubated in 1% BSA for 4 h at 4 °C. These beads were then washed repeatedly and resuspended in binding buffer. Subsequently, 50 μl of the treated beads were added to the chromatin samples and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed, eluted, and cross-linking-reversed by protease digestions using proteinase K as previously described (30Barre B. Avril S. Coqueret O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2990-2996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After proteinase K treatment, the DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer, and 5 μl of the DNA was used for the PCR reaction. PCR was performed using a pair of primers (forward −134 bp to −118 bp; reverse −9 bp to −25 bp, sequence as noted above) that generated a product spanning −134 to −9 bp of the FLAP promoter (126 bp). PCR was performed for 30 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 55 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. The PCR products were electrophoresed through an agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. FCS, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin were obtained from the Cell Culture Facility, University of California. RPMI 1640 medium was obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). All restriction enzymes were obtained from Invitrogen. All synthesized oligonucleotides and primers were obtained from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). The C/EBPα expression vector was obtained from Dr. Steve McKnight, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX) (31Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ expression vector was obtained from Dr. Mario Chojkier, Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System (San Diego, CA) (32Houglum K. Buck M. Adir V. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 808-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The C/EBPδ expression vector was obtained from Dr. Jan Trapman, Erasmus University (Rotterdam, Holland) (34Cleutjens C.B. van Eekelen C.C. van Dekken H. Smit E.M. Hagemeijer A. Wagner M.J. Wells D.E. Trapman J. Genomics. 1993; 16: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The C/EBPε expression vector was obtained from Dr. Julie Lekstrom-Himes, NIAID National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). TNFα was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Autoradiographic film was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). The Qiagen-tip 500 column was purchased from Qiagen. All other reagents were from Sigma and were of the finest grade available. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. in all circumstances where mean values are compared. Data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t test (InStat, version 2.03, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. The full-length -3368FLAP-pGL3 construct was assessed for promoter activity in THP-1 cells. Following transient transfection, the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. The -3368FLAP-pGL3 construct exhibited 22-fold higher activity than that of the promoterless pGL3 Basic vector (Fig. 1). In the non-inflammatory cell lines, HeLa and COS-1, which do not constitutively express FLAP protein, the -3368FLAP-pGL3 construct exhibited minimal promoter activity (data not shown). These results are consistent with the known cell-specific pattern of FLAP gene expression in inflammatory cells. A serial deletion analysis demonstrated that the first 134 bp of the FLAP promoter (as represented by the activity of the -134FLAP-pGL3 construct) mediated a 5-fold increase in promoter activity over that of the minimal promoter construct, -19FLAP-pGL3 (Fig. 1). Notably, the -134FLAP-pGL3 construct accounted for almost all of the observed full-length (3.4 kb) promoter activity. Because the -134FLAP-pGL3 construct demonstrated maximal promoter activity, we attempted to identify the transacting factors that bind to this region of the FLAP promoter. DNase I footprint analysis using a probe from −134 to +12 bp demonstrated that THP-1 nuclear extract binds to the FLAP promoter region corresponding to approximately −30 to −10 bp (Fig.2A, lane 3). In similar DNase I footprint assays, HeLa nuclear extract did not demonstrate binding to the FLAP promoter (Fig. 2B,lane 3). Data base analysis revealed that this region of the FLAP promoter contains a proximal C/EBP consensus site (located at −25 to −12 bp), a distal C/EBP consensus site (located at −36 to −28 bp), and an Octomer-1 consensus site (located at −29 to −15 bp). Wild-type and mutant duplexed oligonucleotide probes (Fig.3) were synthesized for EMSAs to identify the transcription factor(s) that bind to the FLAP promoter region that demonstrated binding in the prior footprint assay. In the presence of nuclear extract from unconditioned THP-1 cells, the EMSA probe from −25 to −9 bp, containing the wild-type proximal C/EBP consensus site (located at −25 to −12 bp), exhibited a 3-band complex (Fig.4A, lane 1). Supershifted bands were observed in the conditions using antibodies against C/EBPα (lane 2), δ (lane 4), and ε (lane 5). Our data indicate the binding of C/EBPα, δ, and ε to the proximal C/EBP consensus site in unconditioned THP-1 cells.Figure 4EMSA analysis of the proximal C/EBP consensus site of the FLAP promoter. Nuclear extract (10 μg) from THP-1 cells was incubated with a [32P]ATP-labeled duplexed segment of the FLAP promoter (from −25 to −9 bp) containing the proximal C/EBP site (located at −25 to −12 bp). A, EMSA and supershift assays were performed with wild-type probe using THP-1 nuclear extract (lane 1) and nuclear extract with antibodies against C/EBP proteins α, (lane 2), β (lane 3), δ (lane 4), and ε (lane 5). B, EMSA and supershift assays were performed with a probe containing a mutation of the proximal C/EBP site, using THP-1 nuclear extract (lane 2) and nuclear extract with antibodies against C/EBPα (lane 3) and β (lane 4).C, EMSA and supershift assays were performed with wild-type probe using HeLa nuclear extract (lane 1) and nuclear extract with antibodies against C/EBPα (lane 3), β (lane 4), δ (lane 5), and ε (lane 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the critical base pairs within the proximal C/EBP consensus binding site, we used the −25 to −9 bp EMSA probe containing a 4-bp mutation within the proximal C/EBP site at −15 to −12 bp (Fig. 3). An EMSA performed with the probe containing a mutation of the C/EBP site demonstrated a loss of specific binding (Fig. 4B, lane 2), and antibodies against C/EBPα and β failed to produce supershifted bands (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). These results confirmed that the proximal consensus site bound C/EBP proteins in a site-specific manner. When similar EMSAs were performed using HeLa nuclear extract and the wild-type −25 to −9-bp EMSA probe, only nonspecific gel-shifted bands were observed. Supershift assays performed with this probe, HeLa nuclear extract, and C/EBP antibodies against α, β, δ, and ε (Fig. 4C,lanes 3–6) failed to produce supershifted bands, suggesting that these proteins were not constitutively present or did not demonstrate binding in the HeLa cell line. To identify the transcription factors that bind to the distal C/EBP consensus site (located at −36 to −28 bp), EMSAs were performed using a probe extending from −39 to −20 bp. Nuclear e"

Human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), an Ig superfamily cell surface glycoprotein used widely as a clinical tumor marker, undergoes homophilic interactions that mediate intercellular adhesion. Recent evidence supports the view that deregulated overexpression of CEA has an instrumental role in tumorigenesis through the inhibition of cell differentiation and the disruption of tissue architecture. The CEA-mediated block of the myogenic differentiation of rat L6 myoblasts depends on homophilic binding of its external domains. We show here that L6 transfectant cells expressing CEA can “trans-block” the myogenesis of juxtaposed differentiation-competent L6 transfectant cells expressing a deletion mutant of CEA (ΔNCEA). This result implies the efficacy of antiparallel CEA-CEA interactions between cells in the differentiation block. In addition, ΔNCEA can acquire differentiation blocking activity by cross-linking with specific anti-CEA antibodies, thus implying the efficacy of parallel CEA-CEA interactions on the same cell surface. The myogenic differentiation blocking activity of CEA was demonstrated by site-directed mutations to involve three subdomains of the amino-terminal domain, shown previously to be critical for its intercellular adhesion function. Monovalent Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies binding to the region bridging subdomains 1 and 2 could both inhibit intercellular adhesion and release the myogenic differentiation block. Amino acid substitutions Q80A, Q80R, and D82N in subdomain 3, QNDTG, however, were found to completely ablate the differentiation blocking activity of CEA but had no effect on intercellular adhesion activity. A cyclized peptide representing this subdomain was the most effective at releasing the differentiation block.

The latter are known collectively as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)1 (1Ruoslahti E. Obrink B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Hynes R.O. Lander A.D.

CAMs function not only to fix cells in specific locations within tissues and regulate their movement but also to translate biochemical information from the extracellular environment through the activation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to specific functional cell responses (4Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar,5Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). CAMs are grouped into several different molecular families; the majority identified to date belong to the Ig superfamily (1Ruoslahti E. Obrink B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 6Huang Z. Li S. Korngold R. Biopolymers. 1997; 43: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Williams A.F. Barclay A.N.

Although the members of this family are functionally diverse, most are cell surface molecules involved in the recognition of other soluble or cell-associated molecules. All members of the Ig superfamily share conserved amino acid residues. These residues are limited to positions within the core of the Ig fold that are important for its structure. In contrast, the functional regions of the various members are often highly diverse. Ig superfamily members function in many cases as a result of homophilic binding between their external domains or heterophilic binding interactions with other molecules (1Ruoslahti E. Obrink B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7995-8001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homophilic interactions can be either antiparallel or parallel. Antiparallel interactions between molecules on apposed cell surfaces are required for intercellular binding (9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Ranheim T.S. Edelman G.M. Cunningham B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parallel interactions between adjacent molecules on the same cell surface can facilitate this process by concentrating the binding molecules into synergistic arrays as described by the “Velcro” (13Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family: Basic and Clinical Perspectives. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 57-71Google Scholar) or “zipper” models (14Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), in which the concerted action of multiple relatively weak interactions between individual pairs of molecules can lead to a strong overall bonding. Both types of interactions can also initiate signaling events (5Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J.

The clustering resulting from their combination might be expected to amplify these signals and lead to the triggering of threshold-activated signaling pathways (5Obrink B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Draber P. Skubitz K.M. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family: Basic and Clinical Perspectives. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 121-140Google Scholar). The human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family is of particular interest in terms of intermolecular binding because of the multiplicity and diversity of interactions between multiple closely related family members (13Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family: Basic and Clinical Perspectives. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 57-71Google Scholar). We have investigated previously the structural requirements for CEA-mediated intercellular adhesion (9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intercellular adhesion seems to depend mainly on antiparallel CEA-CEA interactions as indicated by studies with hybrid constructs between CEA and neural cell adhesion molecule (9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CEA consists of a V-like Ig amino-terminal domain and three pairs of I-like Ig domains (denoted AXBX) that are terminated by a hydrophobic domain, which is processed to allow the addition of a glycophosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (17Beauchemin N. Benchimol S. Cournoyer D. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3221-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Hefta S.A. Hefta L.J. Lee T.D. Paxton R.J. Shively J.E. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1988; 263: 12716-12720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intercellular adhesion was shown to be mediated by double reciprocal bonds between the N and A3B3 domains of antiparallel CEA molecules on apposed cell surfaces (9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Subdomains consisting of 5–6 amino acids that are required for intercellular adhesion, presumably as points of initial binding, were identified by mutational analysis of the amino-terminal domain (16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two cellular functions, intercellular adhesion (for review, see Stanners and Fuks (13Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Cell Adhesion and Communication Mediated by the CEA Family: Basic and Clinical Perspectives. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1998: 57-71Google Scholar)) and the inhibition of cell differentiation (20Eidelman F.J. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Taheri M. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have been shown to be dependent on homophilic CEA family member interactions. In particular, CEA was shown to block the myogenic differentiation of rat L6 myoblasts (20Eidelman F.J. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Taheri M. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the neurogenic differentiation of mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. 2B. Malette and C. P. Stanners, submitted for publication. The effect of CEA on differentiation would be expected to promote tumorigenic behavior and, in fact, was found to markedly increase the tumorigenicity of L6 myoblasts (21Screaton R.A. Penn L.Z. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 939-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Caco-2 cells (22Ilantzis I. De Marte L. Screaton R.A. Stanners C.P. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deregulated overexpression of CEA and the closely related CEA family member, CEACAM6 (formerly known as NCA), at levels closely approximating those found in many colorectal carcinomas, has been shown recently to block cellular polarization, disrupt tissue architecture, and block the differentiation of human colonocyte cell lines (22Ilantzis I. De Marte L. Screaton R.A. Stanners C.P. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, the cell surface level of CEA, which was determined by FACS analysis of highly purified epithelial colonocytes from colorectal carcinomas and normal colonic tissue, was found to be elevated in the tumor cells at levels that were inversely correlated with the degree of differentiation (23Ilantzis C. Jothy S. Alpert L.C. Draber P. Stanners C.P. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 703-716PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have focused on the effects of CEA on the differentiation of L6 myoblasts because of the relative ease of experimentation. Although the expression of CEA in this system is ectopic, our experience to date indicates that the results obtained with this model system are closely mimicked by more biologically relevant systems such as human colonocytes (22Ilantzis I. De Marte L. Screaton R.A. Stanners C.P. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 151-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ordonez C. Screaton R.A. Ilantzis C. Stanners C.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3419-3424PubMed Google Scholar). Because CEA and/or CEACAM6 are overexpressed in more than 50% of human cancers (25Chevinsky A.H. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 1991; 7: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it would seem experimentally and medically important to devise a means of releasing the CEA-mediated differentiation block and to determine whether interference with this function can be made selective without affecting the intercellular adhesion function. We show here that although the structural requirements for the intercellular adhesion and the differentiation block functions overlap, they can be separated effectively in the case of rat L6 myogenic differentiation. Using this information, small cyclized peptides and monovalent Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies have been designed that are capable of releasing the myogenic differentiation block. Cyclized and linearly blocked oligopeptides were obtained (>95% purity) from Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA). Linearly blocked peptides were rendered more stable by acetylation of the amino terminus and amination of the carboxyl terminus. Cyclic peptides contained two cysteine residues joined by sulfide bonds at their termini. The peptides used were blocked linear NAc-LFGYSWYKGE-NH2, NAc-VDGNRQIIGY-NH2, NAc-RIIQNDTGFY-NH2, and NAc-FNVAEGKEV-NH2; and cyclized H-CGYSWYKC-OH, H-CGNRQIIC-OH, H-CQNDTGC-OH, and H-YCTDEKQCY-OH, representing subdomains 1, 2, and 3 and control peptides, respectively. Sequences actually present in the amino-terminal domain of CEA for the cyclized peptides are underlined. Wild type cDNA coding for CEA (17Beauchemin N. Benchimol S. Cournoyer D. Fuks A. Stanners C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3221-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was used as a template for all PCR-generated constructs. The recombinant PCR technique (26Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 177-183Google Scholar) was used to generate site-directed mutants as described previously (16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat L6 myoblasts were grown as monolayer cultures at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (growth medium (GM); Invitrogen). Cell cultures were subcultured while subconfluent to avoid the selection of non-fusing variants. LR-73 cells (27Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) derived from the Chinese hamster ovary line were grown in monolayer culture in α minimum essential medium (28Stanners C.P. Eliceiri G.L. Green H. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 230: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. L6 myoblast cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/l00-mm plastic tissue culture Petri dish and cotransfected 24 h later by the calcium phosphate-mediated co-precipitation method as described previously (29Benchimol S. Fuks A. Jothy S. Beauchemin N. Shirota K. Stanners C.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), with 5 μg of p91023B expression vector containing CEA (wild type or mutant) cDNA, 10 μg of LR-73 carrier genomic DNA, and 0.5 μg pSV2neo plasmid/dish. Stable pooled transfectant colonies were isolated by selection with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen). Immunofluorescent labeling with anti-CEA monoclonal antibody J22 (30Zhou H. Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3817-3822PubMed Google Scholar) and FACS sorting were carried out to select for populations of transfectants stably expressing desired levels of mutant or wild type CEA on the cell surface. At least two independent pooled populations of transfectant clones were isolated for each transfected cDNA. All transfectant populations were maintained in GM containing 400 μg/ml G418. G418 was removed from the medium 24 h before each functional assay was performed. Cells were removed from culture vessels by light trypsinization (a treatment that does not affect cell surface levels of CEA) and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% fetal bovine serum (PBSF). 2.5 × 105 cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit or monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies (J22) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBSF for 35 min on ice. Cells were washed with 2.5 ml of PBSF, centrifuged, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBSF containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:100. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were washed, centrifuged, resuspended in 0.75 ml of PBSF, and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACScan® instrument. LR-73 cells were seeded at 1 × 106/80-cm2 culture flask (Nalge Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) in LR-73 growth medium. After 2 days in monolayer culture, the cultures were rendered as single cell suspensions by 3 min of incubation at 37 °C with 0.12% Bacto trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline lacking Mg2+ and Ca2+and containing 15 mm sodium citrate. The cells were incubated at 106 cells/ml in α minimum essential medium containing 0.8% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml DNase I at 37 °C with stirring at 100 rpm (29Benchimol S. Fuks A. Jothy S. Beauchemin N. Shirota K. Stanners C.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The percentage of cells remaining as single cells, which declines over time because of formation of aggregates, was determined as a function of time by visual counting using a hemocytometer. To initiate fusion and differentiation, L6 cultures were seeded at 104cells/cm2 at day 0 in 60- or 35-mm tissue culture Petri dishes or 7 × 103 cells/cm2 in multiwell plastic chamber slides (Nalge Nunc Inc.) and grown in GM. The medium was replaced after 3 days with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% horse serum (differentiation medium (DM)), and the cells were cultured for an additional 5–7 days. To co-culture L6 (CEA) and L6 (ΔNCEA) cell transfectants, cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells of each type per 35-mm plastic tissue culture Petri dish in GM. 24 h later the medium was replaced with DM. For fusion index determinations, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with hematoxylin. The fusion index was calculated as the percentage of total nuclei contained in fused myotubes having more than three nuclei/myotube, as described previously (20Eidelman F.J. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Taheri M. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fusion determinations were repeated three times (independent experiments) for each of two independently obtained transfectant populations for each mutant. The values reported in Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 represent the averages of these determinations. As a biochemical measure of myogenic differentiation, cells were fixed in methanol:acetone (3:7) at −20 °C and processed for immunofluorescent staining with anti-myosin mAb (31De Giovanni C. Lollini P.L. Dolccetti R. Landuzzi L. Nicoletti G. D'Andrea E. Scotland K. Nanni P. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To study the effect of cyclized or linearly blocked peptides on the CEA-mediated L6 differentiation block, cells were seeded at 7 × 103 cells/cm2 in 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc Inc.) in GM on day 0. After 3 days of incubation, the medium was replaced with DM-containing peptide at the indicated concentrations. Rabbit polyclonal anti-CEA antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies (A20, B18, and D14) (30Zhou H. Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3817-3822PubMed Google Scholar) were purified with the Bio-Rad Affi-Gel protein A MAPS II kit. Antibodies were added to differentiation medium to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Fab fragments of monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies were prepared as described previously (30Zhou H. Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3817-3822PubMed Google Scholar). Fab fragments were added to differentiation medium to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The values for fusion indices shown in Fig. 10 represent the averages of three independent determinations. To explore the nature of the intermolecular interactions involved in the CEA-mediated block of the myogenic differentiation of L6 myoblasts (20Eidelman F.J. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Taheri M. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), experiments were carried out to distinguish the requirements for parallel versusantiparallel intermolecular binding. For antiparallel interactions, non-differentiating stable L6 (CEA) transfectants were co-cultured with differentiation competent L6 (ΔNCEA) transfectants. ΔNCEA is a CEA cDNA deletion mutant lacking two-thirds of the amino-terminal domain (from amino acid 32 to 106) and is completely defective in mediating both intercellular adhesion (9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the differentiation block of L6 myoblasts (20Eidelman F.J. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Taheri M. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). CEA-expressing cells can bind to ΔNCEA-expressing cells, consistent with the model that the amino-terminal domain (intact in CEA) on a CEA-expressing cell can bind to the A3B3 domain (intact in ΔNCEA) on a juxtaposed ΔNCEA-expressing cell by an antiparallel mechanism (9Zhou H. Fuks A. Alcaraz G. Bolling T.J. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). If such antiparallel interactions are sufficient for the differentiation blocking function of CEA, the CEA-expressing myoblasts should be able to “trans-inhibit” the differentiation of the ΔNCEA-expressing myoblasts. Co-culturing CEA-expressing L6 cells with an equal number of ΔNCEA-expressing L6 cells inhibited the overall differentiation (assessed by fusion into multinucleated myotubes) to a significantly lower level than co-culturing the same CEA-expressing cells with an equal number of non-CEA-expressing parental L6 cells for which trans-binding mediated by CEA would be impossible (Fig.1). The latter co-culture controls for the dilution of differentiating cells with non-differentiating L6 (CEA) cells. This experiment therefore supports the contention that antiparallel CEA-CEA interactions between cells are sufficient for the CEA-imposed myogenic differentiation block. To test for the role of parallel CEA-CEA interactions on the same cell surface, differentiation-competent L6 (ΔNCEA) transfectants were treated with cross-linking polyclonal and monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies. Antibodies for which the binding epitopes are still intact in the ΔNCEA molecule, rabbit polyclonal and D14 (binding epitope at the B2-A3 junction (30Zhou H. Stanners C.P. Fuks A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3817-3822PubMed Google Scholar)), converted ΔNCEA to a differentiation blocking molecule, whereas control antibodies directed to binding epitopes that are missing in ΔNCEA, A20 and B18, two N domain-specific mAbs (binding epitopes at residues 35–42 in the amino-terminal domain (16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were without effect (Fig.2). To further control for nonspecific effects, one of the effective antibodies, D14, was shown to have no effect on the differentiation of the parental L6 cells (Fig.2). These experiments support the hypothesis that both antiparallel and parallel binding between CEA molecules are involved in the CEA-mediated myogenic differentiation block. Deletions and substitutions in three subdomains of the amino-terminal domain of CEA (Fig.3) were produced by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rationale for choosing these particular subdomains can be summarized as follows. The requirement for amino-terminal domain amino acids 32–106, deleted in mutant ΔNCEA, for the myogenic differentiation block was demonstrated previously (20Eidelman F.J. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Taheri M. Stanners C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Within this deletion, subdomains 1 and 2 were implicated by the fact that mAb A20 can release the CEA-imposed myogenic differentiation block (see “Effects of Monovalent Monoclonal Anti-CEA Antibody Fragments on CEA-mediated Differentiation Block”) and has a binding epitope that bridges them. This epitope includes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of subdomain 1 and the amino-terminal amino acid of subdomain 2 (16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, these subdomains (1 and 2) and subdomain 3 were all shown to be important in CEA-mediated intercellular adhesion in LR-73 cells; all were demonstrated to be adjacent and exposed in a three-dimensional structural model based on the known structures of CD2 (16Taheri M. Saragovi U. Fuks A. Makkerh J. Mort J. Stanners C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26935-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CD4. 3H. U. Saragovi, unpublished data. Pooled stable transfectant clones of L6 cells expressing comparable cell surface levels, as assessed by FACS analysis (Fig.4), were isolated for each of the deletion and substitution mutants.Figure 4FACS distributions relating the number of cells with the level of cell surface expression of wild type and mutantCEA in L6 myoblast transfectant and control (Neo) populations. All cells were labeled with the monoclonal anti-CEA antibody, J22. Immunoreactivity was detected with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Concerning subdomain 1, G30YSWYK, substitutions at the carboxyl terminus, Y34A, the more conservative Y34F, and K35A had a profound effect on the myogenic differentiation blocking activity of CEA, whereas mutation Y31A at the amino terminus had no effect (Fig. 5). As expected, deletion of the entire subdomain 1 (ΔGK) also affected this function of CEA but, curiously, was not as effective as substitutions Y34A and K35A. Similarly, the deletion of subdomain 2, N42RQII, had less effect on CEA function than some of the substitutions within this domain, notably the double mutation Q44R,I46V, for which the degree of differentiation of 100%, a reproducible effect, actually exceeded that of parental L6 cells (Fig. 6). A single mutation at the amino terminus of the subdomain, N42D, partially removed the differentiation blocking activity of CEA. The mouse analogs of subdomains 1 and 2, in a crystallized soluble mouse construct of CEACAM1 consisting of the amino-terminal domain linked to one internal domain, have been shown by Tan et al.(32Tan K. Zelus B.D. Meijers R. Liu J. Bergelson J.M. Duke N. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Holmes K.V. Wang J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2076-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus"
https://openalex.org/W1995500930,"HMGA proteins are thought to be causally involved in the progression of different diseases, including benign and malignant tumors, obesity, arteriosclerosis, and restenosis. As HMGA proteins are architectural transcription factors, their binding to DNA leads to changes in DNA-conformation modulating the environment for the assembly and function of transcriptional complexes, thus influencing the expression of a huge variety of genes. Despite the emerging role of HMGA proteins for important diseases, only limited information is available about mechanisms regulating the expression of the HMGA2 gene. In this report, 2240 bp of the 5' flanking region of the HMGA2 gene were functionally analyzed by luciferase assay experiments. Besides the identification of novel positive and negative regulatory elements, it was shown that transcription is initiated from two independent promoter regions within cell lines HeLa, MCF7, and L14TSV40. Furthermore, a functional polymorphic dinucleotide repeat (TCTCT(TC)(n)) 500 bp upstream of the ATG translational start codon was found to regulate strongly the human HMGA2 promoter with an activation pattern that correlates to its TC-repeat length."
https://openalex.org/W1994660893,"d-Tyr-tRNATyrdeacylase is an editing enzyme that removes d-tyrosine and other d-amino acids from charged tRNAs, thereby preventing incorrect incorporation of d-amino acids into proteins. A model for the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is proposed based on the crystal structure of the enzyme from Haemophilus influenzae determined at a 1.64-Å resolution. Structural comparison of this dimeric enzyme with the very similar structure of the enzyme from Escherichia coli together with sequence analyses indicate that the active site is located in the dimer interface within a depression that includes an invariant threonine residue, Thr-80. The active site contains an oxyanion hole formed by the main chain nitrogen atoms of Thr-80 and Phe-79 and the side chain amide group of the invariant Gln-78. The Michaelis complex between the enzyme and d-Tyr-tRNA was modeled assuming a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of d-Tyr by the Thr-80 Oγ atom and a role for the oxyanion hole in stabilizing the negatively charged tetrahedral transition states. The model is consistent with all of the available data on substrate specificity. Based on this model, we propose a substrate-assisted acylation/deacylation-catalytic mechanism in which the amino group of the d-Tyr is deprotonated and serves as the general base. d-Tyr-tRNATyrdeacylase is an editing enzyme that removes d-tyrosine and other d-amino acids from charged tRNAs, thereby preventing incorrect incorporation of d-amino acids into proteins.

Recently, the crystal structure ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase from Escherichia coli has been determined (5Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol.

They also proposed that conserved positively charged residues at positions 48, 53, 87, and 90 interact with negatively charged phosphate groups on the tRNA. However, none of the publications so far present a proposal for the catalytic mechanism. The d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase structure fromHaemophilus influenzae (HI0670 according to the The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) numbering scheme (6Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J. Tomb J.F. Dougherty B.A. Merrick J.M. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4677) Google Scholar)) reported here is similar to that from E. coli. A comparison of the two structures together with modeling of the enzyme/d-Tyr-tRNA complex provides the structural basis for a proposed catalytic mechanism and explains all of the enzyme specificity data that have been reported. The gene encoding HI0670 was amplified from chromosomal DNA of H. influenzae Rd KW20 and cloned into the pET17b (Novagen) for expression of the native polypeptide inE. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At mid-log phase (A600 = 0.8), expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth continued for 4 h. Harvested cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and lysed with three passes at 8,000–10,000 p.s.i. in a French press. After clarification of the cell lysate by high speed centrifugation, the protein was purified with the use of a BioCAD 700E chromatography work station (PerSeptive Biosystems). The purification protocol consisted of two steps. The first step employed an anion exchange column (Poros HQ 50) at pH 8.4, and the second step employed a cation exchange column (Poros HS 20) at pH 8.0. The integrity of the purified protein was assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. The pooled fractions of HI0670 were concentrated (∼3 mg/ml) and dialyzed at 4 °C against solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Protein crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction work were formed during dialysis. The molecular weight of HI0670 was verified by MALDI mass spectrometry (Voyager, PerSeptive Biosystems) (Mr = 15,861.7 observed and 15,862.3 calculated). Thermal stability was examined with the use of circular dichroism at 208 nm, revealing a stable protein with aTm = 64 °C. The protein exists in solution predominantly in dimeric form as determined by sedimentation equilibrium measurement. It is worth noting that our initial attempts to express the HI0670 as a thrombin-cleavable His-tagged protein resulted in an insoluble product. With hindsight, the folding of the polypeptide chain was impaired because the N-terminal amino group is buried and forms essential contacts with three carboxylate groups. The HI0670 crystals belong to space group P41212, and the asymmetric unit contains 1 molecule and 55% solvent. For diffraction data collection, crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K from a solution containing the dialysis buffer and 20% glycerol. Data were collected using both a home x-ray facility and the IMCA-CAT 17-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The home CuKαx-ray source was a Siemens rotating anode equipped with MAR345 image plate. The IMCA-CAT beamline was equipped with a MAR CCD detector. Data processing was performed using the HKL program suite (7Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). A single crystal was soaked with buffer containing 4 mmethyl mercury phosphate for 2 days, and 2.0-Å resolution diffraction data were collected on the home x-ray source. The data were non-isomorphous with the native data; thus, the phases were determined using solely the mercury anomalous signal.

D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). The mercury-derivative anomalous difference Patterson map revealed a single peak (>8 ς). The computer program MLPHARE (9Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1991: 80-86Google Scholar) was used to refine the position and occupancy of the heavy atom and to calculate phases. The phases were further improved by solvent-flattening using the computer program DM (10Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The resulting electron density map was excellent, showing the molecular boundaries, unambiguous secondary structural elements, and clear density for the side chains. Most of the 144-residue polypeptide chain (93%) was traced automatically using the computer program Arp/Warp (11Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). Building of the remaining residues and adjustments to the model were carried out with the interactive computer graphics program O (12Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station. Following the structure determination, a native data set was collected to a resolution of 1.64Å on the IMCA-CAT beamline (Table I) and used for structure refinement. Refinement of the HI0670 structure was carried out using the CNS program (13Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Open table in a new tab A model of the enzyme/d-Tyr-tRNATyr complex was built on a Silicon Graphics Octane work station using the computer program TURBO-FRODO (14Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO, version 4.3. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar). Because no structure for tRNATyr is available, the structure of yeast tRNAPhe (Protein Data Bank code 1ehz) (15Shi H. Moore P.B. RNA. 2000; 6: 1091-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) was used. H. influenzaetRNATyr contains 85 nucleotides, whereas tRNAPhe of both yeast and H. influenzae contain 76 nucleotides (www.tigr.org). Thus, structural differences between the two are expected. Yet, all of the known tRNA structures have a similarl-shaped structure with an unpaired 3′-terminal CCA sequence at the acceptor stem. It is the 3′-CCA region that is expected to undergo conformational changes to fit in the active site of the deacylase. The d-Tyr-tRNA was built by linkingd-tyrosine to the O3′ atom of adenosine 76 (A76). After manual adjustments to the 3′-CCA-d-Tyr conformation as described under “Results and Discussion,” energy minimization of the modeled tRNA was carried out using CNS. The final model of HI0670 includes all 144 amino acid residues and 207 water molecules. The quality of the electron density map is shown in Fig. 1, focused on the region of the proposed active site. For the mercury-soaked crystal, the data show that the mercury atom is bound to Cys-133. The N-terminal amino group (Met-1) is buried, interacting with the carboxyl groups of Glu-34, Asp-37, and the C terminus. The molecules pack into closely associated dimers around the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis (Fig. 2). The fold is the same as that of the E. colid-Tyr-tRNA deacylase (Protein Data Bank code 1jke) (5Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47285-47290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each monomer contains a five-stranded mixed twisted β-sheet and a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. The dimer packing results in the three-stranded β-sheets of two monomers forming a continuous six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet, and the pair of five-stranded β-sheets forms a β-sandwich with a central axis roughly perpendicular to the six-stranded β-sheet. Two parallel α-helices cover each of the five-stranded β-sheets. A large loop (residues 83–94) extends from each monomer to interact with the neighboring molecule. Although Ferri-Fioni et al. (5Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47285-47290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) list structural similarities between portions of the molecule and segments of other proteins (5Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47285-47290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we note that these correspond to small common motifs and are not extensive enough to imply evolutionary relationship. Thus, based on Dali (16Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar), the fold is unique to d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase. The H. influenzae and E. coli deacylases share a 67% sequence identity, and their polypeptide chains align well with one another. Excluding one residue that is deleted in H. influenzae HI0670 compared with the E. coli enzyme (residue 117), the superposition of the Cα atoms of the monomers results in root mean square (r.m.s.)1 deviation of 0.6 Å, and for the respective dimers (using dimer AD of the E. coli enzyme structure), the r.m.s. deviation is 0.5 Å. When dimer BC of the E. coli deacylase structure is compared, the r.m.s. deviation values for monomers and dimers are 0.7 and 0.6 Å, respectively. The positions of some water molecules are also conserved in theH. influenzae and E. coli enzyme structures. The superposition of HI0670 and the E. coli AD dimers shows seven pairs of water molecules within 0.2 Å, 15 pairs within 0.2–0.5 Å, and 25 pairs within 0.5–1.0 Å. For the BC dimer, there are 4, 18, and 23 paired water molecules within the corresponding distances. The best matched water molecules are either buried or involved in bridging hydrogen bonds between protein main chain atoms. As reported earlier (5Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47285-47290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 3) and structure analysis show a cluster of invariant residues located in a surface depression at a dimer interface region. The dimer contains two such sites ∼20 Å apart on the opposite sides of the dimer interface, and these are probably the active sites of the enzyme. In the following discussion, residues located on the symmetry-related molecule are labeled by anasterisk. Much of the postulated active site depression is lined with hydrophobic residues including four phenylalanines, Phe-79, Phe-93, Phe-124, and Phe-140* (Fig.4A). Invariant polar residues in the active site are Arg-7*, Ser-77, Gln-78, and The-80. Ferri-Fioni et al. (5Ferri-Fioni M.L. Schmitt E. Soutourina J. Plateau P. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47285-47290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) also noted four conserved positively charged residues, two at the edge of the putative active site (Arg/Lys-53* and Lys-90) and two at a more remote location (Arg/Lys-48* and Lys-87, although position 87 is sometimes occupied by a serine or an alanine), which may play a role in tRNA recognition. Although they identify the location of the active site, the authors did not suggest which are the catalytic residues nor did they propose a catalytic mechanism. Structural considerations, modeling, and inferences from the mechanisms of other hydrolytic enzymes enabled us to develop a proposal for the catalytic mechanism as described below. Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis often involves a general base mechanism with an enzyme group mounting a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate and a group that serves as a proton park, enabling shuttling of protons from and to the nucleophilic group during catalysis. This is a two-step reaction with an acyl enzyme intermediate and two tetrahedral transition states, one en route to the acyl enzyme intermediate and the second along the deacylation step when the hydrolytic water molecule attacks. We propose thatd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase utilizes such a general base mechanism. Two invariant residues in the active site need to be considered as potential nucleophilic groups, Ser-77 and Thr-80. Ser-77 is rather buried, whereas Thr-80 is accessible to solvent. Moreover, a striking oxyanion hole is located adjacent to Thr-80 (but not adjacent to Ser-77) formed by the side chain amide group of the invariant Gln-78 and the main chain nitrogen atoms of Phe79 and Thr80 (Fig.4A). The presence of an oxyanion hole is reminiscent of the catalytic machinery of other hydrolytic enzymes such as the serine and thiol proteases and the serine β-lactamases (17Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 18Herzberg O. Moult J. Science. 1987; 236: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Similarly to Gln-78 of the deacylase, a glutamine or an asparagine amide group participates in the formation of the oxyanion hole in papain and subtilisin, respectively. The oxyanion hole plays a role along the reaction pathway by stabilizing the negatively charged transition states. With these considerations in mind, the Michaelis complex between HI0670 and the aminoacyl-tRNA was modeled following the hypothesis that Thr-80 is the nucleophilic group. Note that in the E. coli enzyme structure, the oxyanion hole of molecule A is shielded from solvent by Phe-79 side chain adopting a conformation different from that seen in molecule D or in the structure of HI0670. We propose that the active conformation is the one exposing the oxyanion hole to solvent. To enable nucleophilic attack, the χ1 dihedral angle of Thr-80 was rotated by 120° so that the Oγ atom is accessible to solvent. The tRNA molecule (consisting of the 76-nucleotide-long tRNAPhe) linked to d-Tyr via an ester bond on the O3′ of ribose 76 was manually positioned so that the carbonyl group of the d-Tyr faced the Thr-80 Oγ atom and the oxygen atom was accommodated in the oxyanion hole. The dihedral angles of the 3′-terminal segment, C74-C75-A76-d-Tyr, were modified to avoid clashes and to form favorable electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. A tRNA orientation that permits potential interactions between phosphate groups and the conserved positively charged residues at positions 48*, 53*, 87, and 90 were selected (Fig.5). Modeling was followed by energy minimization, moving only the tRNA 71–76-d-Tyr segment and imposing harmonic restraint on the distance between the Thr-80 Oγ atom and the d-Tyr carbonyl carbon atom (modeled somewhat arbitrarily at 2.5 Å) to prevent repulsion because of the short contact expected to precede nucleophilic attack. The key interactions in the active site are shown in Fig.4B. The base-stacking interactions of the C74, C75, and A76 seen in the crystal structure of free tRNA are eliminated. Instead, a cluster of edge-to-face interactions is formed between the bases and the active site phenylalanine residues. The aromatic ring of thed-Tyr is also part of this cluster, stacking parallel to A76 and perpendicular to the benzene ring of Phe-79. An ion pair interaction is formed between the invariant Arg7* and the A76 phosphodiester group. The O2′ hydroxyl of ribose 76 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-137*. Most strikingly, the amino nitrogen ofd-Tyr is buried in an environment that is largely hydrophobic (Phe-93, Phe-140*,Val-138*, and Met-62*) with the exception of its interactions with the O2 of the C75 base and with the Thr-80 Oγ atom. The position and orientation ofd-Tyr amino group suggest that it binds in a deprotonated state by either dissipating a proton to solvent or donating it to the O2 atom of C75. Therefore, d-Tyr amino group may serve as a general base, accepting a proton from the catalytic Thr-80 Oγ atom. The model of the complex reveals that the basis for discrimination in favor of d-amino acids is space exclusion, i.e.l-amino acids would clash badly with protein groups. On the other hand, any d-amino acid may be accommodated because the side chain projects toward solvent. The model explains another experimental observation, that is the enzyme is inactive towardN-acetyl blocked d-aminoacylated tRNAs (2Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) because the amino group is buried in a crowded environment and additional atoms would not fit in the space. The model indicates that catalysis is substrate-assisted (Fig.6). The hydroxyl group of Thr-80 mounts a nucleophilic attack on the d-Tyr carbonyl carbon atom. The amino nitrogen atom of d-Tyr is deprotonated and is located in an appropriate position to accept a proton from Thr-80, thus serving as a general base. A negatively charged tetrahedral transition state is formed at the d-Tyr carbonyl carbon stabilized by the oxyanion hole. The d-Tyr-tRNA ester bond breaks, yielding an acyl enzyme. The tRNA molecule diffuses out of the active site, whereas the d-Tyr remains bound to the enzyme. A water molecule next attacks the acyl enzyme, replacing the departing tRNA ribose 76 O3′ atom, and the amino nitrogen atom ofd-Tyr serves again as the base that accepts a proton from the activated water molecule. The ester bond between the enzyme andd-Tyr is cleaved, and free enzyme is generated for the next catalytic cycle. We note that substrate-assisted catalysis has been reported previously (19Dall'Acqua W. Carter P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and deprotonated amino groups have been observed in proteins when shielded from solvent (20Stites W.E. Gittis A.G. Lattman E.E. Shortle D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The role of the invariant Ser-77 remains unclear. In both the H. influenzae and E. coli enzymes, Ser-77 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule (Wat265 and Wat1115 in the Protein Data Bank entries 1j7g and 1jke, respectively), which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to a second water molecule (Wat223 and Wat1384 in 1j7gand 1jke, respectively). Wat265 is also hydrogen-bonded to the main chain nitrogen of Ala-125, a residue on a type II reverse turn located on the edge of the active site depression. According to our model, neither of the water molecules needs to be displaced when the substrate binds and Wat223 is located ∼5.5 Å from the modeledd-Tyr carbonyl carbon atom. It is tempting to speculate that Wat223 may serve as the hydrolytic water molecule and that Ser-77 hydroxyl group together with the main chain amide of Ala-125 and Wat265 help maintain the polar environment despite being somewhat shielded from the bulk solvent by the side chains of Phe-79 and Phe-124. Detailed structural analyses and modeling provide the basis for the proposed catalytic mechanism of an important enzyme that helps maintain the fidelity of protein synthesis,d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. The modeled enzyme-tRNA complex is consistent with all of the available enzyme specificity data. The proposed catalytic pathway follows the general base mechanism seen in other hydrolytic enzymes. In the deacylase, Thr-80 hydroxyl serves as the nucleophilic group, there is an oxyanion hole to stabilize the negatively charged tetrahedral transition state, and the reaction is substrate-assisted by the amino group ofd-Tyr, providing a “proton park” for the Thr-80 hydroxyl group. The enzyme-tRNA complex model and the proposed catalytic mechanism could not be developed without an accurate atomic structure of the enzyme. Moreover, the model suggests future experiments that should be carried out to elucidate the mechanism experimentally. Finally, the crystal structure of the enzyme-tRNA complex will reveal the exact interactions in the active site and validate or refute the proposed mechanism."

The present study has extended our understanding of the molecular mechanism of regulation of CCR5 promoter activity by adding YY1 as the first transcriptional repressor of the promoter. We further demonstrated that overexpression of YY1 actually down-regulates cell surface CCR5 expression and infectibility by R5-HIV-1.We have previously demonstrated that YY1 down-regulates the promoter for CXCR4, another major co-receptor for HIV-1 (3Moriuchi M.

Green M.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 905-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, YY1 associates with cyclophilin A, which may be critical for maturation and uncoating of HIV-1 virions through its interaction with Gag (4Yang W-.M. Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15187-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together with the present study, it is reasonable to consider that the YY1 transcription factor plays important roles in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease (Fig.6). Further investigations to delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate expression of HIV coreceptors and to develop therapeutic interventions using anti-HIV-1 host factor(s) such as YY1 are warranted. YY1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates a number of cellular and viral promoters, depending on the gene as well as the cell type in question (reviewed in Ref. 1Shrivastava A.

Virology. 2000; 273: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Levels of its expression appear to be critical for infectibility by R5 HIV-1 (6Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. et al.J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) or rate of disease progression in infected individuals (7Reynes J. Portales P. Segondy M. Baillat V. Andre P. Avinens O. Picot M-.C. Clot J. Eliaou J-.F. Corbeau P. AIDS. 2001; 15: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have cloned and characterized the promoter region of CCR5 and identified several transcription factors that transactivate it (8Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5441-5449PubMed Google Scholar, 9Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. Fauci A.S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1433-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8639-8642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that YY1 down-regulates CCR5 expression, and overexpression of YY1 reduces cell surface CCR5 expression and infectibility by R5-HIV-1, further emphasizing its importance in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that the YY1 transcription factor can down-regulate expression of CCR5 at the promoter level. Levels of CCR5 expression appear to correlate well with infectibility of CD4+ T cells by R5 HIV-1 (6Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. et al.J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and rate of disease progression (7Reynes J. Portales P. Segondy M. Baillat V. Andre P. Avinens O. Picot M-.C. Clot J. Eliaou J-.F. Corbeau P. AIDS. 2001; 15: 1627-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Expression of CCR5 appears to be highly regulated by a number of cytokines, cell activation, or differentiation (16Bleul C.C. Wu L. Hoxie J.A. Springer T.A. Mackay C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1925-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 17Sozzani S. Ghezzi S. Iannolo G. et al.J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 18Wang J. Roderiquez G. Oravecz T. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7642-7647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Thivierge M. Le Gouill C. Tremblay M.J. Stankova J. Rola- Pleszczynski M.

At the promoter level, several transcription factors have been demonstrated to up-regulate CCR5 expression, including p65 (RelA) (21Liu R. Zhao X. Gurney T.A. Landau N.R. AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir. 1998; 14: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), C/EBP-β (22Rosati M. Valentin A. Patenaude D.J. Pavlakis G.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1654-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), GATA-1 (9Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. Fauci A.S. Blood. 1999; 93: 1433-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Octamer (10Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8639-8642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present study has extended our understanding of the molecular mechanism of regulation of CCR5 promoter activity by adding YY1 as the first transcriptional repressor of the promoter. We further demonstrated that overexpression of YY1 actually down-regulates cell surface CCR5 expression and infectibility by R5-HIV-1.We have previously demonstrated that YY1 down-regulates the promoter for CXCR4, another major co-receptor for HIV-1 (3Moriuchi M. Moriuchi H. Margolis D.M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5986-5992PubMed Google Scholar). YY1 is also known to down-regulate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter (2Margolis D.M. Somasundaran M. Green M.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 905-910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, YY1 associates with cyclophilin A, which may be critical for maturation and uncoating of HIV-1 virions through its interaction with Gag (4Yang W-.M. Inouye C.J. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15187-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Taken together with the present study, it is reasonable to consider that the YY1 transcription factor plays important roles in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease (Fig.6). Further investigations to delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate expression of HIV coreceptors and to develop therapeutic interventions using anti-HIV-1 host factor(s) such as YY1 are warranted. In this study we have demonstrated that the YY1 transcription factor can down-regulate expression of CCR5 at the promoter level.

https://openalex.org/W2024254530,"Activation of caspases has been demonstrated to be involved in thrombocytopenia and prolonged storage of platelet concentrates. Platelets represent enucleate cells that comprise all elements of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. However, no apoptotic stimuli capable of activating the endogenous caspase cascade have been identified so far. Using tributyltin (TBT) we could identify a compound that is capable of activating caspase-9 and -3 in platelets. Recent studies implicate that TBT induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial signaling pathway that is characterized by the formation of a high-molecular-weight complex (apoptosome) containing the adapter protein Apaf-1 and active caspase-9. Interestingly, addition of TBT induced the activation of caspase-9 in an ultra-rapid kinetic within the first 2 min. In addition, size exclusion chromatography revealed that TBT-mediated processing of caspase-9 occurs in the absence of the apoptosome. Thus, these data implicate that TBT induces the activation of caspase-9 by a mechanism not involving the formation of the apoptosome."
