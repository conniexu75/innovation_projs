https://openalex.org/W1557847147,"Abstract The tyrosine hydroxylase activity of tyrosinase from hamster melanoma has been studied by measurement of the release of tritium from tyrosine-3,5-3H. Experiments with mixtures of tyrosine-3,5-3H and tyrosine-14C show that there is little or no tritium rate effect in this reaction. Dopa is the most effective hydrogen donor and will eliminate the lag period when used in catalytic amounts. 2-Amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridine eliminates the lag when it is at a concentration of 2.4 x 10-3 m and shortens the lag at lower concentrations. Substrate quantities of ascorbate, reduced tri- and diphosphopyridine nucleotide, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine do not abolish the lag. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine at high concentration is an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylation, while tyrosine acts as a substrate inhibitor at concentrations above 8 x 10-4 m. The substrate inhibition can be partially reversed by increasing the concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine from the catalytic level to 8 x 10-4 m. Ascorbate magnifies the inhibition by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. Inhibition by cyanide, diethyldithiocarbamate, 5-hydroxyindole, and 5-hydroxy-dl-tryptophan is also reported."

https://openalex.org/W1553453061,"The antigenic distinctiveness of individual organ-specific isoenzymes of human alkaline phosphatase was shown by immunochemical means. A two-step method involving two separate antigen-antibody reactions was utilized to identify and measure the isoenzymes. The first reaction consisted of reaction of the isoenzyme with its antiserum; the second reaction consisted of precipitating the enzyme-antibody complex with anti-γ-globulin. The second reaction was necessary because the enzyme was neither inhibited nor precipitated by specific antibody. By this method, individual isoenzymes could be identified from mixtures of isoenzymes. The results clearly show that antibody to liver phosphatase and antibody to placental phosphatase were specific for their respective homologous antigens, and did not react with alkaline phosphatase from bone, neutrophils, kidney, or intestine. Thus, there are at least three antigenic types of alkaline phosphatases: one derived from liver, one from placenta, and one or more from other organs."

https://openalex.org/W2058777313,Human leukemic cells with a marker (Philadelphia; Ph1) chromosome gave rise to granulocytic and mononuclear cell colonies when grown in vitro. All metaphases from a single colony were either Ph1 positive or Ph1 negative. No colonies contained a mixed cell population. This suggests that leukemic and normal cells exist simultaneously and that in vitro colonies are clonal in origin.
https://openalex.org/W1519022180,"Artificial spherules of phospholipid were prepared with and without cholesterol present, so as to sequester anions (H2PO4- or CrO4=) or glucose. The effect of several polyene antibiotics upon release of anions or glucose was determined, and it was found that, whereas filipin and etruscomycin released similar amounts of these markers whether or not cholesterol was preincorporated into the spherules, amphotericin B and nystatin were far more effective when cholesterol was preincorporated. Ergosterol could be substituted for cholesterol. Release of anions or glucose from spherules by other membrane-active agents, such as etiocholanolone, deoxycorticosterone, diethylstilbestrol, streptolysin S, or Triton X-100, was unaffected by the presence or the absence of cholesterol. It was found that an ovolecithin to cholesterol ratio of 15:1 was optimal for release of markers both by filipin and by amphotericin B. By electron microscopy, the lamellar substructure of polyene-disrupted spherules was seen to be altered. Whereas filipin or deoxycorticosterone induced such morphological changes in spherules prepared with and without cholesterol, amphotericin B produced morphological changes only in spherules formed in the presence of cholesterol. These studies support the hypotheses that polyene antibiotics interact with purified lipids present in biological membranes and that amphotericin B and nystatin preferentially disrupt membranous structures which contain cholesterol. They also show that filipin and etruscomycin disrupt spherules of pure phospholipid prepared in the absence of cholesterol, and thereby suggest qualitative differences in the mode of action of the several polyene antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W1482860927,"The positions of the disulfide linkages of the kallikrein inactivator have been established. Disulfide bonds link half-cystine residues 5 and 55, 14 and 38, and 30 and 51. Reduction of these disulfide linkages yielded a completely inactive molecule. By slow oxidation of the reduced kallikrein inactivator, activity could be nearly completely restored."
https://openalex.org/W2093179889,"A microcytotoxicity test has been used to detect a factor cytotoxic for human sarcoma cells; the factor was found in serums from 70 percent of sarcoma patients, 58 percent of their family members, and 8 percent of serums from normal blood donors. This cytotoxin is an antibody against a common cell surface sarcoma antigen since it is specific for sarcoma cells, is complement dependent, and is extractable with the globulin fraction of serum."
https://openalex.org/W1995651382,"Antiserums to a purified cell membrane component from a Burkitt's lymphoma tissue culture cell line were produced in rabbits. These antiserums were cytotoxic to peripheral white blood cells from 8 of 15 patients with acute leukemia and 5 of 41 relatives, but not to peripheral white blood cells from leukemia patients in clinical remission or from normal individuals. These antiserums appear to be detecting an acute leukemia associated antigen or antigens."

These structures connect plasma membranes of adjacent cells and join surfaces of approximating pseudopodia on the same cell; they also appear to be present in cortical areas of the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W1526696419,"Determination of the complete amino acid sequence of wheat germ cytochrome c has shown that the molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain of 112 residues. On alignment with mammalian cytochromes, the peptide chain extends for 8 residues at the NH2-terminal end. In contrast with other cytochromes that have a peptide chain longer than 104 residues, the NH2-terminal residue is N-acetylalanine. Wheat germ cytochrome c contains 8 residues of proline, 4 of which occur in positions not occupied by a proline residue in any of the previously studied cytochromes. Considering only residues 1 through 104, the cytochrome c of wheat germ differs from that of Neurospora crassa in 46 residues, whereas it differs from that of human heart in only 35 residues. For all presently known cytochromes c, the number of amino acid residues which occupy the same position in the sequences is reduced to 35."

https://openalex.org/W1561974825,"Abstract It was found that 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine could act as a cofactor required by tryptophan hydroxylase partially purified from a microsome-free, final supernatant fraction of neoplastic murine mast cells. The enzyme preparation obtained was free from 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase and phenylalanine hydroxylase. Kinetic studies and pH optima established differences between the mast cell enzyme and that from rat liver."

https://openalex.org/W1567972018,Basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor with disulfide bond 14–38 reduced by borohydride was reacted with sulfhydryl group reagents. The reduced inhibitor and the dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) derivatives retained inhibitory activity toward both trypsin and α-chymotrypsin. The carboxamidomethyl and aminoethyl derivatives were active toward trypsin but inactive with α-chymotrypsin. The p-mercuribenzoate and p-mercuribenzenesulfonate derivatives were partially active toward trypsin and inactive toward α-chymotrypsin. The carboxymethyl and N-ethylmaleimide derivatives were inactive toward both enzymes. The carboxamidomethyl and aminoethyl derivatives inhibited trypsin temporarily and were gradually digested by the enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2064785231,"USING labelled amino-acids and chromatographic techniques, it has been shown that 5-hydroxytryptophan is an intermediate in the conversion of tryptophan to the physiologically important base 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) in higher animals1,2. The hydroxylation of tryptophan in the 5 position has also been demonstrated in Chromobacterium violaceum3 and in tissue slices of Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon)4."
https://openalex.org/W2089849179,"Neurones located 200 to 300 microns from the surface of the auricular lobe of the frog cerebellar cortex, and identified as Purkinje cells, were activated antidromically from the eighth cranial nerve. A parallel anatomical study confirmed the existence of this projection. On the basis of these findings the existence of a cerebello-vestibular efferent system is postulated, the precise significance of which is as yet unclear. However, since Purkinje cells in other species have an inhibitory action on their target cells, the Purkinje efferent system to the vestibular organ may have an action similar to that ascribed to the olivo-cochlear bundle upon the cochlea, that is, to serve as an inhibitory control system."
https://openalex.org/W1991854087,"MANY psychotropic drugs have been shown to interfere with monoamine metabolism in the brain1,2. Recently, interest has been focused on tryptophan and 5-hydroxy-tryptamine metabolism in mental depression3,4. During combined treatment with tryptophan and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in healthy volunteers, mental effects described as drunkenness and hyperreflexia appeared5. In schizophrenic patients, the same combination of drugs caused central nervous stimulation and varying effects on the disease symptoms6–8 (reviewed in ref. 9). In contrast, 5-hydroxytryptophan also in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor is reported to have no such effects on schizophrenic patients7,10. This discrepancy may depend on an accumulation of tryptamine after treatment with MAOI and tryptophan but not 5-hydroxytryptophan. Because of these findings we have made therapeutic investigations of schizophrenic patients given single doses of monoamine precursors and at the same time made repeated estimations of acid monoamine metabolites in the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid. Ashcroft et al. have pointed out that ventricular CSF rich in acid monoamine metabolites might reach the lumbar tap site if large amounts of cerebrospinal fluid were tapped11. In our study, however, the concentration of the acid monoamine metabolite which was uninfluenced by the treatments was unaffected by repeated tapping of the lumbar fluid. 5-Hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cerebrospinal fluid were estimated by the methods of Roos12 and Anden, Roos and Werdinius13. Our patients had been in hospital for many years, and 14 days before these studies were undertaken all treatment was stopped."

Recovery from the anemia eliminates the pagophagia."
https://openalex.org/W2087451017,"All of the 128 Sprague-Dawley female rats bled two-thirds of the blood volume at 1, 2, or 3 months after irradiation (50, 170, or 350 roentgens) succumbed to leukemia by 16 months after bleeding. Some nonbled irradiated rats developed leukemia possibly as a result of triggering by a radiation-induced anemia. The threshold leukemogenic x-ray dose is probably below 25 roentgens. Elevated levels of basophils, neutrophils containing the ""pseudo-Pelger"" type nuclear anomaly, and myeloblasts exhibiting Auer rods seen in these animals were generally not found in earlier models of rat myelogenous leukemia."

The Ishihara Test (second edition: 24 plates) was used under north daylight conditions, and all the children in five schools were tested. Two of the schools were in the city of Canterbury, two in agricultural communities and one in a Kentish coalfield village. The children ranged in age from 4.5 to 11.0+ years. “Colour blind” responses to 12/16 plates of figures and/or all the “path tracing” plates were required for a diagnosis of colour blindness. The frequencies found were as shown in Table 1."
