https://openalex.org/W2021540849,"Nipah virus, first recognized in 1999, is an emerging disease that causes fatal encephalitis in humans. Its natural host is thought to be the fruit bat but it is also found in pigs and other animals. It could pose a serious threat to the pig-farming industry and there is recent evidence of human-to-human transmission. A crucial receptor that the virus relies on to infect human cells has now been identified, suggesting ways that the infection might be countered by vaccines or drugs. The virus's attachment protein binds to the ephrinB2 receptor. This receptor is critical for normal vascular developmental processes and is present in tissues targeted by Nipah virus. The enzyme EphB4 can block the entry of the virus into the cell. Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in up to 70 per cent of infected patients1, and there is evidence of human–to–human transmission2. Endothelial syncytia, comprised of multinucleated giant-endothelial cells, are frequently found in NiV infections, and are mediated by the fusion (F) and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. Identification of the receptor for this virus will shed light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and spur the rational development of effective therapeutics. Here we report that ephrinB2, the membrane-bound ligand for the EphB class of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)3, specifically binds to the attachment (G) glycoprotein of NiV. Soluble Fc-fusion proteins of ephrinB2, but not ephrinB1, effectively block NiV fusion and entry into permissive cell types. Moreover, transfection of ephrinB2 into non-permissive cells renders them permissive for NiV fusion and entry. EphrinB2 is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons3,4, which is consistent with the known cellular tropism for NiV5. Significantly, we find that NiV-envelope-mediated infection of microvascular endothelial cells and primary cortical rat neurons is inhibited by soluble ephrinB2, but not by the related ephrinB1 protein. Cumulatively, our data show that ephrinB2 is a functional receptor for NiV."

Cdk2 is the main target of p27 (refs 2, 3) and therefore we hypothesized that loss of Cdk2 activity should modify the p27(-/-) mouse phenotype. Here, we show that although p27(-/-) Cdk2(-/-) mice developed ovary tumours and tumours in the anterior lobe of the pituitary, we failed to detect any functional complementation in p27(-/-) Cdk2(-/-) double-knockout mice, indicating a parallel pathway regulated by p27. We observed elevated levels of S phase and mitosis in tissues of p27(-/-) Cdk2(-/-) mice concomitantly with elevated Cdc2 activity in p27(-/-) Cdk2(-/-) extracts. p27 binds to Cdc2, cyclin B1, cyclin A2, or suc1 complexes in wild-type and Cdk2(-/-) extracts. In addition, cyclin E binds to and activates Cdc2. Our in vivo results provide strong evidence that Cdc2 may compensate the loss of Cdk2 function."

https://openalex.org/W2082777374,"BAY 43-9006, a multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf, prevents tumor cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits diverse human tumor xenografts in vivo. The mechanism of action of BAY 43-9006 remains incompletely defined. In the present study, the effects of BAY 43-9006 on the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 were examined. Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with BAY 43-9006 diminished Mcl-1 levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner without affecting other Bcl-2 family members. Similar BAY 43-9006-induced Mcl-1 downregulation was observed in ACHN (renal cell), HT-29 (colon), MDA-MB-231 (breast), KMCH (cholangiocarcinoma), Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and MEC-2 (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cells. Mcl-1 mRNA levels did not change in BAY 43-9006-treated cells. Instead, BAY 43-9006 enhanced proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation. This Mcl-1 downregulation was followed by mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase activation as well as enhanced sensitivity to other proapoptotic agents. The caspase inhibitor Boc-D-fmk inhibited BAY 43-9006-induced caspase activation but not cytochrome c release. In contrast, Mcl-1 overexpression inhibited cytochrome c release and other features of BAY 43-9006-induced apoptosis. Conversely, Mcl-1 downregulation by short hairpin RNA enhanced BAY 43-9006-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that drug-induced Mcl-1 downregulation contributes to the proapoptotic effects of BAY 43-9006."

https://openalex.org/W2041784704,"Zerumbone found in subtropical ginger Zingiber zerumbet Smith exhibits antiproliferative and antiinflammatory activities but underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. As several genes that regulate proliferation and apoptosis are regulated by nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, we hypothesized that zerumbone mediates its activity through the modulation of NF-kappaB activation. We found that zerumbone suppressed NF-kappaB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), okadaic acid, cigarette smoke condensate, phorbol myristate acetate, and H2O2 and that the suppression was not cell type specific. Interestingly, alpha-humulene, a structural analogue of zerumbone lacking the carbonyl group, was completely inactive. Besides being inducible, constitutively active NF-kappaB was also inhibited. NF-kappaB inhibition by zerumbone correlated with sequential suppression of the IkappaBalpha kinase activity, IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, and p65 acylation. Zerumbone also inhibited the NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression activated by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, and IKK but not that activated by the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, such as cyclin D1, COX-2, MMP-9, ICAM-1, c-Myc, survivin, IAP1, IAP2, XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1/A1, TRAF1 and FLIP, were all downregulated by zerumbone. This downregulation led to the potentiation of apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents. Zerumbone's inhibition of expression of these NF-kappaB-regulated genes also correlated with the suppression of TNF-induced invasion activity. Overall, our results indicated that zerumbone inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression induced by carcinogens and that this inhibition may provide a molecular basis for the prevention and treatment of cancer by zerumbone."
https://openalex.org/W2018441339,"When multiple stimuli appear simultaneously in the visual field, they are not processed independently, but rather interact in a mutually suppressive way, suggesting that they compete for neural representation in visual cortex. The biased competition model of selective attention predicts that the competition can be influenced by both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Directed attention has been shown to bias competition in favor of the attended stimulus in extrastriate cortex. Here, we show that suppressive interactions among multiple stimuli are eliminated in extrastriate cortex when they are presented in the context of pop-out displays, in which a single item differs from the others, but not in heterogeneous displays, in which all items differ from each other. The pop-out effects seemed to originate in early visual cortex and were independent of attentional top-down control, suggesting that stimulus context may provide a powerful influence on neural competition in human visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2001505418,"Aberrant activation and upregulation of the Wnt pathway is a key feature of many cancers. Wnt antagonists have recently attracted wide attention. Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (WIF-1) is a secreted antagonist that can bind to Wnt proteins directly and inhibit Wnt signaling pathway. It has been reported that WIF-1 expression is down regulated in several solid tumors and that WIF-1 is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in lung and colorectal cancer. By using RT-PCR, bisulfite sequence analysis, and methylation-specific PCR, we analysed expression and methylation of WIF-1 in cancer cell lines and freshly resected cancer tissues of the esophagus, stomach, colorectum, and pancreas. Downregulation of WIF-1 mRNA expression was observed in 61 (91.0%) of 67 cancer cell lines, 16 (80.0%) of 20 esophageal, 23 (74.2%) of 31 gastric, 41 (82.0%) of 50 colorectal, and six (75.0%) of eight pancreatic cancer tissues. Downregulation of WIF-1 expression was also observed at protein level. No significant association between WIF-1 downregulation and clinicopathological characteristics was found, suggesting that downregulation of WIF-1 expression is an early event in carcinogenesis of these cancers. Indeed, downregulation of WIF-1 expression was observed in 32 (72.7%) of 44 colorectal adenoma tissues and 18 (78.2%) of 23 early mucosal or submucosal colorectal carcinoma tissues. CpG island hypermethylation in the WIF-1 promoter region correlated with downregulation of WIF-1 expression in cancer cell lines and tissues. Treatment with demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), restored WIF-1 expression in cancer cell lines. A combined treatment of 5-aza-dC and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatinA, restored WIF-1 expression synergistically, indicating the role of cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation in the silencing of the WIF-1 gene. Transfection of the WIF-1 gene construct into TE-1 esophageal cancer cell lines or SW48 colon cancer cell lines lacking WIF-1 expression resulted in a significant inhibition on colony formation, cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. TOPflash assay showed WIF-1 inhibits Wnt canonical signaling in these cell lines. These results suggest tumor suppressive function of WIF-1, due to its ability to inhibit Wnt signaling. Our results suggest that WIF-1 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation is an important mechanism underlying aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in carcinogenesis of the digestive organs. Modulation of the Wnt pathway, through reversal of WIF-1 silencing by demethylating agents, is a potential target for treatment and/or prevention of gastrointestinal cancers."

https://openalex.org/W1975609166,"Recent evidence demonstrates that the anticancer activity of betulinic acid (BetA) can be markedly increased by combination protocols, for example with chemotherapy, ionizing radiation or TRAIL. Since nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), a key regulator of stress-induced transcriptional activation, has been implicated in mediating apoptosis resistance, we investigated the role of NF-κB in BetA-induced apoptosis. Here, we provide for the first time evidence that BetA activates NF-κB in a variety of tumor cell lines. NF-κB DNA-binding complexes induced by BetA consisted of p50 and p65 subunits. Nuclear translocation of p65 was also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. BetA-induced NF-κB activation involved increased IKK activity and phosphorylation of IκB-α at serine 32/36 followed by degradation of IκB-α. Reporter assays revealed that NF-κB activated by BetA is transcriptionally active. Interestingly, inhibition of BetA-induced NF-κB activation by different chemical inhibitors (proteasome inhibitor, antioxidant, IKK inhibitor) attenuated BetA-induced apoptosis. Importantly, specific NF-κB inhibition by transient or stable expression of IκB-α super-repressor inhibited BetA-induced apoptosis in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells, while transient expression of IκB-α super-repressor had no influence on BetA-induced apoptosis in two other cell lines. Thus, our findings that activation of NF-κB by BetA promotes BetA-induced apoptosis in a cell type-specific fashion indicate that NF-κB inhibitors in combination with BetA would have no therapeutic benefit or could even be contraproductive in certain tumors, which has important implications for the design of BetA-based combination protocols."

https://openalex.org/W1985459563,"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is encoded by the RB1 gene whose promoter contains several putative binding sites for ICBP90 (Inverted CCAAT box Binding Protein of 90 kDa), a transcriptional regulator of the topoisomerase IIα gene. ICBP90 has two consensus binding sites for pRB in its primary sequence. Here, we show that pRB and ICBP90 co-immunoprecipitate in cell extracts of proliferating human lung fibroblasts and of proliferating or confluent Jurkat cells. GST pull-down assays and immunocytochemistry, after cell synchronization in late G1 phase, confirmed this interaction. Overexpression of ICBP90 induces downregulation of pRB expression in lung fibroblasts as a result of mRNA decrease. DNA chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment shows that ICBP90 binds to the RB1 gene promoter under its methylated status. Overexpression of ICBP90 increases the S and G2/M phase cell fractions of serum-starved lung fibroblasts as assessed by flow cytometry analysis and increases topoisomerase IIα expression. Together, these results show that ICBP90 regulates pRB at the protein and gene transcription levels, thus favoring the entry into the S phase of the cells. We propose that ICBP90 overexpression, found in cancer cells, is involved in the altered checkpoint controls occurring in cancerogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2023470803,"Ferritin is the major intracellular iron storage protein that sequesters excess free iron to minimize generation of iron-catalysed reactive oxygen species. We previously demonstrated that expression of ferritin heavy chain (ferritin H) was induced by pro-oxidants, which is a part of cellular antioxidant response to protect cells from oxidative damage. In this study, we have identified that the antioxidant/electrophile response element (ARE) located 4.5 kb upstream to the human ferritin H transcription initiation site is responsible for the oxidant response. The human ferritin H ARE comprises two copies of bidirectional AP1 motifs. Mutations in each AP1 motif significantly impaired protein binding and the function of the ARE, indicating that both of the AP1 motifs are required for pro-oxidant-mediated activation of the ferritin H gene. We identified that JunD, an AP1 family basic-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor, is one of the ferritin H ARE binding proteins and activates ferritin H transcription in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. Gel retardation assay demonstrated that H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) or t-BHQ (tert-butylhydroquinone) treatment increased total protein binding as well as JunD binding to the ferritin H ARE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that H2O2 treatment induced JunD binding to the ferritin H ARE. Both H2O2 and t-BHQ induced phosphorylation of JunD at Ser-100, an activated form of JunD. Furthermore, overexpression of JunD induced endogenous ferritin H protein synthesis. Since JunD has recently been demonstrated to protect cells from several stress stimuli including oxidative stress, these results suggest that, in addition to NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a major ARE regulatory protein, JunD is another ARE regulatory protein for transcriptional activation of the human ferritin H gene and probably other antioxidant genes containing the conserved ARE sequences by which JunD may confer cytoprotection during oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2014409388,"We previously identified constitutive Smad signaling in human melanoma cells despite resistance to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) control of cell proliferation. This led us to investigate the effect of inhibitory Smad7 overexpression on melanoma cell behavior. Using the highly metastatic cell line, 1205-Lu, we thus generated melanoma cell clones constitutively expressing Smad7, and their mock-transfected counterparts. Stable expression of Smad7 resulted in an inhibition of constitutive Smad2/3 phosphorylation, and in a reduced TGF-β response of Smad3/Smad4-driven gene transactivation, as measured using transfected Smad3/4-specific reporter gene constructs. Smad7 overexpression, however, did not alter their proliferative capacity and resistance to TGF-β-driven growth inhibition. On the other hand, expression of Smad7 efficiently reduced the capacity of human melanoma cells to invade Matrigel in Boyden migration chambers, while not affecting their motility and adhesion to collagen and laminin. Gelatin zymography identified reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion by Smad7-expressing melanoma cells as compared with their control counterparts. Smad7-expressing melanoma cells exhibited a dramatically reduced capacity to form colonies under anchorage-independent culture conditions, and, when injected subcutaneously into nude mice, were largely delayed in their ability to form tumors. These results suggest that TGF-β production by melanoma cells not only affects the tumor environment but also directly contributes to tumor cell aggressiveness through autocrine activation of Smad signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1969109450,"Platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) is important for normal tissue growth and maintenance and its overexpression has been linked to several diseases, including cancer, fibrotic disease and atherosclerosis. Here, we show that synthesized as a precursor, proPDGF-B is converted to a mature form by proteolytic cleavage at two sites and its N-terminal cleavage is a prerequisite for processing at its C-terminus. The first cleavage occurs at residues RGRR81/, and the second cleavage close to residues ARPVT190, just before the C-terminal amino-acid sequence crucial for PDGF-B retention to cell surface. Cotransfection of a Furin-deficient cell line LoVo-C5 with proPDGF-B and different PC members revealed that Furin, PACE4, PC5, and PC7 are candidate proPDGF-B convertases. This finding is consistent with the in vitro digestions of a synthetic peptide mimicking the cleavage site of proPDGF-B. The processing of proPDGF-B is blocked by site-directed mutagenesis of the RGRR81/ sequence and by various PC inhibitors. Mutation of the PDGF-A and/or PDGF-B convertase sites, revealed that processing of both A and B chains is required for the formation of mature PDGF-B dimers and that the processing of the B chain controls the level of secreted and matrix-bound PDGF-BB forms. Our findings emphasize the importance of the convertase-directed processing of proPDGF-B at the RGRR81/ sequence for PDGF-B maturation and secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2066500337,"There is growing evidence for crosstalk between septin filaments and actin cytoskeleton which is regulated by Rho family of GTPases. Here we show that active Rho disrupts septin filament structures in rat embryonic fibroblast REF52 cells. Among Rho effector molecules tested, Rhotekin induced morphological changes of septin filaments similar to those by activated Rho. The center region of Rhotekin was sufficient for the septin reorganization in the cells, and likely to interact indirectly with the C-terminal half of a septin Sept9b, where a GTPase domain is located. Rhotekin and Sept9b are colocalized mainly in perinuclear regions in serum-starved REF52 cells. Upon stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid, they translocated to actin stress fibers in 10 min and then redistributed again to cytoplasm after 90 min treatment. In neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells, Rhotekin and Sept9b were enriched in the tip of neurites, a location where cortical actin reorganization is induced upon stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid. Taken together, we propose that Rhotekin is a novel regulator organizing mammalian septin structures and provide a new link between the septin and Rho-signaling."

In liver-Cpr-null (with liver-specific Cpr deletion) and Cpr-low (with reduced CPR expression in all organs examined) mouse models, a reduced serum cholesterol level and an induction of hepatic P450s were observed, whereas hepatomegaly and fatty liver were only observed in the liver-Cpr-null model. Our goal was to identify hepatic gene expression changes related to these phenotypes. Cpr-lox mice (with a floxed Cpr gene and normal CPR expression) were used as the control. Through microarray analysis, we identified many genes that were differentially expressed among the three groups of mice. We also recognized the 12 gene ontology terms that contained the most significantly changed gene expression in at least one of the two mouse models. We further uncovered potential mechanisms, such as an increased activation of constitutive androstane receptor and a decreased activation of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-α by precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis, that underlie common changes (e.g. induction of multiple P450s and suppression of genes for fatty acid metabolism) in response to CPR loss in the two mouse models. Additionally, we observed model-specific gene expression changes, such as the induction of a fatty-acid translocase (Cd36 antigen) and the suppression of carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1a) and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (Acsl1), that are potentially responsible for the severe hepatic lipidosis and an altered fatty acid profile observed in liver-Cpr-null mice.

Three mouse strains with modified Cpr alleles were established recently in this laboratory for studying in vivo function of CPR-dependent enzymes. One is the Cpr-lox (Cprlox/lox) mouse, in which the “floxed” Cpr alleles support normal CPR expression (10Wu L. Gu J. Weng Y. Kluetzman K. Swiatek P. Behr M. Zhang Q.Y. Zhuo X.L. Xie Q. Ding X. Genesis. 2003; 36: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the insertion of the loxP sites did not cause any phenotypic change in the Cpr-lox mice. A derivative of the Cpr-lox mouse is the liver-Cpr-null mouse (Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox/lox), in which Cpr is deleted specifically in the liver (11Gu J. Weng Y. Zhang Q.Y. Cui H.D. Behr M. Wu L. Yang W.Z. Zhang L. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25895-25901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The adult liver-Cpr-null mouse has a compromised drug metabolism ability, as well as a general induction of multiple hepatic P450 enzymes, a >80% reduction in serum cholesterol level, and an enlarged and fatty liver. Additional phenotypes, including decreases in circulating triglyceride and bile volume, were reported by another group for a similar liver-Cpr-null mouse model (12Henderson C.J. Otto D.M.E. Carrie D. Magnuson M.A. McLaren A.W. Rosewell I. Wolf C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13480-13486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We have also generated a Cpr-low (Cprlow/low) mouse, in which CPR expression is reduced by 74-95% in all tissues examined (13Wu L. Gu J. Cui H.D. Zhang Q.Y. Behr M. Fang C. Weng Y. Kluetzman K. Swiatek P.J. Yang W.Z. Kaminsky L. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The Cprlow allele was associated with limited embryonic lethality. Female Cpr-low mice were infertile, a phenotype that was likely due, at least in part, to increased serum testosterone and progesterone. Furthermore, adult Cpr-low mice had decreased (by 25-49%) plasma cholesterol and increased expression of many hepatic P450s; these characteristics were found in the liver-Cpr-null mice but to more marked extents. In addition, although some adult Cpr-low mice developed mild centrilobular hepatic lipidosis, none was found to have pathological changes in the liver. These phenotypes, which developed under physiological conditions, reflect the integrated results of the loss of the activities of all hepatic CPR-dependent enzymes in the liver-Cpr-null mice or the suppression of the activities of most CPR-dependent enzymes throughout the body in the Cpr-low mice. Some of the phenotypes, such as the decrease in circulating cholesterol level, can be directly linked to the functions of known CPR-dependent enzymes. However, the causes of other phenotypes, such as the general induction of hepatic P450s in both models and the specific development of fatty liver in the liver-Cpr-null mice, are less clear. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes will shed light on possible metabolic and associated functional consequences in patients carrying defective CPR alleles. In the present study, genomic analyses of gene expression changes in the livers of the two mouse models were performed. Our goal was to identify mechanisms potentially responsible for the observed hepatic phenotypes in liver-Cpr-null and Cpr-low mice. Hepatic gene expression was analyzed with the Affymetrix Mouse Expression Set 430A GeneChip arrays. The Cpr-lox mouse, which was derived from the same embryonic stem cell that was used to generate the Cpr-low and the liver-Cpr-null mice (10Wu L. Gu J. Weng Y. Kluetzman K. Swiatek P. Behr M. Zhang Q.Y. Zhuo X.L. Xie Q. Ding X. Genesis. 2003; 36: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), was treated as the wild-type control. Genes with expression levels that differed between liver-Cpr-null and Cpr-lox or that differed between Cpr-low and Cpr-lox groups were identified using the criteria of ≥2.0 or ≤0.5 in fold change (change-fold), and p < 0.01. Gene ontology (GO) terms that contained the most significantly changed gene expression were identified through pathway analysis using Gene Map Annotator and Pathway Profiler (www.genmapp.org). A detailed analysis of the gene expression changes in the lipid metabolism and transport pathways led us to propose mechanistic schemes that explain the altered gene expression of multiple P450 enzymes in both mouse models, as well as the severe hepatic lipidosis seen in liver-Cpr-null mice. Additional studies of hepatic fatty acid profiles provided evidence that substantiates the genomic changes in the liver-Cpr-null mice.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25895-25901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Wu L. Gu J. Cui H.D. Zhang Q.Y. Behr M. Fang C. Weng Y. Kluetzman K. Swiatek P.J. Yang W.Z. Kaminsky L. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Animal use protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wadsworth Center. Animals were maintained at 22 °C with a 12-h on, 12-h off light cycle and were allowed free access to water and a standard laboratory diet. Mice were sacrificed at the age of 2 months. Liver was dissected and was stored at -80 °C until use. Total RNA was prepared from individual liver samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and was further purified using Qiagen RNeasy mini columns. The integrity of the RNA preparations was determined by spectrometry and by electrophoretic analysis on agarose gels. Affymetrix Mouse Expression Set 430A GeneChip arrays were used for microarray analysis. Each array contains 22,690 probe sets, representing ∼14,870 distinct genes. Each probe set consists of 11 pairs of 25-mer oligonucleotides. A probe pair is composed of a perfectly matched sequence, which is complementary to the target sequence, and a mismatched sequence, which contains a single nucleotide mismatch at the central base pair position. The mismatched sequence is used as internal control for nonspecific hybridization. Three independent RNA samples were analyzed for each mouse strain (liver-Cpr-null, Cpr-low, and Cpr-lox). Each sample was prepared by pooling equal amounts of total RNA from 2 to 3 mice of the same strain. Five micrograms of total RNA were used for synthesis of biotinylated antisense RNA (aRNA) with MESSAGEAMP™ aRNA kit from Ambion. The labeled aRNA was then fragmented and stored at -20 °C until hybridization. GeneChip array hybridization, staining, and washing were performed according to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis Technical Manual at the Microarray Core Facility of the Wadsworth Center. Briefly, 10 μg of the fragmented aRNA was hybridized to each array at 45 °C for 16 h in a GeneChip® hybridization oven with constant rotation (60 rpm). The arrays were then stained and washed, using the antibody amplification washing and staining protocol (Affymetrix), in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 400. The expression data were collected with a gene array scanner using Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0). Data Analysis—The experimental data sets were normalized using the Robust Multichip Analysis program of the Genetraffic UNO 3.2 software package (Iobion). The hybridizations for control mice were used as the base line. Analysis for significance was performed using the unpaired t test in Genetraffic UNO 3.2 (Iobion). The ratios of averaged values were used to calculate change-fold between two groups. Genes with significantly changed expression were tabulated, along with gene symbol, gene name, transcript identification number, and change-fold values, and were further examined for reproducibility among multiple probe sets for a given gene, where available. Pathway Analysis Using Gene Map Annotator and Pathway Profiler—Two programs, MAPPFinder (14Doniger S.W. Salomonis N. Dahlquist K.D. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R7.1-R712Crossref Google Scholar) and GenMAPP (version 2.0) (15Dahlquist K.D. Salomonis N. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), were used to group genes having significantly changed expression according to the GO hierarchy at the level of biological processes (GO process), cellular components (GO component), and molecular functions (GO function). The relative extent of gene expression changes in each GO node was compared using the “z score” (15Dahlquist K.D. Salomonis N. Vranizan K. Lawlor S.C. Conklin B.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), a standardized difference score, and the number (and percentage) of the genes measured in a GO term that meet user-defined criteria for “significant” changes (e.g.±25% in change-fold and p < 0.01). Redundant GO terms were removed according to the following rules (assuming that term 1 contains more genes than does term 2): if term 1 contains more genes with expression changes than does term 2, then term 2 is removed; however, if the two terms contain the same set of genes with expression changes, then term 1 is removed. Real Time RNA-PCR and Immunoblot Analysis—Real time PCRs were performed according to a protocol described previously (11Gu J. Weng Y. Zhang Q.Y. Cui H.D. Behr M. Wu L. Yang W.Z. Zhang L. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25895-25901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), with gene-specific PCR primers for CYP2A4/5, CYP2B10, CYP4A10, CD36 antigen (CD36), and β-actin. The PCR primers used for CYP2A4/5, CYP2B10, and β-actin were the same as reported (11Gu J. Weng Y. Zhang Q.Y. Cui H.D. Behr M. Wu L. Yang W.Z. Zhang L. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25895-25901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The other primers used were as follows: for CD36, 5′-agtatgtcgtcatgttcc-3′ and 5′-cactataacagctctccaag-3′; for CYP4A10, 5′-agtgtctctgctctaagcc-3′ and 5′-cccaaagaaccagtgaaaag-3′. These primers were designed using Seqweb version 2.1 (Accelrys Inc.). Identities of PCR products were confirmed by electrophoretic analysis on agarose gels (for CYP4A10 and CD36) and sequencing (for CYP4A10). Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described (11Gu J. Weng Y. Zhang Q.Y. Cui H.D. Behr M. Wu L. Yang W.Z. Zhang L. Ding X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25895-25901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), with use of rabbit antibodies to CYP2A5 (16Gu J. Zhang Q.Y. Genter M.B. Lipinskas T.W. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1287-1295PubMed Google Scholar) or rat CPR (BD Biosciences), and goat antibodies to rat CYP1A1/2, CYP2B1, or CYP3A2 (DaiiChi), and monoclonal anti-mouse CD36 (BD Biosciences). Microsomes were prepared according to Coon et al. (17Coon M.J. van der Hoeven T.A. Dahl S.B. Haugen D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) but without the pyrophosphate washing step. The plasma membrane fraction was prepared according to a protocol described by Zhang and Menon (18Zhang Q.-Y. Menon K.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8294-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Lipid Isolation and Analysis—Livers were excised from 8-week-old mice that had been fed a standard chow diet ad libitum (Prolab® RMH3500). Excised livers were cut into three pieces to provided triplicate samples for analysis and then were frozen at -80 °C until use. For lipid extraction, the Folch method was used (19Folch J. Lee M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue sections were homogenized in a Polytron homogenizer (model PT3100) for 30 s at 15,000 -20,000 rpm in chloroform/methanol (2:1) at 20 ml/g liver. The homogenate was shaken for an additional 2 h to fully extract the remaining lipids. After centrifugation and filtration, the extracts were dried down under a stream of nitrogen, and the lipids were resuspended in chloroform. The final lipid samples were split into three equal portions for analysis of complex lipids by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fatty acids by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and total phosphorous determination (20Fiske C.H. Subarrow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Complex lipids were separated by using HPLC on a Phenomenex Luna 5-μm silica column developed with a ternary gradient (A, chloroform, methanol, 30% ammonium hydroxide (80:19:1); B, chloroform, methanol, 30% ammonium hydroxide (60:39:1); and C, chloroform, methanol, water, 30% ammonium hydroxide (60:34:5:1) (21Stith B.J. Hall J. Ayres P. Waggoner L. Moore J.D. Shaw W.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1448-1454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual lipid species were detected using an evaporative light scattering detector (Shimadzu-model ELSD-LT). The HPLC system was calibrated with commercial lipid standards (Avanti Polar Lipids and Matreya, LLC). For fatty acid analysis, complex lipids were hydrolyzed with acidified methanol, and the fatty acid methyl esters were purified and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as described (22Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By using relatively conservative criteria in change-fold (≥2.0 or ≤0.5), and a p value of <0.01, we identified a number of mouse hepatic genes that were differentially expressed between the liver-Cpr-null and control (45 up and 18 down) groups or between the Cpr-low and control (22 up and 26 down) groups. Comparisons of expression levels of these genes among the liver-Cpr-null, Cpr-low, and Cpr-lox (control) groups are shown in Table I, in which the identified genes are grouped in seven functional categories based on GenMAPP and additional literature searches. A number of unknown genes were also identified that have differential expression among the comparison groups.Table IGenes that were differentially expressed in livers of the liver-Cpr-null, Cpr-low, and Cpr-lox mice Genes with significantly changed expression (p < 0.01) and change-fold ≥2.0 or ≤0.5 in the liver-Cpr-null/Cpr-lox or Cpr-low/Cpr-lox comparisons, in at least one probe set and one set of comparisons, are shown. An arbitrary cut-off value (<60) was used to filter genes with very low expression value; probe sets for which none of the three groups has averaged expression values ≥60 were excluded. For genes represented by multiple probe sets, the results for all probe sets are included even though all probe sets may not meet the selection criteria, and the results are arranged in ascending order according to the list of Affymetrix probe set ID numbers. A change-fold value is shown when p < 0.05; otherwise, “no significant change” is assigned. Results from probe sets having <90% homology to target sequence are excluded. For each entry, the reference sequence transcript identification number (RefSeq transcript ID) is given along with the gene symbol and gene name (according to Affymetrix). The genes selected are grouped according to functional categories (defined in MAPP or through literature search).Gene symbolRefSeq transcript IDChange-foldGene

https://openalex.org/W2085527831,"Human replication protein A (RPA), composed of RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 subunits, undergoes hyperphosphorylation in cells in response to DNA damage. Hyperphosphorylation that occurs predominately in the N-terminal region of RPA32 is believed to play a role in modulating the cellular activities of RPA essential for almost all DNA metabolic pathways. To understand how the hyperphosphorylation modulates the functions of RPA, we compared the structural characteristics of full-length native and hyperphosphorylated RPAs using mass spectrometric protein footprinting, fluorescence spectroscopy, and limited proteolysis. Our mass spectrometric data showed that of 24 lysines and 18 arginines readily susceptible to small chemical reagent modification in native RPA, the three residues Lys-343, Arg-335, and Arg-382, located in DNA binding domain B (DBD-B) of RPA70, were significantly shielded in the hyperphosphorylated protein. Tryptophan fluorescence studies indicated significant quenching of Trp-361, located in the DBD-B domain, induced by hyperphosphorylation of RPA. Consistently, DBD-B became more resistant to the limited proteolysis by chymotrypsin after RPA hyperphosphorylation. Taken together, our results indicate that upon hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 N terminus (RPA32N), RPA undergoes a conformational change involving the single-stranded DNA binding cleft of DBD-B. Comparison of the interactions of native and hyperphosphorylated RPAs with short single-stranded oligonucleotides or partial DNA duplexes with a short 5′ or 3′ single-stranded DNA tails showed reduced affinity for the latter protein. We propose that the hyperphosphorylation may play a role in modulating the cellular pathways by altering the DBD-B-mediated RPA-DNA and RPA-protein interactions, hypothetically via the interaction of hyperphosphorylated RPA32N with DBD-B. Human replication protein A (RPA), composed of RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14 subunits, undergoes hyperphosphorylation in cells in response to DNA damage.

RPA is composed of three subunits, RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14, named after their molecular masses of 70, 32, and 14 kDa, respectively. Although the structure of full-length RPA trimer remains unsolved, x-ray crystallography, NMR, and biochemical studies reveal that RPA70 contains four domains, the N-terminal domain of RPA70 and DNA binding domains (DBDs) A, B, and C (6Jacobs D.M.

The tandem DBD-A and DBD-B harbor the major ssDNA binding activity of RPA heterotrimer (9Arunkumar A.I. Stauffer M.E. Bochkareva E. Bochkarev A. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41077-41082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DBD-C has a conserved zinc finger (10Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Bochkarev A. J. Biol.

Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). RPA32 consists of three domains, including an unstructured N-terminal phosphorylation domain (RPA32N), a central DNA binding domain (DBD-D), and a C-terminal domain (RPA32C) largely involved in protein-protein interactions (12Bochkarev A.

All the DBDs in RPA have similar structures built around a central oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding fold (6Jacobs D.M. Lipton A.S. Isern N.G. Daughdrill G.W. Lowry D.F. Gomes X. Wold M.S. J.

However, the N-terminal domain of RPA70 (also referred to as DBD-F or RPA70N) has only been implicated in protein-protein interactions in DNA metabolism (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev.

NMR. 1999; 14: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, DBD-E (RPA14) shows no binding affinity for ssDNA but is structurally important for the formation of RPA trimerization core (11Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4498-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Slight differences in structure and residue compositions of the binding clefts of the DBDs may explain their differences in ssDNA binding (16Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

It has been reported that the N-terminal domain of RPA32 (RPA32N) becomes phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (18Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B.

The DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 is believed to be carried out by the members of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like serine/threonine protein kinase family, which includes DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), and ATM- and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) (2Iftode C.

DNA-PK phosphorylates RPA32 in vitro at many of the same sites that are phosphorylated in vivo in HeLa cells after UV irradiation (22Zernik-Kobak M. Vasunia K. Connelly M. Anderson C.W. Dixon K. J.

One of the most striking aspects of RPA is that the protein is involved in almost all DNA metabolic pathways in cells. It is believed that such broad cellular activities of RPA are mediated by its interactions with ssDNA and numerous proteins engaged in cellular processes (9Arunkumar A.I. Stauffer M.E. Bochkareva E.

Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 449-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). RPA phosphorylation may play a role in regulation of these interactions and, thus, the cellular functions of RPA (24Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair (Amst). 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It has been shown that RPA hyperphosphorylation down-regulates DNA replication (24Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair (Amst). 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 32Vassin V.M. Wold M.S. Borowiec J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1930-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In particular, hyperphosphorylation of RPA32 may modulate RPA interactions with DNA and proteins involved in the DNA repair and signaling pathways in response to DNA damage (2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 24Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair (Amst). 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For instance, hyperphosphorylated RPA (hyp-RPA) has shown decreased interactions with simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen, DNA polymerase α, DNA-PK, ATM, and p53, whereas hyperphosphorylation has no effects on RPA interactions with XPA, Rad51, and Rad52 (20Oakley G.G.

Despite the significant role of hyperphosphorylation of RPA in modulating its cellular functions, the biochemical basis of the effects is still poorly understood. A possible scenario is that RPA may change its structure or conformation upon hyperphosphorylation and, thus, alter the protein activities and functions. A synthetic peptide fragment with eight Ser/Thr residues substituted to Asp to mimic the hyperphosphorylated RPA32N was shown to interact with DBD-F (RPA70N) fragment (RPA701–168) (38Binz S.K. Lao Y. Lowry D.F. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35584-35591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the structural characteristics of the hyperphosphorylated RPA trimer of full-length remain to be elucidated. In the present study we determined the hyperphosphorylation-dependent structural alterations of human RPA protein using mass spectrometric protein footprinting, limited proteolysis, and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy. Of 42 basic residues readily susceptible to modification with small chemical reagents in the native protein, the three amino acids Lys-343, Arg-335, and Arg-382 in DBD-B of RPA70 were shielded in the context of the hyperphosphorylated RPA. Our results indicate that these residues were exclusively involved in a limited structural alteration of the protein upon hyperphosphorylation of the RPA32 N terminus. In particular, this local structural change showed effects on the RPA interactions with 8-mer ssDNA or partial DNA duplexes containing ssDNA tails. Considering the essential role of RPA in most of cellular DNA metabolic processes including those mediated with short ssDNA-associated partial DNA duplexes, our results provide the biochemical basis for the roles of hyperphosphorylation in regulation of RPA functions. Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant human RPA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RP cells harboring the plasmid pTYB-RPA and purified as previously described (40Yang Z.G. Liu Y. Mao L.Y. Zhang J.T. Zou Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13012-13020Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Two RPA mutants, Trp-107/528 and Trp-212/361, which had all the tryptophans of RPA replaced by phenylalanine except for residues 107 and 528 or residues 212 and 361, were expressed from BL21(DE3)-RP cells containing the plasmids constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were purified by the same procedures as for native RPA. In Vitro Phosphorylation by DNA-PK—For hyperphosphorylation, the purified RPA or mutants were incubated with DNA-PK isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts as a complex consisting of a 400-kDa catalytic subunit and the DNA binding component of 85- and 70-kDa Ku subunits (Promega) at 30 °C for 30 min in the phosphorylation buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, 200 μm ATP, and 10 μg/ml calf thymus DNA). A mock treatment of proteins was carried out in parallel under the exact same conditions except that no ATP was added in the phosphorylation buffer. The reaction mixtures were then loaded onto an HR10/30 Superdex 200 column equipped with an AKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). To purify the hyperphosphorylated RPA, the column was pre-equilibrated with the fast protein liquid chromatography running buffer containing high concentrations of salt (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10 μm ZnCl2, and 1mm DTT) and run with the same buffer at 4 °C. The fractions containing hyperphosphorylated proteins or mock-treated proteins were pooled and dialyzed against RPA storage buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10 μm ZnCl2,1mm DTT, and 50% glycerol). Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Chemical Modification and In-gel Proteolysis—Biotinylation of lysine residues of RPA was carried out as described previously (41Shell S.M. Hess S. Kvaratskhelia M. Zou Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μm hyp-RPA or RPA was incubated with N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin, Pierce) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl at 25 °C for 30 min. The reactions were then quenched by the addition of 10 mm lysine. The three subunits of RPA were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue stain. The corresponding bands were excised, and the gel slices were destained, dehydrated, and digested with 1 μg of trypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 25 °C overnight. Proteolytic peptides were recovered and subjected to MS and MS/MS analysis. Modification of arginine residues was performed by incubating 2 μm hyp-RPA or RPA with p-hydroxyphenylglyoxal (HPG, Pierce) in 50 mm HEPES/50 mm boric acid, pH 8.0, at 37 °C in the dark for 60 min. The modification was quenched by the addition of 100 mm arginine. Then samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were excised and processed as described above. MS and MS/MS Analysis—MS spectra were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and quadrupoletime of flight (Q-TOF) techniques. MALDI-TOF experiments were performed using a Kratos Axima-CRF instrument (Kratos Analytical Instruments) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. MS and MS/MS analyses were performed on a Micromass (Manchester, UK) Q-TOF-II instrument equipped with an electrospray source and Micromass cap-LC. Peptides were separated with a Waters Symmetry300 5-μm precolumn (Waters, Milford, MA) and a Micro-Tech Scientific (Vista, CA) ZC-10-C18SBWX-150 column using two sequential gradients of 5–40% acetonitrile for 35 min and 40–90% acetonitrile for 20 min. MS/MS sequence data and the MASCOT automated peptide search engine (www.matrixscience.com) were used to identify RPA peptide peaks from the NCBInr primary sequence data base, and matched peaks were then located in the primary MS spectra. Protection events were qualitatively assigned as the appearance of a peak corresponding to a modified peptide in the modified protein spectrum and the absence of the modification peak in the modified hyperphosphorylated protein spectrum. A protection was considered to be significant only when the intensity of a modifiable peak was reduced by at least 85% in the hyp-RPA spectrum. To accurately identify protection events, at least two unmodified proteolytic peptide peaks present in all four spectra (unmodified protein, modified protein, unmodified hyp-protein, and modified hyp-protein) were used as controls. These control peaks served to standardize the peak intensities in each spectrum for accurate qualitative assignment of protection. Data were reproducibly compiled and analyzed from six independent experimental groups. Fluorescence Spectroscopy Determination—The tryptophan fluorescence spectra of RPA, its mutants, and their hyperphosphorylated forms were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog-3 fluorometer (Jobin Yvon, Inc.) with the excitation wavelength at 295 nm and the slit widths set at 3 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission beams. After equilibration of 100 nm protein in RPA buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, and 5% glycerol) at 25 °C for 10 min, the fluorescence spectra were obtained by recording emission from 310 to 500 nm. For the constant wavelength analysis, the emission at 355 nm was measured with excitation at 295 nm. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed to compare the binding of RPA and hyp-RPA to an oligo(dT)8. The (dT)8 with a fluorescein labeled at 5′ end was purchased from Qiagen in high performance liquid chromatography-purified quality. The anisotropy titrations were performed as described previously (42Liu Y. Yang Z. Utzat C.D. Liu Y. Geacintov N.E. Basu A.K. Zou Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the data were processed using a one-site binding model and the non-linear least squares method for the determination of the binding constants (43Zou Y. Bassett H. Walker R. Bishop A. Amin S. Geacintov N.E. Van Houten B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Partial Proteolysis and Identification of Proteolytic Fragments—4 μg of recombinant human RPA or hyp-RPA was incubated with chymotrypsin (1:80) at room temperature for the indicated periods in a reaction buffer (10 μl) containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 70 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm DTT. At each time point (5, 20, or 60 min), 2.5 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. The proteolytic products were resolved by 14% SDS-PAGE and stained with SYPRO Ruby protein gel stain (Bio-Rad). After destained with a solution containing 10% methanol and 7% acetic acid, the gel was imaged by phosphorimaging (FLA-5000, FUJIFILM) using a 473-nm laser line. For automated N-terminal sequencing, the proteolytic fragments separated on the 14% SDS-PAGE were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The protein bands of interest were excised and sent to the protein chemistry laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch for sequencing. Gel Mobility Shift Assays—ssDNA was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled substrate (1 nm) was then incubated with the indicated amounts of hyp-RPA or RPA at room temperature for 15 min in 20 μl of the binding buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation, 2 μl of 80% (v/v) glycerol was added, and the mixture was immediately loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE running buffer (89 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) and electrophoresed at room temperature. The gel was then dried. The free and bound DNA was visualized using a PhosphorImager (FLA-5000, FUJIFILM). Pull-down Assays—The binding of RPA to partial DNA duplexes containing 5′-protruding 11 nucleotides (DNA-11) or 3′-protruding 10 nucleotides (DNA-10) were investigated by a streptavidin-agarose pull-down assay. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used to construct the partial DNA duplexes are as follows: 55-mer, Biotin-GGACCTGAACACGTACGGAATTCGATATCCTCGAGCCAGATCTGCGCC AGCTGGC; 44-mer, GCCAGCTGGCGCAGATCTGGCTCGAGGATATCGAATTCCG TACG; 45-mer, GCAGATCTGGCTCGAGGATATCGAATTCCGTACGTGTTCAGGTCC. The 44- and 45-mer were 5′-32P-labeled and annealed to their complementary biotinylated 55-mer at a molar ratio of 1:1. The annealing mixture was then loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE running buffer and electrophoresed at 80 V for3hat room temperature. Using the 5′-32P-labeled 44-, 45-, and 55-mer as controls, the bands identified as the partial DNA duplexes, which migrated slower than the single-stranded oligonucleotides in the gel, were excised, eluted, and precipitated with ethanol. After the purification 5 pmol of the partial DNA duplex were incubated with the indicated amounts of mixed hyp-RPA and RPA in 500 μl of the binding buffer at room temperature for 15 min. Then 20 μl of streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Invitrogen) pre-washed with the binding buffer was added. The mixture was placed on a rotating shaker with gentle mixing at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with the binding buffer. The proteins in the complex were assessed by Western blotting using an antibody specific for RPA32 as described below. Western Blotti"
https://openalex.org/W2125798636,"The leukemia-associated protein EVI1 possesses seven zinc fingers within an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–250) that binds to GACAAGATA. Single amino acid missense mutants of EVI1 were developed that failed to bind DNA either in vitro, as assessed by gel shift assay, or in vivo, as shown by transactivation studies. Specifically, mutation R205N lacks high affinity binding to the GACAAGATA motif. Putative EVI1 target genes were identified by using an EVI1-(1–250)-VP16 fusion protein that acts as a transcriptional activator with the binding specificity of EVI1. Sixteen genes induced in NIH 3T3 cells by wild type EVI1-VP16 but not by mutant forms were identified. Sequence analysis revealed evolutionarily conserved GACAAGATA-like motifs within 10 kb of their transcription start sites, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation in fibroblasts, we showed occupancy of many of these sites by EVI1-VP16. To assess whether native EVI1 binds to these sites in EVI1-transformed myeloid cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in 32Dcl3 and NFS58 cells, using anti-EVI1 antisera, and we showed that the majority of these sites is bound by wild type EVI1. These putative target genes include Gadd45g, Gata2, Zfpm2/Fog2, Skil (SnoN), Klf5 (BTEB2), Dcn, and Map3k14 (Nik). In this study we demonstrated for the first time that the N-terminal DNA binding domain of EVI1 has the capacity to bind to endogenous genes. We hypothesized that these genes play a critical role in EVI1-induced transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2049722267,"Although Puma (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis) was known as a principal mediator of cell death in response to diverse apoptotic signals, the molecular mechanism underlying its proapoptotic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. Here we reported that myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family with a rapid turnover rate, interacts with Puma. The Puma/Mcl-1 interaction was verified by both yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immuno-precipation studies. Their binding sites were mapped to BH3 (Bcl-2 homology) domain of Puma and BH1 domain of Mcl-1, respectively. Mcl-1 and Puma was shown to colocalize at the mitochondria by immunostaining. The level of Mcl-1 was increased when coexpressed with Puma, indicating Puma is able to stabilize Mcl-1. Puma binding to Mcl-1 via its BH3 domain is the prerequisite for this effect, which is further supported by the finding that Puma mutant lacking BH3 domain no longer promotes Mcl-1 protein stability. This Puma-enhanced Mcl-1 stabilization was validated in vivo under non-overexpression conditions. We also showed that BH1 domain is essential for Mcl-1 to inhibit Puma-induced apoptosis, since Mcl-1 mutant lacking BH1 domain completely abrogates its protective function. In addition, we concluded that binding of Puma to BH1 domain of Mcl-1 is necessary, but not sufficient to prevent rapid degradation of Mcl-1. In addition to PEST (proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine) and BH1 domain, some additional degradation signal is expected to reside in the C-terminal region of Mcl-1. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that the interaction between Mcl-1 and Puma may represent a novel mechanism by which Mcl-1 prevents apoptosis by increasing its stability through binding to Puma."

https://openalex.org/W2088232329,"Methylation-associated inactivation of RASSF1A has frequently been observed in several human malignancies including sporadic colorectal and gastric cancer. However, nothing is known about the RASSF1A methylation status in the setting of MMR-deficient gastrointestinal tumours. In this study, we analysed systematically alterations in KRAS, BRAF and RASSF1A, in order to define the frequency and the pattern of these genetic/epigenetic alterations in three distinct subsets of MSI gastrointestinal tumours. Further, an association study was performed between RASSF1A methylation and the clinicopathological parameters in order to determine the profile of tumours harbouring this epigenetic event. A total of 56 MSI sporadic gastrointestinal tumours (31 colorectal and 25 gastric) and 20 MSI HNPCC analysed for KRAS/BRAF were analysed for RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation by MSP and DNA sequencing. No significant differences were found between the frequency of RASSF1A methylation in sporadic MSI colorectal and gastric carcinomas and HNPCC carcinomas (P=0.31). Methylation of RASSF1A was present in 16 of 31 (52%) sporadic MSI colorectal and 11 of 25 (44%) MSI gastric carcinomas, and in six of 20 (30%) HNPCC carcinomas. Nearly 36% of MSI sporadic colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) had RASSF1A methylation and activating mutations at KRAS and/or BRAF. In contrast, only 10 and 8% of HNPCC and sporadic gastric carcinomas, respectively, had concomitant KRAS mutations and RASSF1A methylation. The MSI sporadic gastric and CRCs with RASSF1A methylation were preferentially poorly differentiated (P=0.03, 0.05, respectively). We show that the profile of alterations RASSF1A, KRAS/BRAF is different among the three groups of MSI gastrointestinal tumours. Further, we demonstrate that MSI sporadic CRCs accumulated significantly more epigenetic/genetic alterations in RASSF1A, KRAS/BRAF than MSI sporadic gastric or HNPCC carcinomas (P=0.016). These results are likely to have therapeutic implications in the near future, due to the possibilities of using specific kinase inhibitors alone or in association with demethylating agents in MSI tumour types harbouring KRAS or BRAF mutations and RASSF1A methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2052285697,"Recent results have revealed that the p53 tumor suppressor protein possesses a direct transcription-independent apoptotic activity. During apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress, a small fraction of p53 is targeted to mitochondria where it initiates apoptosis by causing mitochondrial dysfunction. In adenovirus-infected cells, the expression of E1A protein enhances the accumulation of p53 during early phases of infection and during late times after infection, it is targeted for degradation by the combined action of E1B-55K and E4-orf6 proteins. The functional significance of E1A-mediated accumulation of p53 during early phases of viral replication is not known. Our studies with isogenic epithelial cell lines that differ only on the status of p53 indicate that Ad infection induces apoptosis by p53-dependent and -independent pathways and both pathways are suppressed by E1B-19K. We show that during early phase of Ad infection, a fraction of p53 is targeted to the mitochondria. In virus infected cells, a large fraction of the viral antiapoptosis protein E1B-19K is also localized in mitochondria during early and late phases of infection. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis has revealed that p53 and E1B-19K form a complex in mitochondria. The interaction of 19K involves two noncontiguous regions located around amino-acid residues 14–15 and 123–124. On p53, the mutations within the DNA-binding domain reduce interaction with E1B-19K. Our studies also suggest that 19K may additionally complex with the multidomain mitochondrial proapoptotic protein BAK, thereby reducing the level of p53 interaction with BAK. We suggest that p53-induced apoptosis may be important for efficient cell lysis and viral spread and that E1B-19K may neutralize the apoptotic activity of p53 at multiple levels."

https://openalex.org/W2023208535,"We recently found that leukocytes from thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)-deficient mice exhibit significant reductions in cell surface CD44 relative to those from wild type mice. Because TSG-6 modulates CD44-mediated cellular interactions with hyaluronan, we examined the possibility that TSP1 interacts with TSG-6. We showed that recombinant full-length human TSG-6 (TSG-6Q) and the Link module of TSG-6 (Link_TSG6) bind 125I-TSP1 with comparable affinities. Trimeric recombinant constructs containing the N-modules of TSP1 or TSP2 inhibit binding of TSP1 to TSG-6Q and Link_TSG6, but other recombinant regions of TSP1 do not. Therefore, the N-modules of both TSP1 and TSP2 specifically recognize the Link module of TSG-6. Heparin, which binds to these domains of both proteins, strongly inhibits binding of TSP1 to Link_TSG6 and TSG-6Q, but hyaluronan does not. Inhibition by heparin results from its binding to TSP1, because heparin also inhibits TSP1 binding to Link_TSG6 mutants deficient in heparin binding. Removal of bound Ca2+ from TSP1 reduces its binding to full-length TSG-6. Binding of TSP1 to Link_TSG6, however, is enhanced by chelating divalent cations. In contrast, divalent cations do not influence binding of the N-terminal region of TSP1 to TSG-6Q. This implies that divalent cation dependence is due to conformational effects of calcium-binding to the C-terminal domains of TSP1. TSP1 enhances covalent modification of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor by TSG-6 and transfer of its heavy chains to hyaluronan, suggesting a physiological function of TSP1 binding to TSG-6 in regulation of hyaluronan metabolism at sites of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2052696175,"Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes skin cancer in humans and mice. We have previously shown that in hairless SKH-hr1 mice, UVB-induced p53 mutations arise very early, well before tumor development. In this study, we investigated whether discontinuation of UVB exposure before the onset of skin tumors results in the disappearance of p53 mutations in the skin of hairless SKH-hr1 mice. Irradiation of mice at a dose of 2.5 kJ/m2 three times a week for 8 weeks induced p53 mutations in the epidermal keratinocytes of 100% of the mice. UVB irradiation was discontinued after 8 weeks, but p53 mutations at most hotspot codons were still present even 22 weeks later. During that period, the percent of mice carrying p53(V154A/R155C), p53(H175H/H176Y), and p53R275C mutant alleles remained at or near 100%, whereas the percentage of mice with p53R270C mutation decreased by 45%. As expected, discontinuation of UVB after 8 weeks resulted in a delay in tumor development. A 100% of tumors carried p53(V154A/R155C) mutant alleles, 76% carried p53(H175H/H176Y) mutants, and 24 and 19% carried p53R270C and p53R275C mutants, respectively. These results suggest that different UVB-induced p53 mutants may provide different survival advantages to keratinocytes in the absence of further UVB exposure and that skin cancer development can be delayed but not prevented by avoidance of further exposure to UVB radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2071729296,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3, arsenite) efficiently kills cells from various hematologic malignancies and has successfully been employed especially for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. There and in lymphoid cells, we demonstrated that As2O3 induces cell death in a caspase-2- and -9-independent fashion. Here, we address a potential role of death receptor signaling through the FADD/caspase-8 death-inducing signaling complex in As2O3-induced cell death. In detail, we demonstrate that As2O3 induces cell death independently of caspase-8 or FADD and cannot be blocked by disruption of CD95/Fas receptor ligand interaction. Unlike in death receptor ligation-induced apoptosis, As2O3-induced cell death was not blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk or the caspase-8-specific inhibitor z-IETD-fmk. Nevertheless, As2O3-induced cell death occurred in a regulated manner and was abrogated upon Bcl-2 overexpression. In contrast, As2O3-induced cell demise was neither blocked by the caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk nor substantially inhibited through the expression of a dominant negative caspase-9 mutant. Altogether our data demonstrate that As2O3-induced cell death occurs independently of the extrinsic death receptor pathway of apoptosis. Cell death proceeds entirely via an intrinsic, Bcl-2-controlled mitochondrial pathway that does, however, not rely on caspase-9."

https://openalex.org/W2030651537,"We have analysed the importance of proper substrate methylation by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases for cell survival and cell cycle progression. We show that treatment of cells with the methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx) causes cell cycle arrest and death in different cell types. The phenotypical outcome and form of cell death was strikingly dependent on the AdOx concentration. Lower AdOx concentrations led to a G2 arrest and predominantly caused apoptosis, as judged by biochemical and morphological criteria. Apoptotic cell death was largely dependent on the presence of the tumour suppressor p53, but did not require the Bcl-2 family member Bax. Interestingly, higher concentrations of AdOx led to a novel and so far undescribed form of cell death, which was characterized by distinct, caspase-independent alterations of the cell shape including a marked protuberation of the nucleus, cytoplasmic extensions, actin aggregation, and incomplete chromatin condensation. Although this latter form of cell death was clearly distinguishable from apoptosis, early apoptotic features such as Bax activation were detected, indicating a commitment but incomplete execution of apoptosis. Altogether, these data show that methylation reactions play a distinct role in cell survival, which might influence the decision between different phenotypic forms of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2031304642,"Decreasing the amount of active mouse Ets2 transcription factor by half in mice or use of a MAP kinase insensitive hypomorphic targeted Ets2 allele restricts the appearance of transgenic mammary tumors caused by either Polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) or activated Neu/ErbB2. In addition, the early growth of transplanted mammary tumors is limited by restricted Ets2 activity of the host. Here we have tested genetically, with the use of a conditional Ets2flox allele and tissue specific Cre recombinase expression, whether Ets2 also functions within tumor cells by inactivating Ets2 within mammary luminal epithelial cells from which transgenic PyMTY315/322F tumors arise. We find that inactivation of Ets2 within tumor cells has no effect on tumor appearance or growth. By contrast, complete inactivation of Ets2 in both epithelial and stromal cells moderates the early hyperplastic phase of tumor development and the time of tumor appearance but does not prevent tumor occurrence and has no detectable effect on tumor growth. Thus, Ets2 supports mammary tumors exclusively through their microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W1967721064,"Activating mutations of the N-ras gene occur at relatively high frequency in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of activated N-ras in primary hematopoietic cells and myeloid cell lines (in some cases) can lead to inhibition of proliferation. Expression of mutant N-ras in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells is sufficient to induce myeloid malignancies, but these pathologies occur with long latency. This suggests that mutations that disable the growth suppressive properties of N-ras in hematopoietic cells are required for the development of frank malignancy. In the present work, the growth suppression induced by a mutant N-ras gene in U937 myeloid cells was used as the basis to screen a retroviral cDNA library for genes that prevent mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression (i.e., putative cooperating oncogenes). This screen identified the gene for the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2), and as confirmation of the screen, overexpression of this gene in U937 cells was shown to inhibit mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression. Also recovered from the screen were two truncated clones of an uncharacterized gene (interim official symbol: PP2135). Overexpression of this truncated PP2135 gene in U937 cells did not appear to abrogate mutant N-ras-induced growth suppression, but rather appeared to confer an increased sensitivity of U937 cells to retroviral infection, accounting for the recovery of this gene from the genetic screen."
https://openalex.org/W2094985042,"In mouse epidermal carcinogenesis, the latest stage of malignant progression involves the transition from squamous cell carcinoma to a highly aggressive type of tumor with spindle morphology. In this work, we have isolated a minor epithelial cell subpopulation (CarC-R) contained in the highly malignant spindle carcinoma cell line CarC. CarC-R exhibited a drastic reduction in tumorigenicity when compared with CarC, but CarC-R-induced tumors were mainly sarcomatoid, although they subsequently reverted to the epithelial phenotype when tumor explants were recultured in vitro. Several single-cell clones with either stable epithelial or fibroblastic phenotypes were isolated from an explanted CarC-R tumor (CarC-RT). All these cell lines contained the same specific point mutation in H-Ras codon 61, but while CarC spindle cells had lost the normal H-Ras allele, it was retained in CarC-R- and CarC-RT-derived cell lines. Furthermore, CarC cells have inactivated p16INK4a and p19INK4a/ARF transcription, while CarC-R and CarC-RT clones expressed p19 mRNA and protein but not p16. Altogether, these results suggest that CarC-R represents a precursor stage to CarC in malignant progression. Spectral karyotyping analysis revealed that CarC-R was highly aneuploid and contained many chromosomal abnormalities. In contrast, CarC had a diploid or tetraploid modal chromosome number and contained a specific T(14;15) translocation in all of the analysed metaphases. The T(14;15) translocation was present in only a minority (1.9%) of CarC-R cells, but it was widely spread in CarC-RT and its derived cell clones, regardless of their epithelial or fibroblastic phenotype, indicating that T(14;15) segregates with malignancy."
